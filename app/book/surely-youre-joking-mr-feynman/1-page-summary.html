             1-Page Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
             Unlike most award-winning scientists, Richard Feynman is more commonly remembered for his quirky wit, his adventurous spirit, and his colorful personality than for his achievements in the world of physics. Feynman began his career as a young theoretician working on the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. He went on to do research at Cornell and Caltech, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his work on quantum mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, that’s not the story Feynman wants to tell. After all,
             <strong>
              his discoveries in the realm of science were merely one result of his lifelong love of learning and adventure
             </strong>
             —of seeking out new experiences, exploring new skills, widening his horizons, and living life to its fullest. Throughout his tales runs a thread of inquisitive delight that shows how intellectual rigor and persistence can go hand-in-hand with excitement and fun.
            </p>
            <p>
             Published in 1985,
             <em>
              <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/Surely-Youre-Joking-Mr-Feynman/" target="_blank">
               Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!
              </a>
             </em>
             doesn’t take the form of a traditional autobiography, and it doesn’t hit all the highlights of Feynman’s career. Instead, it’s a collection of Feynman’s personal stories as recorded by his friend Ralph Leighton and edited into a roughly chronological sequence. There’s little discussion of Feynman’s scientific work, but much about Feynman’s drive to solve puzzles, his joy at new discoveries, and his childlike ability to turn every situation into a game (or even, on occasion, a prank).
            </p>
            <p>
             In this guide, we’ll chart the outline of Feynman’s life from his early college days, through his years as part of the team that developed the atomic bomb, and finally to his academic career. We’ll then examine the personal values that permeate Feynman’s stories of his life: curiosity, persistence, the importance of teaching, scientific rigor, and most of all, having fun.
            </p>
            <p>
             Because Feynman’s memoir is light on historical and biographical detail, this guide will give context for his recollections, including the period of time he lived in, information about the atomic bomb project, and insights into his scientific work. We’ll also compare Feynman’s personal philosophy with those of other writers on the scientific process, educational practices, and getting the most enjoyment out of life.

              Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!
             </em>
             take place around them. Feynman shares the details of his life through the incidents and adventures he most liked to talk about, rather than what others might consider more significant, such as his research in quantum mechanics or his work on the atomic bomb. In this section, we’ll explore the shape of Feynman’s life, from his years in school at Princeton and MIT, his participation in the Manhattan Project, and his return to the academic world, during which (and much to his annoyance) he earned a Nobel Prize.
            </p>
            <p>
             Richard Feynman was born in New York on May 11, 1918. He attended the
             <a href="https://www.mit.edu/" target="_blank">
              Massachusetts Institute of Technology
             </a>
             (MIT) from 1935-1939 and was reluctant to leave after finishing his undergraduate work. However, MIT’s rules required its undergraduates to complete their advanced degrees elsewhere, so Feynman did his graduate studies at
             <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">
              Princeton University
             </a>
             until earning his doctorate in 1942. Although he found Princeton to have a stuffier, more formal culture than MIT, Feynman describes its physics laboratory as a playground not unlike his cluttered workshop at home. Moving to Princeton was a blessing in that it pushed him to learn what the rest of the world was like, in terms of academics, people, and how physics was done.

             (Shortform note: At the time when Feynman was attending college, both Princeton and MIT were renowned for their engineering programs and scientific research facilities, but the two universities had different focuses and priorities. In

             , historian Daniel J. Kevles says that MIT's mission was to provide students with the practical skills needed to fuel America's growing industrialization, whereas Princeton also emphasized the humanities, social sciences, and arts in order to give its students the broad liberal arts education they'd need as future leaders. According to

            </p>
            <p>
             While at Princeton, Feynman spent time with groups outside the physics department so he could learn what was going on in their fields. He says he was a nuisance at philosophy lectures because he had a habit of asking for definitions of fuzzy philosophical concepts. He enjoyed biology because there were so many interesting questions that scientists hadn’t been able to solve yet. He met scientists who could easily see mathematical problems in their heads, whereas Feynman had to grind away at them. He also gave a lecture that famous scientists such as Albert Einstein attended. This made him extremely nervous until the moment his presentation began and the science swept him away.

             As Feynman approached the end of his graduate studies, the US entered the Second World War.
             <strong>
              Feynman would contribute his intellectual gifts as part of the theoretical team that developed the atomic bomb
             </strong>
             . While Feynman would begin as a low-ranking recruit, he would play an important role in the advancement of the atom bomb project, though the ultimate success of his military mission would coincide with a great personal tragedy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like many Americans, Feynman felt it was his duty to contribute to the war effort, but he didn’t want to go to army boot camp; he believed he could better serve in a technical position. While he was still working on his Ph.D., a general came to Princeton looking for physicists to recruit, and Feynman volunteered, even though at the time very few people even understood what a physicist was. Feynman says his first job was working on an analog computer to help artillery target enemy aircraft—work that centered on tinkering with gears and engineering design, rather than Feynman’s area of expertise, which was theoretical physics.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: The purely mechanical “computer” that Feynman worked on was nothing like the digital computers of today. Nevertheless, during World War II, analog targeting computers were essential to the success of many military operations. Systems such as the British Army’s

            </p>
            <p>
             After earning his doctorate, Feynman was recruited into the top-secret Manhattan Project team at Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop the atomic bomb. In the beginning, he was a low-ranking member of the theoretical physics team whose first assignment was to consult with various engineering groups. When the scientists arrived at Los Alamos, the facilities were still under construction, so the experimental physics group lent a hand while theoreticians such as Feynman started work in whatever space was available. Despite his Ph.D., Feynman recalls that he wasn’t knowledgeable about nuclear physics, and he felt he had a lot of catching up to do.

Its scientists were recruited based on their expertise and knowledge in various fields related to nuclear physics, chemistry, and engineering.

              Feynman also admits to being a troublemaker, sometimes accidentally and sometimes on purpose
             </strong>
             . For example, when he was assigned a room in the dormitory for scientists, he decided that he didn’t want a roommate, so he would ruffle the bed and leave some of his wife Arline’s belongings around so that it looked like she was with him, when in fact she was convalescing at a hospital in Albuquerque. Unknown to him at the time, the fact that he was supposedly living with a woman in a men-only dorm went up the chain of command and caused a policy ruckus at the highest level of the project’s management.

            <p>
             (Shortform note: Feynman met and proposed to his first wife, Arline (née Greenbaum), while they were both still in high school. In

            </p>
            <p>
             However, Feynman claims that the group at Los Alamos he probably irritated the most were those in charge of censoring the mail. He and his wife wrote to each other regularly, but certain topics, details, or even words (such as the fact that the mail was being censored) weren’t allowed in correspondence. Feynman grew so frustrated by this that he and his wife started writing in code, which drove the mail censors crazy. The struggle between Feynman, his wife, and the censors grew to such a contest that he began to place bets on what he would or wouldn’t be able to get past them.

              The most significant contribution Feynman discusses was his work on the project’s computing machines

             . Los Alamos was supplied with an assortment of hand calculators and IBM adding machines, which Feynman and other physicists learned to assemble and repair on their own. “Computer programs” were run by a roomful of machines manned by workers who would perform calculations in an assembly line fashion. Feynman recounts that when he was put in charge of the computing staff, he pleaded for permission to explain to the workers what they were doing and why it was important.
            </p>
            <p>
             Once he spoke with the workers, their computations increased by a factor of 10, and they came up with innovative ways for the assembly line to work on several problems at once. In a completely analog environment, passing punch cards from one machine to another,

             July 16, 1945, was the date of the first atomic bomb detonation. During the bomb test, Feynman went without protective glasses, watching the blast with his naked eyes. Exactly one month before, on June 16, Feynman’s wife Arline had died of tuberculosis. Since she’d been ill for several years, her death wasn’t unexpected, but his initial reaction was muted. Feynman recalls that it wasn’t until months later that he broke into tears when he saw a dress she might have liked, and the full weight of his grief struck at once.

             The world now seemed like a wholly different place, one without his wife but with nuclear weapons. He would find himself sitting at lunch calculating the damage if a bomb went off where he was. Feynman claims that while working on the Manhattan Project, neither he nor his colleagues gave any thought to the ultimate impact of what they were creating. Their focus was simply on getting the job done. Afterward, however,
             <strong>
              Feynman was struck by a sense of futility. What was the point in creating anything new in a world where atomic bombs could destroy everything in a heartbeat?

             After the intense pace and pressure of working on the Manhattan Project, Feynman had to readjust to the life of an ordinary research professor. Feynman describes his difficulties finding his scientific inspiration again as he reentered the academic world. First, he had to learn what it meant to be a teacher before finding the place that would become his academic home and doing the work that would earn his Nobel Prize.
            </p>

             </a>
             . There, he had to start his life over, having lost his wife and his four-year wartime job. He had a hard time motivating himself to do research, so instead he focused on teaching. Feynman says that since he was young and inexperienced, he didn’t appreciate how much energy went into devising lessons and classes.
             <strong>

             Feynman recalls having a life-changing inspiration after several universities offered him prestigious research positions that he felt overstated his talents:
             <strong>
              You’re not responsible for living up to other people’s expectations.
             </strong>
             Once he accepted that it wasn’t his job to live up to some glorified academic ideal, he gave himself permission to
             <em>
              play
             </em>
             —in other words, to direct his research to questions in physics that he found personally interesting, instead of what might be considered “important” by the science community at large. Once he made that shift in his attitude, he found that his work became fun again. Research ideas began to flow once more.

He was annoyed by the sudden attention and put off by the pomp and circumstance that went along with receiving the award. In the end, he was persuaded that declining a Nobel would stir up a bigger furor than simply accepting it. Nevertheless, Feynman complains about the celebrity status that the Nobel conferred. After winning the prize, he could no longer simply be “Professor Feynman.” Now, he had to live with being a star of the scientific community.

             Though Feynman’s recollections in his memoir may seem to bounce from topic to topic at random, they all exemplify certain key values that underlie Feynman’s idiosyncratic personality.
             <strong>
              At Feynman’s core is a deep love of learning
             </strong>
             , which expresses itself in a variety of ways. In the remainder of this guide, we’ll explore how Feynman’s values shaped his approach to problem-solving, teaching, intellectual honesty, and living life to its fullest.

             Curiosity and Persistence
            </h4>
            <p>
             When Feynman talks about his life,
             <strong>
              one trait that stands out is his determination to understand how and why things work
             </strong>
             . He applied his curiosity to everything in life, not merely his scientific endeavors, and coupled it with a dogged persistence that made him stand out from his peers, often in unusual ways. Feynman’s childhood curiosity led him to pursue an education in math and science, but as an adult his curious nature expanded his horizons into fields such as safecracking and artistic expression.
            </p>
            <p>
             Feynman recalls that as far back as his early teens, he was already tinkering with electronics. For him, it was more like play than formalized science or engineering. He didn’t follow any standard procedures—instead, he fiddled with wires, gears, and bulbs and observed what worked and what didn’t. He bought broken radios and tried to fix them, ran electrical wires all over his home, devised his own burglar alarm system, and almost inadvertently set his house on fire. Every project, both his failures and successes, was accomplished by nonstop trial and error. What Feynman took away from his early years was that
             <strong>
              persistence is the key to solving problems.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Beyond simple perseverance, Feynman also demonstrated a willingness to take risks while viewing each failure as a learning opportunity. In

            <p>
             Feynman was so driven to solve problems that in school, he’d invent math puzzles for himself. This pushed him ahead of other students, who’d come to him with problems of their own. Feynman claims to have worked out many of the principles of trigonometry just for kicks, and even invented his own form of mathematical notation because he didn’t like the ones used in his textbooks. All of this garnered him a reputation as a budding genius, a label that he frequently downplays, instead attributing his success to perseverance. He also says that by approaching math and science as
             <em>
              play
             </em>
             , he worked out shortcuts to mathematical problems that made him seem smarter than he actually was.

             <em>
              fixed from birth
             </em>
             instead of something you grow into. Students who struggle and work hard at solving problems end up creating more and stronger neural pathways in their brains than children for whom the answers come easily. As a result, learners like Feynman who relish the process of learning more than the end result end up being higher achievers over the long run.)
            </p>
            <p>
             One thing Feynman discovered through his childhood exploration was that the world was a more complicated place than the simplified version in his textbooks, and this drove his curiosity further. When in college, he’d carry a toy microscope around campus so he could observe things such as ant behavior. When he took a summer job at a metal-plating company, he worked out chemical processes by trial and error, even though he wasn’t an expert in the field. Even in the case of puzzles where he could have looked up the answer, Feynman says that he didn’t because that would have spoiled the fun. To scratch his curiosity’s itch, he felt compelled to figure things out for himself.

             —the process of developing skills and ideas in the hands-on environment in which they’ll be applied, much like Feynman’s trial-and-error chemistry experiments while already on the job. Young says that key elements of direct learning are self-directed projects, immersion in the process, and holding yourself to high performance standards.)

             Feynman the Safecracker
            </h5>
            <p>
             Prior to his work on the Manhattan Project, Feynman already had a general interest in picking locks as a technical and intellectual exercise. Once he arrived at Los Alamos, however, he discovered that the site had been built in such a rush that all of its documents and sensitive papers were being kept in simple wood filing cabinets that were easily broken into. Feynman says his puzzle-solving compulsion went into overdrive. Not only was he itching to find out how long it would take to break into the project’s top secret files, but he also thought it was his patriotic duty to do so in order to expose the limits of their security.
            </p>
            <p>
             When cabinets arrived with sturdier locks, Feynman took it as a personal challenge. First, he dismantled his own filing cabinet to understand how it worked. After much trial and error, reminiscent of his childhood tinkering days, he worked out a system to quickly run through every possible locking combination. He also discovered that it was possible to find out what other people’s combinations were if they left their files unlocked. As a result, he made it a habit to collect his colleague’s combinations behind their backs, so that if he needed a file from their office, he could simply break into their cabinet and get it.

             </strong>
             (although he was successful more often than not). According to Feynman, the biggest impact of his safecracking skills—besides infuriating his colleagues—wasn’t an increase in overall security but a mandate from on high for all other staff to do a better job of protecting their combination locks from

Research has shown that whether computer hackers work on the side of the law or act as criminals, their primary motivation is the intellectual reward of using creative thinking to solve complex problems. Just as Feynman did with cabinet locks, computer hackers build a mental model of the system they’re trying to break into by prodding it from different angles and testing its reaction to different forms of input.

              Hackers who work on behalf of institutions to uncover their own security weaknesses are referred to as “white hats,” as opposed to criminal “black hats.” Unlike Feynman, who was acting on his own,

             <strong>
              Later in life, Feynman’s curiosity led him toward projects even he’d never dreamed he’d consider—for instance, becoming an artist
             </strong>
             . He never believed that he had any aptitude, but he always imagined that art might be a way to express the sense of awe he felt about scientific discovery. When an artist friend of his challenged him to learn how to draw, Feynman had doubts, but he gave it a try. Feynman says he wasn’t very good right away, but he learned from the
             <em>
              way
             </em>
             that art teachers taught. His instructors didn’t focus on Feynman’s mistakes, but instead turned everything he did “wrong” into something positive that he could build on.

             highlights the fact that effort produces improvement while giving the teacher an avenue to suggest where the student should focus their efforts. Dweck illustrates this by providing examples of several great artists and performers who showed little intrinsic talent when young but who
             <a href="https://www.shortform.com/app/book/mindset/chapter-3#artistic-ability" target="_blank">

            <p>
             The experience opened Feynman’s eyes to new possibilities within himself. His art instructors consistently encouraged him to relax into his process and not worry about perfection and precision as one does when solving problems in science and math. Feynman never got serious about his art and perhaps that was a good thing—it let him keep his artistic endeavors safely in the realm of “play.” Even so, he continued to practice, and over time he learned that he could distinguish the quality of other people’s artistic work without being able to put a finger on why. He was also struck by the idea that art he created could have an emotional effect on someone else, all because he had the persistence to practice a skill for which he had no inborn talent.

             The Importance of Teaching
            </h4>
            <p>
             While Feynman injected his lifelong learning with a casual sense of fun and exploration, one thing he took very seriously was his role as a teacher.
             <em>
             </em>
             Feynman explains that teaching serves two vital functions in his life: It keeps him engaged with the underlying principles of his field, and it allows him to make a positive contribution to the world. In his memoir, he describes the personal benefits he derives from teaching and highlights two specific examples where his beliefs on the subject clashed with those of others, once in Brazil and once in California.
            </p>
            <p>
             Feynman is insistent that he’d never consider working in a nonteaching position. From a purely personal perspective, it forces him to review and reassess everything he assumes that he knows about the field of physics. He finds that the process of teaching those ideas will occasionally lead to questioning them and finding new approaches to problems and theories that wouldn’t have occurred to him otherwise. Teaching also keeps his mind active on those occasions when he doesn’t have a pressing theoretical problem to solve. In other words,
             <strong>
              teaching is good for the mind, as much for the instructor as it is for the students
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Feynman wasn’t the first to notice teaching’s cognitive benefits for the teacher. The Roman philosopher Seneca noted that
             <a href="https://medium.com/@bravery/learning-by-teaching-4c9cf15d86fe" target="_blank">

             you learn and leads you to seek out the most effective ways to understand and communicate what you’re teaching. Because teaching others is such an effective learning tool,

             During a sabbatical year in Brazil in which Feynman taught science to prospective science teachers, he came across a peculiar phenomenon. His students appeared to have learned many scientific facts without understanding anything about them. When he pushed them to apply their knowledge through practical exercises, they couldn’t. He discovered that previously, his students had learned by rote memorization in order to pass a standardized test. Feynman recalls being horrified that this was how future teachers were trained, and he said so during a lecture he gave to the Brazilian teaching establishment. He explained that passing tests isn’t the point of education.
             <strong>

             This truth came home for Feynman years later, when he served on a California state committee responsible for selecting math and science textbooks. This was during a time when the US was trying to catch up with the Russians post-Sputnik by emphasizing science and math. When Feynman actually read the texts under review, he was shocked to find that the books’ authors apparently didn’t understand their own subjects. The books also tended to be full of abstract concepts without applications that students could try on their own. Feynman insisted the textbooks he reviewed would do students a disservice and discourage learning instead of providing a real-world foundation for knowledge that would serve students later in life.
            </p>
            <p>
             It was all for naught. Budget cuts to California’s Board of Education put the program on a back burner and severely restricted the number and quality of textbooks Feynman’s committee could recommend. When asked to do the same for science textbooks the following year, Feynman declined to participate any further.

            <p>
             Feynman believes that teaching math and science is especially important in the modern age, and not just because of technological advances. He argues that
             <strong>
              understanding math and science requires a level of intellectual honesty that other fields lack.
             </strong>
             Feynman’s experience in the scientific world shines a light on the value of questioning others, questioning yourself, and having the integrity to admit when you’re wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             The first of these principles can best be summed up as
             <strong>
              “Don’t take anyone’s word for granted, not even the so-called experts.”
             </strong>
             Feynman gives the example of a physics paper that was published on a topic that he didn’t fully understand. After Feynman wracked his brain at the topic for a while, his sister suggested that he approach it like a student doing a homework assignment and recheck all of the paper’s math. Doing so—starting from first principles and working through the paper’s argument for himself—unlocked the puzzle in his mind and even provided him with insights that he was able to apply in his own work.

             , Thomas Kuhn explains that confirming already established conclusions is one of science’s chief intellectual functions. After all, the process by which knowledge is achieved, whether experimental or theoretical (as in the paper Feynman studied),
             <a href="https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-structure-of-scientific-revolutions/chapters-2-4#solving-puzzles-through-science" target="_blank">
              is just as important as the end result
             </a>
             . The fact that there may be multiple routes to achieve specific scientific “answers” is one reason it’s so important for scientists to understand each other’s process, since seeing a problem from another perspective may yield further “aha” moments, as Feynman says it did for him.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The research that came from that stroke of insight led Feynman and his colleague Murray Gell-Mann to solve the theoretical problem of beta decay—the process by which subatomic particles emit a particular kind of radiation. Feynman and Gell-Mann’s solution also showed that the results of many beta decay experiments were flawed, which highlights another aspect of Feynman’s thoughts on intellectual honesty:
             <strong>
              Good scientists must call attention to any possible doubt about their work.
             </strong>
             When reporting the results of any experiment or study, it’s crucial to acknowledge any variables, theories, or conditions that might call your conclusions into question. Questioning yourself is an essential part of overcoming your own bias.

             Science, after all, is the process by which you can short-circuit bias to arrive at the truth, but Feynman says it’s every scientist’s job to make sure the system works as advertised. There are two ways to do this: by repeating other scientists’ work to make sure that the same results can be achieved, and by reporting the results of any study you conduct,
             <em>
              whether or not they agree with your theories
             </em>
             . If any field of knowledge doesn’t encourage both of these practices—either by discouraging repeat experiments or hiding contradictory data—then that field is pseudoscience and will remain so until more rigorous standards are established.

             While Feynman took his stance on scientific integrity and the importance of education seriously, he was never very serious about himself or his importance to the world. In fact, Feynman states that
             <strong>
              not feeling responsible for the world is his secret to happiness.
             </strong>
             Instead, Feynman talks about being open to new experiences, grabbing opportunities as they appear, and having the confidence to fake his way through.
            </p>
            <p>
             He learned his first lessons about loosening up in college, where his fraternity brothers taught him how to socialize and dance. Thanks to this, one time Feynman accidentally found himself at a dance party for deaf students. Instead of leaving, Feynman relaxed into the occasion, despite feeling like a traveler in a foreign country. Over time, Feynman says that he learned there are many interesting experiences in life if you’re patient enough to wait for them and go along when they present themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Though Feynman may come across in his memoir as an adventurous person, he’s clear that for the most part, he allowed adventure to come to him. In

             One occasion when Feynman grabbed his chance at adventure was when he was invited to attend a scientific conference in Japan. He and his colleagues were put up in a western-style hotel, but Feynman felt like he was missing out on the authentic Japanese experience. To his hosts’ consternation, he pleaded to be housed at a traditional Japanese hotel, despite the hassle he’d create for himself getting to and from the conference. Feynman won out, changed hotels, and enjoyed his more genuine experience of Japanese culture so well that he returned to the country many times. He explains that in many ways he found the culture and customs of Japan far more civilized than those of the United States in terms of courtesy and hospitality.

             (Shortform note: It may seem like a cliché to say that “travel broadens the mind,” but there is scientific backing for the claim that
             <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/03/for-a-more-creative-brain-travel/388135/" target="_blank">
              travel abroad increases cognitive function
             </a>
             . Due to the plasticity of the brain, new experiences create new neural connections, but to get the full mental benefit from world travel, you have to immerse yourself as much as you can in another culture, as Feynman did in his travels. Research on students who’ve studied abroad shows that
             <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/9/2/20" target="_blank">
              cultural immersion can be intellectually and emotionally transformative
             </a>
             , especially if the students engaged deeply with their new environments and reflected on their experiences afterward.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Another country Feynman grew to love was Brazil, where his enjoyment of travel merged with another hobby of his—playing drums. He’d started drumming in Los Alamos as a way to relax, though he never grew to be as good as a professional musician. Nevertheless, he grabbed at the chance to play drums for an amateur samba band in Rio—the “Fakers from Copacabana.” There, he learned to pretend to be a pro and let his show of confidence carry him along. As part of that group, he got to perform at the annual Carnaval celebrations. Feynman says that the fact that his playing wasn’t perfect didn’t matter.
             <strong>
              What matters is snapping up every chance at joy that life provides.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: “Fake it till you make it” is another cliché that Feynman seems to prove true with his artistic and musical endeavors, but he’s clear that he was never aiming for perfection, only happiness. In

             , the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu identify several

             </a>
             that Feynman embodied as those that lead to happiness and contentment—humility, humor, a willingness to see from others’ perspectives, and accepting the world as it is.)
