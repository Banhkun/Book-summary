              Eleven Madison Park
             </a>
             from a so-so brasserie in the middle of Manhattan into the World’s Best Restaurant in 2017. Guidara contends that the secret to the restaurant’s success was his commitment to providing “unreasonable hospitality”—a level of dedication to providing guests with a fantastic experience that stretched the limits of what seemed sensible. Guidara believes that anyone with a service-based business should
             <em>
              also
             </em>
             commit to providing unreasonable hospitality—both to their employees and their customers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Guidara first joined Eleven Madison Park in 2006, when the restaurant’s then-owner tapped Guidara and chef Daniel Humm to transform the restaurant into a fine-dining establishment. Guidara and Humm succeeded beyond their wildest dreams, garnering widespread acclaim and buying out the restaurant in 2011 to create their own company, Make It Nice. This company developed several other restaurants before Guidara left to pursue his own ventures in 2019—including running

We’ll also include advice from experts in other industries about managing a world-class team and delivering exceptional service to your customers.

             Guidara’s Journey to Eleven Madison Park
            </h3>
            <p>
             Guidara’s interest in restaurants was influenced by his father, who worked in the industry. This interest was bolstered by a fantastic experience in a restaurant on Guidara’s 12th birthday. He graduated from the restaurant management program at Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration and spent years working at several restaurants before accepting the position at EMP. In this section, we’ll discuss the lessons Guidara learned from these experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Guidara’s father knew that his son could be successful in the restaurant industry due to his own experience: The senior Guidara was the president of the dining management company Restaurant Associates (RA) before spending several years as the

              CEO of restaurant chains like Au Bon Pain and Pizzeria Uno
             </a>
             . And by 2013, dining room jobs were in demand among Ivy League graduates (like those from Cornell),
             <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304137304579292350943682222" target="_blank">
              who could make up to $150,000 annually at restaurants like EMP
             </a>
             .)

             Lesson 1: Hospitality Matters
            </h4>
            <p>
             Thanks to a class he was taking at Cornell, Guidara made a connection with famed chef Daniel Boulud and even spent an evening partying with him and his team. This connection proved to be a great relief just a few months later when, soon after Guidara’s college graduation, his mother passed away. Shortly afterward, Guidara and his father happened to be in New York City—so Guidara emailed Boulud to ask if they could eat dinner at Boulud’s restaurant. Boulud gave them the most exclusive table available, served them a superb meal, and didn’t charge them a cent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Although Guidara knew from a young age that he wanted to work in restaurants, this meal at Boulud’s restaurant taught him the true power of hospitality. His 12th birthday dinner taught him that hospitality can enthrall you on your best days. His meal with his father at Boulud’s restaurant during their season of grief showed him that great hospitality can
             <em>
              also
             </em>
             enchant you and provide comfort when you most need it.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Although Guidara has only good things to say about his meal at Boulud’s restaurant,
             <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10160540/happiness-guilt-meaning" target="_blank">
              many people feel “happiness guilt”—a sense of discomfort with the happiness they feel when they are also in the middle of great pain
             </a>
             . Adopting Guidara’s perspective can help you through these situations; experts argue that you should let yourself enjoy happy moments because they will provide the strength you need to endure difficult periods.)

             Lesson 2: Find the Balance of Control
            </h4>
            <p>
             After graduating from Cornell, Guidara began working as a manager at a restaurant owned by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG).  Guidara quickly fell in love with the restaurant group’s “restaurant-smart” culture, which prioritized teamwork and cultivating trust in both the kitchen and the floor staff to do their jobs well.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: In
             <em>

               Setting the Table
              </a>
             </em>
             , Danny Meyer provides further context on why USHG had a restaurant-smart culture. For many years, Meyer believed that running his restaurants as a group and creating corporate structure would ruin the individuality and soul of each restaurant. As a result, he resisted turning USHG into an official restaurant group—and as a consequence lacked several essential departments, such as marketing and public relations—until 2003, shortly before he opened his restaurants at the MoMA (Museum of Modern Art).)
            </p>
            <p>
             However, Guidara’s father warned him that he needed to work somewhere with a “corporate-smart” culture—a more business-like attitude to running restaurants that favored more controlled, corporate systems over on-the-ground staff autonomy. So Guidara joined RA, his father’s old company, first as their assistant purchaser and controller and then as assistant general manager and controller of Nick + Stef’s Steakhouse in Madison Square Garden.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Restaurants have
             <a href="https://hoteltechreport.com/news/front-of-house" target="_blank">
              two broad departments
             </a>
             : the front of house and the back of house. The front of house is made up of guest-facing roles such as the general manager, the servers, and hosts, while the back of house is the team that keeps the restaurant running behind the scenes: the chefs, purchasers—who buy what the restaurant needs from third parties—and finance people, including the controller who oversees accounting and payroll. Guidara thus had a well-rounded experience at RA, which gave him a more holistic view of the restaurant business.)

              too much
             </em>
             control over your employees. Sometimes, control can help your employees. For example, when RA noticed that the increased price of lobster was negatively affecting a restaurant’s profits, the controller banned their chefs from using the ingredient. The controller’s focus on the restaurant’s bottom line freed the chef to focus on serving great food without having to worry about serving a financially viable lobster dish.

            <p>
             (Shortform note: It may be tricky to determine how much control is
             <em>
              too
             </em>
             much. Some research suggests that

             </a>
             : Controls seem to work best in jobs that require performing routine tasks, while more autonomy may work better for jobs that require creativity—in the case of RA, the controller only had control over the bottom line, but didn’t dictate what the chef could serve, enabling the chef to exercise culinary creativity.)

             control can harm your employees. While working at Nick + Stef’s, Guidara fired a server who regularly disrupted the dinner service due to his unprofessional behavior. While USHG would have trusted Guidara’s decision, RA’s head office rehired the server, explaining to Guidara that this server made the company a lot of money because his customers loved him. Guidara was furious; he believed that the server’s profit potential didn’t outweigh the damage that he did to the rest of the dining team—damage that the head office couldn’t see because they weren’t in the dining room every evening.

             Guidara eventually left RA when a chance encounter with Meyer led to a job as general manager for Meyer’s new casual-dining spaces at the MoMA. This gave him the opportunity to combine the lessons he’d learned at RA with Meyer’s vision. (Shortform note: The authors of

             One way Guidara did so was by developing “The Rule of 95/5:” Cut costs as much as possible on 95% of your budget, but spend the last 5% extravagantly—as these extravagant touches will be the most memorable and will keep your guests coming back for more. Guidara created this rule when he added an ice cream cart to the museum’s sculpture garden and invested in expensive but artistic spoons. The memorable spoons drew praise from the guests, and the cart remained profitable despite the expense because Guidara had cut costs elsewhere.

             (Shortform note: At its core, the Rule of 95/5 reflects the idea that a small percentage of what you do has an outsize impact, and so you should focus on that small percentage. This idea is not original to Guidara. The Pareto Principle, or the 80/20 rule, states that

             Guidara loved working at the MoMA. His passion attracted the attention of Daniel Humm, who Meyer had recently hired as EMP’s executive chef after the restaurant received a disappointing two-star review from
             <em>
              The New York Times
             </em>
             . Humm suggested to Meyer that Guidara could help Meyer achieve his vision of turning EMP into the fine-dining jewel that Meyer envisioned.

            <p>
             Guidara initially hesitated to become EMP’s general manager. He’d never wanted to work in a fine-dining restaurant because he didn’t want to work in an establishment that prioritized the chef’s vision above all else. However, he agreed to speak with Humm—and after discovering that Humm
             <em>
              also
             </em>
             wanted to run a restaurant that equalized both the kitchen and the floor staff, Guidara agreed to try the job out for a year. This decision sparked a partnership that would lead to great success for both men—a partnership that would never have happened without Guidara’s willingness to be flexible and join EMP despite his earlier hesitation.

             Guidara joined EMP in 2006 to help Meyer transform the casual brasserie into a three-star fine-dining restaurant worthy of its spectacular location—and by 2007, Guidara achieved that goal. In this section, we’ll detail what Guidara did to transform EMP into a well-regarded three-star restaurant.

            <p>
             When Guidara joined EMP, the restaurant was suffering from poor relationships and erratic levels of service. In an effort to transform the brasserie into a three-star restaurant, Meyer had brought on several service professionals who’d trained in fine-dining restaurants and so brought with them a set of expectations regarding how a fine-dining restaurant is run. The original EMP staff bristled at these expectations, which were both new and confusing given that different managers had different standards for the same thing. For example, one server was made to hold a tray in two different ways by two different managers.

            </p>
            <p>
             After spending some time learning how EMP ran things and why it wasn’t working, Guidara’s focus turned to
             <strong>
              clarifying and communicating the restaurant’s priorities.
             </strong>
             Guidara started by having a daily 30-minute meeting shortly before the restaurant opened. This meeting served two important purposes: First, it made clear to the staff what they needed to know—since Guidara required the managers to share typewritten handouts that he’d pre-approved. Second, it gave Guidara a regular opportunity to reinforce the culture he was trying to build; Guidara regularly praised employees’ successes and shared stories to inspire a good night’s work.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Guidara conducted meetings in a way that aligns with
             <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/03/do-you-really-need-to-hold-that-meeting" target="_blank">
              the experts’ recommendations for having the most efficient meeting possible
             </a>
             . He had clear objectives for the meeting and clear indicators of success, and he insisted on having all necessary materials prepped in advance. And while experts agree that having a regular meeting helps clarify and communicate your company’s priorities, there are other methods, too. For example, you could focus on embodying those priorities yourself as a leader and
             <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-ways-effectively-communicate-corporate-values-arquella-hargrove/" target="_blank">

             for employees who embody your core values.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Then, several months into his tenure, Guidara invited all the staff to a “strategic planning meeting.” He wanted the entire team to have a voice in deciding what type of restaurant they wanted to build. After some discussion, the team landed on the pillars that would define their culture—notably, excellence and hospitality. Guidara contends that these two concepts are somewhat contradictory, given that excellence involves meeting an exacting standard while hospitality involves connecting with the guest—sometimes to the detriment of that exacting standard. But acknowledging that

              both

             were important gave them the tools to provide the best experience possible for their guests.

              ensuring that each employee’s position made the best use of their particular skills
             </strong>

             support his employees. He
             <strong>
              set up “ownership programs,”
             </strong>
             which involved giving employees full control over specific aspects of the restaurant. For example, he put the server who loved beer in charge of developing EMP’s beer program. The programs benefited everybody involved. The staff liked taking on more responsibility, Guidara’s workload was reduced, the customers enjoyed the results (like the better beer that EMP served), and the customers’ happiness reflected well on the restaurant.

             , Paul Marciano elaborates on why giving employees full control over specific aspects of the company (as Guidara did at EMP) may improve the employees’ experience: When employees feel autonomy and are free to take risks and seek out novel solutions, they provide the change they want to see in the organization—which increases a feeling of ownership in the company. Marciano emphasizes that if you want your employees to be more autonomous,
             <a href="https://www.shortform.com/app/book/carrots-and-sticks-don-t-work/chapter-6" target="_blank">
              you must provide them with the information necessary to understand the goals of the organization
             </a>
             ; only then can they make independent decisions that don’t detract from the team.)

             has chosen to keep the system, noting that readers can glean more detail from the review article than from how many stars a restaurant receives.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Guidara attributes the three stars to EMP’s continued commitment to the details, which EMP staff demonstrated in two ways.
            </p>
            <p>
             First, EMP staff
             <strong>
              focused on consistently mastering the smallest details.
             </strong>
             These details didn’t seem individually important, but altogether they contributed to providing an
             <em>
              overall
             </em>
             atmosphere of exceptional service. Guidara contends that this atmosphere was palpable not just to the guests but also to the staff and improved everybody’s experience. For example, the staff carefully curated how loudly they played the music depending on how many people were in the restaurant.
            </p>
            <p>
             Guidara argues that seeing this consistency helped servers when they were having a difficult time due to uncontrollable circumstances—such as guests in a bad mood—as it reminded them that there were some things they still could control.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Several self-help authors maintain that when you face an obstacle, you should focus on what you
             <em>
              can
             </em>
             control rather than what you can’t. Some go even further: In

              </a>
             </em>
             , Norman Vincent Peale contends that
             <em>
              <a href="../../../app/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking/part-2-3#we-create-our-own-obstacles/1-page-summary.html" target="_blank">
               any obstacle is defeatable
              </a>
             </em>
             —as long as you
             <em>
              believe
             </em>
             that you can surmount it. If this seems unreasonable, try to think of creative ways that you might be able to overcome the obstacle. For example, adjusting the music at EMP may have had a bigger impact than Guidara realized. Studies indicate that
             <a href="https://www.lsretail.com/resources/play-music-your-restaurant" target="_blank">
              adjusting the volume of restaurant music can improve how good customers think the food tastes
             </a>
             , while switching to classical music can increase customer spending.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, EMP staff
             <strong>
              followed the “one-inch rule”
             </strong>
             that Guidara developed. Guidara points out that no matter how well you prepare something, you can mess it up at the last minute. At EMP, the staff learned to remain focused during that last “one inch” so they could execute everything
             <em>
             </em>
             perfectly instead of ruining something due to inattention in the final moments.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: It’s not always crucial to do everything perfectly or to focus on the last “one inch.”.

             How Guidara Turned EMP Into a Four-Star Restaurant
            </h3>
            <p>
             Guidara wasn’t content with turning EMP into a three-star restaurant. He, along with Humm, had a larger mission: They wanted to transform the fine-dining landscape into something more modern and inclusive. To do that, they
             <em>
              needed
             </em>
             to become a four-star restaurant, as this was the barrier to entry: Four-star restaurants are fine-dining restaurants, but three-star restaurants are not. Humm and Guidara achieved that dream in 2009, but they faced several challenges along the way. In this section, we’ll describe the lessons Guidara extracts from overcoming those challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Humm and Guidara’s relentless chasing of more stars worked out well for them, but this isn’t always the case.
             <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/09/top-chefs-michelin-stars" target="_blank">
              Many chefs grow so obsessed with receiving stars
             </a>
             from various rating establishments that it damages their restaurants and their mental health, and some have even “given back” stars because the pressure to maintain their rating was overwhelming.)

            <h4 id="lesson-1-re-evaluate-your-policies">
             Lesson 1: Re-evaluate Your Policies
            </h4>
            <p>
             Some of Guidara’s successes at EMP stemmed from his willingness to push back against long-standing policies. For example, all of Meyer’s restaurants closed on Thanksgiving to allow employees to spend time with their families. But in 2007, Guidara proposed that they open on the holiday, pointing out that most of EMP’s employees’ families lived far away, so they couldn’t spend the holiday with them anyway. Meyer agreed—and so EMP opened on Thanksgiving Day. Not only did Thanksgiving become a popular day at EMP, but the profits also allowed the restaurant to close for a few days in January so employees could go home to visit their families.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Business experts agree that you should change policies if they’re not working in the way that you want them to. However, rather than wait for someone to notice that a policy isn’t working—the way Guidara did when he realized that keeping EMP open wouldn’t allow employees to spend time with their families—they recommend

              scheduling regular time every few years to re-evaluate all your policies

             <em>
              you

             and
             <em>

             </em>
             care about; for example,

              restaurant owners and employees often enjoy opening on Thanksgiving
             </a>
             , while retailers tend to close in part because they worry that
             <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/11/23/black-friday-thanksgiving-stores-closed/" target="_blank">
              their employees will quit if forced to work

            </h4>
            <p>
             Keeping EMP open on Thanksgiving Day didn’t just make the restaurant more money; Guidara used it as an opportunity to
             <strong>
              create a new tradition that brought the team together
             </strong>
             by serving the staff a traditional Thanksgiving meal after the restaurant closed. By doing so, Guidara created a space where the staff could connect on a deeper level with each other—and so become a stronger team.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Cultivating regular events that bring the team together may be particularly important for remote-first companies. These companies tend to

              prioritize regularly bringing their employees together
             </a>
             so that they can improve their relationships by bonding in person. For best results, experts recommend
             <em>
              not
             </em>
             packing these events with activities; providing your employees with bursts of free time allows them more opportunities to meet and get to know each other.)
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to creating traditions, Guidara took care of and brought together his team in two more notable ways. First, he
             <strong>
              systematized asking for help
             </strong>
             . At EMP, a server who was struggling could touch her lapel and immediately receive assistance from somebody who noticed this distress call. Guidara contends that introducing this code made it easier to ask for help—and so made it more likely that the employees who needed help would
             <em>
              actually
             </em>
             ask for it, which reduced overwhelm and potential burnout.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note:
             <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_to_overcome_your_reluctance_to_ask_for_help_at_work" target="_blank">
              Many people struggle to ask for help because they fear that doing so will make them come across as inconsiderate
             </a>
             . But at EMP, creating a non-verbal system of asking for assistance helped tackle this fear. Not only did employees have an easy time
             <em>
              asking
             </em>
             for help, but employees were also easily able to
             <em>
              offer
             </em>
             help—and employees who felt inconsiderate asking for help felt less inconsiderate if they regularly helped others.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, he
             <strong>
              learned how to convey criticism.
             </strong>
             Guidara argues that criticism is a necessary part of managing people, as it demonstrates that you care about how well they do. But not all criticism is created equal. People receive criticism in different ways; some people need to be yelled at, some need a rational explanation, and some need a gentle rebuke. As a manager, it’s up to you to personalize how you deliver criticism in the way that your team member is most amenable to it.

              indirectly
             </em>
             , often couching these messages in positive affirmations and mitigating language. Understanding your feedback-receiver’s type is crucial: If you deliver indirect feedback to someone who’s used to direct feedback, they may not realize you’re criticizing them. Conversely, delivering direct feedback to someone who’s used to indirect feedback may make you seem cruel.)

            <p>
             In 2008, EMP decided to apply to join Relais &amp; Châteaux, a prestigious restaurant organization, but the restaurant missed the application deadline. Boulud offered to ask the group to consider EMP anyway, and he brought in two rock star chefs—Thomas Keller and Patrick O’Connell—so that all three could ask together. Guidara noticed how awestruck his team was at these chefs’ presence and realized how much this validation boosted their morale. (The chefs loved the restaurant, and EMP was accepted into Relais &amp; Châteaux).

             , as these early opportunities tend to snowball into larger advantages. EMP’s addition to Relais &amp; Châteaux may be an example: Had Guidara not met and befriended Boulud while at Cornell, he may not have had the connection necessary to apply to the organization even though they’d missed the deadline, and he might not have seen the validating impact that bringing in Keller and O’Connell had on his team.)
            </p>
            <p>
             As a result, Guidara started to
             <strong>
              share external praise
             </strong>
             of his team members with the team member in question. This included having media personalities speak with the most relevant team members—even if that wasn’t Guidara. These actions helped his team members gain recognition and further supported their growth.

             Lesson 4: Find the Silver Lining
            </h4>
            <p>
             In November 2008, the world plunged into a financial crisis—and took EMP along with it. Due to the shaky economy, EMP’s usual customers cut back on expensive meals. The restaurant survived only because EMP owned Shake Shack, a casual fast-food USHG restaurant that exploded in popularity because it was now a cheaper option in the area.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, Guidara learned to
             <strong>
              find the silver lining
             </strong>
             in these financially challenging times. For example, EMP started a $29 lunch special. This allowed young people who couldn’t previously afford EMP to eat at the restaurant—and in later years, many of these people became more financially successful and continued patronizing the restaurant.

             How Guidara Turned EMP Into the World’s Best Restaurant
            </h3>
            <p>
             In 2010—one year after EMP earned its fourth star—the restaurant was nominated for the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list. Guidara and Humm were initially thrilled…but then mortified at the awards ceremony when they discovered that they had only received 50th place. This embarrassment prompted Guidara to commit to making EMP the world’s best restaurant by cultivating a culture of “unreasonable hospitality”—a commitment that ultimately led to EMP winning World’s Best Restaurant in 2017.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: When you compare yourself to others who are doing better than you, you’re engaging in “
             <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/social-comparison/" target="_blank">
              upward social comparison
             </a>
             .” This can inspire positive outcomes, as it did for Guidara and Humm, who channeled their feelings of inadequacy into transforming EMP’s culture so they could ultimately win World’s Best Restaurant. However, upward social comparison sometimes also has negative effects; comparing yourself to others can damage your mental health and even make you try to undermine the efforts of those who are doing better than you are.)
            </p>
            <p>
             In this section, we’ll share how Guidara and Humm successfully transformed EMP into the world’s best restaurant and the lessons they learned along the way.

             Lesson 1: Get Creative
            </h4>
            <p>
             As we learned previously, Guidara defines “unreasonable hospitality” as a level of dedication to providing guests with a fantastic experience that stretches the limits of what seems sensible. However, Guidara saw an inherent tension between this concept and running a food business. After all, as a customer, you purchase the experience at restaurants—but the act of purchasing detracts from the hospitality of this experience by highlighting that you’re exchanging money for a service rather than making a connection.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a result, Guidara decided to hide everything that felt too businesslike and detracted from the experience of hospitality. This required him to
             <strong>
              get creative in unexpected areas
             </strong>
             . For example, the most businesslike element of a meal at the restaurant is when you pay for it. To make that a hospitable experience, Guidara decided that when each table received a check, they’d also receive a full bottle of nice cognac and instructions to have as much as they liked. As a result, even receiving the check felt like a nice gesture because it was combined with a gift.
            </p>

              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Guidara works extensively to hide the financial aspect of hospitality and emphasize the connection between the restaurant and its guests. However, one writer contends in a 2023 piece that restaurant guests have become increasingly demanding, and
              <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/t-magazine/restaurants-hostile-eating-out.html" target="_blank">
               service industry professionals must present clear boundaries to protect themselves
              </a>
              . For example, in contrast to Guidara hiding the check with a cognac bottle, several high-end restaurants now demand money
              <em>
               before
              </em>
              diners even arrive with a non-refundable deposit meant to prevent no-shows.
             </p>
             <p>
              Guidara’s creativity regarding hiding the businesslike aspects of the restaurant may have only worked because he had few financial worries (like no-shows); by 2012,

             Lesson 2: Systematize Gifts
            </h4>
            <p>
             As Guidara was looking for ways to provide unreasonable hospitality, he overheard a table of tourists who’d chosen EMP for their last meal in New York. The group mentioned that they’d eaten everything they’d wanted to eat—except for a classic New York hot dog. So Guidara ran out to purchase some, had Humm plate them, and served these hot dogs to the guests as one of their courses, explaining to them that he’d overheard their conversation and wanted to provide them with the best possible experience. The delight of the guests convinced Gudiara that this was something he should be doing regularly—and so Guidara systematized such gifts in two ways.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: The hot dog story appeared in several

              outlets
             </a>
             as a prime example of how unreasonable hospitality can transform the customer experience, but not everybody was impressed. One blogger contended that this story was
             <em>
              only
             </em>
             impressive because
             <a href="https://www.restaurantmanifesto.com/why-hospitality-evangelism-is-harmful/" target="_blank">
              EMP had an impressive backdrop with which to serve the hot dog
             </a>
             , writing that “It’s patronizing for Guidara to behave as though a $2 hot dog can make everyone a hospitality hero.”)
            </p>
            <p>
             First, he
             <strong>
              created a position dedicated to providing unexpected gifts
             </strong>
             . Guidara understood that, while a meal at a restaurant is by definition consumed, the guests could relive their restaurant experience as long as they had a great story to tell. As a result, he started hiring “Dreamweavers”—people whose job it was to research the guests beforehand or listen during their meals and provide personalized touches to awe the guests and give them a great story. For example, the Dreamweavers turned the private dining room into a makeshift beach for a couple who unexpectedly couldn’t make their planned beach vacation.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: EMP wasn’t the only restaurant of its day to collect personal data on its customers.

             </a>
             so that staff could serve the next course at the perfect time. And while Guidara touts only the benefits of paying close attention to your customers, some people may feel uncomfortable if you give them gifts based on information they didn’t share with you—like the fact that they were going on a beach vacation. This concern may be relevant even if you don't have full-time staff dedicated to providing personalized service. For example, a customer who uses a QR code-based menu may
             <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/diners-beware-that-meal-may-cost-you-your-privacy-and-security" target="_blank">
              unwittingly provide that restaurant with personal information
             </a>
             they didn’t mean to share.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, Guidara
             <strong>
              created standard gifts for repeatable moments.
             </strong>
             The personal nature of the Dreamweavers’ gifts sometimes meant that they were expensive, but Guidara found a more budget-minded way to systematize gifts. He looked for repeatable moments—the memorable things that happened regularly at the restaurant—and created standard gifts for those moments. For example, many couples got engaged at EMP. So Guidara partnered with Tiffany to create custom champagne flutes; he’d pour them a champagne toast in the flutes at EMP and gift them the flutes in Tiffany boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Guidara’s concept of budget-minded gifts is inaccessible to many people. In 2023,
             <a href="https://www.tiffany.com/accessories/barware/tiffany-home-essentials-stemless-champagne-flutes-72333160/" target="_blank">
              a pair of regular champagne flutes from Tiffany retailed for $125
             </a>
             —which is still a bargain compared to the
             <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/09/10/check-please-4" target="_blank">
              nearly thousand-dollar price tag of dining at EMP in 2012
             </a>
             . If you’re financially unable to provide extra gifts for the repeatable moments in your business, consider upgrading the gifts you already provide. For example, many companies
             <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90783717/can-we-finally-kill-off-cheap-disposable-conference-swag" target="_blank">
              provide branded swag at events to increase brand awareness or to advertise to new customers
             </a>
             . In that case, a well-thought-out (branded) party favor—like a high-end water bottle—will likely have a bigger impact than cheaper swag (like a plastic pen).)

            <p>
             In 2010, Guidara and Humm received an offer to run The NoMad, a restaurant in a new luxury hotel opening a few streets away from EMP. Guidara and Humm were thrilled at the opportunity to bring fine dining back to hotels, whose restaurants had depreciated in quality over the years. However, Meyer couldn’t justify allowing the pair to run EMP while also owning a competing restaurant nearby—and offered to sell EMP to them instead. Guidara and Humm agreed to the sale and by 2012, they were running both The NoMad and EMP under the umbrella of their new company, Make It Nice.

             (Shortform note: Guidara and Humm‘s success with The NoMad sparked a

              trend of hiring famous chefs at hotel restaurants
             </a>
             . But it may never have occurred if Meyer hadn’t predicted the challenges he might face: In a
             <em>

            <p>
             The NoMad received three stars in its first

             </em>
             review—a feat Guidara attributes largely to how successfully the employees quickly embodied the team’s culture of unreasonable hospitality. To achieve this, Guidara prioritized
             <strong>
              educating the new employees.
             </strong>
             He spent a lot of time training the staff—both by providing booklets on the culture and bringing in mostly long-time EMP employees to manage The NoMad—so that they could embody Make It Nice’s culture effectively from the first day the restaurant was open.

             told The NoMad’s team what the culture was by providing them with a culture booklet and
             <em>
              implicitly
             </em>
             taught them the culture by bringing in long-time EMP employees. Without both, The NoMad might not have developed the culture that garnered them three stars. In

            <p>
             Despite The NoMad’s success, it wasn’t all smooth sailing back at EMP. While opening The NoMad, Guidara remained general manager of EMP because he didn’t think anybody else was prepared for the job. But the EMP team struggled to move forward without a clear supervisor to make the final call on important decisions. Guidara finally agreed to promote a longtime employee to GM after a tough conversation with a friend and colleague led him to realize that his decision not to promote anyone was doing the EMP team a disservice.
            </p>
            <p>
             EMP also faced a blow after receiving terrible press in September 2012. The
             <em>
              Times
             </em>
             published an unflattering column after the restaurant introduced a new tasting menu, which the servers delivered with a memorized speech about each dish. (Fortunately, the column wasn’t an official review that would have done far more damage to the business.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Guidara learned from both these incidents to
             <strong>
              acknowledge his failings
             </strong>
             so that he could work around them. Both his refusal to promote anyone to GM of EMP and his demand that the servers memorize a speech to share with guests demonstrated a lack of trust in his employees: He didn’t trust anybody to run EMP, and he didn’t trust his servers to judge how much information individual customers wanted to learn about each dish. So Guidara learned that he was too much of a perfectionist and needed to let go and give his team the control they needed to do their jobs well.

            <p>
             By 2015, EMP was thriving. After taking the criticism they’d received in 2012 to heart, the restaurant’s popularity had exploded and it rose in the World’s Best Restaurant ranking every year. So Guidara was disappointed when their ranking slid for the first time—going from fourth to fifth place. This disappointment prompted Guidara to re-evaluate the restaurant. After he and Humm shared a meal at EMP, they realized the problem. In their chase to become the world’s best restaurant, they’d added on so many elements that they were disrupting the diners’ ability to enjoy their meal.

             elements, Guidara removed them, keeping only those that embodied the culture of unreasonable hospitality to its fullest. For example, they realized that serving a pre-set menu and not allowing the guest to decide what they wanted to eat wasn’t a hospitable practice. So instead, they served a meal based on a pre-meal conversation with the guest where she explained what she was and wasn’t in the mood for. These changes allowed Guidara to finally provide the fantastic experience he’d been aiming for—and in 2017, his efforts were rewarded when EMP was voted the World’s’ Best Restaurant.

              Not all restaurant owners reacted the same way. In 2019, the World’s 50 Best Restaurants chose not to allow previous #1 restaurants on the list; in other words, Eleven Madison Park can never again be the World’s Best Restaurant. This decision was criticized in part because it was
