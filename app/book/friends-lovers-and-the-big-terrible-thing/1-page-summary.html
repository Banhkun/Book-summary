            <p>
             In
             <em>
              Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,
             </em>
             Matthew Perry (best known as Chandler from
             <em>
              Friends
             </em>
             )
             <em>
             </em>
             takes readers through his life from childhood to the present day, letting them into his darkest moments of loneliness, health scares, and the big terrible thing he has faced and overcome: addiction. He shares his story with the hope of helping others who are also struggling with substance abuse. He wants to let them know they are not alone in their challenges, and that, if he could get sober, they can, too.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perry’s memoir puts his decades of struggles with substances into the context of the ups and downs of his career and his relationships. He shares what he’s learned about addiction and recovery, and he reflects on his purpose in life after having survived near-death experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
             This guide explores the major themes of Perry’s life—his addiction, his struggles in establishing relationships, and his search for fame—as they evolved throughout five stages of his life:

             Childhood
            </h3>
            <p>
             Perry suggests that his childhood experiences set the stage for his future struggles. As a child, he often felt lonely and like he had to work hard to get his parents’, particularly his mother’s, attention. These feelings would stay with him into adulthood, leading him to turn to substance abuse, fame, and casual relationships to feel less alone.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, Perry doesn’t blame his parents for his addiction. While he did in the past, he now believes that addiction is a disease and that he has a natural predisposition to it. Still, he believes that that predisposition was worsened by the events of his childhood. This section will recount Perry’s earliest experience with drugs and how his family life influenced an unhealthy approach to substance use, fame, and relationships.

             (Shortform note: Perry’s nuanced understanding of addiction is in line with current definitions of it. Addiction is considered a chronic disease or disorder that features

             First Experience With Drugs
            </h4>
            <p>
             Perry had his first experience with drugs when he was only a few weeks old. He was a colicky baby, and his parents were desperate to get him to stop crying. His doctor prescribed him barbiturates, a depressant drug class that generates addiction. His father remembers Perry as a baby crying inconsolably and then falling asleep immediately after being given the drug.
            </p>
            <p>
             While baby Perry didn’t develop an addiction to barbiturates, the experience left a mark. First, he believes it negatively affected his ability to sleep because he was given the drug during a period of intense brain development that shapes a person's sleep. He implies that this could be the reason he has trouble sleeping as an adult. Second, Perry suggests that this was the first instance of trying to fix a problem with a drug rather than investigating and solving the root cause, establishing a pattern he would later repeat.

             . His mother is a former beauty queen turned high-powered career woman. His father is a former musician turned actor who never achieved much success outside of a famous perfume commercial. (Shortform note: Perry’s father did get a chance to shine in prime time, though, when

            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Perry often felt alone and parentless during his childhood.
             </strong>
             One of his earliest memories is of traveling alone from Canada to LA to visit his father. He was only five years old and he flew as an unaccompanied minor. He remembers being scared and feeling relief when he finally saw LA from the plane, knowing that he would soon be with a parent. He believes that memory is behind him feeling at ease—less lonely—in homes or apartments with a view of the city lights.
            </p>
            <p>
             Back home in Canada, feeling alone was a constant. His mother worked long hours and, although he was usually under the care of his grandparents or nannies, he was often home alone. Knowing that his father had taken a plane to go to California, every time he saw a plane overhead he worried that his mother was on it, leaving him behind.

That feeling intensified when she got remarried and had children with her new husband. Although Perry says he loves his mother’s husband and his half-siblings, he felt out of place in the new family. This led to him later deciding to move to LA to live with his father.

              Lindsey Gibson says that many children cope with emotional neglect by constructing future scenarios in which their life is better. This ray-of-hope escape hatch sustains them through difficult times. But carrying these dreams into adulthood can lead to having unrealistic expectations and not understanding why they continue to feel alone.

              In Perry’s case, he fantasized about being famous and being loved by the women he idealized because it gave him an escape from the reality that he didn’t receive enough attention or affection. But as we’ll see, fame and relationships with unavailable women didn’t help him feel less alone.

             While his childhood was the beginning of Perry’s anxieties regarding love and attention, his teenage years and early adulthood were when his unhealthy coping mechanisms started.

             Perry felt uncomfortable with himself and with others, and drinking and seeking attention made him feel better. He turned to unhealthy coping mechanisms for three main reasons:

            <ol>
             <li>

              He experienced thoughts that made him afraid of his own mind.

             <li>
              He experienced anhedonia, an inability to feel pleasure. This especially affected his ability to enjoy small, everyday pleasures, like being with friends. He needed experiences to be heightened, such as with drugs, in order to enjoy them.

             <p>
              <strong>
               When you repeatedly use an outside substance to cope with inner pain, you reinforce a neurological cycle of addiction to that substance
              </strong>
              : Outside sources of pleasure trigger the release of dopamine, the happiness hormone. Then, the substance triggers the subsequent release of glutamate, which makes you
              <em>
               remember
              </em>
              how happy the addictive substance made you feel so you’ll want to take it again. When this cycle repeats for long enough, you come to believe the pleasurable substance is not only enjoyable but
              <em>
               necessary
              </em>
              for survival, and you prioritize it over true survival needs, like finding nourishment, procreating, and defending yourself. You thus become addicted, concludes Whitaker.
             </p>
             <p>
              The neurological process Whitaker describes may become even more destructive and worsen your addiction if you have reward deficiency syndrome (RDS), which might be at the root of Perry’s anhedonia. When you have RDS,

               you have fewer dopamine receptors than other people
              </a>
              . This means you don’t get the same level of pleasure as others from the same thing—for instance, a piece of cake—and must consume more of the substance to get a significant hit of pleasure—say, an entire cake. You thus become addicted but need a particularly high quantity of the substance to feel pleasure, which will likely have adverse health effects—as was the case for Perry.

             Using Alcohol to Cope
            </h4>
            <p>
             Perry had his first alcoholic drink at 14, which marked the beginning of his substance use as a way to cope with his inner turmoil. He and his best friends, the Murray brothers, were alone in Perry’s house. As usual, there were no adults in the house and they got hold of beer and wine. They drank together, but although the brothers felt sick and threw up, Perry felt great and found a calm he had never felt before in which the scary thoughts that plagued him dissipated. (Shortform note: While Perry had his first alcoholic drink at a young age,
             <a href="https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-teens-and-alcohol#fnref3" target="_blank">
              he was actually older than the average age
             </a>
             today’s teenagers have their first drink. Boys, on average, have their first drink at age 11, while girls have theirs slightly later, at age 13.)
            </p>
            <p>
             A year later, he moved to LA to live with his father and his exposure to alcohol intensified. He claims he learned how to drink from his father, who would get home each day, make himself a drink, and comment on how that drink was the best part of his day. That sense of relaxation and relief made a big impression on Matthew.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Perry’s experience fits what researchers know about risk factors for underage drinking. First, according to research, teenagers with certain psychological characteristics, such as being anxious or struggling in social contexts,
             <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA67/AA67.htm" target="_blank">
              have a higher risk of drinking from a young age
             </a>
             . Second, children of people who abuse alcohol, like Perry’s father, are more likely to become alcoholics themselves. This might be because of hereditary factors, such as a higher tolerance to the effect of alcohol, or because of environmental factors, such as growing up in settings where alcohol use is seen as positive.)
            </p>
            <p>
             At first, drinking had positive effects. For example, he was uncomfortable in social situations, but drinking made him feel at ease, which made socializing easier. In fact, he claims he would still drink if he went back in time and did things differently because in his youth, the alternative to drinking would have been worse: loneliness.
            </p>
            <p>

              undo
             </em>
             it to reinstate homeostasis, a proper bodily balance. It does this by making us

             However, he soon began drinking alone, too. He began to suspect he had a problem with alcohol when he noticed that he was drinking every day and that other people didn’t get as restless as he did when there was no alcohol available. But instead of trying to reduce his dependence on alcohol, he began drinking alone because he felt ashamed.

             Brené Brown argues that

              shame causes people to believe that their experience is unrelatable
             </a>
             , creating a sense of loneliness, which makes them avoid sharing their insecurities. But talking about shame is the only way to diminish its power because, once you know that you’re not alone, shame loses its leverage. If Perry had opened up to others about his drinking instead of hiding it, he might have realized that others struggle with similar problems, lessening the shame he felt about his behavior and enabling him to take action on his problem.)

             While alcohol helped ease some of his anxieties, Perry still felt profoundly alone, so he used humor to get people’s attention. When he was a teen, he and the Murray brothers invented a funny way of talking that would later become his signature Chandler Bing cadence. (Perry claims that this cadence changed the way America spoke in the nineties.) In high school, he wouldn’t stop talking in class and made everyone laugh. While he got bad grades and frustrated some of his teachers, he was talented and had leading roles in school plays.

             In 1986, at sixteen, he landed his first big job in a movie, acting opposite River Phoenix in the movie

             He got the role thanks to his “always on” personality. He was in a diner, flirting with a group of girls and making jokes to make them laugh. The movie’s director, William Richert, was watching him and felt he would be perfect for the role of Phoenix’s funny sidekick. Before leaving, he slipped him a note that said, “I want you to be in my next movie.”

            <p>
             At 24, Perry was broke and losing hope of making it in Hollywood. When he realized he was out of money, he took the first job he could find:
             <em>
              LAX 2194
             </em>
             , a TV show about baggage handlers in the LA airport in the year 2194. It was a poorly received show, and it almost kept him from landing

             (Shortform note: Perry wasn’t the only Friend to almost miss out on the show because of a previous engagement. Jennifer Aniston was in a show for a different network and couldn’t be on two shows at the same time. She got cast as Rachel with the hope that the first show would fail.

             Everyone wanted to get involved, including Perry, but he had a contract with
             <em>

             . All of his actor friends and acquaintances were auditioning for the show, and many of them commented that Chandler was a perfect role for Perry. They even asked him to read Chandler’s lines when they practiced for their own auditions.
            </p>
            <p>
             His friend, Craig Bierko, was offered the role of Chandler but he rejected it because he wanted to be the star of a show, not part of an ensemble cast. After Craig rejected the role, Perry prayed for the first time in his life. He told God he could do anything to him as long as he made him famous. Soon after,
             <em>
              LAX 2194
             </em>
             got canceled and he was free to audition for

              Friends Like Us

             they kept auditioning other actors. The only other actor they liked was Bierko and, after they offered him the role, they learned that Perry had helped him prepare. One of the creators was relieved that Bierko rejected the job because he played the role with anger simmering below the surface which would have made it difficult for audiences to love him.)

             was a career and culture-defining hit. There were several reasons the show was so successful, including:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The ensemble cast’s chemistry.
             </strong>
             The show’s producers nurtured that chemistry from the beginning by providing the six stars with plenty of opportunities to get to know each other. For example, the producers sent them to Las Vegas for a weekend before the show’s premiere so they could all enjoy one last weekend of anonymous fun. (Shortform note: The chemistry between the stars was so strong that
             <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/friends-oral-history-top-of-the-rock" target="_blank">
              the audience responded more favorably to a scene where the six of them talked about something
             </a>
             than to eventful scenes without all of them present.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The actors knew the show would be successful if their camaraderie was organic. This kept them from trying to outshine their castmates and encouraged them to negotiate their salaries together—led by David Schwimmer—and make sure they all made the same from each episode. (Shortform note: Their camaraderie made it an early positive example of gender equality. Since all six decided to negotiate their salaries together, it ensured

              The collaborative nature of the set.
             </strong>
             Anyone could get their joke included in an episode if it was funny. Perry and David Schwimmer (who played Ross) contributed the most jokes, for their own characters and for their castmates. (Shortform note: Perry credits Courtney Cox (who played Monica) with setting a collaborative tone among the stars. She was the most famous of the six, but she stressed the fact that they were an ensemble. Elsewhere, Lisa Kudrow (who played Phoebe) shared that Cox asked her costars to give her notes,
             <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/friends-oral-history-top-of-the-rock" target="_blank">
              breaking an unspoken rule among actors
             </a>
             and opening the door to collaboration.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The writers also fed off the actors’ ideas and lives. Early on, they took each star to lunch to get to know them and incorporate some of their real-life traits into their characters. This helped emphasize the similarities between Perry and his character, such as a fear of intimacy, an addiction to cigarettes, and the use of humor to hide underlying emotional pain. (Shortform note: The writers also incorporated feedback from the actors. Matt LeBlanc, who played Joey,
             <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/05/friends-oral-history-top-of-the-rock" target="_blank">
              worried that his part would get cut
             </a>
             if the show did a romantic storyline about him and one of the female characters and it ended up not working out. So, he asked that his character be a protective figure of the three women and that he never get involved with them romantically.)

He staved off the worst of his addiction (for example, avoiding heroin because he knew it would be impossible to quit) and tried to stay healthy because he loved his job and he knew how lucky he was to have it.

In 2000, he was diagnosed with pancreatitis as a result of heavy drinking. He received treatment but he went back to Vicodin and alcohol when he recovered.

He says that the seasons where he’s underweight are the ones where he was addicted to pills, and the seasons where he’s overweight are the ones where he’s drinking too much.

             After that stay in the treatment center, he was sober for two years (2001-2003), which he believes were two of the best years of his life. During that time, he was nominated for an Emmy and he found purpose in helping other people get sober. But Perry’s struggle with addiction wasn’t over. In fact, it would get so intense that he would even have a spiritual experience.

            <p>
             In 2003, a relationship he was in ended badly and he went back to pills. At one point, he was unable to sleep and took eight Xanax pills at once. Standing in his kitchen, he prayed to God for help because he knew that going from eight pills to zero in a matter of hours was dangerous and might even kill him. After praying, he saw a golden light and felt a warmth around him that he attributed to God. After the light and warmth were gone, he cried with relief because he felt he had been in the presence of God.

             The breakup in 2003 that led him back to pills was only one of Perry’s many failed romances with women during this time. He was in several relationships, but he always ended them. He feared that they would get too close, see who he really was, and break up with him, so—in all but one of his relationships—he broke up with them before they had the chance to hurt him.

             While he was sober from 2001-2003, he was mostly single. He broke up with the woman who took him to rehab because he wanted to enjoy his sobriety. He proceeded to have a string of casual relationships that he enjoyed but now considers to have been a mistake—he wishes he had invested that time in looking for a more meaningful relationship.

             came to a close. When the show ended, Perry and his castmates were ready to say goodbye to their characters. Still, the finale was emotional and the entire cast and crew—except Perry—were in tears that last day. He claims he didn’t feel anything, probably because he was taking Buprenorphine, an opioid that helps people get over addictions to other opioids but made him feel numb. However, he realized the show’s ending was momentous and he asked the producers to have the honor of delivering the last line.

However, his counselor questioned why he was having fun at rehab and pointed out that he enjoyed the chaos that addiction created in his life. At first, Perry was offended by this remark, but then he found that there was some truth to it.

            <p>
             During that same rehab stay, he had an epiphany. He didn’t want to invite anyone to family and friends night at the center because he didn’t want to put any of his loved ones through another ordeal related to his addiction. But then he asked himself why he didn’t give himself the same courtesy. He concluded that he needed to permit himself to let go of the inner conflicts that kept him trapped in addiction. But the realization didn’t lead to him applying the lessons learned right away, and he eventually relapsed.
            </p>
            <p>
             After leaving rehab, he got involved in activism. He advocated for the use of drug courts that would allow drug offenders to be sent to rehab facilities instead of jail. He also got into business with his AA sponsor creating treatment homes in LA. However, that business failed and it ruined his relationship with his sponsor.

             In 2018, he had a major health crisis when his colon ruptured as a result of chronic constipation caused by opioid abuse. He was in rehab at the time, and his best friend and assistant drove him to the hospital as he screamed in pain. At the hospital, he went into a coma and developed pneumonia. He had emergency surgery and was put on an ECMO machine, which performs the jobs of a critically ill person’s heart and lungs so that the organs can rest and recover. His chances of survival were slim at every step, but he beat the odds. He woke up from his coma after two weeks and spent the next five and a half months at UCLA. When he woke up he had a colostomy bag which he continued to have for about a year.

He mentions that during the six months of his health crisis, he was never alone, a major fear of his. He was grateful for their loving companionship, especially to his parents. During this time, he got closure with his mother, who stayed with him the entire time he was at the hospital.

             After being released from UCLA, he went to New York to continue recovering. He was still using opiates because he convinced his doctors that he was in too much pain, but he admits that he didn’t need the painkillers. Once the doctors realized he was addicted to the oxycontin they were giving him, they sent him to rehab. This led Perry into a series of rehab facilities where he constantly clashed with doctors, lied to get more drugs, and nearly died during a follow-up surgery. During this time he traveled within the US and from the US to Switzerland, unable to find a rehab center that offered the treatments and support he needed.

            <p>

             Perry’s experiences with treatment centers gave him a negative opinion of the industry. He believes they don’t care about the people they allegedly try to help—that they’re interested in taking their money rather than making them healthy. He also argues that at most centers it’s very easy to get access to drugs, which exposes how little they care about their patients.

Furthermore, many rehab centers don’t offer medication maintenance treatment, a treatment that allows patients to receive supervised doses of specific drugs so their bodies can sustainably wean off the substances without suffering painful and even fatal withdrawal effects.)

            <p>
             In his forties, Perry wanted a serious relationship, but he kept pushing the women who loved him away. At one point, he fell in love with two women at the same time. When he decided to break up with one of them and try to make it work with the other one, his fear of intimacy intensified. To dull the fear, he started doing drugs again until his girlfriend realized what was happening and left him.
            </p>
            <p>
             He also almost got married a couple of times. He had a girlfriend for several years and decided to ask her to marry him. To do so, he commissioned a painting of the two of them and planned a romantic proposal. But when the time came to ask the question, he couldn’t bring himself to do it. They broke up not long after. Then, during COVID, he proposed to another girlfriend when he was under the influence of drugs because he was afraid to be alone during the pandemic. When he got sober, he realized what he had done and broke up with her.

             Beating Addiction One Day at a Time
            </h4>
            <p>
             At the time of writing his memoir, after multiple health crises and 14 surgeries, Perry is sober. He claims he quit alcohol and opiates because he got to a point where he needed too many drinks or pills to feel anything. The fear of living with a colostomy bag forever and the fear of dying before learning how to love also helped him quit. Today, he’s on Suboxone, which helps him avoid taking other opiates but makes him depressed.
            </p>
            <blockquote>

             <p>
              In the same way that addiction has complex causes, being in recovery may require a complex array of supporting mechanisms. Perry’s recovery is supported by his personal commitments (not having a colostomy bag forever and learning to love), his acknowledgment of the limitations of substances in making him feel better, and the use of maintenance medication.
             </p>
             <p>
              The medication he’s on—Suboxone—is

              (Naloxone). It works by attaching itself to the same brain receptors another opioid would attach to. That way, it reduces a person’s craving for drugs because, in essence, there are already drugs in the brain. The maintenance opioid (buprenorphine) prevents the person from seeking dangerous drugs such as heroin or fentanyl, and the opioid antagonist keeps the effect of the maintenance opioid safe.

             Of all his addictions, he says quitting cigarettes was the hardest. He was forced to quit when he was diagnosed with emphysema and his doctors told him he would die if he kept smoking. After trying several strategies, he was finally able to quit with hypnosis. (Shortform note: Quitting smoking is difficult for two reasons. First, nicotine, the drug in cigarettes, is highly addictive and makes the brain need it in order to feel at ease. Second, the habit of smoking itself becomes enmeshed in your routine and

             </a>
             . For example, if you always have a cigarette after lunch, lunch becomes a trigger because your brain has been trained to expect the serotonin rush of nicotine at that time.)
            </p>
            <p>
             However, despite being sober, he argues that addiction is a patient disease—it can wait for the right time to resurface. He believes he can only beat it with the support of his loved ones and by fighting it one day at a time. He also thinks that if he loses his sobriety again, he would likely die since he has such a high tolerance for drugs and alcohol. If he relapsed, he would have to take an enormous amount, which would put his life in immediate danger.

             means that a person who is dependent on opioids is unable to quit them because of the intense withdrawal symptoms they develop. When a person has been off a drug for a certain amount of time and then relapses,
