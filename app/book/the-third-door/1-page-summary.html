             1-Page Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
             Alex Banayan writes that success is like a nightclub with three doors: The first is the main entrance, through which you enter by working hard and playing by the rules. The line to this door is crowded and moves slowly. The second door is reserved for billionaires and celebrities and is off-limits to the ordinary person. In
             <em>
              <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/227814/the-third-door-by-alex-banayan/" target="_blank">
               The Third Door
              </a>
             </em>
             , he focuses on the last option—the door that allows regular folk to achieve extraordinary things by skipping the line, finding hidden opportunities, and thinking outside the box. He argues it’s the best—and really, only—route to getting ahead of the crowd.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the middle of his studies as a pre-med student, Banayan discovered he no longer had a passion for his chosen track of becoming a doctor. He began wondering what other people who’d gone on to become successful had done when they were in the same stage of life: young, inexperienced, and without a firm plan for their careers. Where had they found their inspiration? What allowed them to break through the ranks of their peers and become exceptional?
            </p>
            <p>
             To find out,
             <strong>
              he dropped out of college to pursue what he admitted was an irrational, overly ambitious goal: to secure interviews with some of the world’s most successful, famous people
             </strong>
             and glean insights as to how they got there. This book is a compilation of what he learned not only from the people he interviewed but also from the process of pursuing them, as even when he couldn’t land interviews, he learned from his setbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Each interviewee had different stories and insights, but their underlying messages often overlapped. In this guide, we’ll look at some of the themes he came across:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Get help from others.
             </li>
             <li>
              Be persistent.
             </li>
             <li>

             Get Help From Others
            </h3>

             Throughout the book, Banayan discovers repeatedly that
             <strong>
              to become successful, you need to reach out to others for help
             </strong>
             . He first learned the value of asking for help when he sought funding for his book by competing on
             <em>
              The Price Is Right
             </em>
             , a US television show in which contestants guess the prices of various items. He wasn’t very familiar with the show, and so didn’t know what prices to guess. However, he asked the audience for their opinions and by doing so, came up with the winning answer. The experience taught him that people are generally happy to help you if you only ask.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another way people are happy to help, Banayan discovered repeatedly, is by providing a personal, inside connection to an industry. He finds that
             <strong>
              having an inside connection is one of the most effective ways you can further your career
             </strong>
             because such a person allows you access to opportunities you otherwise wouldn’t have. Entrepreneur Elliott Bisnow and filmmaker Steven Spielberg both had insights on the importance of finding an inside connection.

              reciprocal altruism
             </em>
             , or the instinct to help others without any clear and immediate reciprocation, is as innate as kin selection. He theorizes humans have evolved this way because groups in which unrelated people help each other
             <a href="https://www.shortform.com/app/book/behave#evolved-behaviors" target="_blank">
              end up stronger as a whole
             </a>
             —for example, in primate groups, when individuals groom each other to remove insects, the entire group stays healthier. This instinct has evolved such that we like to see others be happy, even if the return on our investment is unclear. This explains the urge to, for example, help a person answer a game show question, or to act as an inside connection.)

             Banayan argues that Steven Spielberg, the award-winning director of some of Hollywood’s biggest blockbusters, including
             <em>
              E.T.
             </em>
             ,

             <em>
              Saving Private Ryan
             </em>
             , can credit his success to an inside connection he developed early in his career.
            </p>
            <p>
             Chuck Silvers, a Universal Studios employee, ran into Spielberg one day as Spielberg was touring the Universal lot and took a liking to him. Silvers wrote him a pass that allowed him to return to the lot repeatedly, and later, he actively advised him. He told Spielberg to make a short film and then showed it to the vice president of production at Universal TV, who subsequently offered Spielberg a seven-year contract.
            </p>
            <p>
             Banayan writes that Spielberg was undeniably talented, and without that talent, his success wouldn’t have happened. But he notes that countless aspiring directors are also talented—
             <strong>
              what set Spielberg on his trajectory was that early inside connection
             </strong>
             .

             </p>
             <p>
              The randomness of Spielberg’s introduction to Silvers, and in turn, to Universal executives, brings up a question of which matters more: luck or skill. In

               </a>
              </em>
              , Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that wild success, such as the kind achieved by Spielberg, is always due to luck. He makes a distinction between moderate success of the kind most people realize through hard work and talent, and
              <em>
               wild
              </em>
              success like Spielberg’s, which he argues
              <em>
               only
              </em>
              comes about because of a fortuitous event or circumstance that puts one person randomly on a path to success.
             </p>
             <p>
              He bases his argument on an insight similar to Banayan’s: Though many people are talented, only a few achieve runaway success. Taleb would credit Spielberg’s success, then, entirely to the fact that he ran into someone who happened to have connections to particular executives.
             </p>
             <p>
              This worldview puts him at odds with the central thesis of Banayan’s book. Banayan only interviews people who are wildly successful, looking for their secrets. Taleb might counter that
              <em>
               there are no secrets
              </em>
              : Each of the interviewees is certainly talented, skilled, and hard-working, but each got to where they are
              <em>
               only
              </em>
              because of a random event that set them fortuitously on their path to success—if that random event had happened to someone else, that other person would have achieved their success instead.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thus, according to Taleb’s theory, if not for the random meeting of Spielberg and Silvers, a different aspiring director would have received an early contract, and we’d be remembering a different set of wildly popular movies.

             Be Persistent
            </h3>
            <p>
             To write his book, Banayan had to be persistent in tracking down famous people over several years. One lesson he learned from this process was that although business books tout endless, relentless persistence,
             <strong>
              it’s possible to take persistence too far
             </strong>
             —in several cases, the people he pursued blacklisted him, or nearly did, because his persistence crept over the line into
             <em>
              harassment
             </em>
             . He learned that it’s important to know when to pull back and that you should remain professional and recognize when you’re going too far.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Banayan’s caution about not crossing from persistence to harassment applies not only to business situations but also to personal relationships. In either case, people who refuse to take “no” for an answer are often hoping to

             </em>
             so as to be efficient. Kamen invented the Segway and scores of other products, from insulin pumps to water purifiers. He held over 400 patents, was a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame, and produced a TED Talk that garnered over a million views.

             As an inventor,
             <strong>
              Kamen lived persistence: trying things that failed until discovering something that worked
             </strong>
             . He came up with a metaphor for persistence:
             <em>
              kissing frogs
             </em>
             . Based on the princess and the frog fairy tale, it describes a mentality by which you kiss frogs (potential solutions to your problem) until one of them reveals itself as a prince—the right solution.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Kamen’s metaphor of kissing frogs has become
             <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kissing-frogs-2011-5#:~:text=A%20common%20phrase%20in%20the,to%20find%20the%20real%20gems." target="_blank">
              popular with business strategists
             </a>
             , but some note that a better metaphor, especially for large companies, would be picking horses. The idea is that a kissing frogs approach might work for inventors like Kamen who pursue a wide range of ideas (evidenced by the variety of inventions he’s come up with), but is unsustainable for larger companies: Trying out countless ideas can mean resources get spread too thinly. Instead, a more efficient approach is to examine potential ideas for feasibility and then
             <a href="http://innovateonpurpose.blogspot.com/2006/06/kissing-frogs-and-picking-_114926826050756332.html" target="_blank">
              devote enough resources to those ideas
             </a>
             that they stand a good chance of success.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Though Kamen encourages people to kiss many frogs, he acknowledges no one has the time or resources to kiss every frog available. He offered advice on how to kiss frogs, or pursue ideas, as efficiently as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
             First,
             <strong>
              ask yourself if your goal is truly feasible:
             </strong>
             Does it contradict a law of physics? Is there a fundamental flaw in your product’s idea? For example, are you offering a service that solves a problem no one cares about? Examining your idea for feasibility will prevent you from wasting time pursuing an inherently unworkable solution.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Business strategists say that one of the main things to consider when judging your idea’s feasibility is its potential market, which aligns with Kamen’s advice to ask whether you’re solving a problem no one has. Then, even if your product does solve a problem, you must consider whether it’s a problem people are willing to pay to fix, or if it’s a
             <a href="https://www.commercebank.com/business/trends-and-insights/2017/evaluating-the-feasibility-of-your-new-idea" target="_blank">
              market segment that’s growing or shrinking
             </a>
             .)
            </p>
            <p>
             Then,
             <strong>
              sort your “frogs” into categories,
             </strong>
             so that instead of blindly kissing every frog possible, you can eliminate swaths of frogs by determining if a
             <em>
              type
             </em>
             of frog is unworkable. This will save you time.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Categorizing your frogs—your ideas—by topic can also help you see new ideas: Labels and lists can
             <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-ways-to-organize-new-ideas-and-drive-innovation/225133" target="_blank">
              provide a framework
             </a>
             that sparks creativity and helps you spot connections between ideas, projects, and goals.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, if you’re having trouble finding the right frog,
             <strong>
              rethink the questions you’re asking.
             </strong>
             If you come at your problem from a new direction, the solution may appear. As an example, Kamen described a project he was tapped to help with: how to introduce more science into schools’ curriculums. While most people saw it as a funding issue or a hiring problem, he viewed it as a
             <em>
              cultural
             </em>
             problem, and he set out to change students’
             <em>
              attitudes
             </em>
             toward science by introducing engineering competitions (under the FIRST program) and positioning scientists as celebrities. By rethinking what the underlying problem was, he was able to devise an effective solution, and his programs have improved science curriculums around the world.

            <p>
             (Shortform note: Kamen has referred to the

             World champion boxer Sugar Ray Leonard also had insight into how to be persistent. Sugar Ray grew up in poverty and saw boxing as a way to better his life. However, he was smaller and less experienced than many of the kids in his neighborhood, so he set out to develop an edge by being more disciplined and more driven than them.
            </p>

             The scrappiness he developed as a child stuck with him into adulthood, and he related how
             <strong>
              he learned to tap into a “hidden reservoir” of strength to get through difficult fights
             </strong>
             . This reservoir was a source of inner desire that would propel him forward even when the odds were stacked against him—in other words, it motivated him to stay persistent.
            </p>
            <p>
             By tapping into this desire, he could move past any doubts he might have.

             Bill Gates: Know Your Stuff
            </h4>
            <p>
             When Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, was trying to close a deal with IBM in 1980, he faced a credibility problem. IBM was the world’s largest tech company at the time, and landing a deal with them would allow Microsoft to dominate the tech field for decades. But, he was the youthful-looking head of an unproven startup.
             <strong>
              He had to convince IBM executives that he was a serious player in the field and could be trusted with their business.
             </strong>
             To do this, he went into their meeting armed with knowledge not only about his product but also about IBM itself.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Microsoft’s eventual success, which was started by clinching that deal with IBM, is an example of what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls a

              “path-dependent outcome,”
             </a>
             where the success of a company is determined not necessarily by the strength of its offerings, but instead by its luck in getting a key early contract. Taleb argues that while Gates
             <em>
              was
             </em>
             intelligent and hard-working, his product was not necessarily the absolute best available—but his good fortune in getting that early contract put his company comfortably ahead of competitors. Like with his discussion of Spielberg, Banayan doesn’t argue against the luck involved but instead focuses on how Gates (and Spielberg) met the challenges of that early connection, lucky or not.)

             Gates convinced IBM executives of his expertise in his product
             <strong>
              by talking fast and overwhelming them with detailed, technical answers
             </strong>
             to questions they raised. By discussing in-depth aspects of programming and software, he made it known that his knowledge outpaced his youthful looks.

            <p>

            <p>
             <strong>
              Fears:
             </strong>
             Gates knew IBM feared potential lawsuits, and he used that knowledge to secure what
             <em>
              he
             </em>
             wanted, which was to keep the source code to his product a secret. He implied that if he disclosed the code to them and it was leaked, they’d be liable for billions of dollars. Fearful of this possibility, they agreed to his terms, even though normally, IBM, as the company with more leverage, would have been expected to extract the source code from Gates as part of the deal. Gates was thus able to establish his company as the one with more power in the negotiation, despite the fact that it was far smaller and less experienced.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: By mining IBM’s fears, Gates was taking advantage of the paranoia that successful companies often harbor: what Jim Collins, in

             Maya Angelou: Fake It—Then Be Sure to Make It

            <p>
             Poet, writer, activist, professor, and Grammy Award-winner Maya Angelou told Banayan her secret to appearing credible when starting out:
             <strong>
              Trust your capabilities, oversell your existing skills, and then work hard to improve those skills
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             When Angelou applied for a job at a newspaper early in her career, she lied about her credentials and experience. She told Banayan that she promised the interviewers what she felt she needed to so that she could get the job, and she trusted that she’d be able to later learn the skills she’d promised. Then, she made sure she did—she spent lots of time at the library studying and learning until she had developed the expertise she’d claimed to have.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Angelou’s advice to oversell your abilities echoes Bill Gates’s. As discussed above, this strategy

             </a>
             . However, only promising what you’re currently capable of can put people who are just starting out at a disadvantage, as their current capabilities often aren’t strong enough to set them apart from competitors. By emphasizing that you should immediately work to gain the skills you promised, Angelou acknowledges this reality and offers young people a way to position themselves competitively while mitigating the risks of overpromising.)

             One lesson that Banayan repeatedly came across was that
             <strong>
              even if you copy everything someone else has done, you can’t expect to replicate their success
             </strong>
             . This is because what works for one person won’t work in the same way for another person—there will be different factors and details that make it impossible to fully follow someone else’s path. Instead, you have to figure out what path will lead you to your own, unique success.

             Legendary interviewer Larry King told Banayan that the secret to getting good interviews with people was to
             <strong>
              be comfortable with who you are and not imitate the style of others
             </strong>
             . What makes another person successful might not work for you because each person’s style reflects their individual, unique way of seeing the world. Thus, for example, what worked for Oprah (being enthusiastic and emotional) wouldn’t have worked for Barbara Walters (who instead was thoughtful and strategic).
            </p>
            <p>
             King argued that
             <strong>
              it’s only when you’ve adopted a style that reflects who you truly are that you’ll be able to genuinely connect with other people
             </strong>
             . And it’s only when you’ve established a genuine connection that they’ll open up to you.

             Warren Buffett: Pay Attention to What Others Overlook
            </h4>
            <p>
             Banayan wasn’t able to secure a private interview with Warren Buffett, the legendary investor and chairman of financial firm Berkshire Hathaway, one of the most valuable companies in the world. However, Banayan read many books about Buffett and attended a shareholder’s meeting where he was able to ask him a few questions when Buffett took questions from the audience.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the main insights he gathered from Buffett’s wisdom was that you should
             <strong>
              pay attention to details that others overlook, and in doing so, follow your own path instead
             </strong>
             of following the crowd. Banayan credits much of Buffett’s success to his habit of “reading the footnotes”—scouring information for details that others miss. He notes that “reading the footnotes” encapsulates Buffett’s approach to life in general: It requires you to put in extra effort and dig deeper than others, seeing what some might consider a boring task (reading footnotes) as the real secret to success, as it leads to overlooked insights.

             Let Your Values Guide You
            </h3>
            <p>
             Banayan heard from several of his interviewees how important it was to know your values and to design your life’s choices around them.

             Steve Wozniak: Follow Your Own Values
            </h4>
            <p>
             When Banayan met with Steve Wozniak, the co-founder, along with Steve Jobs, of Apple, he found someone who didn’t fit the mold of an extremely successful businessperson: Wozniak defined success not by typical hallmarks like power, fame, or wealth, but by
             <strong>
              how his actions aligned with his values and how that led to personal happiness
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Wozniak said that society expects people to pursue power and money, but he decided early in his career that those goals wouldn't make him happy. Instead, he had two goals: to create something—through engineering—that would benefit the world, and to live his life “on his own terms”: In other words, to do things he wanted to do rather than what society expected him to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             To accomplish those goals, he lived according to his personal values. As such, he turned down executive positions at Apple, choosing instead to remain an engineer—a role that made him happier.
            </p>
            <p>
             It also meant being honest and treating people well. One incident that showed this in action was when he discovered that Jobs had denied stock options to some of Apple’s earliest workers before the company’s public offering. Wozniak righted this wrong by gifting them some of his own shares. These shares, which he could have kept for himself, went on to make millions.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Wozniak’s instinct to choose two overriding goals for his life aligns with advice from Brené Brown, who notes, in
             <em>
              <a href="../../../app/book/dare-to-lead/1-page-summary.html" target="_blank">

              </a>
             </em>
             , that when identifying which values you’ll focus on, you should
             <a href="../../../app/book/dare-to-lead/chapter-2#choosing-practicing-your-values/1-page-summary.html" target="_blank">
              choose just two overriding values
             </a>
             . If you have more than this, they’ll become meaningless. These two broad values will then inform all your other values. Wozniak’s goals spoke to his values of prioritizing engineering and having freedom of thought and action, and they, in turn, allowed him to live according to his other values, such as treating people well even if it meant sacrificing some of his own wealth.)

             Jessica Alba: Focus on What Ultimately Matters Most—Life
            </h4>
            <p>
             Jessica Alba found success both as a leading actress in Hollywood and as the founder of a billion-dollar startup, The Honest Company. She told Banayan that
             <strong>
              what drove her, particularly with regard to her business, was her sense of mortality
             </strong>
             : her awareness of life, death, and health.
            </p>
            <p>
             She came to appreciate the importance of life and health after she became a mother. This was especially true because she’d witnessed numerous family members go through cancer and Alzheimer’s, and after the birth of her child, she developed a strong desire to stay alive and healthy for the sake of her growing family.
            </p>
            <p>
             When her son was young, Alba couldn’t find baby products without allergens and harmful chemicals. Inspired by this difficulty, she set out to create a company that would fill that gap in the market. She saw it as a way to give people more control over their health—she noted that a person’s health is affected by a combination of many things, but at the very least, we can control what we put in our bodies and what we bring into our homes. Because many other people also share these same values—fears of death and illness and desire for control over health—her company struck a chord with customers and launched her to success.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: The Honest Company’s mission aligns with advice from many thought leaders: In your approach to life,

             </a>
             and ignore the rest; in this case, while we can’t ultimately control what happens to our health or when we die, we
             <em>

              odds

             of having good health and a long life. Alba’s company was successful because she tapped into not only the human instinct to value life, health, and control, but also the instinct to protect and care for our loved ones—which many experts, such as Jonathan Haidt in

            </p>
            <p>
             He argues that while ego can be unhealthy,
             <strong>
              it’s OK to let ego be
              <em>
               part

               only
              </em>
              thing driving you
             </strong>
             . Wanting the recognition or prestige that comes with success is a natural human desire, and instead of denying that such things are important to you, you should accept that such values can coexist with other, more worthwhile, values like wanting to help people.
            </p>
            <p>
             When he published
             <em>
              Delivering Happiness
             </em>
             , Hsieh was honest with himself that he wanted the book to hit the bestseller list because it appealed to his ego. Acknowledging that aspect of his motivations helped him choose the right tactics to launch the book successfully and allowed him to then succeed with his other motivations, which included making a difference in people’s lives—a deeper, more altruistic motivation that coexisted with his egotistical motivations.

              </a>
              , he encourages readers to question their motivations by asking “why” until they’ve arrived at the underlying motivation driving all the others. For example, if your goal is to spend more time with your family, asking yourself “why” might prompt you to say, “so I can create more memories,” and asking “why” again will inspire you to dig deeper and deeper until you arrive at your most important value.

              </em>

               happiness
              </em>
              , and to that end, the egotistical desires he speaks to Banayan about might be seen as ways to achieve happiness. Hsieh’s recommendations align with what he told Banayan in
              <em>
               The Third Door:

              Be honest with yourself about your motivations.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, while Hsieh argues egotistical desires can be legitimate sources of motivation, he’s not arguing that you let your ego completely drive you. His caution aligns with that of other experts, like Ryan Holiday, who explains, in
              <em>
               <a href="../../../app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/1-page-summary.html" target="_blank">

              <a href="../../../app/book/ego-is-the-enemy/part-1a/1-page-summary.html" target="_blank">
               that you’re better than other people or more deserving of success

              —beliefs that will cause you to behave badly and make poor decisions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Holiday does acknowledge, though, like Hsieh, that ego can be healthy. He defines healthy ego as a type of self-esteem that’s based on actual accomplishments instead of false beliefs of superiority. Hsieh doesn’t specifically define ego in this way, but his focus on the egotistical feelings that accompany achievement implies a similar outlook.

             Several of Banayan’s interviewees emphasized

              the importance of working extra hard early in your career
             </strong>
             , arguing that the long-term gains you’ll earn are worth the effort and the sacrifice of short-term comfort. Two interviewees in particular who made that attitude a cornerstone of their careers were Grammy Award-winning rapper Pitbull and Microsoft executive Qi Lu.

             Pitbull: Always Be Learning
            </h4>
            <p>
             Armando Perez, better known as Pitbull, who has produced award-winning music in multiple genres and started his own charter school, told Banayan that his secret to success is his willingness to approach any new venture with the mindset of an intern:
             <strong>
              be willing to work a low-wage, low-level job to learn about an industry from the bottom up.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Pitbull argues that when you do menial tasks and function as an assistant to others, you can get a foot in the door and gain access to insights and wisdom from experienced people. Even if you’re already successful in a different field, you should be ready to start at the bottom in any new field you approach. By constantly learning in this way, you’ll ultimately be a better executive because you’ve learned how the business works at every level.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Pitbull’s advice is aimed both at people starting their first career and at people successful in one career and choosing to enter a second. As such, he emphasizes the importance of being open to learning new skills, but some experts note that when starting a new venture, you can use skills you’ve already mastered to give you a leg up. In

             Banayan asked engineer Qi Lu, who grew up in extreme poverty in rural China but rose to hold executive positions at Yahoo, Microsoft, and other tech firms, how he was able to achieve exponential social mobility
             <strong>
              .
             </strong>
             Lu explained that he was extremely disciplined and that he sacrificed immediate comfort for long-term success.
            </p>
            <p>
             He maintained a rigorous routine, running five miles every morning, eating small meals of fruits and vegetables throughout the day, and working 18 hours a day, six days a week. He also trained himself to sleep just four hours a night, giving him, over the course of a year, an extra two months of time (compared to people who sleep eight hours a night) with which he could learn new skills and work on projects.
            </p>
            <p>
             He said that his
             <strong>
              discipline allowed him to get more out of his day than others, and therefore he was more prepared to jump on opportunities when they presented themselves
             </strong>
             . For example, when he was a student, a professor asked him if he’d done any research on a particular topic, and Lu was able to respond that he’d already written five papers on it. The professor was so impressed that he helped Lu apply to Carnegie Mellon, which allowed him to fulfill his goal of moving to the US and starting his career.

             , you’re far more likely to stick with them. Clear writes that to successfully adopt new routines, you should envision the version of yourself you want to become, as this will encourage you to behave as that ideal version likely behaves. This advice aligns with how Lu approached his life: His goals reflected his desire to escape poverty, which gave him the motivation to adopt and stick to difficult habits. His image of himself as an accomplished person helped him stick to habits that set him apart from other students and put him on his path to success.)

             Many of the people Banayan interviewed overcame difficult challenges in their lives and their careers. Lady Gaga and Quincy Jones both gave him insights on how to bounce back from setbacks so that you don’t derail your progress.

             Lady Gaga: See Your Mistakes as Strengths
            </h4>
            <p>
             Banayan wasn’t able to sit down with Lady Gaga for an official interview, but he did meet her briefly and, through a mutual acquaintance, became involved in planning her media response to the criticism of her recently released album. The lesson he learned from how she handled that criticism was that
             <strong>
              if you have a strong sense of your values, you can spin your failures as successes as long as they align with those values.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             The phenomenal success of her first two albums made Gaga a worldwide star, but critics panned her third album,
             <em>
              ARTPOP
             </em>
             , and sales were low. For several months after the album’s release, Gaga struggled to respond to this criticism, and the negative reviews were hard on her. However, she ultimately realized that the unusual character of her album—which is what prompted the negative reviews—was consistent with her brand of always defying expectations. Since her previous albums had been so well-received, it was fitting that she then release an album that appealed more to a fringe audience.
            </p>
            <p>
             By embracing the message that the low sales and bad ratings of the album
             <strong>
              actually reflected its underlying strengths,
             </strong>
             Gaga was able to emerge from the experience with a sense that she was in control of the narrative. She even ramped up the strangeness of the album by making all-the-more bizarre performances, including having someone vomit on her on stage. She publicly compared this strangeness to Andy Warhol’s art, thus positioning her album alongside recognized great art.
            </p>
            <blockquote>

             </p>
             <p>
              There were a number of reasons Gaga’s 2013 album
              <em>
               ARTPOP
              </em>
              was poorly received by critics and the public. Some people called it pretentious and objected to Gaga’s unusual artistic choices, like the

              </a>
              Banayan mentions. But another focus of criticism, that Banayan doesn’t discuss, was that the album seemed to
              <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lady-gaga-artpop/" target="_blank">
               trivialize and profit off of sexual assault

             </p>

              One song in particular, “Do What U Want,” featured a duet with R. Kelly, who was widely recognized as a sexual predator. Gaga also created a music video with Kelly—never officially released, but leaked—that many interpreted as a glamorization of rape.

             <p>
              However, she did ultimately acknowledge, without spinning it as a strength, the weakness of her collaboration with R. Kelly—after the full extent of his sexual assault history became publicized in 2019, she

             <p>
              Though Gaga’s apology came after the publication of

               The Third Door
              </em>
              , Banayan might argue that Gaga was still letting her values guide her decisions and move her past her setbacks—in this case, not so much to
              <em>
               justify
              </em>
              her setbacks or frame them as wins, but instead, to acknowledge them honestly and show growth.

             Jane Goodall: Women Face Different Pressures
            </h4>
            <p>
             When Banayan sat down with primatologist Jane Goodall, he was confronted with a challenge that his male interviewees hadn’t had to face: sexual harassment. His lesson from this encounter was less about how to recover from these kinds of challenges, and more about his own recognition that they happen—
             <strong>
              before his conversation with Goodall, he didn’t consciously realize that women face unique disadvantages in the workplace
             </strong>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Early in her career, Goodall landed a job as an assistant to Louis Leakey, a renowned paleoanthropologist with valuable knowledge and connections. Leakey was in a position to greatly further Goodall’s career, but he made sexual advances to her, putting her in a difficult position: If she rejected his advances, would he block her career progression?
            </p>
            <p>
             Fortunately, Leakey stopped making advances when Goodall made it clear she wasn’t interested. He went on to fund her studies, which allowed her to live in the jungle and make the discoveries that changed science’s understanding of primates.
            </p>
            <p>
             Banayan had a difficult time understanding Goodall’s attitude toward the experience. She brushed it off as just “something that happens,” which clued him in to the different dynamics women face in the workplace, and the fact that they must successfully navigate obstacles that men don’t.
            </p>
            <blockquote>

              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Goodall’s experiences of navigating unwanted sexual advances from men were by no means unusual, especially
              <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/03/12/the-1960s-a-decade-of-change-for-women" target="_blank">
               in the 1960s
              </a>
              when she started her career. But was Banayan’s almost-exclusive focus on that aspect of her work a different type of sexism? It might be argued that his emphasis on those experiences is an example of
              <em>

              </em>
              —the well-intentioned but still-harmful attitude that frames women in positive terms but by their gender first and capabilities second.
             </p>
             <p>
              An example of subtle sexism is if a male coworker tells a woman he’s happy to have her on the team because he needs a “mom” to keep him organized—this kind of comment diminishes a woman’s achievements while purportedly complimenting them, and frames her as a “female” team member instead of just a “team member,” thereby excluding her from the “norm.”
             </p>
             <p>
              Banayan doesn’t go into detail about any challenges Goodall faced other than the sexual harassment, nor does he seek insights about her success, accomplishments, or worldview that led her to her

              , as he does with his other interviewees. Instead, his talk with Goodall ends up being a tool for him to come to a deeper understanding of himself and his male-centered outlook on the world.

             Quincy Jones: Focus on the Journey, Not the Destination
            </h4>
            <p>
             Banayan’s interview with legendary music, film, and television producer Quincy Jones taught him a healthy way to recover mentally and emotionally from mistakes and setbacks: Jones argued that the important aspect of your pursuit of success is the journey itself, not the end result, and that if you approach your career with that attitude, you’ll see mistakes as a step along the way instead of an ending point. In this way, you should focus on growth and effort, not outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Jones said that
             <strong>
              when you accept mistakes as part of the process, you’ll stop being afraid to make them
             </strong>
             , which can help keep you motivated to get through difficult times. If you’re afraid to make a mistake, you won’t challenge yourself, which will limit how much you achieve.
            </p>
            <p>
             Banayan realized that this lesson applied to his journey in writing his book. He’d endured many failures and had made many mistakes (for example, asking the wrong interview questions, not listening properly, and being too aggressive and thus putting people off). But those mistakes had taught him more than anyone’s wisdom had taught him.
            </p>

             </p>
             <p>
              Jones isn’t the only person to advise focusing on
              <em>
               growth
              </em>
              and
              <em>
               effort
              </em>
              instead of
              <em>
               outcomes
              </em>
              and
              <em>
               results
              </em>
              . Jones’s advice pertained to finding success in business, but the approach can influence how you work toward any goal—for example, it mirrors the approach, discussed earlier, that Jessica Alba took to improving health: Focus on what you can control.
             </p>
             <p>
              The ancient Stoics recommended this approach as a way to find
              <a href="https://www.shortform.com/app/book/a-guide-to-the-good-life#practice-2-focus-on-what-you-can-control" target="_blank">
               happiness in general
              </a>
              , as William Irvine explains in
              <em>
               <a href="https://www.shortform.com/app/book/a-guide-to-the-good-life" target="_blank">
                A Guide to the Good Life
               </a>
              </em>
              . They recommended focusing on your own effort, which you can control—you can choose how much time and resources to devote to a project—because if your project involves other people, you can’t fully control the outcome since other people may do things differently than you’d like.
             </p>
             <p>
              When you adopt this mindset, you can reduce your fear of mistakes because you can see them as part of your effort—part of your journey—and you can recognize that your journey doesn't have to end because you’ve made an error. You’ll see that when you make a mistake, it will teach you what to do better so that you can then stay more in control of your effort and process.
             </p>

               </a>
              </em>
              , Ray Dalio takes this idea further by defining mistakes as nature’s way of telling us to keep learning. He sums up the relationship between mistakes and achievement with the equation:
              <a href="../../../app/book/principles-life-and-work#principle-1-relentless-truth-seeking/1-page-summary.html" target="_blank">
               Pain + Reflection = Progress
              </a>
              . This idea again focuses on
              <em>
               progress
              </em>
              instead of
              <em>
               outcomes
              </em>
              , and it also incorporates
              <em>
               reflection
              </em>
              , which is, ultimately, the lesson Banayan took away from the experience of writing his book: Mistakes afford opportunities for reflection that lead to learning.
