            <h2>
             1-Page Summary
            </h2>
            <p>
             Have you ever held a job that you felt was genuinely pointless? You're not alone. In
             <em>
              Bullshit Jobs
             </em>
             , David Graeber argues that many jobs in contemporary industrial societies are, in fact, pointless. This flies in the face of our conventional economic thinking, in which jobs exist largely to fulfill a pre-existing need that adds value to society. In this book, he explains what pointless jobs are, why they’re proliferating, and why they make workers so unhappy.
            </p>
            <p>
             David Graeber was an anthropology professor, activist, and self-identified anarchist. He began this book with
             <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs-a-work-rant" target="_blank">
              an op-ed in Strike! magazine
             </a>
             . When hundreds of people reached out to him to talk about their own experiences in pointless jobs, Graeber realized his op-ed had struck a nerve. He put out calls on social media for people to discuss their pointless jobs with him and developed a rich collection of interviews, upon which he based this book.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our guide will cover Graeber's ideas in four parts.

             Part 1: What Is a Pointless Job?
            </h3>
            <p>
             Broadly speaking, a pointless job is one that serves no purpose for society. Either no tasks are assigned to the worker, the tasks assigned are not useful, or—in some cases—the tasks assigned are actually detrimental to society. But how do you know a pointless job when you see one, and who determines which jobs are pointless? In this section, we'll cover how Graeber defines pointless jobs, then we'll explore the characteristics of pointless jobs as well as the four types of pointless jobs.
            </p>
            <h4 id="how-to-identify-a-pointless-job">
             How to Identify a Pointless Job
            </h4>
            <p>
             Graeber argues that
             <strong>
              you can identify a job as pointless if the worker
              <em>
               believes
              </em>
              it is so.
             </strong>
             While critics might counter that this definition is too subjective, Graeber reasons that the person who spends most of their waking hours performing a task is the one who is best positioned to judge its uselessness.
            </p>
            <p>
             He argues that workers have direct personal knowledge of what they do all day. They’ll see the impact their work performance has on the product or service their organization provides. If they suddenly start slacking off or working harder than before and find nothing changes, they’re right to conclude that their work has no point.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Because Graeber's criterion for identifying a pointless job is subjective, it's important to note that workers may consider their jobs pointless for a wide range of reasons. For example, many workers see their jobs not only as a way of contributing to society,
             <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/175400/workers-sense-identity-job.aspx" target="_blank">
              but also as a source of identity and meaning
             </a>
             . Thus, someone may believe their work is pointless because it fails to provide this sense of identity and meaning, even though it may actually contribute value to society.)
            </p>
            <h5 id="are-there-pointless-professions">
             Are There Pointless Professions?
            </h5>
            <p>
             While Graeber maintains that the worker's subjective assessment of their own job is the most important criterion for determining its pointlessness, this only tells us whether their
             <em>
              own
             </em>
             job is pointless. But this raises the question, are there entire
             <em>
              professions
             </em>
             of pointless work? Graeber recommends you ask yourself,
             <strong>
              “How would society change if this class of workers simply disappeared overnight?”
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, if truck drivers disappeared overnight, stores would quickly run out of stock. Therefore, driving a truck is a purposeful job. On the other hand, Graeber argues, if America's corporate lobbyists disappeared overnight, the government would continue to function normally. Therefore, he would argue, this profession is pointless.
            </p>
            <p>

             Characteristics of Pointless Jobs
            </h4>
            <p>
             Based on his research, Graeber outlines five general characteristics of pointless jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              1. The worker feels a need to keep up the pretense that they are doing something.
             </strong>
             Whether to keep up appearances, adhere to social norms, or keep from getting fired, the worker feels pressured to pretend that their job is purposeful when deep down they feel that it's not.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: The sociologist
             <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/1/19/Goffman_Erving_The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life.pdf" target="_blank">
              Erving Goffman
             </a>
             argues that
             <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/the-presentation-of-self-in-everyday-life-3026754" target="_blank">
              we should understand social interactions as performance, similar to theater
             </a>
             . In each situation, people are aware of having a distinct "role" to perform for others. Workers without anything to do will therefore keep up the appearance of "working" because they understand this as their role in the "play.” This sheds light on why it can feel stressful to do nothing at work. Goffman would argue that the employee isn't really doing nothing, but is putting considerable energy and care into maintaining their performance.)
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              2. Pointless jobs are often executive jobs.
             </strong>
             Graeber argues that you most frequently encounter pointless jobs in managerial or administrative positions where workers have vaguely defined responsibilities and roles. They may have impressive titles, but no clear or obvious way to add value in their position.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Many of Graeber’s characteristics of pointless jobs can be explained by "Parkinson's Law." The historian and civil servant C. Northcote Parkinson argues that bureaucratic organizations
             <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/1955/11/19/parkinsons-law" target="_blank">
              create extra jobs because work will expand to fill allotted time
             </a>
             . Parkinson writes that managerial or administrative positions are particularly susceptible to needless expansion. He points out that in administrative or bureaucratic roles, anyone who feels overworked will request more subordinates to lighten their workload rather than resigning or sharing responsibilities with a coworker. Their subordinates may then feel overworked and request additional subordinates indefinitely, allowing for continuous sprawl.)
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              3. Pointless jobs often pay better than purposeful jobs.
             </strong>
             Graeber argues that workers with purposeful jobs like garbage collectors, teachers, or agricultural workers are often given much lower wages than the workers in pointless managerial jobs. This goes against the prevailing assumption that those with higher pay are making more valuable contributions.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Critics of Graeber argue that
             <a href="https://www.economist.com/bartleby/2018/06/01/do-we-pay-nurses-less-because-we-envy-them-unlikely#:~:text=So%20if%20companies%20have%20employed%20lots,all.%20His%20explanation%20for%20this%20point" target="_blank">
              professions such as nursing, garbage collection, and food service pay less simply because of labor markets, and their wage bears no relation to their usefulness or uselessness
             </a>
             . When the skills required to perform a certain task are widespread throughout the labor force, workers will have to compete with each other for jobs more than companies will have to compete with each other for employees. The competition between employees allows employers to offer lower wages. As evidence of their position, these critics point to the high pay of jobs that are useful but require specialized skills, like surgeons.)

            <h4 id="types-of-pointless-jobs">
             Types of Pointless Jobs
            </h4>
            <p>
             In his research, Graeber found that pointless jobs broadly fit into four categories.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              1. Jobs that create an impression.
             </strong>
             Many jobs exist just to keep up appearances. For example, an executive might hire an assistant just to make it look like they are busier and more important than they actually are. Or a company may commission a report so that they can publicly say they're "doing something" about a source of public controversy, even though the results of the report will likely be ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              2. Jobs that are actually harmful.
             </strong>
             These jobs have an impact, but one the worker feels harms society more than it helps. For example, a copywriter who writes fake customer reviews to inflate a company's online rating may be helping their employer, but only at the expense of customers looking for useful, honest product reviews.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              3. Jobs that provide unnecessary solutions.
             </strong>
             Some organizations might employ someone to solve a chronic problem that could easily be solved by other means. For example, hiring a data entry clerk to move data from one spreadsheet to another, when they could easily automate the process with software.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              4. Jobs that create pointless supervision.
             </strong>
             Many people in pointless jobs are hired to supervise other workers who don't need supervision. The organization feels a need to create an extra layer of management, even though these workers are perfectly capable of getting all their tasks done without someone watching.

               Why Do Managers Allow Pointless Jobs?
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Critics of Graeber's thesis argue that corporate managers are under enormous pressure from investors to deliver high returns on their investment. They contend that
              <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2018/05/31/are-you-stuck-in-a-bullshit-job#:~:text=suggests%20that%20automation%20in%20recent,argues%20that%20while%20executives%20in%20the" target="_blank">
               managers therefore have strong incentives to eliminate pointless work, and find it unlikely that they’re subsidizing jobs simply for their own sake
              </a>
              . Therefore, it's worth exploring how these jobs might be able to exist in spite of pressure to create return on investment.
             </p>
             <p>
              The first two categories (impression maintenance and social harm) are jobs where the worker may consider their work pointless, but the manager and shareholders might disagree. While some workers would be disappointed to feel their position exists mainly for show,
              <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2010/02/01/brand-reputation-value-leadership-managing-ethisphere.html?sh=54e86ce33790" target="_blank">
               business experts argue that a company's reputation is one of its most valuable assets
              </a>
              . Therefore, keeping up a favorable impression may be a priority to managers and investors even if employees find it dispiriting. Secondly, even those employees who believe their work is harmful to society (as in the fake reviews example) would still be helping the company gain a return on their investment (at others’ expense), and would still be useful in the eyes of the manager.
             </p>
             <p>
              The second two categories (providing unnecessary solutions and pointless supervision) are jobs that managers would have a strong incentive to eliminate for the sake of efficiency. However, doing so requires knowledge of which positions could be eliminated, and in large organizations, higher management often lacks the information necessary to identify inefficiencies. In

             Part 2: Why Are There So Many Pointless Jobs in Industrialized Countries?
            </h3>
            <p>
             Now that we understand what pointless jobs are, we'll explore Graeber's explanations as to why there are so many pointless jobs in industrialized nations. We’ve divided his causes into three broad categories: economic, political, and cultural.
            </p>
            <h4 id="economic-reasons">
             Economic Reasons
            </h4>
            <p>
             Graeber defines two core economic reasons why there are so many pointless jobs in industrialized countries. First, he discusses the role of automation, then he explains how an economy that prioritizes wealth extraction enables the proliferation of pointless jobs.
            </p>
            <h5 id="economic-reason-1-automation-has-reduced-the-need-for-work">
             Economic Reason #1: Automation Has Reduced the Need for Work
            </h5>
            <p>
             Graeber argues that
             <strong>
              automation in industrialized societies has reduced the need for labor, so there simply isn't as much useful work to be done by
              <em>
               humans
              </em>
              .
             </strong>
             He contends that technological advances in manufacturing and software now allow industrial nations to fulfill their material needs without their entire workforce contributing a full workweek. However, instead of reducing workers' hours or allowing part of the population to subsist without working, industrial economies have simply created unnecessary jobs to keep the entire workforce employed—even though many of these jobs actually contribute very little value to society.
            </p>
            <p>
             He cites early 20th-century economists who argued that by now, automation ought to have created mass unemployment. Graeber contends that their predictions have mostly come true—it's just that industrial societies have solved this problem by creating lots of pointless jobs.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>

               Does Automation Create Mass Unemployment?
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              The impact of automation on employment has been widely debated by economists, technology experts, and forecasters. Some economists argue that
              <a href="https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2010/10/20/rise-of-the-machines#:~:text=automation%20of%20manufacturing%20activity,work.%20But%20this%20unemployment%20goes" target="_blank">
               automation will not lead to mass unemployment
              </a>
              . They point out that new technologies also create new types of industries that will need skilled employees. They also contend that robots will still cost money to produce and therefore may not be economical to deploy in every possible niche.
             </p>
             <p>
              Those who are more worried about the effects of automation on employment point out that even if automation won’t eliminate all jobs,

               it will hit some sectors of employment much harder than others
              </a>
              . Business owners will see greater profits as their costs of labor drop, but the automation of industries like customer service, transportation, and manufacturing will force large numbers of workers to change jobs at once. They warn that this will be highly disruptive, as many workers won’t have the skills or education to move into more secure fields.

             Economic Reason #2: Wealth Extraction
            </h5>
            <p>
             Graeber contends that many pointless jobs are created because
             <strong>
              the most well-resourced industries aren't actually producing anything.
             </strong>
             He argues that in wealthy, capitalist societies, the investors who control most of the capital are more interested in
             <em>
              extracting
             </em>
             wealth than
             <em>
              producing
             </em>
             it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Producing wealth would include things like manufacturing goods or harvesting raw materials that would increase the number of useful goods for people. On the other hand, extracting wealth involves siphoning off value that
             <em>
              others
             </em>
             have created. For example, a company that researches and develops a new medicine would be creating wealth, whereas a company that buys up patents on existing medicines just to collect fees from manufacturers would be extracting wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
             Graeber argues that those who control the supply of investment capital are investing heavily in wealth extraction because they’re the ones who benefit. Therefore, the companies they own invest their labor power in sprawling bureaucratic administrations designed to support this siphoning of wealth. This creates a sprawling, managerial workforce that adds little value to society—a breeding ground for pointless jobs.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>

             </p>
             <p>
              In arguing that investment capital doesn't "produce" things, Graeber is drawing heavily on Marxist ideas about class struggle. In

               economies can be divided into two classes: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie

             Graeber also identifies two political reasons why the governments of industrial societies would condone—even support—the creation of pointless jobs. He argues they have two key incentives: maintaining jobs for the sake of pleasing their constituents and maintaining political stability by keeping the population occupied.

            <p>
             Graeber argues that
             <strong>
              politicians have a vested interest in maintaining jobs to please their constituents.
             </strong>
             Policies that the public sees as "protecting" or "creating" jobs tend to be more popular than those seen as "eliminating" jobs. Because politicians need to keep winning elections to stay in power, they have an incentive to choose these popular policies. Therefore, a politician will likely enact policies that "create" or “protect” jobs even if those jobs themselves serve no purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, in debates over cutting military spending or reforming healthcare, politicians will argue that workers depend on these programs to provide them with employment. These often take precedence over arguments that the program employing people serves some essential function or adds value to society. Graeber argues that this reveals that politicians tacitly acknowledge these jobs could be eliminated and are maintaining pointless jobs simply for the sake of providing workers with income.

             Mass unemployment has historically produced major upheavals, including revolutions. Not only does unemployment deprive people of an income and make them desperate, but it also gives them time to organize themselves and devote their energy to political causes. Politicians can therefore maintain stability in society, and their own power, by simply giving everyone something to do—even if the tasks themselves serve no purpose.

             Cultural Reasons
            </h4>
            <p>
             In addition to economic and political reasons, Graeber argues that cultural reasons contribute to the proliferation of pointless jobs. He asserts that societies put up with pointless jobs because they view work as an inherent good, expect it to be unenjoyable, and undervalue care work.

             Cultural Reason #1: Work Is Viewed as an Inherent Good
            </h5>
            <p>
             Graeber argues that
             <strong>
              Western cultures view work as an inherent good.
             </strong>
             People are expected to work for the sake of working. Work is understood as transformative—it "builds character." Work is also a means of acquiring dignity and earning your quality of life, which implies that
             <em>
              people who don't work don't deserve dignity or quality of life
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             Under this view, it makes perfect sense to create jobs purely for the sake of creating jobs. To deprive someone of work is to deprive them of the means of transforming their character, obtaining dignity, and earning their quality of life. Therefore, jobs are considered an inherent good, whether or not they actually achieve anything useful.
            </p>
            <p>
             It's not surprising, Graeber argues, that a society that holds these values would support the creation and preservation of pointless jobs, as the purpose achieved by the job becomes secondary to the cultural purpose of
             <em>
              work itself

              these ideas specifically have their roots in the theology of John Calvin
             </a>
             . This theology suggests a cold, distant, disapproving God. Additionally, most people are damned, and only a small chosen few called “the elect” will enter heaven. This resulted in Protestants striving to prove their membership in the elect by devoting themselves to industrious work in a display of ascetic spiritual seriousness—making work an inherent spiritual good.)

             Cultural Reason #2: Work Is Supposed to be Unpleasant
            </h5>
            <p>
             Furthermore, Graeber argues that pointless jobs proliferate because
             <strong>
              Western cultures traditionally understand work as something that’s supposed to be unpleasant, if not downright miserable.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In these cultures, work is the opposite of play and leisure. Anything that you do for its own sake—recreation, hobbies, spending quality time with others—definitionally cannot be considered work. Work, rather, is something you would never
             <em>
              want
             </em>
             to do, only something you
             <em>
              have
             </em>
             to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recall that work is also the means by which workers obtain dignity and their quality of life. This presents a paradox: Workers are supposed to want to work because it provides them with dignity and quality of life,
             <em>
              and
             </em>
             they are supposed to hate working. Graeber argues that, in this value system, workers earn the right to dignity and quality of life
             <em>
              because they are miserable
             </em>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             This contributes to the tolerance of pointless jobs in two distinct ways. First, if someone is at work but has nothing to do, then they aren't supposed to spend the extra time doing something enjoyable like personal hobbies. They are supposed to pretend to be busy or make up pointless tasks to fill the time. Second, as we will discuss, pointless jobs often leave their workers feeling miserable. However, no one will view this as a problem if they
             <em>
              expect
             </em>
             work to be miserable.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: To understand the view that work is the opposite of enjoyment, we can again turn to Weber's analysis of Calvinism in
             <em>

             </em>
             . Recall that Calvinism compelled Protestants to prove their membership in a spiritual elect by demonstrating their industriousness and spiritual seriousness. This need to display seriousness also led Protestants to
             <a href="https://shortform.com/app/book/the-protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-capitalism/1-page-summary#john-calvin-introduces-predestination-mid-1500s" target="_blank">
              shun leisure activities considered frivolous, including drinking, feasting, and idle talk
             </a>
             . Any “instinctive" pleasure was considered suspect. This created a dichotomy with serious, ascetic industriousness on one side and frivolous self-indulgence on the other. Therefore, if you enjoy something, it can't be work.)

             Cultural Reason #3: Care Work Is Undervalued
            </h5>
            <p>
             Lastly, Graeber argues that
             <strong>
              industrial societies enable pointless jobs because they undervalue care work.
             </strong>
             He contends that care work provides real value to society by making sure people's needs are met. However, he maintains that care work is undervalued because people view it as less important than work that produces goods. Care work includes tasks such as raising children, looking after the elderly, or watching over the sick. There are also many jobs with care work components, such as when nurses try to manage a patient's emotions by putting them at ease before a risky surgery. This provides value to society because it improves clients’ quality of life, unlike a desk job where the worker has no real responsibilities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Graeber argues that the undervaluing of care work has two cultural causes: sexism and capitalism.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Sexism:
             </strong>
             Care work has traditionally been done by women and is therefore seen as less valuable in societies with a history of sexism. Graeber contends that these societies presume that women are less valuable and therefore their work must be less valuable too.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Capitalism:
             </strong>
             Secondly, Graeber argues that in market-based economies, the value of all work must be quantified and exchanged. If you want to trade one good for another, both of their values need to be translated into quantities of currency. The value of care work is harder to measure, which makes it more difficult to exchange with other commodities. For example, could you put a price on the value your parents provided by raising you? Probably not. Because you can't place a number on this value, your culture might not consider it “work” in the conventional sense.

             </p>
             <p>
              In addressing the economic problems caused by undervaluing care work, it helps to distinguish between paid and unpaid care work. Paid care work includes looking after others such as children in daycare, but it can also include domestic work such as cleaning someone else's house. Unpaid care work typically involves looking after one's own children, taking care of household chores, or caring for an ailing or elderly family member. This distinction matters because undervaluing leads to different economic consequences in each case.
             </p>
             <p>

             <p>
              Unpaid care work also puts a strain on economies because it falls disproportionately on women. This prevents women from participating equally in the workforce, potentially lowering a country's prosperity. Illustrating this, economists

             How Undervaluing Care Work Creates Pointless Jobs
            </h5>
            <p>
             Graeber argues that undervaluing care work contributes to the proliferation of pointless jobs in two distinct ways. First, in trying to address the unemployment caused by automation, industrial societies have opted to fund purposeless managerial work instead of valuable care work.
            </p>
            <p>
             Second, the need to quantify the value provided by professional care workers—such as social workers—has created extra administrative jobs whose role it is to try to measure and document the value of the work done by these care workers. Trying to quantify that which is not easily quantifiable creates extra and unnecessary bureaucratic work, producing new pointless jobs.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
             <p>
              <strong>
               Can You Measure the Total Value of Unpaid Care Work?
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              While trying to attach an exchange value to care work can create extra unnecessary tasks, some economists have argued that trying to estimate the
              <em>
               total value
              </em>
              of unpaid care work in an economy can have important policy implications. They argue that if policy makers truly understand the economic importance of this work, they would be more likely to invest in it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Therefore, a number of economists have tried to put a monetary value on the total care work done in a country. Some have focused on the cost of hiring a nanny or house cleaner to do all the work an unpaid care worker does. Others focus on how care work supports those already in the work force and enables other forms of production. Economists have
              <a href="https://hdr.undp.org/content/valuing-care-work" target="_blank">
               launched studies in India, Japan, Australia, South Africa, and several other nations
              </a>
              . They’ve estimated the total value of unpaid care work at anywhere from 15% to 60% of the total GDP, depending on the country.

            <p>
             Now that we've discussed the causes of pointless jobs, we can turn to their effects. Graeber doesn't just argue that these pointless jobs are inefficient, but that
             <strong>
              they are actually harmful to society.
             </strong>
             He highlights two major problems: They make workers chronically miserable, and they create deep social divisions. In this section, we'll explore Graeber's arguments about the destructive consequences of pointless jobs.

            <p>
             <strong>
              Graeber’s research found that those who work pointless jobs often feel miserable
             </strong>
             . You might assume that people would be happy getting paid to do nothing, but that's actually not the case. Instead, Graeber maintains, deep down, most people genuinely want to contribute to society and feel frustrated and depressed when they can't. In this section, we'll cover the four psychological reasons pointless jobs make workers miserable: lack of agency, dishonesty, ambiguity, and indignity.

              The assumption that people would be happy getting paid to do nothing is

              ." This theory maintains that people would naturally seek to get the greatest reward for themselves in exchange for the lowest cost to themselves. This theory gained traction because it made it easier to create mathematical models of markets and economies—if you can accurately predict how most people in a given situation would behave, then you scale that up to model an entire society.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem with this is that people are complex, and therefore prone to making “irrational” decisions that throw off the accuracy of these models. Workers have a variety of motivations, goals, and needs that don't equate perfectly with monetary terms—for example, a desire to feel that you're making a valuable contribution or helping others. All of these motives would undermine a model that presumes people are simply looking to gain personal wealth in every situation.

             Graeber argues that pointless
             <strong>
              jobs make workers miserable because when nothing you do seems to matter, it can make it feel like
              <em>

              </em>
              don't matter either.
             </strong>
             When people have a sense of agency—the ability to make things happen through their actions—this affirms their sense of value and existence. After all, would you rather see yourself as someone who is capable of directing their own life and impacting the world around them, or someone who just helplessly reacts to scenarios outside your control? When people feel like nothing they do makes a difference, this creates a sense of erasure, a feeling that they don't really matter.

            <p>
             Graeber argues that pointless jobs also make workers miserable because
             <strong>
              they often feel like they’re living a lie.
             </strong>
             Recall that in most pointless jobs, workers are expected to keep up the pretense that they are busily doing something important. This dishonesty causes three distinct problems:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              1. Workers will feel a sense of anxiety at being found out.
             </strong>
             If you believe that everyone expects you to be working, when actually you're scrolling through social media all day because there's nothing for you to do, this can create a fear of getting fired, or being seen as less valuable by others.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Health researchers have also found that chronic dishonesty can have consequences on your physical as well as mental health.

            <p>
             <strong>
              2. Workers will feel alienated from their coworkers because they feel that they can't truly be honest around them.
             </strong>
             If they have to keep up a lie all the time, then they can't really let their guard down and talk authentically about their work with others. This makes their position much lonelier.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Management experts agree that a sense of belonging and authenticity is important to an employee's overall well-being. Research has shown that being your authentic self helps build larger personal networks,

             <strong>
              3. Being dishonest forces workers to act against their own values.
             </strong>
             Most people believe honesty to be a virtue. But to maintain the false pretense that a pointless job is purposeful, the worker must act against their own sense of virtue. This can undermine a worker's sense of integrity, and with it, a key part of their self-esteem.

             Psychological Problem #3: Ambiguity
            </h5>
            <p>
             Graeber contends that workers also feel miserable in pointless jobs because
             <strong>
              there's a sense of confusion and ambiguity about how they’re supposed to behave.
             </strong>
             Our social scripts—learned sets of expectations for how to behave in a given situation—tell us that we are supposed to work hard at our jobs and that our jobs are supposed to add value to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             What do you do when you realize your job is pointless? Do you tell your supervisor? Do you make up tasks? Do you pretend to be busy? Because pointless jobs aren't "supposed" to exist, there is no social script for how to behave in a pointless job. This leaves workers feeling
             <em>
              scriptless,
             </em>
             or confused and unsure of how to act.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: The concept of “scriptlessness” comes from the field of relationship psychology. Psychologists compared stories of
             <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232549899_Unrequited_Love_On_Heartbreak_Anger_Guilt_Scriptlessness_and_Humiliation" target="_blank">
              heartbroken suitors who had been rejected to stories told by those who had done the opposite: rejected an unwanted suitor
             </a>
             . They found that the rejected were able to console themselves with narratives of heartbreak from popular culture such as songs, movies, and novels. However, rejectors found themselves cast in an "unscripted role." There aren’t as many stories from the opposite perspective, and those in this position were left unclear on how to feel. This points us toward a possible solution: If more people came out and told stories about working in pointless jobs, then others caught in the same situation could have more scripts to rely on.)

             Psychological Problem #4: Indignity
            </h5>
            <p>
             Lastly, Graeber argues that
             <strong>
              working a pointless job often makes workers miserable because they may feel degraded and insulted by their employers.
             </strong>
             If there is genuinely nothing useful for them to do with their time, and their employer keeps giving them meaningless tasks just to keep them busy, employees may experience this as a form of bullying or coercion. They may feel this way because it calls attention to power inequities in the workplace in a demeaning way, reminding workers that their time is not their own.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, let's say you wait tables at a restaurant, and there aren't any customers, so your supervisor makes you wipe down tables that have already been wiped down. You're putting forth effort to achieve nothing simply because your employer feels they own your time and want to make sure you aren't using it for yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Management experts explain that

              managers often assign "busywork" when they feel they feel they can't trust their employees
             </a>
             . This distrust leads the managers to feel that they need to assert control of their workers’ time to maintain control of the office. This affirms why workers may experience "busywork" as an indignity. They are being made to put forth effort just so their bosses can feel in control.)

            <p>
             Graeber argues that in addition to making people unhappy,
             <strong>
              pointless jobs also create deep social divisions by fostering resentment between classes of workers.
             </strong>
             Recall that, according to Graeber, purposeful jobs tend to offer lower pay compared with pointless jobs. This situation creates two specific cross currents of resentment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The workers making very little but doing something useful are angry and resentful toward those who get paid more to do less. However, also recall that pointless jobs make workers miserable. This creates a second form of class resentment, in which those with purposeless work envy and resent those with purposeful work, despite the former group being paid more. These cross-currents of resentment lead to mutual hostility and antagonism.
            </p>
            <p>
             Graeber argues this explains a lot of the virulent partisanship currently afflicting Western industrial nations. Throughout the USA and Europe, the bases of political parties are realigning by their level of education, in which college-educated "white-collar" workers tend to be aligned against non-college-educated "blue-collar" workers. Furthermore, these political divisions are becoming more virulent and entrenched. Graeber maintains that the proliferation of pointless jobs plays an important role in creating and perpetuating hostility between classes of workers.

              Graeber describes a process of voters realigning behind political parties by level of education and type of work.

Political commentators have put forward several theories as to why this realignment is taking place.

            <p>
             Now that we have defined pointless jobs, identified their causes, and explored their consequences, we can turn our attention to how we can solve this problem. Graeber stresses that his goal in this book is to identify a problem rather than offer a solution. However, he still highlights one policy that he believes may offer a chance at solving the problem: universal basic income. In this section, we'll explain this idea and how it would impact the problem of pointless jobs.

             Graeber explains that
             <strong>
              universal basic income would provide every member of society with an equal flat wage, paid by the government and funded through taxation.
             </strong>
             This is meant to provide a supplemental income that could be combined with other conventional forms of income. However, it is intended to be enough to support someone who is unemployed, giving them the chance to opt out of undesirable employment. Graeber argues this policy would address the problem of pointless jobs in three distinct ways: Workers could decline pointless jobs, care work would receive funding, and politicians would have no need to support work for work’s sake.

              Graeber's possible solution of a universal basic income (UBI) has inspired widespread economic debate. So far,

             He maintains that people mainly stay in pointless jobs because they feel like they couldn't afford to be between jobs. But if workers could live without working, they would probably not take a job that contributed nothing, as these jobs make people miserable, for all the reasons we’ve explored. Therefore, pointless jobs would mostly disappear.

             (Shortform note: The possibility of workers opting out of employment after receiving a universal basic income is both feared by critics of universal basic income and touted by supporters as a potential benefit. It's worth asking then, have workers opted out of jobs in pilot programs? A study of cash payments in Alaska

             Universal Basic Income Would Fund Care Work

             <strong>
              This flat wage would support people who add value by caring for others.
             </strong>
             Recall that in an economy based on market exchange, work that's difficult to quantify is undervalued. Graeber argues that universal basic income would correct this problem. If people could support themselves while performing meaningful forms of care such as raising children or caring for elderly family members, then societies could fund work that added more value than, say, an office job where the worker spends half their time on social media.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: The pilot program in Alaska (mentioned above)

             </a>
             . Since family care is disproportionately carried out by women, this would support Graeber's thesis that universal basic income would allow people more time to invest in care work.)

             Politicians Would Cease Supporting Jobs for the Sake of Jobs
            </h5>
            <p>
             <strong>
              With a universal basic income, there'd be less incentive for politicians to provide work for work's sake.
             </strong>
             Recall that when people need employment to survive, governments are incentivized to create jobs for the sake of jobs, regardless of whether these jobs fulfill an actual need. If workers could survive without a job, there would be less reason to do this, resulting in the creation of fewer pointless jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: While universal basic income may hypothetically alleviate the incentives to support policies that create work, recall that Graeber argues that the belief in "work for work's sake" is
             <em>
              cultural
             </em>
             as well as
             <em>

             </a>
             . As long as their constituents believe in the
             <em>
              cultural value
             </em>
             of work, politicians will most likely follow suit and continue to support job-centered policies.)
