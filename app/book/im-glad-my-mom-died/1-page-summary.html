             , former child star Jennette McCurdy explores the ways in which her acting career and her entire identity are inextricably linked with her difficult, often traumatic, relationship with her mom, Debra. Debra’s control over McCurdy’s life is so complete that it extends even beyond Debra’s death from cancer when McCurdy is 21; it isn’t until years later that McCurdy starts to recover from her childhood in earnest.

             Part 1: McCurdy’s Difficult Relationship With Her Mom
            </h3>
            <p>
             McCurdy’s relationship with her mom dominates every aspect of her childhood and young adulthood. In this section, we’ll examine how Debra’s behavior colors McCurdy’s home life, her relationship with her dad, her acting career, her disordered eating and drinking, and her efforts to be independent from Debra.

             McCurdy’s Troubled Home Life
            </h4>
            <p>
             From early childhood, McCurdy lives with her family in Garden Grove, California, about an hour and a half from Hollywood. She notes that residents call the city “garbage grove” because so many “white trash” people live there. She lives with her mom and dad, her three brothers, and her mom’s parents.
             <strong>
              The family doesn’t have much money and frequently pays their rent late or underpays it
             </strong>
             , even with McCurdy’s dad and grandparents all chipping in. Her grandparents work minimum-wage jobs; her dad works two blue-collar jobs. Debra home-schools her four kids.
            </p>
            <p>
             McCurdy’s home life is marred by Debra’s mental and physical illnesses, including Debra’s hoarding, her volatile mental and emotional state, and her cancer.
             <strong>
              These issues cause McCurdy to feel constantly anxious, guilty, and responsible for her mom’s health and happiness.
             </strong>
             However, she loves her mom deeply and, as a child, she’s unaware of how much her uncomfortable feelings are a reaction to Debra’s behavior.
            </p>
            <h5 id="debras-hoarding">
             Debra’s Hoarding
            </h5>
            <p>
             Debra is a hoarder, and
             <strong>
              their house is so filled with junk that there’s no room for the four children to sleep in their bedrooms
             </strong>
             ; they sleep on mats on the living room floor. They also use a fold-out mat on the floor as a dining room table.
            </p>
            <p>
             The garage is so full of junk that it’s impossible to walk through, and it’s full of dead rats and possums, which smell bad. The family keeps an extra refrigerator at the front of the garage near the garage door so it’s more accessible, but the garage door is broken, so every time McCurdy and her brother have to get food out of the refrigerator they put themselves in danger: Her brother strains to keep the heavy garage door open while McCurdy runs to get what they need before the door comes crashing down.
            </p>
            <p>
             The family is Mormon, and McCurdy loves going to church—not because she’s religious, but because it means she can leave the house. She hates the house and feels anxious just being in it. Church feels like a clean, peaceful escape.

               Causes and Effects of Hoarding Disorder
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              While researchers don’t know what causes hoarding disorder, they do know that it often

               coexists with other mental health conditions
              </a>
              , such as obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and depression. A unique feature of hoarding disorder is that hoarders frequently have no awareness of or insight into their behavior. As a result, they defend their hoarding and resist attempts at intervention.
             </p>
             <p>
              The causes of hoarding may be unknown; the effects, however, are clear. Studies show that hoarding can present a

               risk of psychological and physical harm to family members
              </a>
              , as was the case in the McCurdy family. Like McCurdy,

               children of hoarders report increased anxiety and family strain
              </a>
              . They often feel that they can’t have friends over to the house and they need to keep a shameful secret about their family. In addition, hoarding can collapse appropriate boundaries by forcing family members to share—and perform all their activities in—the only uncluttered spaces in the house.

             Debra’s Volatile Mental and Emotional State
            </h5>
            <p>
             Debra is very emotionally volatile and frequently has angry outbursts over everything from her sons spilling milk to her husband getting home late from work—she often makes him sleep in the car when he gets home late.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Debra’s unpredictability causes McCurdy to be very sensitive to her mom’s emotions
             </strong>
             ; this hyperawareness allows McCurdy to determine what’s about to happen and behave accordingly. She feels responsible for her mom’s happiness. For example, she can tell from Debra’s body language and facial expressions when she’s about to get angry at McCurdy’s dad, so she rushes to Debra’s side and tells her she loves her in an attempt to calm Debra down and prevent another violent outburst.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: While everyone has occasional outbursts, people who are consistently unable to control or manage their emotional responses—in particular, their responses when things go wrong in their lives—are known in psychological terms as

            <h5 id="debras-cancer">
             Debra’s Cancer
            </h5>
            <p>
             Debra was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer when McCurdy was two years old, and she underwent chemotherapy, radiation, a bone marrow transplant, a mastectomy, and a breast implant.
             <strong>
              Even after the cancer is in remission, Debra’s illness is a constant presence in McCurdy’s childhood
             </strong>
             : Debra frequently tells her cancer story to anyone who will listen, and every week she makes her kids rewatch a home video she made shortly after her diagnosis. Each time, she tells McCurdy that she can’t understand how she could have been singing “Jingle Bells” at such a somber time—McCurdy was two years old.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a six-year-old, McCurdy feels incredibly guilty for her behavior as a two-year-old. She also feels uncomfortable about repeatedly having to watch a video of her mom when she was very sick with cancer.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              The overall feeling in McCurdy’s house that her mom’s cancer could return at any minute contributes to McCurdy’s desire to please her mom
             </strong>
             and do anything she can to keep her healthy and happy. McCurdy even believes that she can keep Debra alive by wishing for it every year when she blows out the candles on her birthday cake.
            </p>
            <p>
             When McCurdy is 18, her mom’s cancer does return. The cancer spreads and Debra gets progressively worse over the next few years.

             McCurdy’s Relationship With Her Dad
            </h4>
            <p>
             Debra’s behavior also complicates McCurdy’s relationship with her dad, Mark.
            </p>
            <p>
             Debra belittles her husband to his face and to McCurdy when he’s not around. Mark is mostly distant and not affectionate with McCurdy throughout her childhood; the one time he does try to take her for a bike ride to get smoothies, Debra yells at him for not getting McCurdy home on time for an acting class. McCurdy wishes she were close to her dad like she is with her mom, but unlike her relationship with her mom, she doesn’t know what she needs to do to make him happy.
            </p>
            <p>
             Years later, after McCurdy’s mom dies, Mark reveals to McCurdy that he’s not her biological father or the biological father of two of her brothers. McCurdy realizes that her mom lied to her children about their dad throughout her life, depriving them of a relationship with their biological father.
            </p>

             (Shortform note: Studies show that

             </a>
             . These effects are worse when the person making the discovery has a difficult relationship with their mother, such as when the mother has violated the child’s trust by failing to disclose the father’s identity. People who make such a discovery are likely to fare better afterward, however, if they’re able to openly discuss the news with others. McCurdy is able to ask Mark a few questions about her biological father, and she ultimately meets him, but her mother’s death means she’ll never have the opportunity to talk to her mom about why she kept this secret for so long.)

             Debra’s Control of McCurdy’s Acting Career
            </h4>
            <p>
             Whereas Debra’s behavior influences McCurdy’s home life and her relationship with her dad, when it comes to acting, Debra controls McCurdy’s career completely—including the decision to act in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
             Debra had always wanted to be an actress, but her parents wouldn’t let her. When McCurdy is six, Debra tells her that she should be an actress because Debra wants to give McCurdy the life she never had.
             <strong>
              McCurdy knows being an actress is what she has to do to make her mom happy.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Debra takes McCurdy to audition for an agency and McCurdy is accepted as a background actor. She starts to get more work because she’s good at cooperating and doing what she’s told, which she says are important traits for a child actor. She auditions to work as a principal actor with a better-known agent, and she doesn’t get it, but Debra talks the agent into taking McCurdy on as long as she takes acting classes.
            </p>
            <p>
             McCurdy hates the acting classes.
             <strong>
              She doesn’t enjoy acting at all, but she’s glad it makes her mom happy.
             </strong>
             To add to the discomfort, Debra insists on sitting in on her acting class, so McCurdy has the additional pressure of knowing her mom is watching, judging, and coaching her (by using facial expressions and mouthing the lines).
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: While encouraging children to work through obstacles can be healthy,

              putting too much pressure on them to perform can have a variety of negative consequences
             </a>
             , including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Similarly, when parents are

             </a>
             —for example, when they tell their kids how to do something that they’re already managing to do on their own—this can make it harder for the children to regulate their behavior and emotions in other contexts.)
            </p>
            <p>
             McCurdy becomes known for crying on cue. To do so, she has to imagine horrible things happening to her family. It makes her miserable, but she usually books roles if she cries on cue in the audition. After she’s done this for a while, she has one audition where a part of her rebels against having to feel so much pain again, and she isn’t able to cry.
             <strong>
              After the audition, she tells her mom that she doesn’t want to act anymore. Her mom throws a fit, crying and banging on the steering wheel.
             </strong>
             When McCurdy retracts her statement, her mom stops crying immediately. McCurdy notices that she’s not the only one who can cry on cue.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              As McCurdy gets older, she starts to notice that some of her mom’s expressions and actions seem fake—as if they’ve been rehearsed.
             </strong>
             And some of McCurdy’s own words and behavior around her mom are also a form of acting: performances designed to please her mom. For example, when McCurdy writes a screenplay and presents it to her mom, thinking she’ll be proud, her mom looks into the distance with a rehearsed “wistful” expression on her face and tells McCurdy she hopes she doesn’t like writing more than acting. McCurdy responds that of course she doesn’t—because she knows that’s what her mom wants to hear. Debra says she wants McCurdy to keep her actress’s “peach butt” and not get a fat writer’s butt; she also says that the plot of McCurdy’s screenplay has already been done in another movie.
            </p>
            <p>
             After many years of guest-starring on episodes of TV shows, McCurdy books a role as a series regular on the Nickelodeon show
             <em>
              iCarly
             </em>
             . McCurdy’s regular paychecks bring her family financial stability. The show becomes successful, and McCurdy becomes increasingly famous. The attention adds to her anxiety: Strangers approach her everywhere she goes and she’s resentful and apprehensive about constantly having to interact with them.

Many child stars, including Shirley Temple and Macaulay Culkin, have been victims of their parents’ mismanagement (or embezzlement) of their salaries.

             When McCurdy is about 17, she begins to resent her mom for the first time. Her mom controls every aspect of McCurdy’s acting career, down to how she signs her name for autographs. It had always been her mom’s dream for McCurdy to act, and McCurdy had always wanted her mom to be happy. But now that McCurdy is successful, she starts to realize that her mom is happy and she’s not.
             <strong>
              She feels like her mom used her.

             Sometimes she even hates her mom, but she immediately feels guilty and tells herself how much she loves her mom and is grateful to her. Near the end of the book,

Emotionally immature or narcissistic parents don’t meet their children’s needs for respect, understanding, and empathy.

             McCurdy’s Eating Disorders and Drinking
            </h4>
            <p>
             Just as she controls McCurdy’s acting career, Debra also controls McCurdy’s eating, and she steers her into anorexia.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a child, McCurdy is afraid to grow older because her mom wants her to stay young and small, in part because Debra thinks McCurdy can book more roles if she looks young for her age. When McCurdy is 11 and starts puberty, she asks her mom what she can do to stop developing, and her mom introduces her to what she calls “calorie restriction,” a form of extremely strict dieting.
            </p>
            <p>
             McCurdy and her mom bond over their careful calorie counting and weekly weighing sessions (during which Debra also measures McCurdy’s thighs with a measuring tape). In six months, McCurdy drops three clothing sizes. Her doctor and others become concerned that she has anorexia. Debra lies to the doctor and says she hasn’t noticed any changes in McCurdy’s eating habits.

             McCurdy starts a music career as a teenager because her manager says that’s what all the child actors are doing. Right before she goes on a tour of American malls to promote her music, her mom’s cancer comes back, so Debra is unable to go with her.
             <strong>
              It’s the first time in McCurdy’s life that she experiences what it’s like to be away from her mom for more than a few hours.
             </strong>
             She notices that a lot of her anxiety disappears. Although she’s still nervous about her performances, she’s enjoying herself. She feels free and she starts eating a lot more. She realizes how exhausting it is to constantly monitor her mom and be exactly the way her mom wants her to be.
            </p>
            <p>
             After the experience of being able to eat whatever she wants without worrying about what her mom will think, McCurdy starts binge eating frequently. She feels like her body is making up for having starved itself for so long.

             McCurdy tries alcohol for the first time when she’s 21. She loves it because when she’s drunk, her inner critic—which is mostly the voice of her mom criticizing and judging her—is silenced. She proceeds to get very drunk every night for three weeks after she first tries alcohol.

             Lack of Emotional and Physical Boundaries Between Debra and McCurdy
            </h4>
            <p>
             McCurdy and her mom are so close that there are few emotional or physical boundaries between them. When teenaged McCurdy finally starts to assert some independence from her mom, Debra punishes her for it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Debra doesn’t have many friends and, until McCurdy meets her co-star Miranda Cosgrove on
             <em>
              iCarly
             </em>
             , McCurdy doesn’t, either. When McCurdy is a young girl, Debra tells her repeatedly that she is her best friend and that she’d rather have McCurdy than any man. It makes McCurdy feel special to be so close to her mom.
            </p>
            <p>
             Throughout McCurdy’s childhood—until she is 17—Debra showers with her. Sometimes Debra showers with both McCurdy and her brother Scottie, who is 16. This makes McCurdy and her brother extremely uncomfortable. Debra says she has to shower with her because she was trained as a hairstylist and only she knows how to properly shampoo and condition McCurdy’s hair.

              During the showers, Debra performs breast and vaginal “exams” on McCurdy.
             </strong>
             She says this is to check for cancer. McCurdy dissociates from her body when this is happening and thinks hard about Disneyland to remove herself mentally from her present reality. When the “exams” are over, McCurdy feels immense relief.
            </p>
            <p>
             After Debra’s cancer comes back, she’s in a wheelchair and unable to drive McCurdy to the set of her show. McCurdy is 18 but Debra didn’t want her to learn to drive because she said her time would be better used doing other things, such as practicing lines. So she arranges for McCurdy to get her own apartment closer to the set. McCurdy is excited to finally be living on her own, but on her first night there, Debra invites herself over to spend the night—and never leaves.
             <strong>
              She sleeps in McCurdy’s bed with her; it’s hard for McCurdy to sleep because Debra clings to her all night.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             One day, McCurdy lies to Debra that she’s having a sleepover with Miranda Cosgrove, whom she had grown close to, so she could spend the night with a man.
             <strong>
              Debra detects the lie and screams at McCurdy that she’s a dirty whore, throwing a remote control at her
             </strong>
             . McCurdy goes on to have a relationship with the man, but she keeps it secret from her mom.

            <p>
             When McCurdy and her boyfriend go on vacation to Hawaii together, McCurdy tells her mom that she’s with a gay friend (the only men Debra wants McCurdy to spend time with are Mormons and gay men). However, the paparazzi take photos of McCurdy and her boyfriend together. Upon seeing the shots in the news,
             <strong>
              Debra goes ballistic. She calls McCurdy about 100 times, leaving her voicemails, and sending her emails in which she tells McCurdy she’s a slut, evil, and a monster

             , and she also goes into detail about the sex she imagines McCurdy and her boyfriend are having. Debra goes so far as to post a note to McCurdy’s fan page about how awful she is. She accuses McCurdy of causing her cancer to come back and says that she and McCurdy’s brothers all disown McCurdy.

In addition to manipulation, emotional outbursts, and shaming, emotional abuse can involve yelling and verbal aggression, constant criticism, isolation, passive aggression, excessive insults, and threats. Debra engages in many of these behaviors toward McCurdy.
             </p>
             <p>
              One particularly insidious form of emotional abuse is

              , sometimes also called emotional enmeshment or emotional parentification. Emotional incest occurs when a parent depends on a child to get their emotional needs met, treating the child like a surrogate spouse. The parent grooms the child to fulfill their needs and depends on the child for love and support, rather than the other way around. This creates a situation where there are
              <a href="https://www.webmd.com/parenting/what-is-emotional-incest" target="_blank">

             <p>
              The relationship between Debra and McCurdy similarly lacks emotional—or physical—boundaries. Debra relies on McCurdy for her happiness and to fulfill her own dreams of becoming an actress. When McCurdy tries to assert her independence in any way (such as by living on her own, learning to drive, or dating someone), Debra thwarts or punishes her, sometimes violently. Debra physically imposes herself upon McCurdy and won’t allow her to perform even basic functions of living—showering and sleeping—without Debra right next to her, invading her privacy.

However, McCurdy’s response to her mom’s invasive breast and vaginal exams—dissociating from her body and going somewhere else in her imagination—mirrors the response children (and adults) typically have to sexual abuse. Children experiencing sex abuse are essentially trapped, so their brains resort to

             . They feel the ordinary grief of losing a parent, plus the additional grief of mourning the loss of the healthy, supportive parent-child relationship that they never had. This can cause different reactions in different people, but McCurdy’s response is a common one: anger and acting out as a type of regression to primal-level survival tactics.)

             McCurdy Reconsiders Her Acting Career After Debra’s Death
            </h4>
            <p>
             After her mom dies, McCurdy is increasingly going through the motions at work. She hates the show she’s on (
             <em>
              Sam &amp; Cat
             </em>
             , a spin-off of
             <em>
              iCarly
             </em>
             ) and she hates acting. She agreed to the spin-off because her mom wanted her to do it and because the producers agreed that she could direct an episode. But the date on which she’s supposed to direct keeps getting pushed back until, with very few episodes left to go, it’s pushed off the calendar completely. She feels demoralized.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later, she finds out that the show is being canceled. A manager tells her it’s because of a sexual harassment claim against one of the producers. McCurdy had her own experiences with this producer. For example, when she was younger, he pressured her to try alcohol for the first time. He also massaged her shoulders and placed his hand on her knee without her consent, and insisted that she wear a bikini for a scene in
             <em>
              iCarly
             </em>
             even though she felt uncomfortable doing so. Nickelodeon offers McCurdy $300,000 not to talk publicly about her experience with the network.
             <strong>
              She refuses to take what she considers to be hush money.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             After she’s done a couple of seasons of a new show, she decides to take a break from acting. Acting makes her feel much the same way her eating disorder does: like she has no control over her life and is constantly bargaining to be good enough.
             <strong>
              She wants to take charge of her life, rather than allowing her eating disorder or her acting career to control her.

               The Toll of Child Acting
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Many child actors experience a similar loss of control as teenagers or adults, often resulting in public breakdowns or acting out. Experts and former child stars say there are a
              <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/08/06/child-star-issues/2609493/" target="_blank">

              .
             </p>
             <p>
              Like McCurdy, some child actors are pushed into acting by their parents, who want to live their lives through their child (and who may also be financially dependent on their child’s paycheck). In addition, having a job as a child is hard work. There can be a lot of pressure on child actors, especially those who are starring in a show: They need to learn their lines, work long hours, and live up to other people’s expectations of them—while also going to school. Finally, fame brings public scrutiny. Child actors don’t have a lot of free time or the opportunity to just be kids and make mistakes.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the other hand, psychologists say that if the parents of child actors are able to maintain good boundaries and a sense of normalcy in their child’s life, the child is more likely to succeed later in life. Just as there are many examples of child actors turning to substance abuse or having meltdowns, there are child actors who have gone on to be successful as adult actors, or in other careers.

             Part 3: McCurdy’s Recovery
            </h3>
            <p>
             After her mom’s death, McCurdy’s difficult childhood and its lasting, negative effects start to catch up to her, and she begins the process of recovery. In this section, we’ll first explore McCurdy’s experience with therapy and treatment for her eating disorders. Then, we’ll discuss how McCurdy comes to terms with Debra’s abuse.
            </p>
            <h4 id="therapy-and-treatment-for-eating-disorders">
             Therapy and Treatment for Eating Disorders
            </h4>
            <p>
             Following her tailspin, McCurdy begins going to a therapist and life coach, Laura. They start by taking stock of McCurdy’s life, determining that she’s binging and purging 5-10 times a day and drinking 8-9 shots of hard alcohol a night. Laura helps McCurdy understand that she’s binging and purging as a way to relieve anxiety caused by pent-up emotions. McCurdy is so spent and exhausted after she purges that she has no energy left for anxiety. In this way, the act serves as self-medication.
             <strong>
              She learns that one method of addressing her bulimia is by journaling constantly to get her feelings on paper so they aren’t unconsciously propelling her actions.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             In response to Laura’s questions, McCurdy reveals that her mom showed her how to restrict calories when she was 11. Laura says that McCurdy’s mom taught her how to be anorexic and encouraged her anorexia; she says this was abuse.
             <strong>
              McCurdy has always told herself that her mom wanted what was best for her, and she can’t stomach hearing her mom be called abusive.
             </strong>
             She quits therapy and returns to her disordered eating with a vengeance.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Like McCurdy,
             <a href="https://marciasirotamd.com/psychology-popular-culture/adult-children-abusive-parents-live-denial" target="_blank">
              many adult children of abusive parents have a hard time accepting that their parents were abusive
             </a>
             . Some psychologists say this is due to a kind of twisted hope: Children of abusive parents have been conditioned to believe that if they just do everything the abusive parent wants and try harder to please them, eventually the parent will give them the love and support they need (and, illogically, sometimes this hope continues even after the parent’s death). It’s especially hard to recognize and come to terms with childhood abuse if it was primarily emotional—like Debra’s abuse of McCurdy—because this kind of abuse doesn’t cause obvious, physical harm. However, denial of a parent’s abuse doesn’t make the pain it caused go away. Only by facing the pain directly are children of abusive parents able to heal.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Soon after McCurdy leaves therapy, her dad tells her that he’s not her biological father. Then, her boyfriend, who’s suddenly become religious despite previously showing no interest in religion, declares that he’s Jesus Christ reincarnated. McCurdy feels as if nothing in her life is certain or under her control. On a flight to Australia for a press junket, she binges and purges the entire time, and the last time, she loses a tooth in the process—her stomach acids had worn down the enamel. When she lands, she finds out her boyfriend is in a mental health facility and may be schizophrenic.
            </p>

             (Shortform note:
             <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CpyJj_Evrw-/" target="_blank">
              McCurdy has said that she considers this sequence of events her “rock bottom”
             </a>
             —a time when she didn’t believe things could get any better. The term
             <a href="https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/substance-use-disorder/hitting-rock-bottom" target="_blank">
              “rock bottom”
             </a>
             is frequently used in the recovery community to describe a crisis in a person’s life that makes them realize they don’t have any control over their addiction. Rock bottom looks different for everyone, and it isn’t necessary for people to hit rock bottom before they can begin their addiction recovery. However, for some people, like McCurdy, it’s what sets them on the path to recovery.)
            </p>
            <p>
             Things have gotten so bad that she decides to see an eating disorder specialist, Jeff. He starts by having her eliminate any “dieting” behavior: She must get rid of all diet foods in her house and stop exercising, except for walking and stretching. Then she needs to track her eating and purging. Next, he has her attempt to eat three meals a day, with snacks in between. She starts making gradual progress.
            </p>
            <p>
             One lesson she learns that hits home for her is the difference between a “slip” and a “slide.” A slip is when you slip up on your road to recovery and return to the behavior you’re trying to quit. You may feel guilt or frustration, which is normal and can even motivate you to change. A slide is when you add
             <em>
              shame
             </em>
             to those feelings of guilt and frustration, beating yourself up or telling yourself you’re a terrible person because you made a mistake. The problem with shame is it tends to spiral, often leading you to slip up more and more.
             <strong>
              Accepting that you’ll make mistakes on the road to recovery, without going into a “shame spiral” every time you do, can in fact make recovery more likely.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             McCurdy struggles for years to recover from her eating disorder and has frequent relapses. However, using the techniques she’s learned, McCurdy eventually reaches a point where she’s able to go a year without purging, and she begins to enjoy eating.
            </p>

             <p>
              Recovery experts, psychologists, and even some religions have long emphasized the importance of knowing the difference between guilt and shame, or what McCurdy describes as the difference between a “slip” and a “slide.” In

                The Power of Vulnerability
               </a>
              </em>
              , researcher Brené Brown explains that
              <a href="https://www.shortform.com/app/book/the-power-of-vulnerability/part-1" target="_blank">
               guilt is about actions, while shame is about identity
              </a>
              . Guilt makes you say, “I did a bad thing,” while shame makes you say, “I’m a bad person.” Shame can cause you to feel unworthy and unlovable, as well as to believe that you’re all alone with your problems, which can in turn lead you to engage in more unhealthy behavior. Brown notes that
              <a href="https://youtu.be/psN1DORYYV0" target="_blank">
               shame is highly correlated with addiction, eating disorders, depression, and violence
              </a>
              . It’s often caused by negative interactions with authority figures in childhood.
             </p>
             <p>
              The antidotes to shame, says Brown, are vulnerability, empathy, and self-compassion. Talking about your shame with a trusted confidant helps you understand that you’re not alone, and learning to understand other people’s feelings helps them dispel their own shame. Self-compassion—being kind to yourself when you make a mistake—helps you learn from your mistakes without connecting them to your self-worth.

              <a href="http://dharmapunxnyc.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-two-arrows-of-suffering.html" target="_blank">
               A lesson on the toxic effects of shame is also present in the Buddhist metaphor of the “two arrows.”
              </a>
              The first arrow is the emotional or physical pain you experience when you make a mistake or something bad happens to you. The second arrow is the additional mental suffering your thoughts create, which can lead you to shame yourself, blame others, and engage in unhealthy behaviors to distract yourself from the pain.
             </p>
             <p>
              The solution, according to Buddhism, is to sit with the uncomfortable feelings caused by the first arrow, rather than immediately shooting yourself with the second arrow of your thoughts. A more colloquial description of this process sometimes used in the recovery community is “The only way out is through.” The Buddhist approach also emphasizes self-compassion, encouraging you not to beat yourself up when you make a mistake.

             Coming to Terms With Debra’s Abuse
            </h4>
            <p>
             McCurdy visits Debra’s grave regularly after she dies, but as the years pass, she visits less and less frequently. On one of her visits, McCurdy notes all of the superlative adjectives the family had placed on her gravestone and reflects on how she always believed her mom was all of these and more—a kind of goddess who could do no wrong.
             <strong>
              But now she recognizes the truth: Her mom was a narcissist who emotionally, mentally, and physically abused her.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             McCurdy catalogs some of the ways that Debra hurt her:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              Debra gave McCurdy breast and vaginal exams until McCurdy was 17. McCurdy felt violated, but her mom had taught her that she didn’t have the option of saying “no” to anything her mom thought was best.
             </li>
             <li>
              When McCurdy was only 6, Debra forced her into a career that McCurdy didn’t want. She never had a chance to be a child.
             </li>
             <li>
              When McCurdy was 11, Debra taught her an eating disorder.
             </li>
             <li>
              Debra lied to her about who her father was, and never told her about her biological father.
             </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
             Despite the abuse, McCurdy still misses her mom and reflects fondly on some aspects of her personality. Sometimes she imagines that if her mom were still alive, she would have apologized for her actions, and the two could have a healthy relationship.
            </p>
            <p>
             But then McCurdy realizes that this is just a fantasy. She knows that her mom never acknowledged her issues or made any effort to change during her lifetime, even though her behavior was harming her family.
             <strong>
              McCurdy knows that if Debra were still alive, she’d still be trying to manipulate McCurdy
             </strong>
             into doing and being exactly what Debra wanted, she’d still be encouraging McCurdy’s eating disorder, and she’d still be pushing McCurdy to continue in an acting career that makes McCurdy miserable. McCurdy gets up from Debra’s grave and walks away, knowing that she’ll never come back.

              Although “I’m Glad My Mom Died” is a provocative title, McCurdy has said in interviews that

             </p>
             <p>
              Psychological research supports McCurdy’s belief that if Debra were still alive, she’d still be controlling and abusing her daughter.

              In fact, many therapists point out that because it can be very difficult to have a healthy relationship with an abusive parent,

               focus on their own needs

              , rather than focusing exclusively on the parent’s needs. As a result, some children of toxic parents don’t have any relationship with their parent, even if the parent is still alive.
