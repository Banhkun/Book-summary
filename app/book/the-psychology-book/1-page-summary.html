Starting in antiquity, the authors describe how our collective knowledge of psychology evolved over the centuries, highlighting the contributions of the most influential psychologists and researchers over time.

             The authors work across a variety of disciplines, including clinical psychology, business psychology, journalism, writing and editing, and music. Together they provide a multifaceted perspective on the many concepts that comprise the field of psychology.

             In our guide, we’ll explore the origins of psychology before moving chronologically through six major fields: behaviorism, psychoanalysis, cognitive psychology, social psychology, developmental psychology, and differential psychology. We’ll explore the major concepts of each field, as well as each field’s most prominent thinkers. We’ll also add historical context, criticisms and limitations of certain theories, and updated research that supports or contradicts some theories.

             The Origins of Psychology
            </h3>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Psychology is the study of human thought and behavior, as well as the mental processes that underpin them.
             </strong>
             In its infant form, psychology dealt with the concept of human consciousness
             <em>
             </em>
             before thinkers turned their attention to understanding and measuring mental processes through experimentation and behavioral observation. We’ll explore that transition in this section.

             Early Ideas About Consciousness
            </h4>
            <p>
             According to the authors, psychology’s earliest beginnings were in ancient Greece when philosophers began pondering what the mind—or the soul—was and consisted of. Plato proposed the idea that the mind and the body are separate, rather than a single entity as was previously thought.
            </p>
            <p>
             Then, in the 1600s, French philosopher René Descartes expanded on Plato’s ideas about the mind being separate from the body to theorize about how the mind
             <em>
              influences
             </em>
             the body: He suggested that the mind is immaterial (doesn’t exist in space) and resides in the pineal gland of the brain, where it consciously operates the rest of the body like a machine. Descartes defined consciousness as the ability to think about oneself and about one’s thoughts.

             <p>
              The question of whether the mind and body are separate is known as
              <a href="https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/discovery-mind-body-problem/" target="_blank">
               the mind-body problem
              </a>
              , and it continues to be a topic of debate in science and philosophy.
             </p>
             <p>
              Plato and Descartes’ belief in the separation of the mind and body is known as
              <em>
               mind-body dualism
              </em>
              . According to this theory, the body is physical and exists in spatial reality, but the mind doesn’t: You can measure the length of your arm, for instance, but you can’t measure the length of your mind.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the mind can’t be defined according to physical or spatial measures, then, the theory goes, the mind must be defined by
              <em>
               consciousness
              </em>
              . This idea contrasts with theories that the mind and body are the same and are therefore both defined by the same physical measures. In these theories, mental processes are believed to be the result of biological processes of the brain.
             </p>
             <p>
              One of the major views that contrasted with Descartes’s throughout history was the orthodox Christian view that
              <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3115289/#:~:text=Mind%20and%20Body%20Dualism%3A%20Reformatory%20and%20Confining%20Force%20in%20Medicine" target="_blank">
               the mind and body were both spiritual
              </a>
              and thus not distinct from each other. As a result, people believed that physical ailments were the result of a person or group’s misdeeds and that for a soul to go to heaven, the body couldn’t be dissected for medical or scientific purposes. Some psychologists say that by disentangling the soul from the body, Descartes helped destigmatize the practice of dissection and greatly accelerated the advancement of medical science.

               materialism
              </em>
              , which is the belief that everything that exists is material (made of physical matter) and that thought and consciousness are merely functions of the

               physical
              </em>
              brain. This view is commonly held by behaviorists and biologists, some of whom believe so strongly in a strictly physical reality that they believe the mind doesn’t actually exist at all.

             The authors explain that Descartes and earlier philosophers believed that only humans had consciousness—which would mean observing an animal’s behavior wouldn’t provide any insight into human psychology—but 19th-century German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt claimed that all living things have a consciousness, even single-celled organisms. This claim was highly influential, and most psychologists today believe many animals have some level of consciousness.

             According to the authors, Wundt’s ideas led to the study of thoughts and perception, which were only internally observable but can be reported and measured by subjects of an experiment. He also designed his experiments so they could be replicated, which would allow scientists to gather and compare much more data.
             <strong>
              These standards formed the basis of experimental psychology.

              falsifiability
             </em>
             (the ability to be proven wrong)—to be applied to psychology. Wundt’s emphasis on replicability reinforced this standard, and his focus on gathering evidence through behavior and experiences established
             <em>
              empiricism
             </em>
             (

             While previous thinkers attempted to define consciousness as a single identifiable “thing” or state, 19th-century American psychologist William James suggested that consciousness is instead a
             <em>
              process
             </em>
             , a constantly changing stream of thoughts that allows us to adapt to our circumstances by pondering our past, present, and future. He coined the term “stream of consciousness” to explain his theory.

             <a href="https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/wlf/what-stream-consciousness" target="_blank">
              a literary style

              Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and William Faulkner
             </a>
             . Stream of consciousness writing allows writers to create narratives that more closely resemble the natural human thought process in order to give readers a more personal and private glimpse into the characters’ experiences.)
            </p>
            <p>
             James further suggested that our worldviews are rooted in beliefs that we find useful (as opposed to being rooted in fact). For instance, it might be useful to someone who loves sweets to think that sugar is good for them, so they’ll adopt that belief. We constantly test these beliefs against each other and against what we learn, changing them or adjusting them to fit what we experience. If the sweet-lover reads an article about the harmful effects of sugar or develops health problems, they might be forced to alter their belief about sugar, for instance. This also describes the process of altering a hypothesis in scientific research.
            </p>
            <p>
             The authors say that James’s ideas shifted the central question of psychology from whether or not the mind and body are separate—which was unprovable—to the study of mental processes, which could be measured and tested through things like behavioral observation and memory tests. This led to the embrace of experimental psychology in America and caused some to call him “the father of psychology.”

             By the late 1800s, there were two different major approaches to psychology: behaviorism, which was more popular in America, and psychoanalysis, which was more popular in Europe. We’ll discuss behaviorism first.

             Behaviorism: Studying the Mind by Observing Behavior
            </h3>
            <p>
             The authors explain that many researchers felt that the best way to analyze the human mind was through a person’s behavior.
             <strong>
              Behaviorism is the study of why people and animals behave the way they do and how they learn.
             </strong>
             Behavior was appealing to study because it was observable and could therefore be studied in experiments. American psychologists considered it to be a more scientific approach to the field than the philosophical analysis of consciousness. Below, we’ll discuss some of the most important experiments and ideas that shaped the field of behaviorism.
            </p>
            <p>

             <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/behaviorism.html" target="_blank">

             </a>
             . Despite the view many had of behaviorism as a scientific and objective approach to psychology, some have suggested that the controlled variables and artificial environments in which such experiments take place lead to behaviors that humans wouldn’t normally perform. Others suggest that behaviorism discounts the role of emotions, motivations, and the unconscious mind.)

             Stimulus-Response Theory: Classical and Operant Conditioning
            </h4>
            <p>
             According to the authors, some of the earliest and most famous behaviorist experiments were Russian-Soviet scientist Ivan Pavlov’s experiments with dogs, which established the concept of classical conditioning, and more broadly, the stimulus-response theory.
            </p>
            <p>
             In his experiments, Pavlov measured how much dogs salivated when they were being fed. He then exposed them to a neutral stimulus—such as a ringing bell—just before offering them food and discovered that, over time, the dogs began salivating in response to the neutral stimulus. He had conditioned a response (salivation) in the dogs by pairing an unconditioned stimulus (giving the animal food) with a neutral stimulus (ringing a bell). This phenomenon was termed classical conditioning and led to the idea that
             <strong>
              behavior is learned through a creature’s interaction with its environment.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Pavlov’s experiments are well-known, but
             <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/revisiting-pavlovian-conditioning" target="_blank">
              they’re often misinterpreted
             </a>
             to mean that classical conditioning only relates to a
             <em>
              physiological
             </em>
             response to a stimulus (such as salivating). In fact, a conditioned response can also be an emotion or a preference. For example, if you have several bad experiences with public speaking, you may start to feel fear at the sight of large groups of people because of the association between that and your negative experiences.)

             Around the same time, American psychologist Edward Thorndike was studying how certain behaviors become more prominent than others depending on the results of those behaviors. Based on his experiments with cats, Thorndike proposed the Law of Effect, which states that a behavior that results in a reward is more likely to be repeated than a behavior that doesn’t. This idea formed the foundation of reinforcement learning theory—the theory that
             <strong>
              the outcome of a creature’s behavior determines how likely that creature is to repeat the behavior.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Thorndike developed his theory of the Law of Effect in part because
             <a href="https://www.studysmarter.us/explanations/psychology/developmental-psychology/the-law-of-effect/" target="_blank">
              he took issue with the idea of classical conditioning
             </a>
             as the sole means of learning. Because classical conditioning is involuntary, he felt it didn’t fully encompass the ways in which creatures could
             <em>
              actively
             </em>
             learn, so he developed a theory that could explain that type of learning.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The authors say that American psychologist B.F. Skinner’s ideas aligned more with Thorndike's than with Pavlov's. His experiments found that
             <strong>
              behaviors were more driven by the possible consequences of an action than by a stimulus preceding it.
             </strong>
             He designed an experiment in which rats were placed into a box where they could press a lever to receive food. As they learned the positive consequence (called positive reinforcement) of the lever-pressing, they altered their behavior and began pressing the lever more.
            </p>
            <p>
             In later experiments, Skinner added an electric grid to the bottom of the box, which would turn off when the rats pressed the lever. Removing a negative stimulus in response to a behavior is called negative reinforcement (this is different from punishment, which is the
             <em>
              application
             </em>
             of a negative stimulus in response to a behavior). Skinner gave the name
             <em>
              operant conditioning
             </em>
             to this phenomenon of altering behavior in response to positive or negative reinforcement, and he found that
             <strong>
              either form of reinforcement was a more effective means of shaping behavior than punishment
             </strong>

             —or external—rewards and punishments to shape behavior, but research suggests that extrinsic rewards don’t increase intrinsic motivation and may in fact decrease it. This led psychologists to develop the

              self-determination theory
             </em>
             , which suggests that the factors involved in intrinsic motivation aren’t external rewards but are instead feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.)

            </h4>
            <p>
             According to the authors,
             <strong>
              Austrian scientist Sigmund Freud pioneered the field of psychoanalysis
             </strong>
             . He established a theory that identified three dimensions of the mind: 1) the conscious, or the active operations of our minds that we’re aware of; 2) the unconscious, or the underlying mental processes that we’re not aware of; and 3) the preconscious, or the ideas and processes that we’re not actively aware of but that we can access if needed. He believed that memories that are too overwhelming for the conscious mind to handle are “repressed,” or stored away in the unconscious. The unconscious is also where contradictory beliefs and ideas reside, and the conflict between them and our reality is what causes psychological suffering, according to Freud.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: The authors don't discuss the preconscious in much detail, as Freud's main theories, particularly those dealing with psychological suffering, centered around the interplay between the conscious and unconscious dimensions.)
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              Freud devised a treatment for mental suffering called psychotherapy
             </strong>
             . This involves having many in-depth sessions in which a patient talks to a specialized therapist who acts as a mediator between the patient and their unconscious. The goal of these sessions is to retrieve the repressed memories that are causing a patient’s suffering, often through means such as dream exploration or hypnosis. Though the unconscious can’t be accessed directly, it shows itself subtly in the way the conscious operates. The psychotherapist’s job is to listen to the patient’s conscious musings and decode messages from the unconscious.

This data processing helps us make decisions quickly but may also lead to unconscious biases like racism and sexism.

            <p>
             Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and student of Freud, expanded on Freud’s ideas and explored the concept of the unconscious in a broader context. He identified similarities in the mythologies of cultures across the world and wanted to understand why those similarities existed when other aspects of the cultures were so different. He suggested that
             <strong>
              all of humanity shares a collective unconscious
             </strong>
             , which holds universal memories passed down from the earliest humans—memories that help us understand the human experience. These memories manifest themselves in the real world through mythology and symbolism. He labeled these common myths and symbols
             <em>
              archetypes
             </em>

             Carl Rogers: Person-Centered Therapy
            </h4>
            <p>
             According to the authors, another major player in the field of psychotherapy was American psychologist Carl Rogers, who pioneered a type of psychotherapy called person-centered therapy. Until around the mid-1950s, psychotherapy was largely focused on curing or treating illness, but Rogers felt it didn’t make sense to view mental health as something that could be permanently achieved, nor did he believe anyone could be mentally or psychologically defective. Instead, he believed that
             <strong>
              creating a healthy human experience is an ongoing process, the goal of which should be to grow rather than to cure.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             This involves living in the moment, allowing your experiences to form your personality—as opposed to trying to make your experiences fit your perception of your personality—and taking responsibility for your own life. In person-centered therapy, the therapist allows the patient to identify and explore their own problems rather than following the direction the therapist wants to take.
             <strong>
              Much of modern therapy still follows this model.

            </h3>
            <p>
             The authors say that after World War II, psychology’s main focus shifted from behavior and psychoanalysis to the study of mental processes like emotion and memory in what’s referred to as the “cognitive revolution.” Following the development of computer systems and artificial intelligence, some psychologists began to view the brain as an information processor, and this view—along with advances in neuroscience—gave them a model for how to study mental processes directly instead of interpreting them through behavior.
             <strong>
              This led to the field of cognitive psychology, which remains the dominant approach to psychology today.

              Some cognitive psychologists study beliefs,
             </strong>
             the authors explain. In the 1950s, Leon Festinger studied how people deal with information that clashes with their beliefs. He noticed that people whose beliefs are challenged by evidence experience an uncomfortable feeling called “cognitive dissonance.”
            </p>
            <p>
             People experiencing cognitive dissonance will seek a way to reconcile the differences between their beliefs and the contradictory evidence. Someone with an open mind may change their beliefs, but people who hold very strong beliefs are likely to distort or ignore contradictory evidence in order to protect their beliefs. This is particularly true when the person has invested a lot in their beliefs (like time, emotion, or money).

             Memory: Storing and Categorizing

             According to the authors,
             <strong>
              other cognitive psychologists studied how the brain organizes and stores memories.
             </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
             Psychologist Endel Tulving identified two types of long-term memory: episodic memory, which is memory of experiences and events, and semantic memory, which is memory of data and facts. In his experiments, Tulving demonstrated that we group pieces of semantic memory into meaningful categories to remember them better (like grouping the words “red” and “blue” into the category of “colors”). To remember experiences, however, we organize episodic memories according to the
             <em>
              circumstances
             </em>
             —such as time, location, and sensory input—under which they occurred. This is how a date or a smell might become associated with an experience in our memories.

             and Israeli psychologist Amos Tversky observed that people tend to base their decisions on anecdotal evidence rather than statistical data or probability (contrary to popular belief at the time). Their observations had major implications for decisions made by juries.

             Soon after, American psychologist Elizabeth Loftus demonstrated that

              people’s memories could be distorted or even fabricated
             </strong>
             by emotions, other experiences, or the way in which the person is asked to recall them. This became known as “false memory syndrome.” Loftus used these findings to criticize memory retrieval techniques like dream therapy and hypnosis and also to insist that eyewitness testimony is not sufficient evidence to prove a crime in court—even though jurors tend to give it more credence than any other type of evidence. Still, her findings have been adopted in a number of legal systems today.

             <strong>
              The scope of psychology broadened in the 20th century, leading to the emergence of new fields like social psychology.
             </strong>
             In the 1930s, some scientists began to study how individuals behave within groups, as well as how those groups impact the individuals within them. They also looked at relationships among individuals in groups and among groups themselves. This gave them insight into how social change occurs, humans’ tendency to conform, and the psychology behind obedience, among other things. We’ll discuss some of the most prominent ideas below.

            <h4 id="field-theory-and-social-change">
             Field Theory and Social Change
            </h4>
            <p>
             The authors say that one of the earliest figures in social psychology was German-American psychologist Kurt Lewin. He developed field theory, which focuses on how a group or individual’s psychology influences a situation. He established a model of change suggesting that anyone who wants to create change in a person or group must understand the psychological and environmental factors that influence them.
            </p>
            <p>
             For example, if a doctor’s office wanted to switch from in-office visits to remote telehealth appointments, they would need to understand many factors, including whether patients benefit from physically being in the office, whether patients and staff have the technology and knowledge needed for video visits, and whether patients can measure their own vital signs or if they need a professional to do it for them. Failing to account for any of these factors could prevent the desired change from being effectively implemented.
            </p>
            <p>
             Lewin’s model involves three steps for effecting change:
            </p>
            <p>
             1) Unfreezing, in which the people involved are made to understand that change is needed (which is difficult because people tend to be naturally resistant to change)
            </p>
            <p>
             2) Changing, in which the new system is put into place (which in groups requires strong leadership and support, and in individuals requires willingness to take on a new mindset)
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Freezing, in which the new system becomes routine

              Lewin’s model has been criticized for

              </a>
              of change, with critics saying, for example, that humans must be willing to accept the need to change and can’t be coerced into it. Since Lewin established his model, many other models have followed that do account for this human factor. Some are designed to facilitate organizational change, like

               John Kotter’s 8 Steps for Leading Change
              </a>
              . Kotter’s model involves creating a feeling that change is urgently needed (similar to unfreezing), building a large group of volunteers to lead the change, getting rid of barriers to change, and establishing the change (similar to freezing).
             </p>
             <p>
              Other models are geared toward catalyzing personal change, such as

              </a>
              . This consists of two major stages, each characterized by six elements (represented by the acronyms SCARED and SO WHAT). The SCARED stage begins with surprise at the need for change and ends with a decision to either move forward or reject the change (if you decide to reject the change, you’re likely to repeat the SCARED stage until you can make a decision to move forward).
             </p>
             <p>
              The SO WHAT stage begins with a strategy for creating the change and ends with taking ownership of the change you’ve established. Both this model and Kotter’s model are much more detailed and actionable than Lewin’s model but still draw from some of the same principles of field theory.

            <p>
             The authors note that while Lewin focused on change, other scientists like Polish-American psychologist Solomon Asch studied humans’ tendency toward conformity. He conducted an experiment called the Asch Paradigm, in which participants were placed into groups and asked to identify which of three lines on a card matched the length of a line on another card. They did a total of 18 such questions, each called a “trial.” The participants didn’t know that the other members of the group were actors instructed to give incorrect answers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Asch found that 75% of participants conformed to the group’s incorrect answers on at least one trial but that none of them conformed on every trial. He also found that 26% of participants never conformed and always gave the right answer despite the group’s dissent, suggesting that certain people are less prone to conformity than others. Additionally, he found that if just one of the actors provided a correct answer, the actual subjects were much more likely to also provide the correct answer—this suggests that if even a small minority diverges from the group, it makes others much less likely to conform as well.

             </p>
             <p>
              Some researchers have also distinguished between different types of conformity. For instance,
              <em>
               informational conformity
              </em>
              occurs when the conformist believes others have more information and are thus better equipped to make decisions about how to behave. However, the type of conformity revealed by Asch’s Paradigm is called
              <em>
               normative conformity
              </em>
              , and it occurs when the conformist agrees with the group even though they know the group is wrong. People often engage in normative conformity in order to show cohesiveness or avoid conflict, but it can have dangerous consequences when it leads individuals to look the other way when they know other members of their group are doing things that are wrong.

             According to the authors, one of the leading questions that arose in social psychology after World War II was the question of how ordinary people could be convinced to carry out acts of extreme cruelty, as occurred during the Holocaust. In 1971, American psychologist Phillip Zimbardo conducted further research into conformity and what prompts people to behave cruelly with his famous Stanford Prison experiment. For this experiment, Zimbardo placed 24 male college students who were deemed mentally healthy into a fake prison scenario. The students were randomly assigned the role of either prisoner or guard, and the guards were given total control over the prisoners.
            </p>
            <p>
             All of the guards quickly began abusing their authority and mistreating the prisoners, and conditions grew so bad that the experiment had to be ended early after less than a week. Zimbardo’s experiment suggests that people will adjust their behavior to fit social roles that they’re assigned, and that even ordinary, mentally healthy people will behave cruelly when given positions of total authority.

              Due to the ethical issues that arose, Zimbardo’s experiment had to be cut short early and couldn’t be replicated, leading to questions of how representative Zimbardo’s sample population was. One commonality the participants shared was that they elected to sign up for a study based on life in prison as opposed to a more general psychological study.

            <p>
             <strong>
              1) The sensorimotor stage (birth to age 2).
             </strong>
             Children use their senses and physical actions to learn about their environment, and they’re unable to understand perspectives other than their own.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              2) The pre-operational stage (ages 2-7).
             </strong>
             Children begin to understand things like symbols and language.
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              3) The concrete operational stage.

             Children gain the ability to think logically about physical objects.

             Learning Through Social Interaction and Modeling
            </h4>
            <p>
             The authors explain that later researchers adapted and expanded on Piaget’s initial ideas. While Piaget believed that children learn mostly through interaction with their environment, Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky felt that learning was more dependent on social interaction. He also developed the theory of the zone of proximal development, which is the idea that children need help from an adult or older child to learn how to do certain things. The zone of proximal development is the area of learning that’s accessible to a student with such assistance (as opposed to what the learner can do without assistance or what they can’t do even with assistance), and
             <strong>
              this theory prompted a greater emphasis on cooperative learning in the education system.

            <p>
             (Shortform note: Vygotsky’s theory of learning and the zone of proximal development have led to an emphasis on

              the practice of scaffolding in education
             </a>
             . Educators scaffold by providing activities to children that are challenging but within their capabilities, while controlling the factors that are beyond the child’s capabilities. This type of teaching has to be highly individualized and requires a deep knowledge of a child’s abilities and cognitive level. It also requires a large time commitment for planning, which can

            </p>
            <p>
             Canadian-American psychologist Albert Bandura was also interested in how children learn, particularly how they pick up behaviors such as aggression, which he felt couldn’t be adequately explained by behaviorist theories like operant conditioning. He believed that
             <strong>
              humans learn behavior by watching others and mimicking their actions
             </strong>
             , an idea known as the social learning theory (in contrast to reinforcement theory in behaviorism, which suggests that they learn from rewards and punishments).

              Subsequent experiments that Bandura carried out
             </a>
             demonstrated that punishment may play a role in how likely someone is to mimic a behavior they’ve seen modeled: When children saw someone behaving aggressively and then being punished for it, they were less likely to imitate the behavior. However, if someone
             <em>
              asked them
             </em>
             to mimic the behavior, they did, suggesting that they had learned the behavior, but seeing someone punished for it taught them that they shouldn’t engage in that behavior.)

             Differential Psychology: The Study of Human Differences
            </h3>
            <p>
             The field of differential psychology, which arose in the 20th century, examines differences in people’s personalities and intelligences. This has led to modern day IQ and personality tests, trait theory, and research into personality disorders. We’ll discuss some of the most prominent figures and concepts below.

             Differences in Intelligence
            </h4>
            <p>
             In the late 1800s, German scientist Wilhelm Wundt theorized that
             <strong>
              all living creatures have a “mental life,” which includes intelligence.
             </strong>
             The authors explain that he formed the idea of an intelligence quotient (IQ), which led him and other scientists to seek to measure a creature’s intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later, in the 1890s and early 1900s, French psychologist Alfred Binet observed that it was only possible to measure someone’s mental abilities in a specific time and context, and that these abilities could change over time, meaning
             <strong>
              intelligence was not fixed at any particular level
             </strong>
             . Binet and fellow scientist Théodore Simon devised a set of IQ tests called the Binet-Simon Scale to assess a child’s abilities based on the abilities of other children of the same age.
            </p>
            <p>
             While the Binet-Simon Scale was originally intended to provide accommodations for children with disabilities, later scientists co-opted the test and used it instead to identify children who were considered genetically inferior (despite Binet’s insistence that intelligence was not hereditary or fixed) or to identify students who would be suited only for menial work as adults. Still, the Binet-Simon Scale continues to be used for most modern IQ tests.

             </p>
             <p>
              The idea that a person’s intelligence can be measured with a single IQ score is considered by some to be inherently flawed. Wundt acknowledged that any
              <a href="https://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Paper/Cole/iq.html" target="_blank">
               assessment of intelligence would vary
              </a>
              depending on a person’s culture, and because he felt it was impossible to fully account for these differences, he believed there was no way to study intelligence in a laboratory setting—which, in experimental psychology, suggested it couldn’t be studied at all.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some modern critics of intelligence tests note that the

               tests’ validity seems to vary
              </a>
              with the age of the subjects and assert that they’re poor predictors of academic and intellectual performance in people in early adulthood onward. They also suggest that classifying children in schools based on their intelligence creates a self-fulfilling prophecy in which “gifted” students are given more enriching and challenging experiences that aren’t offered to their peers, leading to an even wider achievement gap between the two groups.
             </p>

              Also, particularly in the mid-20th century, some took the misuse of the Binet-Simon Scale to

             Decades later, when differential psychology emerged as its own distinct field, other scientists continued to refine ideas of intelligence. In the 1960s, American psychologist J.P. Guilford suggested that the Binet-Simon Scale was flawed because it couldn’t measure creativity, which he considered an essential part of intelligence and mental ability.
             <strong>
              He identified two types of thinking
             </strong>
             : convergent thinking, which encompasses things like memory and solving simple problems (and which could be measured by IQ tests), and divergent thinking, which refers to creative problem-solving. Guilford designed tests to assess divergent thinking.

              Other scientists studying differential psychology focused on differences in personality

             , the authors explain. American psychologist Gordon Allport, one of the pioneering researchers in personality theory, identified 4,500 adjectives that could describe personality traits. Analyzing these further, he identified three different types of traits: cardinal traits, which are essential to a person and shape how they live their lives; common traits, which develop from influences from others and help shape our behavior; and secondary traits, which are dependent on context and can be changed.
             <strong>
              His work led other researchers to develop personality tests that heavily influenced the ones we still use today.

              Allport’s theory has been criticized

             for a lack of supporting empirical evidence. Some critics say trait theory isn’t an accurate way of predicting behavior because Allport’s conclusions were based largely on observations and generalizations, and the traits he identified weren’t always consistent in the behavior of people who had them. Some critics also suggest that the theory’s focus on the present means it offers no explanation for personality development and how traits change over time and that it doesn’t account for the ways in which certain traits can be present in different degrees in some people.)
