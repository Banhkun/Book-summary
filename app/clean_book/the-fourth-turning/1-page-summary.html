             The Four Turnings
            </h3>
            <p>
             Like a single phase of a human life, a Turning lasts around 15-25 years. A single cycle of these four Turnings is called a saeculum. Turnings aren’t characterized by the events that occur during them, but rather by society’s reactions to those events. According to the authors, a First Turning is a High, a Second Turning is an Awakening, a Third Turning is an Unraveling, and a Fourth Turning is a Crisis. The saeculum theory is based on a cyclical view of time—the idea that the same themes and types of events recur and will continue to recur throughout history—as opposed to the chaotic theory, which views time as a series of random and unrelated events, or the linear theory, which views time as a non-recurring progression with a definite start and end.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: Other writers have proposed
             <a href="https://forge.medium.com/theories-of-time-95783b12323a" target="_blank">
              a fourth theory of time known as the spiral theory
             </a>
             . This combines the cyclical theory with the linear theory. It suggests that, while themes and events do recur throughout history, we can also learn and improve as time goes on and shift the spiral up—or we can continue to make bad choices and shift the spiral down. In the spiral theory, “turnings” and “saecula” don’t exist because there’s a greater focus on change than on recurrence. Like the cyclical theory, the spiral theory shows that we can better handle upcoming changes if we’re aware of them and prepare for them, but it also grants us the agency to improve ourselves and society in the long term.)
            </p>
            <p>
             The actions of a society can’t stop the cycle, but we can prepare for each Turning by studying previous cycles and the effects they had on society. We can then ease transitions by shifting our activities based on the Turning we’re currently in and anticipating the next one. On an individual scale, this means preparing in advance for the financial and cultural challenges the next Turning might pose. On a societal scale, this means governments should anticipate the shifts in public sentiment and alter their programs and agendas to suit them.

             The First Turning: A High
            </h4>
            <p>
             According to the authors, a High occurs after a period of great turmoil is resolved. During a High, a new social order is put in place. Government is strong and active, and public services are expanded. New institutions like schools are established and infrastructure is strengthened. Public trust in these institutions is strong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Values like individualism fall out of fashion and are replaced by more collective values. This includes an emphasis on self-sacrifice and duty for the greater good of the community, as well as a strong expectation for conformity. Income inequality and unemployment fall and productivity increases. Class inequality also falls, but gender gaps increase as society’s values begin to reflect a strict division between masculine and feminine roles. Children are given greater autonomy and parents become less protective.

             The Second Turning: An Awakening
            </h4>
            <p>
             The authors describe the Second Turning as an Awakening. An Awakening occurs when people pull away from the social order imposed during the High, resulting in a cultural revolution. People question and defy the institutions and regulations established during the High as the need for them falls out of living memory. The establishments from the High now seem stifling and inequitable, and people reject them to seek out spiritual fulfillment.
            </p>
            <p>
             People also reject collective values and the ideals of duty and conformity in favor of individual rights. Government weakens and free markets begin to overshadow public services. Violence and crime increase, as do income inequality and class divisions. Gender divisions become less strict, and child-rearing becomes more lenient and laissez-faire. Risk-taking becomes more common.

             The Third Turning: An Unraveling
            </h4>
            <p>
             The authors describe the Third Turning as an Unraveling. An Unraveling occurs when society embraces the new order put in place during the Awakening. Trust in government and establishments continues to decline, and people become more passionate about and extreme in their beliefs. Communities become divided over morals and unified action becomes more difficult. People begin to feel like they’re hurtling toward a catastrophe.
            </p>
            <p>
             People become tribal or nationalistic and suspicious of anything that doesn’t fit their values. Individualism is at its highest, government power stagnates, and free markets become even more favored. Violence, crime, and income inequality reach their peak. Gender divisions are even less strict and society becomes more protective of children.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: The sense of impending cataclysm during an Unraveling may help explain the psychology behind the extremism that grows in this period. Research suggests that when we perceive potential risks,

              we’re compelled to seek safety among groups
             </a>
             , and these groups are often ideological in nature. The greater our sense of danger, the more closely we adhere to such group ideologies, and the stronger and more polarized our beliefs become. During an Unraveling, these perceived dangers would be exacerbated by increased crime and inequality, further eroding trust in large organizations and cementing trust in tribal groups.)

             The Fourth Turning: A Crisis
            </h4>
            <p>
             A Crisis occurs when a catalyst—a major event or series of events that creates a mood shift—occurs and ignites a significant change in society. According to the authors, major events can happen in any Turning, but only after an Unraveling do they create a society-wide crisis because the anxious, pessimistic, and pre-cataclysmic mood of the Unraveling primes people to respond in a way that creates a societal upheaval.
            </p>
            <p>
             These events are the culmination of threats that the nation saw coming but failed to properly prepare for, which creates a panic about the nation’s ability to handle such events. In response to this panic, people begin to unite as communities to establish a new social order that demands collective sacrifice to resolve the nation’s problems. The government is appointed to implement and enforce this social order, usually with mixed results. Still, people are willing to endure the government’s missteps—even catastrophic ones—for the sake of decisive action, which can give inordinate power to poor leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
             Violence, crime, and income inequality decrease as the Turning progresses. Gender divisions increase again as women and the elderly are expected to leave the workforce to make room for young men. Protectiveness over children is at its highest.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eventually, the Crisis peaks and the social order is at its strongest. Though violence at the public level is low, the risk of national violence such as revolution, civil war, and foreign war increases. Leaders characterize foreign enemies and political opponents as immoral and refuse to compromise, and the use of highly deadly or destructive weaponry increases for the sake of decisive victories in war.
            </p>
            <p>
             As a result of the Crisis, society is unrecognizably transformed, for better or worse. The resolution of the Crisis cements the new social order and results in an end to wars and conflicts via treaties, the punishment of the “losers,” and the renewal of public life.

            </h3>
            <p>
             According to the authors, each generation in society fits into one of four different archetypes: the Prophet generation, the Nomad generation, the Hero generation, and the Artist generation. Archetypes help characterize the generations and explain why they behave in certain ways during each Turning. The birth range of a generation is about 15-25 years—approximately the same length as a Turning—and the pattern proceeds almost universally in this order. Those born on the cusps of generational divides can be sorted based on the generation they most identify with—for example, the Boomer generation spanned from approximately 1943 to 1960, but someone born in 1961 might identify with the Boomer generation, while someone born in 1959 might identify with Generation X.

Additionally, schools have become more and more dominant in children’s lives, and the idea of a pedagogical method of child-rearing has spread from schools into the home. This causes parents to feel they need to constantly monitor their children rather than trusting them to play and grow freely.)

              than Strauss and Howe’s theory may suggest. While it’s easier to study culture in midlife and elder generations because their traits are more fixed, much of social change is prompted by young people, and cultural change is generally more rapid in groups that include both younger and older individuals.

              </a>
              , which may be due to factors like less free time and less stable housing for younger generations. Younger people are also underrepresented in political office, and research suggests that

               financial barriers play a large role in preventing younger people from running

The median age of Members of Congress has increased by more than seven years over the last three decades, from around 53 to over 60, and around 25% of Congresspeople are now over 70. Additionally, the 2020 presidential election resulted in the election of the nation’s oldest president in history—Joe Biden at age 78.

             <li>
              Prophets are born during a High. In childhood, Prophets are coddled, and they grow into self-centered rebels who seek societal change. They are judgmental in midlife but can provide wise judgment in their elder years.
             </li>
             <li>
              Nomads are born during an Awakening. In childhood, Nomads are loosely parented or neglected. They feel estranged and are stigmatized in young adulthood, but they become sensible mid-lifers who provide practical leadership, and they’re hardy and reliable in elderhood.
             </li>
             <li>
              Heroes are born during an Unraveling. In childhood, Heroes are heavily protected. They have a strong sense of teamwork, duty, and self-sacrifice in young adulthood, but grow arrogant in midlife. As elders, they find the values they fought for under attack by the Prophet young adults.
             </li>
             <li>
              Artists are born during a Crisis. In childhood, Artists are overprotected. In young adulthood, they’re thoughtful and deferential. They make for ambivalent midlife leaders and compassionate elders.

             <p>
              The Artist generation represents a rebirth story arc.

             The authors published this book in 1997, at which point they explained that the US was nearing the end of a Third Turning. America’s current saeculum began in 1946, just after World War II (America’s most recent Crisis), which is where we’ll start.

            <p>
             The First Turning of our current saeculum lasted from 1946 to 1964, explain the authors. With the Crisis of the war over, the G.I. generation returned from war with renewed optimism and a sense of collective purpose. They were welcomed back home as brave champions and began forming secure, prosperous families.

             (Shortform note: The success of the American High depended largely on the Allies’ victory in World War II. Critics before the war cautioned that a

             </a>
             , a loss would have resulted in the complete extermination of Jewish people and large-scale support of Nazis in America. In either case, it would be difficult to term the resulting era a “High” for the general population.)

            <p>
             During this Turning, the elder Lost (Nomad) generation was leading with the wisdom built by living through two world wars and the Great Depression. They willingly and self-sacrificially paid high taxes to support the younger generations. The (Hero) G.I.s in midlife built their nation to its greatest point in history so far. The young adult Silent (Artist) generation married early and avoided risk, working mostly to help the older and younger generations in their efforts rather than pursuing a generational cause of their own.

              Research shows that greater financial stability results in earlier and more common family-building and child-rearing, which explains the huge rise in birth rates that resulted in the Baby Boomer generation (the offspring of the financially successful G.I. and Silent generations). However, today’s experts point out that Millennials are on track to be the

             During the American High, trust in government and institutions was high, and governing power was strong and had plentiful resources to implement social change. Income inequality dropped and the middle class flourished. As families grew, their need for housing increased as well, leading to the mass building of suburbs. However, beneath the upbeat mood of the High, racism and sexism brewed, materialism was rampant, and nonconformity was stigmatized.

             The Awakening that followed the American High lasted from 1964 to 1984, and the authors termed it the Consciousness Revolution. According to the authors, its beginning was sparked by the assassination of John F. Kennedy at the end of 1963, which shook the nation and incited new social movements rebelling against the now well-established government and social institutions from the High.

             Confidence in the nation’s G.I.-built institutions—such as government regulation and spending, labor unions, and corporations—began to waver.

             Boomer Prophets entered young adulthood with no memory of the wartime plights that necessitated these systems. Hero G.I.s (now elders) watched on as the Boomers rebelled against what they had built. Simultaneously, Boomers and the Silent Artist generation (young adults and midlifers) were raising Nomad Xennial children with hands-off parenting styles and little supervision, as the normalization of no-fault divorce led to the highest divorce rates the nation had ever seen.

             Violence spread, both in the public eye with the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and on a smaller scale with protests against government and institutional overreach. The Vietnam War further eroded public faith in leadership, not only because it lacked the moral righteousness of World War II, but also because the young Boomer generation rejected the idea that duty to the country outweighed individual rights. As with the moon landing, people felt that the resources spent on this endeavor would be better applied on the homefront for ending poverty and social and racial inequality.

             The clash between social movements and American materialism led to economic conflict in the 1970s. Environmentalist movements called for a reduction in energy consumption and construction, which led to a decrease in economic supply while demand for goods stayed the same. Inflation from fluctuating oil prices added to this economic crisis and resulted in a stagnation of wages that America still hadn’t recovered from by the time of this book’s publishing in 1997.

             . In the early 1970s, the Fed lowered interest rates in an attempt to bring the country out of the recession of the 1960s. While these policies succeeded in that goal, some argue that they flooded the economy with too much money,

            <p>
             The focus on the individual created a culture of self-centeredness that rejected the idea of duty to one’s nation. At the beginning of the Awakening, young people’s focus on individual rights related mostly to civil rights and issues of culture. However, as the Turning came to a close, individualist sentiment spread to the realm of politics and economics. Conservatives embraced this new ideology and capitalized on the country’s newfound fierce individualism to reignite the Republican party, electing Ronald Reagan, whose first term brought the end of the Awakening.

             The Culture Wars: A Third Turning

            <p>
             The Culture Wars following the Consciousness Revolution began in 1984 and were still ongoing at the time of this book’s publication in 1997. The authors roughly estimated that it would last through 2005 but acknowledged that it could end a few years earlier or later. During this time, the new system of individualistic values established during the Awakening had become part of mainstream culture.

             The elder Silent Artist generation led ineffectually and indecisively during this time.Though this was the era when they should have been dominating the highest leadership roles, they failed to produce a single president during this Turning, a generational anomaly that had never happened before in U.S. history. They instead took on helper roles as White House staff and congresspeople, but the authors note that their generation of leaders has become notorious for working diligently but getting very little done. They explain that, compared to the G.I. leaders in the 1960s, the Silent leaders in the 1980s had twice as many hearings and four times the staff, but only one-third as many laws passed.
            </p>

Biden hasn’t been immune to these accusations, as critics have pointed to a lack of action on his part to stop

             Meanwhile, Boomer Prophets entered midlife as judgmental leaders heavily fixated on black-and-white values that they were unwilling to compromise on. Xennial Nomads came into adulthood feeling alienated and ignored and with a fragmented generational identity.

             Trust in the government reached its lowest point in the saeculum, but polls showed a high level of individual self-esteem. People began dividing into groups based on shared interests or characteristics such as gender, race, class, and religion, which led to discord between groups and a lack of unifying public sentiment. Each group saw themselves as victims of their opposing group, and paranoia fed these beliefs. Distrust grew between social groups of every kind.
            </p>
            <p>
             The three main cultural “wars” during this time were over inclusivity and diversity, religion, and free market economics. Citizens, politicians, and the media all chose sides and stuck to them staunchly. Individuals on both sides of these conflicts viewed the other side with vitriol and deemed them stupid or evil. Voters became more polarized, with polls during the 1994 election showing a greater ideological divide than the nation had ever seen, and the number of independents and nonvoters grew. Politicians and political ads became brutally hostile.

             Predictions About the Crisis
            </h3>
            <p>
             The authors predicted that the Fourth Turning—a Crisis—would begin within the first few years of the 21st century, around 2005. Because the catalysts for a Fourth Turning are always foreseeable based on the trends that are established during the Unraveling, the authors make a handful of predictions about what the next catalyst might look like:
            </p>
            <p>
             <strong>
              A terrorist attack by a foreign group purporting to have nuclear weapons
             </strong>
             , leading the US to declare war and begin searching people’s homes. Suspicions that the president fabricated the event would lead to a nationwide strike and the loss of foreign capital.
            </p>
            <p>
             (Shortform note: This prediction bears a striking resemblance to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. As the authors suggest in the book, there were some warnings of this attack in advance, including a memo sent to the FBI by Special Agent Kenneth Williams in July of 2001
             <a href="https://fortune.com/2011/10/12/fbis-phoenix-memo-unmasked/" target="_blank">
              warning of a potential terrorist plot by Osama Bin Laden
             </a>
             . The memo was not acted upon, and experts have suggested that it could have been used to mitigate or prevent the September 11 attack if it had been dealt with properly. However, Neil Howe has noted that
             <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9EmSI12raQ" target="_blank">

             The authors note that these exact scenarios are unlikely and that whatever does happen, the nation will be able to mitigate it before it becomes truly devastating. However, it will arise from some problem that the country had failed to deal with soon enough, which will spark outraged calls to action.

            </h4>
            <p>
             As a result of the catalyst, the authors predicted that people would lose all faith in the government, struggle financially and begin to panic about their future, and that a recession or depression may occur. People will have to form a new social order, peacefully or otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
             One political party will achieve a decisive win early in the Crisis and will maintain its power throughout the Turning. Its leaders will exaggerate and deliberately exacerbate the country’s problems to accelerate change and enact a more and more extreme agenda.
            </p>
            <p>
             At the beginning of the Turning, income inequality will stop growing. Toward its end, the economy will begin to recover and may become stronger than ever. It will be more unionized and more independent from the global economy. The public will again trust the nation’s institutions and demand that they restrict choices by standardizing certain options in goods and services and by establishing a single dominant political party to relieve people of the onus of having to choose.
            </p>
            <p>
             The rights of certain groups will come under attack by powerful organizations. Criminal justice will become increasingly harsh, and the harming of innocent people will become acceptable collateral damage for protection against those considered dangerous to society.

               What the Authors Got Right—And Wrong
              </strong>
             </p>
             <p>
              Several of the authors’ predictions about the unfolding of the Fourth Turning haven’t yet come true. In contrast to their prediction about a single party maintaining dominance throughout the Crisis,
              <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/United-States-Presidential-Election-Results-1788863" target="_blank">
               America saw Republican Donald Trump win
              </a>
              after two terms from Democrat Barack Obama, and then another Democrat win in 2020 with Joe Biden.
             </p>
             <p>
              Additionally,

               income inequality has not slowed
              </a>
              but has instead continued to grow. In 2021, the wealthiest 10% of Americans held more than two-thirds of the nation’s wealth, while the bottom 50% held just 2.5% of the wealth.

               Union membership has also fallen
              </a>
              even though research suggests that public support for unions is nearly the highest it’s ever been.

              However, as the authors predicted, attacks on the rights of certain groups have increased in the past few years. In June 2022,
              <a href="https://www.american.edu/cas/news/roe-v-wade-overturned-what-it-means-whats-next.cfm#:~:text=On%20Friday%2C%20June%2024%2C%202022,or%20outright%20ban%20abortion%20rights." target="_blank">
               the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade

              , which guaranteed people the right to abortion.

               Hundreds of bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights have been introduced

             Through some combination of larger conflicts, the nation’s issues will coalesce into one large problem that forms the climax of the Crisis. People will unify around this problem, setting aside differences for the purpose of healing the nation and putting it on track for a new rebirth in the upcoming High. Whether the results of the Crisis’s resolution are positive or negative, the nation will be unrecognizable from what it was at the beginning of the Crisis.

             (Shortform note: A possible downside of recognizing the pattern Strauss and Howe describe is that people and leaders may be tempted
