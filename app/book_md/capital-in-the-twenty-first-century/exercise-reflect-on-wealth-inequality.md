## Exercise: Reflect on Wealth Inequality

In _Capital in the Twenty-First Century_ , Thomas Piketty warns that rising inequality threatens to transform the character of our society, entrench a permanent elite based on inherited wealth, and undermine democratic institutions. Use these questions to reflect on Piketty’s central claims.

* * *

Do you think wealth inequality poses a threat to the stability of our society? Why or why not?

Do you think the wealthy generally earn their fortunes through hard work and talent, or do you think the rules of the economic game are rigged in their favor? Explain your answer.

Do you think a global wealth tax, Piketty’s proposed solution to inequality, is a workable idea? What might be some of the pitfalls of this proposal?

Do you think inherited wealth is unjust because it exacerbates inequality, or do you think that people have the basic right to pass down their wealth to their heirs without limit? Explain your answer.
