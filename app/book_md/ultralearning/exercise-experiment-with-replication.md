## Exercise: Experiment With Replication

Reflect on the 1st avenue of experimentation, “Replicate.”

* * *

Think about your chosen topic or skill. What’s one method from others who have mastered your topic or skill?

Select one method and spend 20 minutes practicing it. How did practicing that method impact your understanding of the topic or skill?

Select a second method and spend another 20 minutes practicing. How did the practice impact your learning? Did it have a different effect than the previous method? If yes, how so? If not, what is something valuable you can take away from the experience?
