## Exercise: Learn How to Learn

This exercise is an opportunity to think about a potential learning project and explore the questions “why,” “what,” and “how?”

* * *

What is a skill or topic you would like to learn?

Why do you want to learn this topic or skill? Is your motivation intrinsic or instrumental? How so?

What do you need to learn in order to master your skill or topic? Make a list below of your facts, concepts, and procedures.

Review your lists. What are the areas you expect to have the most difficulty in?

Consider the benchmarking method. Who has already learned and mastered your skill or topic? What are some methods these people have used to learn? Which methods resonate with you?
