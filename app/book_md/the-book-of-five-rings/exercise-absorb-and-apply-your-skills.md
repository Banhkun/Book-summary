## Exercise: “Absorb” and Apply Your Skills

Musashi emphasizes the importance of _absorbing_ information and technical know-how so that it will become second nature. In this exercise, you’ll consider what knowledge or skills you’ve already absorbed, and how you could absorb a new skill.

* * *

Recall a motor or intellectual skill you have developed to a high degree. Write down the skill below.

What steps did you take to “absorb” it so that you could draw upon it automatically when needed? Write down three steps or strategies you used.

What is a new skill you would like to learn within the next six months? Write it down below.

List three steps or strategies you will use to aid you in “absorbing” your new skill (e.g. a set practice routine, resources you could use, and so on.)
