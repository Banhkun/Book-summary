## Exercise: Achieve a Goal Using Musashi’s Way

Musashi advises developing the appropriate knowledge, using the right tools, and being flexible and committed. Let’s take a step-by-step approach to putting Musashi’s principles into practice.

* * *

Choose a goal you would like to achieve during the next three months, either personally or professionally. Write down what your goal is, and why you’d like to achieve it.

List the knowledge or advice you might need to achieve your goal. How could you gain this knowledge or advice—reading an article, doing market research, meeting with a mentor?

List three to five tools or resources that will help you achieve your goal. For each tool/resource, define what it is and how you can best apply it.

Since flexibility and commitment are important in achieving a goal, write down several challenges or obstacles that you may have to overcome to achieve your goal (e.g. lack of time, minimal support, etc). Name two or three things you can do to minimize these challenges and stay focused on your goal.
