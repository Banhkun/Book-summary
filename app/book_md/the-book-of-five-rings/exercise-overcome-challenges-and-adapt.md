## Exercise: Overcome Challenges and Adapt

Throughout the Fire Book, Musashi focuses on how adaptability helps a warrior succeed in any form of combat. In this exercise, you will reflect on a challenge you overcame in the past and how to develop your own adaptability.

* * *

Think of a challenge you faced, either personally or professionally, within the last 12 months. Describe the challenge.

List at least three tools or strategies you used to overcome this challenge and explain how you applied them.

Which of the seven qualities of adaptability do you struggle with the most (flexibility, curiosity; focusing on opportunities; working well with others; emotional intelligence; being proactive; positivity)? How did you wrestle with this quality within the last six months?

Now list several things you could do within the next three months to make yourself more adaptable. How will you put them into practice?
