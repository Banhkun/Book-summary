## Exercise: Make a Checklist

Checklists should be short, clear, and contain the “killer” steps (the ones with the greatest consequences if you miss them) as well as routine steps you might miss. Create a checklist to increase the effectiveness of your routines at work or at home.

* * *

Think of a task that you or others perform at home or at work that is error-prone (if you like, you can use the example you chose for one of the previous exercises). Describe what a checklist for this task would look like — define the task, determine the pause points or logical breaks in the workflow, and the steps to be taken after each pause.

Draft the checklist, and have someone else walk through it. How did it work? What improvements were needed?

How can you implement the checklist? If you need buy-in from others, how can you get it?
