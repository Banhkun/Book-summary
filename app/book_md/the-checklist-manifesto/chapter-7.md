## Chapter 7: WHO Tests a Checklist

With information from Boorman on how to create an effective checklist, Gawande and his team created and began testing a Surgical Safety Checklist for WHO.

They chose a Do-Confirm approach to give people greater flexibility in performing their tasks, but had them stop at key points to confirm they hadn’t missed any steps. When researchers tested the checklist in a simulated surgery, they realized they hadn’t designated who was supposed to pause things and launch the checklist. They decided to have the circulating nurse call the pause rather than the surgeon, to send the message that everyone is responsible for the overall well-being of the patient in surgery.

They had a team in London try the checklist, then one in Hong Kong, and continued to improve it. The final WHO checklist listed 19 checks with three pause points and it took two minutes to go through. The checks were divided as follows:

  * Before anesthesia: seven steps, such as checking patient consent, medication allergies, and availability of replacement blood.
  * After anesthesia and before making the incision: seven more checks, including making sure team members have been introduced by name and role and have discussed aspects of the operation.
  * Before the patient leaves the OR: five checks, including an accounting of all surgical equipment and a review of plans for the patient’s recovery.



Next was a pilot study of the Safe Surgery Checklist in eight hospitals around the world.

The researchers chose a diversity of hospitals, rich and poor, because failures can happen anywhere.

To establish a baseline, they collected data on current complications and death rates at the test sites. Of 4,000 patients, 400 had developed major complications from surgery and 56 died.

About half the complications involved infection, and a quarter involved failures that required a return to the OR to fix something or stop bleeding. Complication rates ranged from 6 to 21 percent, which indicated room for improvement everywhere.

They began implementing the checklist in the pilot hospitals in spring 2008. To help get buy-in, they provided each hospital with its failure data to show what the list was trying to address. They presented the checklist as a tool for people to try in hopes of improving their results.

Use of the checklist was well underway within a month and they began hearing encouraging stories. For instance:

  * In London, the before-incision part of checklist caught a wrong-size prosthetic knee about to be used as a replacement.
  * In India, surgical staff discovered a flaw in their system: they were giving the antibiotic too soon. Frequent delays in the operating schedule meant it had worn off by the time surgery started, so they changed their system.
  * In Seattle, they caught problems with antibiotics, equipment, and overlooked medical issues. They also found that going through the list helped the staff respond better if an unexpected problem came up — they worked better as a team.



### Three-Month Results

The results after just three months exceeded researchers’ hopes and expectations:

  * Rates of major complications for surgical patients in all eight hospitals fell by 36 percent. Deaths fell 47 percent.
  * Infections fell by almost half.
  * The number of patients having to return to the OR because of problems fell by a quarter.



Overall, in the group of nearly 4,000 patients, 435 would have been expected to develop serious complications based on the baseline observation data. Instead just 277 did. **Using the checklist had spared more than 150 people from harm and 27 of them from death.**

Every hospital in the study saw a substantial reduction in complications. Seven of the eight hospitals experienced a double-digit drop. Because of their significance, the results were published by the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2009 as a rapid-release article.

Results had already begun to leak out prior to publication, and hospitals in Washington state had begun using Seattle’s checklist. The hospitals formed a coalition with Boeing (a major employer), the state’s insurers, and the governor to introduce the checklist across the state and track data.

In Great Britain, the chairman of surgery at St. Mary’s Hospital, which was part of the study, became the country’s minister of health and helped launch a campaign to implement the checklist nationwide.

Some surgeons objected that the study had not clearly established how the checklist was producing the results (the decline in complications from surgery). For instance, while the hospitals made improvements in procedures such as giving antibiotics and making sure they were doing the right procedure, the improvements didn’t explain why unrelated complications, like bleeding, fell.

**Researchers suggested the results were due to improved communication.** In spot surveys, surgical staff reported a significant increase in the level of communication. There also was a correlation between teamwork scores and results for patients — the more that teamwork improved, the more patient complications declined.

After using the checklist for three months, more than 250 staff members filled out an anonymous survey. Among the results:

  * 80 percent said the checklist was easy to use, didn’t take long, and improved care.
  * 78 percent said they saw the checklist prevent an error.
  * 93 percent agreed that if they were having an operation, they’d want the checklist to be used.
