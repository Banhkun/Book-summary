## Exercise: Select a Script Style

Anderson has three script styles that he recommends (and one that he doesn’t). Think about which one works best for you.

* * *

Which script style are you drawn to (Scripted and memorized, scripted and read, unscripted but planned out, or unscripted with no plan)? Why?

How does this differ from script styles you’ve used in the past?

Were your previous methods successful or unsuccessful? Why?

What are three ways that you can prepare or rehearse this new script style?
