## Chapter 18: Junta Tactics in Iraq

In the last chapters, we discussed how the US brought a new type of privatized, outsourced military and government to Iraq. In this chapter, we’ll see how that occupying force was completely incapable of doing its job—and how, as a result of that fact, the US fell back on the old tactics of the South American juntas.

### Giving Up On Democracy

Those behind the invasion and “reconstruction” of Iraq had been banking on the Iraqis being too shocked to resist. The people of Iraq were supposed to meekly go along as they were dragged into an idealized free-market society. Then one day those Iraqis would come out of their trances, and realize with pleasant surprise that their country was a modern paradise. As we’ve already seen, that wasn’t how events played out.

The first summer of Iraq’s occupation saw people enjoying free speech on a level that would have been impossible under Saddam Hussein’s rule. They gathered every day for rallies and protests, news and opinions traveled freely, and even religious clerics turned to talking about politics during sermons.

However, the Iraqis used their free speech to harshly criticize Bremer, voice their outrage about the country’s soaring unemployment, and demand a voice in governing their own lives. This put the Bush administration in an awkward position, as they’d previously promised to involve Iraqis in decision-making and to hand over power to a new government within months. It was now clear that any such new government would immediately undo all of Bremer’s work and give Iraq back to the Iraqis.

**The US solution to this dilemma was to abandon any pretense of democracy.** Instead of creating a large assembly from all areas of Iraqi society as previously promised, Bremer instead decided that he’d handpick a small Iraqi Governing Council to run affairs.

Bremer’s next problem was the fact that local elections were cropping up in cities and towns all over Iraq. He ordered that all such elections stop; local leaders were to be chosen by the occupying forces, not by the Iraqi people. In those places where elections had already happened, the newly elected councils were disbanded.

#### Renewed Violence in Iraq

Many people stationed in Iraq during these months say that there’s a clear link between Bremer’s efforts to suppress democracy and the increase in Iraqi resistance. For example, shortly after Bremer appointed his Governing Council, terrorists attacked both the Jordanian mission and the UN’s local headquarters in Baghdad.

It seems likely that even Bremer himself knew that his policies would spark violence. In 2001, long before he took charge of operations in Iraq, Bremer warned US firms that they were at increased risk of terrorist attacks due to rising unemployment and income inequality—results of the same free-market system that had made them rich.

Even so, Iraqis were still expecting the US to organize national elections and peacefully hand over power once to whoever won the majority vote. However, in late 2003, Bremer announced that no general elections were to be held—Iraq’s new government would be appointed, rather than elected.

That was the last straw for many Iraqis. Shia Muslims were particularly outraged—they were the largest ethnic group in the country, and had been almost guaranteed to dominate the new government after decades of brutal repression under Hussein.

The Shia responded to Bremer’s latest announcement with massive protests. High-ranking clerics compared Bremer to Hussein and argued that the US was merely replacing one dictatorship with another. When those peaceful measures failed, **many more Shia became convinced that they’d have to fight for the democracy they’d been promised.**

### Shock Tactics Come Full-Circle

Many of the US’s problems in Iraq were due to then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld running the military like a CEO trying to whittle down the payroll. After various negotiations and cuts, US generals only got about a third of the troops they’d requested for the Iraq invasion. That pared-down invasion force was able to overthrow Hussein, but it didn’t have a chance of stabilizing the country.

To make matters worse, Bremer’s policies had left the occupying force with an angry, rebellious population and no local police or military to keep the people in check. It was clear that Shock and Awe had failed, and economic shock was failing.

**Therefore, to protect their perfect model of capitalism, US forces turned to a more personal type of shock.** They began using the same tactics seen in the Southern Cone three decades earlier: kidnapping, imprisonment, and torture. In fact, private security companies operating in Iraq brought in experts from previous shock experiments in other countries.

At the advice of those experts, US forces snatched an estimated 61,500 “terrorists” and “subversives” out of their homes or off of the streets. The prisoners were handed to CIA agents, soldiers, or private contractors for interrogation.

Iraqi death squads and propaganda worked hard to keep the people in line. The bodies of tortured civilians were commonly left on the sides of roads as warnings. The LA Times reported that the Baghdad morgue received a weekly delivery of dozens of bodies, many of whom were still in police handcuffs. Furthermore, a popular program on the US-funded Al Iraqiya network featured prisoners—who had clearly been tortured—confessing to their “crimes.” Those confessions included crimes that lawyers proved had never happened.

When these abuses came to light, many of the prisoners were released without charges or apologies—they were simply pushed out of trucks and told that they’d been arrested by mistake. However, those “mistakes” tended to come out of prison angry about how they’d been treated, and willing to do anything for revenge. **That’s why one former prisoner called the prisons breeding grounds for resistance fighters.**

### The Elusive Blank Slate

The goal of shock therapy has always been to reduce the subject (whether a person, an economy, or an entire country) to a blank slate. People believed that by forcibly stripping away the layers of the psyche, they could reach some core essence, and build an entirely new version of the subject on that core.

However, a colleague of Dr. Cameron—the pioneer of medical shock treatment—observed that there _was_ no core. In his words, “...the layers are all there is.” After blasting through those layers with shock therapy, they weren’t left with clean, programmable patients; all they had were confused and broken people.

Similarly, shock therapists in Iraq sought to strip away all the layers of culture, industry, and self-determination. Their goal was to erase an entire country and find the blank slate underneath it. Instead, they only found piles of rubble and millions of broken people.

The problems got worse, rather than better, after each round of treatment. However, instead of concluding that their premise was flawed, the architects of the Iraq war decided that they’d simply been too soft—in medical terms, the dosage had been too low.

For example, former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage insisted that the Shock and Awe campaign had led to victory _too_ quickly. His analysis was that the Iraqis hadn’t had time to become exhausted by a prolonged war, and so the US was left with an Iraqi people who were neither shocked nor awed.

As late as January 2007, the Bush administration still believed that they were just one good shock treatment away from controlling Iraq. The new theory was that by wiping out resistance leader Moqtada al-Sadr and his forces, they could take control of the country in a single “surge.”

However, by April 2007, Iraq was still falling apart around them. Like with Dr. Cameron’s patients, no amount of shock treatment could cause the reset the US forces hoped for. **Instead, the country just became more and more broken.**

#### Iraq’s Failure Was Foreigners’ Success

On the surface, it seemed like every part of the plan to convert Iraq into a perfect capitalist utopia had failed. In addition to the horrors we’ve already discussed, **hiring foreign companies and contractors simply hadn’t worked.**

However, while those facts might seem like nails in the coffin for Chicago School capitalism, the truth was quite the opposite: What had been a resounding failure for Iraq and its people was an incredible success for the disaster capitalism complex. Every aspect of war and reconstruction had been privatized and outsourced during the Iraq invasion, meaning that corporations were profiting every step of the way. For many wealthy investors, times had never been better.

Therefore, far from giving up on its privatized model of warfare,**the Bush administration took steps to make it a permanent part of foreign policy.** For example, the State Department founded a new branch, the Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization. The Office pays contractors to create plans for rebuilding countries all around that world that might, for whatever reason, find themselves the next target of a US invasion. It also has prearranged contracts with many different corporations and consultants, so that they’ll be ready to leap into action at a moment’s notice.

(Shortform note: The Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization existed until 2011, several years after _The Shock Doctrine_ was published. In 2011 it was replaced by the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations.)

The inspector general for Iraq’s reconstruction issued a 2006 report concluding that the disastrous outcomes in Iraq had simply been the result of poor planning. The report called for the creation of a standing army of reconstruction contractors that would function much like the military reserve, and further entrench the disaster capitalism complex. Bush applauded that idea in his 2007 State of the Union address.

In short,**rather than a model free-market utopia, Iraq became a model of privatized destruction and reconstruction** —and that model became export-ready very quickly. Through the efforts of the Bush administration, the disaster capitalism complex is now ready to open up a new frontier wherever a catastrophe strikes—or wherever it can create a catastrophe.
