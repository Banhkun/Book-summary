## Chapter 9: The Struggle for Self-Determination

As we’ve seen, **free-market economies are difficult to create because most people simply don’t want them.** This struggle between average people who want stability and peace, and free-market capitalists who want unrestricted trade and immense profits, is the central conflict of the Chicago School’s agenda.

In this chapter, we’ll examine that struggle as it played out in Poland, where the newly-elected Solidarity party was caught between the demands of the people and immense economic pressure from the IMF and the World Bank. We’ll also briefly look at a similar struggle in China, which only ended when the ruling party massacred protestors in Tiananmen Square.

### Poland’s Regime Change

**Poland also fell victim to the IMF’s bait-and-switch tactics when the newly-elected Solidarity party had to implement harsh neoliberal policies in exchange for foreign aid** —policies that went directly against the worker-centric economy they’d promised to create.

In 1980, Poland was chafing under the control of communist Russia. Tensions came to a head when the Communist Party raised the price of meat. In response, Polish workers formed a powerful union which they called Solidarity.

Led by a charismatic electrician named Lech Walesa, the leaders of Solidarity demanded freedom from the overbearing Communist Party, and the right to instate their own democracy. Furthermore, Solidarity had the numbers to make that happen. The union was over ten million strong—large enough to hold a strike that would bring the entire country to a halt.

In 1989 the Communist Party officially recognized Solidarity. Party leaders agreed to hold special elections, pitting their own party members against the union for control of Poland. Solidarity won in a landslide.

However, like the new democracies in the Southern Cone, **Solidarity inherited as many problems as they overthrew:** Poland was $40 billion in debt, inflation had risen to 600%, and food was running short. Rather than striving for the worker-centric economy they’d dreamed of, they had the much more immediate concern of avoiding total economic collapse. They needed immediate debt relief and financial aid.

**Solidarity turned to the IMF for help, which by this point was firmly controlled by Chicago School economists.** Those economists didn’t see a country that had struck a heavy blow against the communist regime that the US so hated—they only saw another place reeling from debt and inflation, caught in the throes of a sudden regime change. In other words, another perfect target for shock therapy.

Meanwhile, the US government congratulated Solidarity on its decisive victory against the Communist party, but still insisted that the Polish people would still have to pay the debts they had inherited from their former oppressors. The US only donated a pittance in aid—$119 million, when the country needed billions.

#### Sachs Arrives in Poland

While Poland was being denied aid on all fronts, Jeffrey Sachs began working as an advisor for Solidarity. After what he’d done in Bolivia—which the rest of the world only knew about through carefully sanitized reports—Poland saw him as nothing short of a messiah.

**Sachs’s plan was standard Chicago School neoliberalism:** Getting rid of price controls, cutting subsidies, privatizing the state-owned mines, factories, and shipyards, and opening the borders for free trade. It was even more extreme shock therapy than what he’d subjected Bolivia to, but Sachs claimed that making these changes immediately, and all at once, would quickly rein in inflation.

Even more enticing than economic stability, Sachs promised that Poland would quickly become a “normal” European country. That is, it would become a country that the world viewed in the same way that it viewed Germany or France: successful and influential, worthy of attention.

Some members of Solidarity, including Lech Walesa, protested that these measures were the exact opposite of the social-democratic platform they’d run on, and they warned that his proposed shock therapy would only worsen conditions in the country. But others, who were desperate for a solution—any solution—pushed for the party to accept Sachs’s offer. **After several months of political paralysis, the party went with Sachs’s proposal.** They simply needed the money he was offering, and they needed it immediately.

The Polish prime minister went before the people to announce sweeping changes: the privatization of state-owned industries, a newly formed stock exchange, and a new currency, among others. These changes were to happen immediately, and all at once. In return, Sachs negotiated with the IMF to get Poland some debt relief and $1 billion to stabilize the economy.

#### The Free Market Takes the Credit

Solidarity’s sudden course change was deeply unpopular. Three years after they swept the elections, 60% of Poland’s citizens still opposed the privatization of state industry. Many felt that they’d been betrayed by the party they’d fought so hard to elect.

As had happened over and over in the Southern Cone,**the sudden spending cuts and deregulation led to a depression.** Unemployment—which had been effectively zero under communism—skyrocketed to 25%, and remained as high as 20% even after the economy started recovering from the sudden changes.

Sachs, addressing the people’s anger, claimed that he and Solidarity had had no choice. He compared himself to a doctor performing emergency heart surgery, unable to worry about the messy scar tissue he’d leave behind. For the first 18 months or so, the Poles gritted their teeth and endured the hardship. Solidarity and Sachs assured them that it was temporary, and the people believed them. However, as the economy and standard of living failed to recover, the people’s anger—and Solidarity’s confusion—grew. How could it be, the party wondered, that this promised miracle cure had made things worse than they’d been under Moscow’s rule?

The people made their displeasure known with nationwide strikes and protests, forcing the government to slow down its privatization plans. At the end of 1993, four years after Solidarity had taken the reins and instituted economic shock therapy, 62% of Poland’s industry was still owned by the state. Once Solidarity scaled back the shock therapy, Poland’s economy began to rebound.

Solidarity was soundly defeated in the 1993 elections by a coalition of left-wing parties—including the communists who had previously run the country. The coalition took 66% of the seats in Congress that year, while Solidarity won only 5%. **The people had clearly and firmly rejected shock therapy.**

In spite of all of that, Poland is still held up as a shining example of how free-market capitalism can revitalize a struggling country. The economic gains that the Polish people won by protecting their state-controlled industry are somehow credited to the very shock therapy that they fought against. Meanwhile, all of the inconvenient facts surrounding that shock therapy—the protests, Solidarity’s backpedaling on policy, and their resounding defeat in the next election—get swept under the rug.

### Extraordinary Politics

1980s Poland was a perfect example of what some people called “extraordinary politics”: times of crisis when the normal rules and strategies didn’t apply. The bargain his party struck with Sachs was the exact opposite of what they’d promised the people. **However, because it was a time of extraordinary politics, Solidarity was able to flout the normal democratic processes and push through the shock therapy package.** The approval of the people wasn’t needed—and, equally importantly, the people were too beaten down, confused, and scared to fight back.

Shortly after, it seemed like a great deal of the world was in periods of extraordinary politics. Around 100 countries experienced dramatic shifts in politics and economics within the span of just a few years.

The Soviet Union was quickly losing its grasp on the eastern part of the world, and many hoped that, now that the world wasn’t locked in a fight between superpowers, countries would be free to explore and find new methods of governance—perhaps the hybrid capitalist/communist model that Walesa dreamed of.

The fundamentalist Chicago School, naturally, scorned such ideas. Francis Fukuyama, a Chicago School follower and senior member of the US State Department, declared that free-market capitalism had won—and, moreover, that communism’s defeat was proof that capitalist theories were right and just.

Much as the World Bank and IMF had hidden Friedman’s shock therapy inside their relief packages, Fukuyama was hiding free-market capitalism inside the wave of democracy sweeping over Europe and Asia. He spoke of people demanding the right to govern themselves and said that such rights went hand in hand with true economic freedom—that is, a free market.

**However, while Fukuyama was right that growing numbers of people all over the world believed in democracy, he was wrong that those same people wanted to lose their economic protections and their jobs.** Instead, people wanted both self-governance and the ability to choose their own economic models.

### The Tiananmen Square Massacre

One country that swiftly discredited Fukuyama’s theories was China. A key point Fukuyama made, echoing Friedman before him, was that democratic reforms and free-market reforms were intrinsically linked—you couldn’t have one without the other.

However, China was pushing for Chicago-esque deregulation of wages and prices, but fiercely resisting demands for elections and expanded civil rights. Meanwhile, massive crowds of protestors were fighting for democracy, and against the government’s attempts to remove protections and controls.

China’s leader, Deng Xiaoping, was desperate to avoid what had happened in Poland: He didn’t want China’s workers to create their own movement that could threaten the party’s absolute control. He therefore created a “People’s Armed Police,” consisting of about 400,000 members, to patrol the streets and crush any strikes or protests they could find.

Deng began making free-market reforms in 1983. By 1988, it was becoming increasingly clear to the people that Deng’s so-called “reforms” just attempted to enrich a small group of elites at the expense of the rest of the country. He started facing such severe backlash that the government had to roll back some of those changes.

With public opinion swiftly turning against him, Deng called in Milton Friedman himself for help and advice. Friedman spoke to many different audiences in Shanghai and Beijing, spreading the message that capitalism was better than communism. However, despite his fame and charisma, Friedman couldn’t win the people back to Deng’s side. In the months following his visit, the protests only grew larger and more radical.

Tiananmen Square was the site of some of the largest demonstrations. It’s commonly believed that the Tiananmen Square protesters were students fighting for democracy and against communism, but historians are now challenging that story.

For example, Wang Hui, who helped to organize the Tiananmen protests and is now a respected member of China’s so-called “New Left,” wrote his own perspective on the events. In his book _China’s New Order_ , Hui says that it wasn’t only idealistic young students who gathered in the square. There were factory workers, teachers, and even some small-time entrepreneurs there as well. Furthermore, he explains that they weren’t fighting against communism; **they were fighting Deng’s reforms and the undemocratic way he’d forced them onto the people.**

On May 20, 1989, the Chinese government declared martial law. Two weeks later, on June 3, came the infamous Tiananmen Square massacre; soldiers freely beat and shot protesters, while tanks rolled straight over the crowds.

After that, Deng scoured the country in a Pinochet-like campaign to round up, imprison, and execute his political opponents. Western media covered the horrific events as an example of communist brutality, but**Deng made it clear that it was capitalism—not communism—that he was protecting so viciously.**

Following the massacre, Deng’s reforms only increased in speed and scope. This economic reshaping of China led directly to how it’s viewed today: a source of cheap labor for much of the world.
