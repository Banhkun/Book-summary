## Chapters 20-21: Discrimination After a Disaster

In these chapters, we discuss what Naomi Klein terms _disaster apartheid_ : The unequal treatment that marginalized people receive after a disaster. The chapter begins with a personal anecdote from Naomi Klein about the discrimination she saw in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit. We’ll then move onto a discussion of the prejudice and injustice that Palestinians face in Israel. **Finally, we’ll see how both of these topics link back to disaster capitalism.**

### Apartheid in New Orleans

In September 2005, just a few weeks after the hurricane had hit, Klein was involved in a serious car crash in New Orleans, and an ambulance rushed her to the hospital. She’d seen the terrible conditions at the underfunded, understaffed clinics that had sprung up to help people after the hurricane, and she assumed the ambulance was taking her someplace like that. Instead, she woke up in Ochsner Hospital, a sleek and modern facility where she received immediate, comprehensive care.

The people who worked there, from doctors to security officers, counted themselves lucky that they hadn’t had to deal with the worst damages from Hurricane Katrina. One medical intern thanked God that he hadn’t been on duty when the storm hit—when Klein asked if he’d gone to one of the shelters to help, he replied that it hadn’t occurred to him. Then, when she asked whether he thought Charity Hospital (which treated poor, mostly African-American people) would reopen, the intern replied that he hoped so; they couldn’t treat “those people” at this hospital.

**That spa-like hospital, and the people who worked there, were embodiments of disaster apartheid.** The intern Klein spoke to hadn’t even considered that he could help the poor, uninsured people of New Orleans—they simply didn’t register as potential patients.

#### A Test of Faith for the Free Market

When Katrina hit, the whole world got to see the sharp divide between the patients of Ochsner Hospital and Charity Hospital. Those who had the means simply left town, went to hotels, and started making arrangements with their insurance companies. Meanwhile, the poorest residents of New Orleans were left behind to drown.

It was a shocking revelation for many people. Even those who understood the inequalities that people faced in day-to-day life had thought that major disasters would be exceptions to the rules of capitalism—that the state would step up and help those who’d been hit the hardest. The response to Katrina proved that that was not the case.

FEMA had previously paid private contractors $1 million to make comprehensive plans for just such a storm. **However, when the time came for the government to put those plans into effect, the coffers were suddenly empty.** The response to Katrina was so weak that aid struggled to even reach the New Orleans Superdome—where some 23,000 people were stranded with no food or water, and where media from all over the world had already been for days.

As in Iraq, the US government proved to be an empty shell that couldn’t—or wouldn’t—fulfill its obligations.

For a few weeks, it seemed that Hurricane Katrina might create a crisis of faith for neoliberalism. People got to see all of the consequences of Chicago School economics condensed into a single place and time, and it had a dramatic effect on some of them. Many influential free marketeers recanted their beliefs in the wake of Katrina, saying that the horrific failures in New Orleans had shown them that free-market capitalism wasn’t the perfect system they’d thought it was.

#### Just Another Opportunity

However, for those in the vanguard of the Chicago School’s crusade—namely the Heritage Foundation, the Bush administration, and Milton Friedman himself—Katrina was merely another chance to push their agenda.

The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank, drafted a list of proposals for responding to the hurricane and promoting the free market at the same time. These proposals were classic economic shock therapy disguised as hurricane relief. At the top of the list were suspending wage laws, lowering taxes, and relaxing regulations across the affected area. **President Bush officially announced those policies within the week.**

Within weeks the Gulf Coast was run by a contractor-driven government that closely resembled Iraq’s CPA. Many of the same companies were involved: Halliburton, Blackwater, Parsons, and so on. All told, the Bush administration handed out $3.4 billion in contracts, with no bidding necessary.

**The results also resembled those in Iraq—which is to say that work was slow, expensive, and jealously guarded.** For example, the company Kenyon had a contract to clear out dead bodies from buildings and streets. Corpses were left out in the sun for days at a time, many of the bodies may have been improperly labeled, and victims of Katrina were being discovered in attics almost a year later.

Another similarity between New Orleans and Iraq was the contractors’ reluctance to hire local people. Instead, the citizens were expected to sit back and watch as company executives got rich from their tax dollars.

All told, the Bush administration increased contractor spending by about $200 billion from 2000 to 2006. To offset this bloated budget, it slashed $40 billion from the budget—which included student loans, food stamps, and Medicaid. **In short, Bush’s hollow government fleeced the country’s poorest citizens to fund massive corporate handouts.**

### Israeli Apartheid Leads to Economic Boom

**Whereas the people of New Orleans suffered from a short-term form of disaster apartheid, Israel has been experiencing it for years;** Palestinians are treated as second-class citizens in what used to be their homeland, when they’re allowed in at all. Understandably, there’s a great deal of tension—and violence—between Israel and its neighboring countries. As a result, a large part of Israel’s economy is based on homeland security; **the country now profits off of the very attacks that seek to tear it down.**

This apartheid began when huge numbers of Palestinians had their property taken away in order to create the country of Israel. Many were forced to leave the country entirely, and settle in the surrounding lands. While there were some token efforts to restore the people’s rights and redress their grievances, Palestinian leaders rejected those deals because they didn’t do nearly enough for the people who were suffering the most.

Due to the ongoing political and economic tensions, Israel has been locked in an endless war with its neighbors and subject to near-constant terrorist attacks—yet, even so, the country’s economy is booming.

This is because Israeli firms were developing a homeland security industry years before the US or Europe recognized that industry’s potential. Demand for security is high in such an unstable political climate, so business is always booming for security contractors. As a result, while many individual people (both Palestinians and Israelis) are suffering from the ongoing violence, the Israeli economy has never been stronger.

### The Davos Dilemma

**Israel provides a prime example of an apparent contradiction in modern economics.** For many years, people believed that stability and peace were necessary for steady economic growth. While it was true that individual shocks were opportunities to force open new markets, the common understanding was that ongoing chaos was bad for the global economy.

However, the 2007 World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland, was puzzled by a global trend that seemed to buck this common knowledge. The world had been rocked by a near-constant series of shocks, beginning with the stock market crash after 2000 and the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Despite that, the global economy was growing at an incredible rate.

This discovery is also evident in the so-called “guns-to-caviar index.” This index compares the yearly sales of fighter jets (guns) and executive jets (caviar). For nearly two decades there was an inverse relationship between the two—that is, when sales of one type of jet went up, sales of the other went down. However, since the Iraq invasion of 2003, sales have increased quickly and steadily for both fighter jets and executive jets.

The logical conclusion is that the economy no longer relies on stability—quite the opposite, in fact. **Corporate profits all over the world are actually _increasing_ in the face of sustained conflict and repeated disasters. **

This changing trend correlates directly with the shift from a narrowly focused military-industrial complex to the massive, multipurpose disaster capitalism complex of the 2000s. With massive contracts going out to private firms in every industry from fuel to construction—and, of course, security and defense—it makes sense that the worse things get, the more the stock market grows.

Many people see the connection between disaster and profit, even if they don’t fully understand the mechanics behind it. This tends to lead to a lot of conspiracy theories; people believe that global elites intentionally cause disasters in order to make money.

The truth, though, is that there’s no need for massive global conspiracies. **An economic system that demands growth and rejects regulations will create near-constant disasters without any outside help.** It causes wars over resources, economic collapses as market bubbles burst, and natural disasters as people keep burning cheap, dirty fuels.

Furthermore, the companies that profit the most from this system relentlessly pump out propaganda to make sure people believe it’s the only viable option. They push the narrative that the world is a dark and scary place, and the endless string of disasters is a necessary evil because any alternative (socialism, Islamism, or whatever the -ism of the week is) would be worse.

However, the people who spread that propaganda aren’t afraid. The economic system that they thrive on is in no danger from any of these supposed threats. **In fact, the only things that scare the disaster capitalism complex are global stability and peace.**
