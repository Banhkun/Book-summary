## Exercise: Keep Your Opinions to Yourself

Many of us believe we know what’s best for the people in our lives, and some of us extend that belief to people we don’t know. What makes us feel this way, and how can we learn to keep our opinions to ourselves?

* * *

Think of the last time you gave someone advice on what they should do with their life. Who was it, and what was the advice?

Why did you feel compelled to advise them? What did you fear would happen if this person didn’t take your advice?

What are two positive characteristics of this person and what they’re capable of?

How can you reshape your advice from an opinion to a statement that might help this person see who they are and still find a positive way forward?
