## Exercise: Overcome Your Fears

There are things we want in life but are too afraid to ask for, and there are things we want to do but are too afraid to try. If we want to grow and reach our potential, we need to stop being afraid.

* * *

What is one thing you want to do but believe you canâ€™t? What fears keep you from trying?

Are you someone who takes risks? If yes, what risks have you taken? If no, why not?

What are you most afraid of in your life? How does that fear keep you from moving forward?

What can you do to overcome that fear so you can become the person you want to be?
