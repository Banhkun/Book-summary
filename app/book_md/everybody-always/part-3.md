## Part 3: Personal and Spiritual Growth

You like to play it safe most of the time. It’s natural to feel more comfortable making moves when you have all the answers you think you need to move forward safely. You want assurances that things will work out before you take a leap. But recognize that the leap you finally take is not a leap of faith. There’s a difference between staying safe and being safe. **When you lack faith and only do what is comfortable, you don’t grow.** You stay where you are as the same person. God wants you to learn and grow under His love, and the only way to do that is to have faith in His love.

God doesn’t give you uncertainty and hardships because He enjoys watching you struggle. He does this because He knows overcoming obstacles is the only way for you to learn about yourself and move forward to a better place.**Becoming love means understanding that discomfort and struggle are God’s way of helping you grow in your faith.** He wants you to be brave. He wants you to realize that you are the embodiment of His love, and as such, you can take risks and manage fear because you know it brings you closer to Him.

### Don’t Wait for Green Lights

Think of your faith like the green lights that let a pilot know his landing gear is locked and ready. Bob learned this lesson the hard way one night while piloting a plane from Palm Springs to his hometown near San Diego. He played it very safe on the way there, intentionally flying 2,000 miles above the highest obstruction on the route to make sure he cleared it and stayed alive. He did the same thing on the way home, assuming these precautions would be enough to avoid any accidents.

When he was back home and ready to land, he flipped on the landing gear. But instead of seeing three green lights, one for each back wheel and the one nose wheel, he saw two—just the lights for the back wheels. He radioed to the tower for help, but there was nothing they could do. It was late at night, and they couldn’t tell whether the nose wheel was down or not.

Bob panicked. The options for avoiding danger were slim to none, and the two options he had—land without nose gear or keep flying—didn’t carry positive outcomes. He didn’t know what to do, and he realized much of life was like that moment. You can make all sorts of plans to make sure you are safe, but **what you expect to happen often doesn’t turn out the way you wanted. These are the moments when your faith is put to the test.**

You often wait for those green lights in life. Those green lights tell you that everything is okay and it’s safe to move forward. Maybe you want something negative in your life to stop and something better to come in. So you do what you feel you need to do to make that happen and feel good about the outcome. But what happens when all your plans blow out the window and all your preparation didn’t lead to the desired result? What if one of your lights doesn’t come on? You likely panic and start circling the environment looking for another solution.

What you don’t realize is that your green lights are already turned on. Your life and faith are the only green lights you need to move forward. **When you become fixed on one path or one solution, you thwart God’s larger plan for you.** His plan is not ruined because yours is. His plan is working exactly as He wants it to work. He gave you the ability to ask questions and have hopes and desires, but He also gave you fortitude, courage, and strength. He helps you discover those by forcing you to adapt in the moment.

You can’t predict the outcome of all your actions. You can expect a certain result, but you shouldn’t put your energy into waiting for that result to happen. Put your energy into what you know is already true and the answers you already have. When you have true faith, you know that God loves you and wants you to succeed. You can see everything that happens as part of his plan and put your weight behind that. If you can do that, you don’t need to wait for the right time to act or move forward. **The right time is now because God may not bring about the same lesson twice, and if you miss your chance to learn that lesson, you’ve missed a chance to grow.**

You don’t need as many green lights as you think you do. Make yourself vulnerable to life. Be okay with doubts and be honest about them. God doesn’t care how assured you pretend to be. He cares about what you’re doing to become love, and admitting doubt and fear are part of that process. Take a true leap of faith so God can lead you to the place you’re meant to land.

Bob took that leap that night at the airport. He didn’t have as many green lights as he wanted, but he had faith in God and approached the landing strip as slowly as he could. He angled the plane so the back wheels would touch first and the nose would follow. Either the front of the plane would crash and blow apart or he’d bounce on the one wheel. He eased the back wheels down, and the nose bounced a second later. Turns out, the green light for the nose gear was burned out. His wheel had been down the whole time.

**If you wait for confirmation before acting in life, you’re letting a cheap burned out bulb stop you from your destiny.** Don’t let your expectations stymie your growth. Put the plane on the ground full of faith in God’s love and guidance.

### What You Can’t See Is More Important Than What You _Can_ See

When you look down the road of your life, you probably only see a few steps ahead at a time. You use the information gathered from this short distance to guide your actions. You move ahead again until it’s time to stop and peer farther down until you see the next set of steps. When you move through life in this measured way, you’re not living with faith, which means you’re not becoming love. **Real faith gives you the strength to follow the road of your life blindly.**

One of Bob’s friends is a blind track star named Lex, who is a para-Olympian and World Champion in the long jump. It might seem impossible for a blind person to compete in the long jump, which requires seeing the end of the track and the platform from which to launch your body through the air. But Lex has a partner he trusts who points him in the right direction. The partner then calls to Lex from next to the sandpit so he knows when to jump. This blind trust allows Lex to compete at the highest levels and succeed.

Jesus is like Lex’s partner. He points you in the right direction and asks you to trust Him as you move forward. That trust is the epitome of faith. **Jesus wants you to run toward His voice at the edge of your life with all your strength, believing that you will know when to jump and will land safely.** But this task is not always easy. You hear many voices that have an opinion about who you are and where you’re headed. Some of those voices are negative. They say you’ll never accomplish what you want to do or don’t have the abilities needed. They’ll make you fear failing, and when you do fail, they’ll show you why you should never try again.

You must learn to parse through these voices and find Jesus’s voice. His voice is the only one you need to listen to. Along your journey to live as God, you will wander from the path and become afraid. You will stop moving or find that your steps are smaller than before. You may trip and fall for no discernible reason. These things _will_ happen, but it’s okay when they do. Making it down the path correctly and in record time is not what God delights in. He is happiest when He sees you taking steps, even small ones, and when you pick yourself up when things haven’t gone as you hoped. **His voice will not leave you if you stray from the path, and if you listen for it, Jesus will guide you back to where you belong.**

Sometimes, Jesus’s voice will come in the form of a friend, like Lex’s partner. God sends you people you can trust to help guide your life. But it can be hard to recognize those people if you’re not honest about what you’re seeing and not seeing. Take the example from the Bible about a blind man who was healed by Jesus. Jesus touched him once and asked what the man saw. The man, risking insult to Jesus’s healing powers, said he saw people who looked like trees walking around. Jesus touched him again, and the man’s full vision was restored so he could see the world as it actually was.

When you become love, you are working with that second touch. The trick is you have to be honest about what you see and don’t see after that first touch. Your first encounter with a person may not be great. Maybe you don’t understand their perspective on life or their attitude and actions. But if you are honest about your confusion or differences, you can have a second encounter that helps you see their worldview more clearly or at least better understand it. From this place, you can give them love, and trust is formed.

**Pay attention to the people you meet and wait for that second touch.** **This person might be the trusted voice God sent to help you grow and move farther down the road.**

### Who Are You?

If someone asked you who you were, would you know how to answer? Would you answer honestly or let your pride call the shots? Many of us like to pretend we’re different than we actually are. And many of us do this when we express our faith and relationship with God.

**You know you’ve lost your way with God when having a certain kind of faith becomes more important than the faith itself.** God is always trying to guide you in the direction that leads to your authentic self. He provides circumstances that allow you to see where you are with Him and what that says about who you’re becoming or need to become. But when you fake your relationship with God, you close the door to His guiding light.

The problem is your words express a certain image that your actions don’t live up to. You pretend to be _with_ God, but your ego is really driving your behavior. You’re not becoming the person God wants you to be. You’re not becoming love. To truly be with God, you need to be honest about where you are in your faith and who you are in the moment. You have an open invitation from God to swap out your former self and become the person He knows you to be. Your new identity is always waiting for you, but you must become love if you want to achieve it.

When you are truly becoming love, you know that the most important way to be with God is by showing love to others, even people who are difficult to love. You stop moving through the world believing that you are the center of it. You stop forcing your opinions on others and give them grace and compassion instead. You stop merely seeing what someone else is going through and start being _with_ them in their pain. Becoming love is the only way to truly know who you are because **when you start to love others freely, you become aligned with your true identity—a representation of God’s love**.

This is what God wants from you. As you start the work of bringing others into your grace, God provides you with more grace to give. You’ve been granted the opportunity to live in this world and become love. Everything that happens in your life is a chance God has granted you to become your true self. You don’t need to waste time wondering who you are or arguing with others about your differences. You just need to open your arms, and God will show you who you are and where you need to go.

### Focus on What You Have, Not What You Don’t

God doesn’t care about the things you don’t have. He doesn’t grant you only a sliver of His love if you don’t have much to offer Him. He wants you to use what you have to feel all His love and use it in your life.

You likely get bogged down about what is missing from your life. You allow these believed deficiencies to define you and keep you from seeing what else is possible. But **when you focus on what you don’t have, you lead your life down the wrong path**. The body follows the head, and when you turn your head away from God’s love, you walk away from your faith.

Bob shares the story of Karl, a young man who lost all movement in his arms and legs in high school after a diving accident. Karl went from being an athletic young man full of mischief and hope to someone who only had use of his eyes, mind, and tongue. He was given a special chair to operate using a straw and was sent out into the world to learn how to live in his new body.

Karl didn’t let his paralysis keep him from making something of his life. He understood what he had to work with and offered it up to God with love. What he received was more love and guidance for his path forward. Karl and Bob graduated from law school together. Karl went on to work for the California attorney general’s office. He argued and won five cases in front of the California Supreme Court and made great strides in changing laws that affected millions.

Karl’s journey represents someone who refused to be limited by what they no longer had. He had no choice but to look inside himself and offer up what he could to God. He had faith that God would help him make something with what he still had, and He did.

Many of us have the use of our arms and legs and could use them to help other people, but we don’t. We have the gift of sight and can see people suffering around us, but we watch from a distance, rather than jumping into action to make a difference. We can intellectually understand pain and hardship, but we don’t act on that understanding, only empathize with others’ pain and hardships. **We’re not limited in our abilities. We’re limited by how we choose to use them.**

Like Karl, we need to remove the limitations from our psyches and use our minds to see the possibilities in ourselves and others. Remove doubts and distractions. Forget about what others think and your desire for approval.

People who become love still suffer hardships, just like you. But when you become love, you stop seeing setbacks as limitations. You stop focusing on what went wrong or is missing and stop defining yourself by those things. Instead, you **put your faith in God’s plan for you to become who you are meant to be and offer up what you do have to receive grace and guidance**. You don’t need arms and legs to become love. You just need to turn your head toward love, and your life will follow.

### You Don’t Need to Hear God to Know He’s There

You likely have specific questions you want answers to, and when you ask God those questions, you wait for an answer. But you can’t hear God’s voice, and maybe you believe that means He isn’t listening. Chances are you aren’t really waiting for God’s literal voice, but rather instructions or a boost of confidence to be able to feel good about what you’re doing. But God is already confident that you know what to do. His silence or lack of “signs” does not signify his indifference or lack of love for you. He knows you will grow more in your faith and life if you try to find courage on your own.

**While you’ve been waiting for God to speak, He's been waiting for you to act.** When God is silent, He is still communicating with you. Your faith lets you understand that His silence means you have everything you need and know everything you need to know to follow your path. But to understand the power of this silence, you also need to be silent. Clear your head of doubts, distractions, and external noise, and in the beautiful quiet, you will find God.

All of your successes and failures have not been random. God doesn’t expect you to do everything perfectly. Becoming love doesn’t mean loving everyone the right way all the time. God’s delight is in your commitment to His love and attempts to live within it. The manners in which you either fail or succeed are your lessons. What you learn from those experiences help you grow and bring you closer to your faith. Your life up to this point has prepared you for everything there is to come, and **when God is silent, He’s watching from above, sending you his grace without interference because He believes you’ve got this**.

When you become love, you understand God’s belief in you, and it gives you strength. You recognize that you don’t need as much guidance as you think you do. All any of us really need is someone who believes in us. Hopefully, you have other people God has sent to your life that know you as well as He does and trust you to find your own way through life. You may not always understand what’s happening to you, but when you’re surrounded by the trust of others, you can trust in yourself to figure out what to do and do it.

You are not unique in your desire to approach life with caution or fear. And you are not the only one who doesn’t understand God’s plan for you at all times. But when you become love, you understand that God has given you compassion, love, and patience with yourself and others. You can take the trust God has in you and turn that into belief in another. When you become love, you always know the way forward because it is bathed in God’s love.

Look around your life. What are you afraid to do? What have you always wanted to try but didn’t know how? Who are you hiding from or wish you could connect with? Who has wronged you or broken your heart? Where is your compassion needed? Who needs someone to believe in them? **Believe that God has given you everything you need to live your authentic life, and carry that trust forward as you give love to everyone you know and don’t know.** You already have the power of God in you. He’s waiting for you to use it.
