## Part 4: How You Love Is What Matters

When you get to heaven, rumor has it you’ll have a conversation with Jesus. Through this conversation, you’ll hear about the things you didn’t understand while you were alive. You’ll learn about the many ways Jesus came into your life, and your entire perspective of how you’ve lived will change. **The most surprising thing you’ll learn are the many forms Jesus took and how many times you actually met Him.**

In anticipation of this conversation, you likely have a list of accomplishments you want to tout. You’ll talk about all of the good things you did for certain people, and you’ll hope it was enough. But what you’ll find out is that all people are Jesus. Everyone you meet is Jesus, so if you truly want to love Jesus, you must love everyone like you would Him.

But there is more to it than that. Loving easy people is easy. Jesus intentionally puts people in the world that challenge your beliefs or safety or time. How you treat those people is the real measure of how well you love God. **The people who are needy, poor, in jail, living less than moral lives, holding differing opinions, and living different lives are the ones through which you are meant to prove your faith in God’s love.**

There are two types of people: the ones who will learn that the people they loved were Jesus and those who will realize the people they chose _not_ to love were Jesus. You, like everyone, likely fall into the second category most of the time. And your intention was likely not to be mean or spiteful. If you’d known it was Jesus, you would have dropped everything to help. But you didn’t, and you let other things, like fear or your busy life, get in the way of showing love.

Treating everyone as though they are Jesus is God’s plan for you. If you truly want to go deep in your faith and be with Jesus, you must treat everyone like they’re Jesus. It’s not easy, but when you become love, it gets a lot easier. You need to realize that when you give love away to everyone, you are acting in accordance with who God made you to be. You are doing it for God, not for yourself.

**You don’t need to wait for a plan or a sign for who to help and how to do it. Love is the plan.** Find people who need help. Seek out people on the fringe and give whatever love you can. Visit people in jail or hand out water to people who are thirsty. God’s plan is simple. Don’t complicate it with fears or confusion. Set the intention to love everybody, and you will be fulfilling your true purpose in life. Your conversation with Jesus will be one you can be proud of.

### The Price of Grace

When you become love, you give over part of your life to those in need. You make room in your world for others, even if you don’t think you have room. Becoming love means getting used to having your world disrupted in ways you didn’t imagine, but these disruptions are where your faith lives and your grace. **You might feel like grace is too high a price to pay if your world is thrown out of whack because of it, but what price would you pay to know you were serving Jesus and living your life’s purpose?**

In the back of _Love Does_ , Bob’s previous book, he listed his phone number. He wanted to make himself available like Jesus does. He gets dozens of phone calls a week from people, and he takes them all. He even takes them while he’s working because he knows becoming love means being fully accessible to people when they’re in need.

One day, a man from prison called his number by accident. But while they were on the phone, the man asked Bob to call two people—the man’s girlfriend and mother. Bob made the calls using a third-party system to connect the man with his loved ones, and both were a disaster. The girlfriend didn’t come to the phone, and the mother hung up after the man said he loved her. Bob felt his heart wrench for this man. He asked him what he was looking for with these calls, and the man said he needed someone to buy him an ankle bracelet so he could be released. Without a second thought, Bob agreed to buy it for him.

That day, the cost of Bob’s grace was $9.95 for the phone call and a large chunk of money for the bracelet, but he didn’t worry about it. He could help someone who’d asked for it, so he did, like Jesus would want him to. Afterward, Bob never heard from the man again, and that was also okay with him. He didn’t need anything from this man, and he didn’t help him so he could get a pat on the back from others for his good deed. He told his wife and that was it.

This experience reminded Bob of two things: 1) Jesus already knows what you’re doing, so you don’t need to wow Him with stories of your grand gestures, and 2) becoming love is like playing the part of a tree in a play, as Bob had done as a child. The tree is not the hero or the antagonist of the story. The tree has no lines and gets no credit for being a tree. Your only job as the tree is to stand tall and move your arms when directed to. It’s pretty simple.

Likewise, when you’re simply a tree in someone’s life, your only job is to stand tall and await directions, then perform them to the best of your ability. You don't need to be the victim or hero or receive applause. You just need to love. **Jesus wants you to participate in the play of life that He is the star in. Play your part well, and don’t ruin the performance by demanding credit in the playbill.**

When you get to heaven and talk with Jesus, you can both have a good chat about all the ways you gave love to others. There won’t be fanfare or a parade to salute you. You will simply have the satisfaction of knowing you did what you could to live the way Jesus wanted you to live. And at the end of the day, if it costs you time, comfort, or $9.95, the price will be worth the reward.

### Fill Your Bucket With Love

There’s a children’s book that centers around the concept that your life is a bucket, and you become whatever you put in the bucket. You may be thinking about what you want to put in your bucket so you can become that thing. But stop for a moment and ask yourself, “What could I fill my bucket with to make life good for the people around me?”

**Becoming love means making God’s world a place where everyone can experience His love, not just you.** You can fill your bucket up with parties and become popular. You can fill your bucket up with complaints and become an unhappy person. Or you can fill your bucket up with love and become God. Which bucket do you think serves more than just you?

Ask the people you love how your life is working for them. If they’re honest, you’ll understand what you need to put in your bucket to become love for them. Bob asked his family how his life worked for them and got a surprising answer. He’d always been impatient, but he never felt bothered by it. But his family did, so he decided to fill his bucket with patience. To hammer the matter home, he carried a bucket with him as a reminder.

One day, he was leaving a sermon he’d just given at a church in Texas and was rushing to make it home in time for the Super Bowl. He drove to the rental-car return and became stuck in a slow-moving line. He didn’t understand what was taking so long until he looked out the window. He saw the attendant working at a turtle’s pace. Twenty-five minutes and a missed flight later, he was ready to burst. Then, he noticed his bucket on the passenger seat. He decided to fill it with patience, and when he finally reached the front, instead of unloading a storm of annoyance on the worker, he complimented him and wished him well.

Later, the same worker caught up to Bob and told him what a great sermon he’d given earlier that day. The man had been in the audience of one of several sermons Bob gave at the church. If Bob had acted the way he initially wanted to, the wise and benevolent man this worker had seen spreading God’s love would have fizzled. Bob may have released his frustration if he’d yelled at the man, but that conversation would not have worked for the man. It likely would have damaged him and made him lose faith.

You can pretend to be a wonderful person in front of an audience and tell yourself how much you love God and how deep your faith is. But if you step down from that pedestal and treat the people you believe don’t matter without grace, you know your faith is not where it needs to be. You’re not there yet with God.

How you treat the people around you says a lot about who you are. **You need to act in a way that works for others, and in doing so, you will ensure that your actions always work for you, too.** The more love you give, the more you become love. How you deal with negativity and strife will dictate whether you stay stuck in one place or grow into your true self. God is not grading your performance or demanding perfection. He just wants you to fill your bucket with love so others will recognize Him when they see you.

### A Church Is More Than a Building

Jesus's prayer was for us to come together as one, the way He did with God. There are many religious denominations that all aim to serve God. This common goal makes all denominations one church. **You can be _with_ others without needing to be the _same_ as them. **

In the grand church of Jesus, no one is turned away because of differences or mistakes. There are no rules to follow beyond treating everyone with love, and no one is excluded. But some have taken God’s love to be different for different people. Buildings were constructed in His honor, and separation of His worshippers became the standard practice. But God told you that He doesn’t exist in buildings. He is inside of every person He made in His image.

Excluding people or admonishing them for their lives is not fulfilling God’s purpose. When you shun people who are not like you, you betray Jesus. Jesus doesn’t want you to fight in His name. He wants you to love in a way that makes others feel as though they are in God’s presence.

The true nature of a church is coming together with God and each other. There is no specific location required. Where there is a group gathered to do God’s work, there is a church. **Even if you don’t literally attend church, if you seek to become love and live as Jesus did, you are part of the church of God.**

God refers to His church as his bride. The symbolism is one of an intimate relationship that exists forever. He loves you unconditionally, even your flaws, and accepts you for who you are. A bride is beautiful and enchanting. No one criticizes a bride; they stand in awe of her. To truly be part of God’s church, put away your differences, and recognize one another as the brides you are.

### You Have Nothing to Fear

You don’t need to be afraid when you encounter difficult circumstances or people in your life. God told all His disciples to “be not afraid,” and He meant it. Often, you receive the most grace and understanding about yourself when you go through difficult times. But **if you don’t have the nerve or courage to move forward during struggles, you’ll miss out on all the good that follows**.

Bob does charitable work in Uganda, part of which is providing legal services for people in need. On one trip, he met a chief justice and learned about a frightening aspect of Ugandan life. For more than a century, the Ugandan people have lived in fear of witch doctors. The witch doctors believe that the flesh of children has magical properties, and they perform ceremonies using this flesh. To get the flesh, they abduct children.

A witch doctor has never stood trial in Uganda for their crimes. The people who’ve lost children are too afraid of the witch doctors’ powers to press charges, and the lawyers and judges are too afraid to prosecute. When Bob met with the chief justice, he asked if he could be part of a witch doctor trial if one ever happens, and the justice agreed.

The next time Bob visited Uganda, he learned about a 13-year-old girl who’d been in prison for two years awaiting trial. She was accused of kidnapping after a witch doctor tricked the girl into bringing her a baby. The girl saved the baby when she discovered the witch doctor was not the baby’s mother, but she was arrested. Nothing had happened to the doctor.

Bob took the case and was able to get the girl released from prison. He saw it as a warning to the witch doctors that he was not afraid of them. He felt in his heart that, one day, they would try and convict one of these witch doctors. And when that time came, he would not be afraid. He was following God’s plan, so there was nothing to fear.

What if you weren’t ever afraid again? **You will experience moments when you’re lost, confused, and anxious. But if you’re honest with God and have faith in His love, you’ll understand that something good waits on the other side of your courage.** When you become love _with_ God, you no longer have anything to fear.
