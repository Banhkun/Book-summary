## Exercise: Setting the Objective

Think about these questions to help you set goals and manage expectations.

* * *

Have you ever struggled in a job because you were unclear about what you were supposed to be doing? Describe the situation. How do you think you could have avoided this ambiguity?

Write out 3-5 one-minute goals for yourself in your personal or professional life, as well as clear performance standards for each.

How can you hold yourself accountable to these goals? (Suggestions: check your goals regularly to make sure your work aligns with them; send reports on progress regularly.)
