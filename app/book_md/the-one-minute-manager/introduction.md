## Introduction: Getting Results

_The New One-Minute Manager_ is all about how to use effective management to get the most out of the people in your organization. **The people you manage are the organization’s most valuable asset:** they’re the ones who do all of the day-to-day work that enables your organization’s prosperity and success.

Thus, **good managers are those who know how to motivate people to produce positive results for the organization**.

Most managers fall into one of two different categories of boss.

#### “Tough” Managers

Managers who care _only_ about the organization. These are autocrats who treat their employees as mere cogs in a machine: they give orders, expect them to be followed, and don’t train their employees to make decisions on their own. For these bosses, you’re only as good as the numbers you produce.

#### “Nice” Managers

Managers who only care _only_ about people. They are overly concerned about their employees’ feelings and insufficiently focused on achieving results. These managers don’t hold their people accountable for poor performance. This hurts the organization and deprives employees of the opportunity to learn and grow from mistakes.

#### One-Minute Managers

**One-minute managers care about both results _and_ people**. These are _not_ competing aims: they are complementary.

They instill confidence in their employees, because they know that **confident people produce results**. Therefore, helping people feel good about themselves is the key to getting things done, both quickly and effectively. They understand that they must tap into the skills and talents of _everyone_ in the organization to achieve results. Talent does _not_ reside only in the executive office.

#### Productivity = Quality x Quantity

One-minute managers are also time-management experts. As their name would suggest, **most of the techniques they use can take as little as one minute**. In today’s interconnected, fast-moving world, your organization needs to be adaptive. It’s not enough to just do good work: you have to produce it quickly and efficiently.**Productivity is a function of both quality _and_ quantity.**

### Investing in People

One-minute managers invest in the organization’s most important asset: its people. They know that the best minute you spend is the one spent investing in people. Think about this: 50-70 percent of a typical company’s budget gets spent on salary, but less than 1 percent on training. Given how important employees are to the achievement of company goals, this is a gross misallocation of resources: more gets spent on buildings and equipment than people!

One-minute managers put in the work to make their employees self-supported and self-motivated. They don’t make decisions _for_ their employees: they guide them to make decisions for _themselves_.

This is more important than ever before. New technologies and tools of communication are transforming the way organizations operate every day. Your organization needs to be quick on its feet to survive: the old top-down, command-and-control style of management is simply too slow and unresponsive to keep organizations agile and adaptive. One-minute managers succeed where other managers fail, because **they empower the people in their organization to take responsibility and manage _themselves_** , with minimal direct input. This saves valuable time and resources.

### Manipulation vs. Empowerment

Too many managers practice manipulation: getting people to do things that they’re either not aware of or don’t agree to. Manipulative managers often use a mix of threats, coercion, and neglect to force people to do their bidding. Employees feel taken advantage of, misled, and used, and end up bitter and having learned nothing from their experience.

**One-minute managers believe in empowering employees, not manipulating them.** An empowerment-focused management style treats everyone as a potential high-achiever. You bring out the best in people when you give them the structure and the right mix of positive and negative feedback that motivates them to perform well on their own. You can only do this, however, if you treat them as full human beings worthy of respect. They aren’t cogs in a machine or robots programmed to do a task: they’re people, and you need to take account of their complexity and emotions as people if you’re to manage them successfully.

Giving your people clear goals and then judging their performance based on those goals puts everyone on the same page and creates a truly honest, open, and empowering working relationship: **goals begin positive behaviors and consequences maintain them.**
