## Exercise: Prepare for Social Success

Van Edwards says that the key to establishing and deepening your relationships with people is proactively setting yourself up for positive interactions, making yourself likable and memorable, and playing to other people’s traits.

Think of a time you had to go to an event where you didn’t know anyone and you felt uncomfortable and unsure of yourself. What could you do next time to make that event go more smoothly? For example, is there a better location you could choose for striking up conversation?

Reflect on a time when you met someone new and felt like your conversation went poorly. What are two things you could do to make that conversation go better next time? For example, could you be a better listener or use an engaging story?

Think of someone in your life that you wish to understand at a deeper level. How could you use love languages, personality traits, or values to get to know them better?
