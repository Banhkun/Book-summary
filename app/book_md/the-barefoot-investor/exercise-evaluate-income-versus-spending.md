## Exercise: Evaluate Income Versus Spending

Check whether you’re following the 60 percent rule for spending.

* * *

Calculate 60 percent of your take-home pay.

Calculate how much your essentials—food, shelter, bills—cost per month. Is this lower or higher than 60 percent of your take-home pay?

List other things you spend money on regularly, like newspaper subscriptions or Netflix.

Do you think these expenses should be part of your regular expenses or your Treat expenses? Why?

List some strategies you could employ to lower these non-essential expenses.
