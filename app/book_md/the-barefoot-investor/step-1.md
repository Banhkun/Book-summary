## Step 1: Plan a Monthly Date Night to Discuss Finances

In this step, you’ll learn how to set aside time to regularly discuss your finances and why regularly discussing them is important. Then, you’ll learn what you’ll do on the first three dates.

### Making the Time

For the next five weeks, schedule one night per week as a date night with your spouse to work toward financial improvement. Working through the steps as a couple helps you ensure you can provide for your family, and when you work together, you both feel invested.

If you’re single, consider finding a family member or someone else who wants to work on their finances to do these steps with you. Though this is helpful for staying motivated, going it alone is also an option.

**For each date, go out to eat at a restaurant—don’t worry about the cost because the steps you’re taking will save you thousands of dollars over time.**

After the first five weeks and implementing the initial steps, select just one night per month for this date night. It’s helpful to do the same night of the month each time, like the first Thursday.

#### Why It’s Important

You may be tempted to simply complete these steps without treating yourself to a date. But there are two compelling reasons to go the date route instead:

  1. **Treating yourself is both fun and inspiring.** Though it’s possible to complete these steps anywhere, going out and doing something fun provides an incentive to do the work instead of blowing it off, whether you do it with someone or alone. Plus, if you’re doing it with someone else, you’re spending time with people you care about, which studies show makes us happy. 
  2. **You can’t get rich quick.** Getting your finances in order requires you to make time to regularly work on the steps in this book. Sporadically working on the steps in a random order may yield results, but not as efficiently as when you work on them regularly. Though setting aside time may feel daunting, you’ll eventually look forward to it. Working regularly toward your financial goals will help you reach them faster than if you only work on them once in a while, and going on a date helps you make the space to work on your finances. 



### Date Night #1: Open New Bank Accounts

On this first date night, you’ll open five new bank accounts that allow you to avoid banking fees and start directing money toward five important purposes:

  * **Day-to-Day:** basic expenses
  * **Treat:** nonessentials that you enjoy
  * **Happy:** long-term purchases you need time to save for
  * **Fire:** pressing needs, like paying off debt or saving for a home
  * **Backstop:** in case of emergency



The purpose of these accounts will be discussed later. For now, you’ll learn how to open them and what to consider with each account.

#### Why It’s Important

Besides helping you organize your income and spending, opening new accounts will save you money on banking fees.There are many reasons you might currently be banking with a high-cost bank without realizing it—for instance, you might have an account at the same place that your parents did, or you might have received a bank account with your home loan.

**But there’s good reason to switch:** Switching to banks with no fees can save you thousands of dollars over the course of your lifetime. **The average Australian household pays $489 per year in bank fees, some of the highest in the world.**

#### Take Action

1\. **Set up two checking accounts with banks that offer online interfaces and don’t charge fees, including for ATM transactions.** Pape recommends ING Orange Everyday Debit Cards, available in Australia. The only caveat is that you’ll need to deposit $1,000 into one of the accounts each month.

Nickname one account “Day-to-Day” and the other “Treat.” You’ll learn how to use these in Step 2.

If you’re doing this with a spouse, you’ll share these accounts, with each of you having your own debit card. Pape and his wife have an agreement that they’re each allowed to spend up to $400 on anything they want from these accounts without asking the other for permission. They have to discuss spending anything above that amount.

2\. **Set up two high-interest savings accounts.** Pape recommends using ING Savings Maximizers, which you can connect to your ING debit accounts. Label one “Happy” and one “Fire.”

3\. **Set up an account at a separate bank that you won’t be tempted to use, called your “Backstop” account.** Pape recommends UBank USaver, a savings account in Australia with a high interest rate. Deposit $2,000 in it to start with. In Step 6, you’ll work to save three months of living expenses in this account.

Ideally, you’ll never have to touch the money in your Backstop account, but it’ll be there if you need it in an emergency or need money to fall back on. For example, if you lose your job and need time to find a new one, you can use the money in this account.

### Date Night #2: Get a Better Deal on Your Super Fund

In Australia, employers divert 9.5 percent of an employee’s pre-tax income into a retirement account known as a “superannuation,” or “super” for short, to help employees save for retirement. Employees can also pay voluntarily into this system and can increase their contribution rate. (Shortform note: In the U.S., employers may offer a 401(k) savings plan for employees, but employee participation is voluntary. However, U.S. employers divert 6.2 percent of an employee’s pre-tax income to Social Security and pay another 6.2 percent of the employee’s pre-tax income toward their Social Security. This money will be available to the person during retirement.)

It’s important to save for retirement so that you have enough money to live on once you’re no longer working full time. **On this date, you’ll ensure you’re directing your money into a super account that isn’t skimming off a large percentage of your deposits.**

#### Why It’s Important

Employers often offer a specific super account when an employee is hired; 90 percent of Australians take the super that they’re given, and may have multiple super accounts corresponding to different jobs they’ve held. If they’ve never examined the fees on their super(s), they’re likely losing precious money.

Australians can avoid losing money to fees by choosing a low-cost super account instead. For example, an account that charges 0.02 percent annually versus 1 percent annually will save $226,484 AUD over 30 years.

#### Take Action

Investigate the annual fee on your retirement fund by googling the name of the fund. In Australia, search for the “PDS,” or “Product Disclosure Statement.”**If you’re being charged more than 0.85 percent per year, choose another super or retirement account to invest in.**

For Australians, Pape recommends choosing “Hostplus Index Balanced Fund” for a super account. It charges 6 cents for every $100 invested, and a $78 annual fee.

(Shortform note: Low-cost, passively managed index funds are a helpful, more cost-effective investment option for U.S. investors and eventual retirees, too.)

### Date Night #3: Choose Insurance Wisely

Life comes with losses, such as losing a job or becoming disabled. Having insurance helps protect you from the financial costs of these losses. However, finding appropriate insurance can be tricky. Here are some common insurance pitfalls:

  * We pay for coverage we don’t need.
  * We pay too much for insurance.
  * We fail to get coverage we _do_ need.



On this date, you’ll scrutinize your insurance choices and take action to support your and your family’s financial well-being.

Here are two pieces of advice to follow when choosing and managing insurance:

  1. **If losing it won’t affect your financial situation, don’t insure it.** For example, if you damage your phone beyond repair, you’ll be able to get a new one without putting yourself at a financial disadvantage, so don’t insure it. On the other hand, if your house burns down, you’ll want to recoup the value of the house itself and the possessions within. Here are some other common items or scenarios to consider insuring against:


  * Losing the ability to work, or becoming disabled
  * Death
  * Theft
  * Car accidents
  * Health insurance (more on this below)
  * Becoming ill and needing medical care while traveling abroad


  1. **Negotiate your annual insurance premiums down.** Companies want to retain your business. If you call them and tell them you’re thinking about switching, they’ll likely be willing to negotiate a better deal for you. You can also offer to pay more money, or excess, which is the initial amount of money you’re willing to pay toward a claim. By increasing the amount of excess you’re willing to pay, you can decrease your insurance cost. Since you now have a Backstop account, you’ll have the extra money to pay if something catastrophic happens.



Now, we’ll look at some specific types of insurance.

#### Private Health Insurance

Australia’s health care system is so robust that you may not need private insurance. If you’re under the age of 31 or earn less than $91,000 as a single person or $180,000 as a couple, the country’s health system will cover your medical expenses for free.

If you earn above these thresholds, you’ll have to pay a special tax for medical services. **To avoid paying this tax, pay for private insurance instead, which is the same cost, but gives you access to private medical providers.** You’ll also want to go with private insurance if you want to avoid waiting for care in the public system or want to choose your own doctor.

Here are four tips for choosing private insurance in Australia:

  1. Opt for comprehensive coverage and $500 excess.
  2. Choose a plan that allows you to pay for each day you’re in the hospital. This reduces your annual insurance cost.
  3. Purchase plans that don’t cover extras like massages that increase the cost.
  4. Avoid iSelect for browsing insurance, as it doesn’t include all the most prominent or cost-effective providers. Instead, visit PrivateHealth.gov.au for a list of all providers.



#### Income Protection, Life Insurance, and Disability

Ninety-four percent of Australian families have no insurance to protect them if an income earner can no longer work. **This leaves families vulnerable, as they will have to make do with less income in the event of accidents or other life-changing events.**

Pape recommends that parents with young children aim to insure 10 to 12 times their annual income.

Australians can purchase insurance for income protection, life, and disability through their super fund. Call your super fund and asking for three pieces of information:

  1. A quote on 12 times your annual income for combined life and total permanent disability insurance.
  2. A quote on 75 percent of your annual income until the age you plan to retire.
  3. How much additional money you’ll need to put into your super to cover these new insurances.



(Shortform note: U.S. employers may provide some types of insurance to employees. Be sure you understand what your employer offers and supplement it if necessary.)
