## Exercise: Save for a 20 Percent Downpayment

Make a plan to save for a home.

* * *

Look back at your napkin plan from Step 2. What percentage of your income did you decide to put toward your Fire account each month? What was the dollar amount?

Using your monthly contribution to your Fire account, calculate how long it would take you to save for a $100,000 downpayment.

Does the above feel like a reasonable timeline for you? Why or why not?

Discuss one or two things you could do to bring in additional income to reach your goal sooner.
