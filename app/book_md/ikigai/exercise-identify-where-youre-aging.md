## Exercise: Identify Where You’re Aging

In Chapter 4, you learned principles and practices of youth and longevity. This exercise leads you to identify which of these areas you most need to focus on.

* * *

Which of the principles in this chapter—handling stress, revitalizing your mind, keeping active, getting enough sleep, and eating well—are you already doing a good job of following? (For example, are you eating a lot of antioxidant-rich food?)

Which of the anti-aging principles are you currently _not_ practicing? (For instance, are you currently living a lifestyle that’s too sedentary?) Which one principle might have the biggest positive impact on your life if you implemented it?

List three specific ways that you can start implementing your “least followed” principle this week. (If it’s diet, what three things could you stop eating and/or start eating? If it’s exercise, what are three ways to start moving your body more?)
