## Exercise: Use Flow to Find Your Ikigai

Clarify how your personal experiences of flow can help you to identify your ikigai and live it out more fully.

* * *

Write down the activities that bring you into the flow state. (These are activities that engage you so deeply that time flies and you feel pleasurably focused, creative, and capable. They might be related to your job, hobbies, talents, interpersonal relationships, or any other factors.)

Why do you think these particular activities create flow for you?

What do these activities all have in common? What recurring themes do they involve? (For example, do you practice them all by yourself or with other people? Do they all cluster around common sets of topics or people?)

Go deeper: What ikigai (or ikigais) might lie behind your flow activities? What life purpose might these activities be driving you towards?
