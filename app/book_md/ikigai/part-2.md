## Part 2: Finding Your Ikigai | Chapter 2: Finding Purpose

Having learned what ikigai is and how it factors into the lives of the people of Okinawa, you can now try to find your own ikigai. **Your ikigai is hidden deep within you, so you have to search for it.** However, as you’ve seen, Okinawans say you shouldn’t worry too much about your ikigai or become preoccupied with finding it. Instead, just let your ikigai find _you_ as you occupy yourself with doing the things you love in the company of people who love and care for you.

That said, you can still benefit from working to find your ikigai in a relaxed but focused way. **This chapter introduces two useful methods for doing that: logotherapy and Morita therapy.** Even though these are both formalized systems of psychotherapy, general knowledge of their principles can be useful for finding your ikigai regardless of whether or not you receive actual treatment.

### Logotherapy

**Logotherapy is unique among Western forms of psychotherapy because it focuses explicitly on helping people find _meaning_.** Its purpose is to break the hold of your neuroses and enable you to face challenges effectively by helping you find a reason to live.

Logotherapy’s creator, Viktor Frankl, was a prisoner under the Nazis in various German concentration camps. From this experience, he famously declared that you can take away literally everything from a person except their ability to choose their attitude. No matter what happens on the outside, he said, this primary freedom remains unassailable. Frankl also said a clear life purpose enables a person to overcome virtually any challenge and endure virtually any conditions.

Frankl’s own biography demonstrates the reality of logotherapy’s core assumptions and existential value. During his imprisonment in the Nazi concentration camps, his captors took away the manuscript he brought with him that contained all of his initial writings about life purpose and psychological health—the precursor of logotherapy, his life’s work as a psychologist. He spent the rest of his time in the camps rewriting that manuscript. His drive for a purpose helped him survive such awful conditions. When he got out of the camps, he created logotherapy.

Logotherapy offers a highly specific understanding of “meaning.” Like the Japanese concept of ikigai, logotherapy says we don’t _create_ our life’s meaning. Instead, we discover it. Logotherapy says each person has a unique meaning, a unique reason for being. It also says your meaning evolves throughout life.

What follows is a description of how logotherapy is formally practiced, but bear in mind that you can derive many of its benefits on your own by reading Frankl’s classic book, _Man’s Search for Meaning_.

The formal practice of logotherapy takes place in five steps or stages:

  1. Someone feels empty or anxious.
  2. A therapist helps the person realize that her negative feelings are really the desire for a meaningful life.
  3. The patient discovers her life’s purpose, relative to that moment in time.
  4. The patient freely accepts that purpose. (It’s also possible for the patient to _reject_ that purpose, in which case the therapist leads the patient to figure out why she feels that way.)
  5. With her newfound passion for life, the patient now overcomes her problems and sorrows.



#### Differences From Psychoanalysis

**Logotherapy differs significantly from the more widely familiar psychotherapeutic approach of psychoanalysis.** The differences show the fundamental value of logotherapy over psychotherapy for finding happiness through discovering your purpose:

  * Logotherapy focuses on cultivating health, as opposed to psychoanalysis, which analyzes sickness.
  * During sessions, the logotherapy patient sits up, facing the therapist, instead of reclining on a couch, thus undercutting the “sick patient” and “healing doctor” roles.
  * Logotherapy looks forward to the patient’s future instead of backward toward past pains. It handles conflicts and crises as they present themselves instead of dredging them up through reflection.
  * Logotherapy is compatible with spirituality because its goal is to find meaning and life purpose, which is also a core goal of religion and spirituality. By contrast, psychoanalysis largely ignores or even rejects questions of spirituality and life purpose.



### Morita Therapy

**Another possible aid for finding your ikigai comes from Morita therapy, a Japanese form of life therapy specifically based on finding your purpose**. Created by psychotherapist and Zen Buddhist Shoma Morita, Morita therapy teaches people in psychological crisis to accept their emotions instead of trying to control them. It says your emotions will automatically change when you change your actions, and as this happens, your purpose will become clear.

The practice of Morita therapy takes place in four stages. The first stage is a week of absolute bed rest and total silence. This creates an extended space for doing nothing but watching your mind, thus clearing away the layers of manic mind activity that pollute your life and obscure your purpose.

The second and third stages take the patient through a multi-stage reintroduction to active living and working. Activities include keeping a diary, practicing breathing exercises, walking, and doing chores such as gardening and chopping wood, while still maintaining mostly silence so the patient can continue to reflect.

The fourth stage has the patient return to the world and social life as a newly inner-directed person with a clear sense of purpose. The patient now knows who they are and what they’re supposed to do.
