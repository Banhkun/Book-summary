## Epilogue: The 10 Commandments of Ikigai

You’ve learned many things in this book. You’ve learned what ikigai is and how to find and follow yours. You’ve learned how the longest-lived people in the world build their lives around pursuing ikigai. You’ve learned principles and practices of diet, exercise, and lifestyle for remaining young and living long. You’ve learned to become resilient and antifragile so that you can fulfill your ikigai over the course of a long and fruitful life.

Drawing on all these things, we can assemble a condensed list of 10 core rules of ikigai. Use these rules as a map for fulfilling your life purpose in loving community with other people and the world around you.

  1. **Don’t retire.** Remain active throughout your life. Keep helping others and bringing beauty into their lives even after your professional career has ended.
  2. **Don’t hurry.** Stay slow, gentle, and full of ease.
  3. **Eat well, and don’t overeat**. Practice the 80 percent rule: Eat only until you feel 80 percent full. Or, practice intermittent fasting.
  4. **Have friends around you.** Enjoy the company of the people you love, and who love you back.
  5. **Keep moving.** Practice gentle movement of some kind.
  6. **Keep smiling.** Maintain a cheerful attitude.
  7. **Get in touch with nature.** Take time to get away from cities and recharge your spiritual batteries in communion with the natural world.
  8. **Be thankful.** Take some time every day to direct a grateful attitude toward everything in your life. Find beauty in everything by applying the attitude of wabi-sabi.
  9. **Remain mentally present.** Give up regrets and fearful anticipation. Live in the now. Practice ichi-go ichi-e.
  10. **Follow your unique talent and passion.** Follow your ikigai, which motivates you to spend your life sharing the best of yourself with the world. If you’re still not sure what your ikigai is, bear in mind the advice of Viktor Frankl: If you don’t know your mission, then currently, your mission is to find it.
