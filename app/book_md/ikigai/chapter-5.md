## Chapter 5: Becoming Resilient

You’ve learned how to find your ikigai. You’ve learned to build it into your life by experiencing flow. And you’ve learned how to stay young and healthy so that you can fill a long life with your ikigai. The final lesson of this book builds on the others and adds a new dimension: You must learn to be _resilient_. Resilience is the ability to handle setbacks and just keep going.

**A strong attitude of resilience is connected to a clearly defined ikigai.** In fact, resilience and ikigai are mutually reinforcing. People who clearly know their ikigai tend to be resilient in their pursuit of it, while resilience is a quality that enables them to keep on pursuing their ikigai with passion even in the face of setbacks and difficulties.

To strengthen your pursuit of your ikigai through resilience, do two things: Learn to embrace life’s flawed and fleeting nature, and then go beyond mere resilience by becoming antifragile. We’ll discuss both of these approaches in this chapter.

### Embracing Impermanence and Imperfection

The Japanese concepts of _wabi-sabi_ and _ichi-go ichi-e_ can help you discover resilience in your own life:

#### Wabi-Sabi

**Wabi-sabi means finding beauty in imperfection and loveliness in things that are incomplete or flawed.** The basic idea of the concept is that only flawed and imperfect things reflect the reality of an imperfect, incomplete, and fleeting world. A standard example of wabi-sabi in action is to find great value in a teacup that’s cracked or irregular.

To apply this principle in your own life, look around. You can find plenty of imperfect things in your daily life—objects, situations—where you can fruitfully apply this attitude.

#### Ichi-go Ichi-e

**Ichi-go ichi-e is the Japanese attitude of recognizing that the current moment only exists right now and will never come again.** Its practical application is to quit losing yourself in memories of the past and thoughts about the future. Instead, choose to fully inhabit the present.****

Japanese culture embraces the fleeting, vanishing nature of what we are and what we create. You can see this attitude in play in Japanese architecture. Unlike the West’s imposing and permanent-feeling cathedrals, temples, and skyscrapers, traditional Japanese buildings are made of wood, reflecting the spirit of valuing imperfection and recognizing impermanence.

**Practicing wabi-sabi and ichi-go ichi-e in tandem can help you to remain resilient, live in the present, and enjoy each moment by finding beauty in imperfection and recognizing imperfection as an opportunity for growth.** These concepts teach that because all things vanish, you have to live your ikigai _now_ or risk never living it at all. When you clearly know your ikigai, and when you embrace imperfection and impermanence, you’ll find that each moment seems to offer almost unlimited possibilities.

### Learning From Buddhism and Stoicism

Two famous historical examples, one from ancient Eastern philosophy and one from ancient Western philosophy, can help to further illustrate the principles of wabi-sabi and ichi-go ichi-e.

First, Siddhartha Gautama, better known as the Buddha, awakened to the realization that all life is impermanent and full of suffering. Born a prince, he rejected his wealth and position and went on a quest for enlightenment that led him to sample the extremes of both indulgent pleasure and strict asceticism. In the end, **he realized that it was better to follow the “middle way” of moderation, neither rejecting pleasures nor becoming enslaved to them.** This attitude enabled him and his followers to remain calm and resilient in the face of life’s empty turmoil.

Second, and similarly, the ancient Greek philosophy of Stoicism taught people to control their pleasures and desires in order to avoid being controlled by them. Like Buddhism, it taught people to reduce their ego and take control of negative emotions. **Stoics were also careful to distinguish between _what happens_ and _how you react to it_. **They said true satisfaction only comes from achieving a state of resilient tranquility or _apatheia_ characterized by freedom from passion, so that you don’t mind what happens or doesn’t happen. They said this liberates you from both your “negative” feelings (such as anxiety and shame) and your “positive” ones (such as happiness and love).

### Becoming Antifragile

In your quest to become resilient, you can also benefit from learning about the advanced state of resilience that Nassim Taleb has termed _antifragility_. When antifragile things are harmed, they don’t just survive, they get stronger. **Becoming antifragile is the ultimate way to underwrite the lifelong fulfillment of your ikigai.** If you’re antifragile, the many challenges you’ll inevitably face when pursuing your ikigai will only intensify your pursuit of it by giving you added strength, skills, and determination.

There are several concrete steps that you can take to become antifragile:

**Create redundancies.** Act on the old advice to avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. For example, create multiple streams of income. That way, if something bad happens to one thing—for instance, if one of your income streams dries up— you aren’t totally bereft.

**Combine a conservative approach in some areas of your life with multiple small risks in others that may produce a valuable payoff.** In other words, wisely “diversify your portfolio” in all areas of life. Maintain a core of safe stability while taking some calculated risks that could really pay off. This can apply to your finances, your career, your relationships, or anything else.

**Remove from your life whatever makes you fragile.** First, take an inventory of your fragile areas. Do you eat poorly? Do you build your life around a job you hate or waste your time on social media? Next, drop those vulnerabilities. Eject those down-dragging things from your life.

**Follow your ikigai.** Antifragility and ikigai are complementary. Knowing and living out your ikigai actually makes you antifragile because it gives you something to keep living and striving for, while taking deliberate steps to become antifragile, like the sample steps listed above, strengthens the clarity of your ikigai and the fulfillment you experience in pursuing it.

Antifragility also harmonizes beautifully with wabi-sabi and ichi-go ichi-e. When you become antifragile, you learn to welcome life’s uncertainty, imperfection, and fleetingness. You know you can bounce back from life’s challenges all the more strengthened and devoted to your ikigai.

(Shortform note: For more information on antifragility, see our summary of Taleb’s Antifragile.)
