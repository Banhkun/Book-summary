## Exercise: Identify Your Suboptimal Areas

In Chapter 1, you also learned five principles of the Ogimi lifestyle: Refuse to worry, create positive habits, feed and nurture your friendships each day, live unhurried, and choose optimism. In this exercise, you’ll compare your current lifestyle to those principles.

* * *

Which of the five principles above do you most follow or fulfill in your own life? How do you implement this principle? Why is it important to you?

Which of the five principles do you _least_ follow or fulfill in your own life? Why don’t you implement this principle?

What are some practical steps you could take to align your life more effectively with the principle you follow the least? (For example, if you worry all the time, what could you change about your circumstances or your thought patterns to overcome this?)
