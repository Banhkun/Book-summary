## Chapter 1: Success Requires Believing in Yourself

_What is success_? It means something different for all of us because we all have different goals. But if you look at people you view as successful, regardless of their goals, you’ll see they all have one thing in common: **They believe in themselves**. They believe in their abilities. They believe they can accomplish their goals, no matter what obstacles arise.

Believing in yourself isn’t about wishful thinking, though many people confuse the two. You can’t simply wish yourself into a promotion or a bigger home. You can, however, fuel yourself with an “I know I can do it” attitude, which creates the energy needed to propel you forward. With the right attitude, you’ll observe how other people succeed, and you’ll see all the opportunities for yourself to succeed. The “how” comes naturally if you believe you can do it.

### Why Thinking You’ll Fail Is Harmful

When you’re talking with someone who has failed, you may often hear, “I had a feeling it wouldn’t work out,” or, “I wasn’t really surprised it failed.” From the very beginning, these ventures were seeded with failure.

When you start out with a mindset of, “I’ll give it a try but it probably won’t work,” you’ve already given up. You have a subconscious will to fail. Because you don’t truly believe, you find more and more reasons to support your lack of belief — more reasons to give up. **If you believe you _can’t_ do big things, you _won’t_ do big things. **If you believe you’re worth little, you’ll receive little. Disbelief causes our opinion of ourselves and our possibilities to shrink.

This also affects how the world sees you. Others see us as we see ourselves, so we shrink in the view of others. If we don’t think we can do it, others certainly will agree. This makes it harder to attract other people to you.

### When You Believe in Yourself, You Gain Power

Here’s what happens when you believe in yourself and adopt an “I know I can do it” attitude:

  * **You generate the energy, skills and power to set and achieve your goal**. The American space program was driven by a firm, unwavering belief that space exploration was possible. Without this belief, it could never have happened.
  * **Because you believe you can do it, you overcome obstacles**. The underwater English Channel Tunnel linking England and France was seen as incredibly difficult and costly. But with resolution to achieve the goal, the builders overcame the many engineering and political obstacles that arose.
  * **Others have confidence in you when you project confidence and a belief in yourself.** In the book, a young woman with dreams of selling mobile homes was viewed with skepticism because of her lack of capital and experience. But she believed so firmly in her success that she convinced investors to fund her and manufacturers to advance her inventory, and she sold millions of dollars of mobile homes.



In summary, “whether you think you can, or you think you can't—you're right.”

### How to Develop the Power of Belief

The most important part of developing a belief in yourself is controlling your thoughts. Think of your mind as a thought factory producing endless thoughts every day. This factory has two foremen: Mr. Triumph and Mr. Defeat. They are both extremely hard workers who are at your beck and call. Send the slightest signal to either one and he will snap to attention.

If you think, “Oh boy, today is off to a bad start,” Mr. Defeat springs into action. He’ll manufacture tons of thoughts to prove you right. “It’s too hot.” “You have too much to do.” “You’re probably getting sick.” Soon it’s a _really_ bad day. Negative thought production goes into overdrive.

But if you start out telling yourself, “This is going to be a _great_ day,” you signal Mr. Triumph. He manufactures positive thoughts. “It _is_ a lovely day; we’re going to get so much done!”

If you let him, Mr. Defeat will endlessly produce reasons that you’ll fail at something. Likewise, Mr. Triumph will manufacture reasons that you’ll succeed.

The only path to true success involves firing Mr. Defeat, then using Mr. Triumph to handle 100% of your thought processes. **Whatever thought enters your mind, call Mr. Triumph into action to spin that thought in a positive direction — and manufacture _more_ positive thoughts.**

Keeping Mr. Triumph at hand, here are three guidelines toward developing the power of belief:

  1. Think success. **Whenever a difficult situation arises, face it with an attitude of “I’ll win this,” not, “I’ll probably lose.”** When competing, think “I’m an equal or better rival,” not “I’m hopelessly outclassed.” Thinking success constantly conditions your mind for success. (In contrast, thinking failure conditions the mind for failure.)
  2. **Remind yourself that you’re smarter and more capable than you think you are. Stop comparing yourself negatively to others**. That successful person you admire isn’t Superman; she’s no smarter or more capable than you. (Shortform Note: Steve Jobs said, “Everything around you that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you.”)
  3. **Think big goals** to win big success. Don’t limit yourself to mediocre goals. Big ideas and plans aren’t any more difficult than small ideas and plans.



### This Book Is the Plan for Your Success

You need the tools to create a plan for your own self-development and growth. This book does three things:

  1. Teaches **what** to do: Learn the practices used by successful people that set them apart from the ordinary. 
  2. Teaches **how** to do It: Apply the practices with concrete guides for action.
  3. Gets you **results** : You need proof that what the book teaches actually works. If you apply the principles, you’ll start noticing gradual improvements (like self-confidence, respect from others, and self-fulfillment) . But the biggest reward is reaching your ultimate goal and achieving your version of success. 



The book is just a static set of principles. How it can really come alive is to apply it to the world around you. After digesting this book, you can view success and failure through a new lens. You can see what makes certain people around you so successful, and what differentiates them from the merely mediocre.

To hone your skills of human observation, here’s a tip: **Think about the most successful person you personally know, and the most unsuccessful.** As you read through the principles in this book, **observe how closely the successful person models the principles and strategies outlined here**. Notice how and where the more unsuccessful person falls short.

This exercise will help you see success principles in action, and serve as evidence that these ideas really work.
