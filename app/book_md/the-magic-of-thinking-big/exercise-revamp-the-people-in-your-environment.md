## Exercise: Revamp the People in Your Environment

Is there a negator in your life? Itâ€™s time to lose that negative influence.

* * *

Think of a person in your life who is often negative. What kinds of things this person say or do?

How do you feel in this negator's presence? How do this person's words and attitudes rub off on you and affect your behavior?

How can you reduce your exposure to this person?

Is there a more positive person or group that would help uplift your mood and attitude? How can you spend more time with these positive people?
