## Troubleshooting by Thinking Big

We’ve covered a lot of concepts and suggestions. They’re not easy to remember in the moment when you need them most. Here are a few specific situations that might require you to think big.

When other people try to bring you down:

  * Stay big. Don’t engage with small people. You won’t win when you fight, but you win when you refuse to fight.
  * People who try to bring you down have other personal issues. They’re insecure or jealous, and it has nothing to do with you. Pity them. Don’t engage them.



When you don’t believe you have what it takes:

  * Remember that if you think you can’t do it, you can’t. If you think you can, you can.
  * Remember your assets. Repeat that commercial you wrote to sell yourself to yourself.
  * Withdraw from your positive memory bank. Think about previous examples that prove you _can_ do this.
  * Remember that other formidable people are just people with their own strengths and weaknesses, just like you.



When you get dragged into an argument:

  * Ask, “is this really important enough to spend time on? Would a big person waste time on this?”
  * Don’t sweat the small stuff. They don’t move you toward your big goals.



When you encounter a setback:

  * Remember every setback is a lesson. Learn from it. Every failure is just another reason you’ll succeed next time.
  * Don’t blame other people or bad luck. Focus on how you can make yourself better.
  * Experiment with new approaches. Don’t keep trying something that hasn’t worked many times before.
