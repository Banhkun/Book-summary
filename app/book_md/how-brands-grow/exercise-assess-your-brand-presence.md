## Exercise: Assess Your Brand Presence

Sharp argues that most marketers have a misguided view of their brand presence—they don’t accurately understand why their marketing is successful (or not). Assess your brand presence to gain a clearer idea on how well you’re doing and what you could be doing better.

Sharp argues that most marketers spend too much time worrying _what_ customers think about their brand and not enough about _how often_ customers think about their brand. How do you currently balance these two priorities? How could you shift your focus toward increasing the likelihood that your audience will think of your brand? (For example, imagine you run a seafood fast food franchise. Your advertisements may be too focused on positioning your brand as “fresher” than your burger-peddling competitors, and you should instead try to make them humorous and more memorable.)

Sharp claims that brands often tailor their brands to a target demographic that’s too narrow. How could you adjust your service and messaging to appeal to a broader audience? (For example, your seafood chain may only be popular with families, failing to serve individuals looking for a quick bite to eat. You might be able to remedy this by offering a value menu and emphasizing your drive-through service in advertising.)

List all your brand assets. Is there a way you can make them more distinctive or memorable, without changing them in a way that makes them less recognizable? (For example, your seafood restaurant’s brand assets may include a basic text-based logo and nautical theme. You could make these assets more memorable by creating an animated mascot to add to the logo or establishing a consistent color scheme for your nautical branding.)
