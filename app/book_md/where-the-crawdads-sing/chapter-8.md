## Chapter 8: A Beautiful Nightmare—1966 to 1968

A year had passed since Kya and Chase had come together, but things had not progressed physically. What had changed was the way Chase talked about their future. **Chase started talking about building them a house after they were married.** He said Kya could choose whatever kind of house she wanted, and he’d build it for her, including a veranda that looked over the water. Chase’s words were music to Kya’s ears. She would be forever attached to another. She’d finally have a family.

As Chase continued imagining their new home (away from town so Kya would be more comfortable), Kya remembered the conversation they’d had about his parents. Had he told them about her, and would they accept her? Chase said his parents would love and support whatever decision he made. If he said Kya was the woman for him, they’d love her, too. This life all sounded too amazing, and although Kya wasn’t positive she loved Chase like a husband, the fantasy of it made her swell with emotion. Her life could really change.

Chase had to go to Asheville for business over one weekend and wanted Kya to come. Kya hesitated. Asheville was a big city, and she didn’t have the right clothes or know how to act around so many people. Chase assured her he’d take care of her, and if they were going to get married and move closer to town, she’d have to get used to normal life eventually. Kya wasn’t sure, but she wanted to see the countryside and mountains, so she said yes.

### The Long Wait Is Over

The trip to Asheville was dizzying for Kya. She’d never been away from the shore and couldn’t believe her eyes as they drove through barren flatlands. It was her first time in a car. She became even more dazed when they pulled into the Appalachian Mountains, with its windy roads and deep valleys. The way the sun seemed to vanish behind the peaks and appear again a second later disoriented her, being used to the stable schedule of sunrise and sunset along the coast.

When they entered Asheville, Kya couldn’t believe the tall buildings and hundreds of people milling about. She searched each of their faces, hoping to see Ma or Pa among them.

Chase drove across town and pulled into a small drive-up motel. Their room reeked of cleaning supplies and was filled with shabby furniture. The bed took up most of the space, and Kya understood what was about to happen. **With all those lovely nights under the stars, this was where they would consummate the relationship. Nothing about the room felt like love.**

Chase had always been gentle with her on all those nights of touching and kissing. But now, granted access to her body, he plowed forward, ignoring the discomfort that comes with losing one’s virginity, until he was finished. Without any concern for Kya, he rolled over and passed out. The whole time, Kya had watched the blinking neon “Vacancy” sign through the window.

### Is This What Love Is?

After that night at the motel, Chase and Kya continued making love. Kya always experienced an unsatisfied sensation when it was over, but she didn’t know what to say about it or if it was even okay to say something. Weeks went by, and then Christmas was upon them.

Chase had just finished dinner at the shack when he announced he wouldn’t be out to visit for a few days, what with the holidays and all. **Kya dug deep and found the courage to ask whether she might come along to some of the holiday parties and dinner with his family.**

Chase was sincere when he said she wouldn’t be comfortable at any of those town get-togethers. As she’d said before, she didn’t have the right clothes, didn’t know how to dance, and didn’t know anyone who’d be there. Kya questioned whether it wasn’t time for her to start getting used to being in town and going to events, like he’d said, for when they were married.

Chase didn’t want to ruin what they had together. It had always been just the two of them, and their time together was more precious than some stupid dances. They wouldn’t be attending those types of things once they were married anyway, so why start now?

Chase leaned in, touched her face, and stared into her eyes when he said Christmas dinner wasn’t a good idea either. He had annoying relatives coming in, and _he_ didn’t even want to be around them. She wasn’t going to be missing anything good, he assured her. **He left the shack, and just like every other Christmas since Ma had left, Kya spent it alone.**

### The Setback

Chase didn’t return to the shack until a week after Christmas. **Kya had promised she would never be caught waiting on another man again, but each day, she was on the beach desperate to hear the sound of his boat.**

One morning, Kya was finishing breakfast when she heard the whir of a boat entering her lagoon. She raced outside and found an unpleasant surprise. It wasn’t Chase’s boat. It was Tate’s.

Kya thought about running away, but she stood her ground. This was her land after all. She picked up rocks, threw them at Tate, and screamed for him to leave her lagoon. She yelled that she was with someone else now while pelting him with handfuls of pebbles. Tate did his best to duck the onslaught and said he just wanted to talk. He hadn’t planned on speaking about Chase, but since she’d brought him up, he couldn’t stop himself.

Tate told Kya that she didn’t know what Chase was like in town. He dated other women and had left a party the other night with a blonde in his truck. **Kya said that no matter what Chase was doing, none of it was as bad as what Tate had done. He was a coward, and she hated him.**

Tate admitted that Kya was right. He apologized for meddling in her private life and said he just wanted a chance to explain what had happened all those years ago. Kya wanted to rage against him, but she softened. Here was her first love, her companion in the marsh, a person who had known her family.

Seeing an opening, Tate scrambled to get the words out. He regretted leaving her and knew he was wrong in thinking she didn’t fit into his life. He’d never gotten over her and hoped she could forgive him, but even if not, he’d needed to tell her how sorry he was and how much he still thought about her.

Tate wanted to say more. **He wanted to tell her about Chase dancing with all sorts of women at the Christmas party and bragging to his friends about sleeping with Kya.** Chase said she was wild and willing and worth every ounce of gas it took to get to the shack. Tate had forced himself to leave before his anger took over.

Kya kept glancing nervously behind Tate, afraid Chase might pull up any minute, so Tate suggested they go inside. He wanted to see how her collection was coming. He followed Kya inside and gaped at the grandness of what had once been just a hobby.

As Tate took in her meticulous categorization and starkly accurate renderings, he exclaimed that her collection was good enough to be published in a book. Kya rejected this notion, but Tate asked if he could take a few samples to show a publisher in the city. After much persuading, Kya finally let him take a few items. She was afraid of what she’d have to do if people wanted to meet her and discuss a book, but Tate promised he’d take care of everything.

One of the specimens Tate picked up was the first feather he gave her and the painting she’d made of it. They glanced into each other’s eyes, remembering, but Kya looked away. She wouldn’t be dragged back into feeling anything for this man. Tate asked if she could forgive him, but Kya said she didn’t think she could ever trust him again. **After Tate left, Kya couldn’t stop picturing Chase with the blonde in his truck.**

### The Revelation

Chase spent New Year’s with Kya, ringing in 1967 walking arm in arm along the coast and making love. Kya forgot all about what Tate had told her, and the winter months continued, with Chase visiting often and staying over on the weekends.

For Chase’s birthday, Kya wanted to make a special dinner and birthday cake. She took her boat into town one early March morning to buy supplies at the Piggly Wiggly. She was most excited about the cake, figuring she better learn to bake if she was going to be a good wife. Chase had continued to make comments about saving money for their dream home.

When Kya reached the docks at Barkley Cove, she tied off her boat and walked the path to the row of shops. **At the end of the dock, Chase was hanging out with his friends, his arms around a young perky blonde.** Kya had never seen Chase in town and wasn’t sure what to do, but the only way to the store was to pass their group, so she kept on.

When Chase and his friends saw Kya, he immediately removed his arms from around the blonde and casually said hi. He asked if Kya remembered his friends, then introduced her to everyone, his voice losing strength. Kya had been waiting to meet Chase’s friends for so long, and she held her breath, hoping this might be the moment when they could be together for real. She searched for something to say, but the others only eyed her cooly and turned away. Chase lingered, saying he’d be out on Sunday, then hurried away before she could respond.

Kya finished her shopping and went home. She’d purchased a local paper to read about the new lab opening in Sea Oaks. She read the article at the kitchen table, but when she turned to the next page, her heart stopped. **Staring back at her was a large picture of Chase and the blonde he’d had his arm around. It was an announcement for their upcoming marriage.**

Kya ran from the room and collapsed on her bed on the porch. Her body heaved with the force of sobs. She couldn’t believe he would do this to her. Just then, the sound of a motor cut her anguish short. Chase was entering the lagoon. As she had done so many times before, Kya slipped out and hid in the woods. She watched Chase enter the shack, knowing he’d see the open paper, and come out calling her name. She waited until he gave up and left before taking the bread she’d bought for his dinner to feed to the gulls.

### Mania

After feeding the birds, Kya jumped in her boat and motored with unusual speed into the open water. As she raced farther out than she’d ever traveled from land, she cursed to the wind. Finally, she reached her destination, an area of deep currents fed by the Gulf Stream. **Kya had always avoided this part of the water because of the dangerous riptides, but today, she plunged into the heart of them.**

The water was rough and ragged, tossing her small boat here and there. The rip grabbed hold of her boat and thrust her farther into the sea, but she didn’t care. She just wanted to feel something besides pain. Water began to slosh inside her boat, drenching her and spinning her this way and that.

Kya caught a glimpse of a small sandy island in the distance. She fought the currents and made her way toward it. When she beached, she collapsed on the sand. Kya thought about the way Chase had manipulated her with talks of marriage. All he ever wanted was sex, and once he got it, he found someone else more suitable to build his life with. In her heart, she knew she wasn’t sad about losing Chase. **She was sad about losing the dream of a different life.**

Once again, she spoke aloud the words of her favorite poet Amanda Hamilton—a poem about letting love go and watching it drift away. The sun burst through just then and warmed her splotch of land. When Kya sat up, she realized she was sitting among glistening rare shells unseen in this part of the coast.

Kya gathered some shells and headed back into the water. She looked at the sandy island and knew she would be the only person to ever see it. The water had created the island momentarily from shifting sand, and soon the water would rise again and move all of it to another location. **It had been divine intervention that had created that piece of stable land for her to find when she needed solid ground the most.**

### Self-Sufficient

A year had passed since Kya had seen Chase’s wedding announcement. It was now 1968, and she was twenty-two years old. One morning, she walked to the mailbox and found a large package inside. She opened it and pulled out an advance copy of _The Sea Shells of the Eastern Seaboard_ by Catherine Danielle Clark. **Her heart soared at seeing her name on her book, but she had no one to share her joy with.**

After Tate took Kya’s samples to a publisher, Kya had submitted more drawings through the mail. An editor, Robert Foster, allowed the entire interaction to take place through the postal service and sent her a five-thousand-dollar advance for two books: the shell book and another on birds. It was more money than she’d ever thought about.

Kya’s book felt more like a family album with its pages filled with years of her collections. It sold well, and bookstores all along the Eastern Seaboard displayed it in their windows. Royalty checks started to flood in, sometimes made out for thousands of dollars.

Kya knew Tate was to thank for pushing her to publish. He’d helped her turn her passion into a career and made it so she never had to dig for mussels to survive again. She sent him a note at the Sea Oaks laboratory, where he now worked. **She still didn’t trust Tate, but she extended an offer for him to stop by if he was ever nearby to pick up a copy of the book.**

With the advance, Kya got to work on her shack. She hired a contractor to completely renovate it. He fitted the shack with electricity, indoor plumbing, a water heater, a large bathroom with a sink, tub, and toilet, and a brand-new refrigerator and stove. The only thing that remained of her old home was Ma’s wood stove. She bought new furniture for each room of the house except the kitchen, where the old family table still held court.

Once the house was in order, Kya turned to the land. She’d heard from Jumpin' that developers were thinking of turning the marsh and swamp surrounding Barkley Cove into resort hotels. She’d already seen construction around the area, watching with horror as rows of trees were bulldozed and marshes drained. She didn’t want her home to suffer the same fate.

Kya didn’t have any legal papers regarding the ownership of her home or land, so she took the Bible with her family’s names to the courthouse in town to see about attaining a deed. To her delight, Kya’s grandfather had had the land surveyed in 1897. But there were years of back taxes to be paid before the land could be officially claimed, and anyone who paid the fee would own the land. Kya was afraid that forty years of taxes would be too much to pay, but the fee was only eight hundred dollars because of how the land was zoned. **She paid in cash and left with a deed for 310 acres of beachfront property. Her home would always be safe**.

### Turning Tides

Tate accepted Kya’s invitation to stop by a day after receiving her letter. When he pulled up in her lagoon, the first time since the rock-throwing Christmas, he waved and gave a small smile. Kya mimicked both gestures.

Tate marveled about the beauty of her book. He wanted to hug her, but her body language suggested otherwise. Standing on the beach, he thanked her for the book and asked her to sign it. Kya thought about what she could possibly say to Tate. Then, **on the front page, she wrote, “To the Feather Boy, Thank you, From the Marsh Girl.”** When Tate read the words, he turned to hide his emotions. If only he could hold her. He settled for squeezing her hand.

Before Tate left, Kya thanked him for helping her the way he did. **Kya felt a stirring on one side of her heart, but the other was still locked down tight.** She thought maybe she might be able to be his friend or, looking at her book, even his colleague someday.

Later, Kya grabbed another copy of her book and headed to Jumpin’s. When she climbed out of the boat, she placed the book in Jumpin’s hands. He stared at it, not knowing what it was, until she pointed out her name on the cover. She thanked him for all the ways he and Mabel had taken care of her and said that she was finally okay.

Kya continued to visit Jumpin’s wharf for gas and supplies. **She saw her book propped in the window of his store and knew it was the kind of thing a father would do for a daughter he was proud of.**
