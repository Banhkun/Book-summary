## Chapter 2: A New Way of Life—1952 to 1953

Kya had gotten used to hiding in the overgrowth of the marsh for safety, just as Jodie had taught her. So when she heard the sounds of a car coming up the dirt lane to their shack, that’s exactly what she did. From the brush, Kya watched a man and woman step out of the car and walk up the steps to the porch.

**The woman called through the screen door, announcing she was there to take Kya to school.** Kya was desperate to learn to read and find out what came after twenty-nine, but she was afraid of other kids. But when the woman, Mrs. Culpepper, yelled that Kya could get a hot lunch, Kya’s hunger won out. She stepped forward and allowed herself to be taken to school.

Kya was placed in the second grade despite never attending a day of school in her life because they couldn’t find her birth certificate. The classroom held twelve other students, most of them dressed in clean clothes and shoes, and Kya had never seen so many people in one room before. She took a seat in the back of the class, barefoot and in a soiled dress.

When the teacher asked Kya to spell “dog,” she searched her mind for the lessons Ma and Jodie had given her about letters. She wavered and blurted out “G-O-D,” causing the rest of the class to howl with laughter.

### Ostracized

When it was time for lunch, the smell of chicken pie, with its warm flaky crust and thick gravy, made Kya’s mouth water. She couldn’t believe the amount of food the lunch workers had put on her tray: a heaping mound of pie, peas, a yeast roll, banana pudding, and a carton of milk.

The cafeteria was full of all the kids from grades first through twelfth, and everybody had someone to sit with. Kya, avoiding the other faces, especially those of Chase Andrews and his friends, sat at an empty table by herself. At one point, a group of girls wearing blossoming skirts walked in her direction, and **Kya braced in anticipation of their company. But the girls bounced past, ignoring her like everyone else**.

Despite her gut-wrenching hunger, Kya was too nervous to eat, so she drank the milk and shoved the rest of the pie in the carton. She kept her mouth shut the rest of the day, not wanting to give the other kids more ammunition to make fun of her, but it didn’t matter. After school, as the bus drove down the ruddy road to the marsh, the kids, including the girls from lunch (who she named Tallskinnyblonde and Roundchubbycheeks), teased Kya, calling her swamp rat.

Kya ran the three miles from the bus stop to the shack and went straight to the beach. With tears streaming down her face, she fed the swirling and diving birds the chicken pie from lunch. The birds were her only friends, and she wished she could stay with them forever.

Mrs. Culpepper was back at the shack two days later searching for Kya. This time, Kya created decoy tracks in the mud and stayed out of sight. Every few days or so, the car would bound down the lane, and the search for Kya would ensue. **But after a few weeks, Mrs. Culpepper stopped coming. Kya never went back to school.**

### Learning the Ropes

Weeks then months passed, and each morning, Kya still woke hoping to find Ma making breakfast. Pa stayed out of the house more and more, staying away for a week or more at a time. Without money or food, Kya ate Crisco slathered on soda crackers for nourishment. **With no one around to love her, Kya turned to the land—the fields and lagoons of the marsh― for comfort.** The land wouldn’t leave her, and she would never leave it.

Pa finally came home and told Kya he was headed to Asheville to speak with the disability officers about increasing his checks. He’d be gone for four days. Kya watched him limp down the lane, the same one that had taken all of her family away. But this time, Pa looked back and gave a short wave. She hoped this was a good sign.

After Pa left, Kya wandered the lagoon until she was standing next to Pa’s boat. She’d never been out in the boat alone before, but Jodie had shown her how to steer it and navigate some of the channels around their property. **It was risky to take Pa’s boat, especially if he found out, but she felt drawn to the water.** She checked the gas and reckoned there was enough for a quick joyride.

Kya remembered a little bit about how to get through the winding waterways and made her way to the edge of the large estuary stretching toward the horizon. She could tell by the water lines that the tide was going out, and if she didn’t make it back soon, she’d be stranded. Thunderclouds appeared in the distance, and she grew scared.

### The Boy in the Boat

Making her way back through the channels, Kya came across a sight more disturbing than the storm clouds rolling in. Across the water she saw a boy fishing from another boat. He was a few years older, with blond hair covered by a red cap. Kya didn’t want the boy to see her, but she had to motor right past him to make it home. When she did, she tried to be inconspicuous, but the boy turned and gave her a gentlemanly tip of his cap and a friendly smile.

Once past the boy, Kya got lost. She couldn’t find the right series of turns to make it back to her lagoon, and she was running low on gas. Fear settled in. Her only choice was to ask the boy for help. As it turned out, the boy had known Jodie and knew Kya’s name. **Kya beamed, surprised by how good it felt to be known by someone in the world.** A small portion of her sadness lifted. The boy showed her the way home, introduced himself as Tate, and motored away.

Something changed in Kya after seeing Tate. She felt grounded by his calm demeanor and openness, and she longed to see him again.

Tate lived in town with his father, Scupper, who operated _The Cherry Pie_ , a red shrimping boat. **Tate’s mother and sister had died in a car accident in a nearby town a few years back** ,**** and since then,**** father and son lived mostly the same routine. Scupper had a love of opera, and each evening after docking his boat in Barkley Cove’s marina, he and Tate would listen to opera records while cleaning it.

The night after Tate saw Kya, he and Scupper finished cleaning the boat and went home for dinner. Tate told his father about school, saying he didn’t much care for the poetry section they were studying in English. His father told Tate not to dismiss poetry. It made you feel something, and there was nothing wrong with a man feeling things. Scupper told Tate real men weren’t afraid to show emotion, could find beauty in poetry and opera, and would always stand up for a woman in need.

Scupper recited a poem Tate’s mother had loved. It was about a young man meeting his love on a lake and hiding her from death in the trees. **Tate thought of Kya and how scared and alone she seemed out in the marsh.** His dad was right. The poem had made him feel something.

### Better Times Ahead

The only people Kya ever spoke to were Pa and Mrs. Singletary at the Piggly Wiggly, who was teaching her how to count coins. Her only friends were the birds she fed on the beach, but **after seeing Tate, she couldn’t stop thinking about what it might be like to have a real friend**. She would have to figure out some way to get Pa to let her use the boat again.

She figured if she did her part around the house, she could convince Pa to let her take the boat out. So the day after her joyride, Kya cleaned the shack from top to bottom. She scrubbed the kitchen surfaces until they shone, washed the laundry, and walked to town for groceries and gas. Then, she polished Pa’s boat until it reflected the sun.

Kya sat on the porch and waited for Pa to return four days after he left. With each passing hour, she started to fear he’d run off, too. Then, with dusk waning, Pa turned the corner of the bend and headed up the lane. Kya rushed inside to stand next to the kitchen table, where she’d laid out a stew of greens and backbone and a pan of cornbread. The table was set for two with knives on the right and forks on the left, as she’d seen Ma do.

Pa marched into the house and stomped into his bedroom without acknowledging Kya. After noticing the fresh smell and clean sheets, he came into the kitchen and saw what she’d done. **Something in Pa changed at the sight, and Kya could tell he was sober.**

The two ate dinner at the table like a family. They didn’t talk except when Pa offered a rare compliment. Kya waited until they were almost finished with supper before she asked Pa if she could go fishing with him sometime. She thought it was safer than asking to use the boat by herself. Things were going so well, she didn’t want to ruin it.

The next day, Pa took Kya in the boat and taught her how to fish. He didn’t talk about anything but fishing, but he was calm and steady. **When Pa helped her pull in a fish, he smiled for the first time and looked at her with such tenderness, she felt like a connection had been made between them.**

Kya and Pa went fishing again the following day, and she amassed a small collection of feathers, a hummingbird nest, and other natural trinkets. After a dinner of fried fish and greens, Pa gave her his Army backpack to put her collectibles in, the first present he’d ever given her.

For the next couple of months, things were good between Kya and Pa. They went out fishing almost every day, and she’d pack a picnic for the boat. Many days, Pa would stay sober through the afternoon. He told her stories about his family and the old tobacco farm they once owned near Asheville. Kya loved hearing these stories about distant relations. **But** **most of all, she loved feeling like a family again with Pa**.

### A Glimmer of Hope

Winter became spring, and spring grew into summer. It was 1953, and Pa and Kya had settled into their new life together. They ate meals at the table, talked, and sometimes played gin rummy after dinner.

Pa started to take her places, too. On one occasion, he took her to Jumpin’s Gas and Bait, a filling station and fishing shop that sat along the shore between the marsh and Barkley Cove. The shop was a shack on a floating wharf held in place by a cable tied around a tree. Jumpin’ was an old black man with gray hair. He lived in Colored Town, a small Black community located outside of town. He was kind to Kya, as he was with everyone who came to fill up their boats.

On another night, Pa took Kya into town for supper at the local diner. Kya had never been to a restaurant before. Before they went inside, she tried to clean the mud off her dingy clothes and smooth her wild black mane down. Pa ignored the snide looks and comments from the other patrons and ordered them a feast for dinner, including blackberry cobbler for dessert.

Kya waited outside the diner while Pa paid the bill. A small voice said hello, and she turned to find a four-year-old girl in a snazzy dress and blonde ringlets holding her small hand out. Kya was afraid to touch the little girl because of how clean she was, but she extended her hand anyway. Before they could shake, however, Teresa White, the preacher’s wife, burst from a store and shooed Kya away. Mrs. White warned her little daughter not to go near the Marsh Girl because she was dirty. **Kya didn’t have time to be offended, preoccupied as she was watching a mother show love to her child.**

Kya still hoped Ma would return someday. Now that Pa was being civil and engaged, she reckoned things would be better at home if everyone came back. He wouldn’t hit Ma over and over until she fell in a heap anymore. Things would be different. They could be a family again.

All of Kya’s wishing seemed to have worked when she found a letter from Ma in the mailbox one day in early fall. She wanted to rip open the envelope and read what Ma had written, but she didn’t know how. She left the letter on the table for Pa to read when he got home.

When Kya saw Pa coming up the lane, she ran from the house, too nervous about his reaction to the letter. She hid in the outhouse until she was sure he’d read it. After a minute, Pa slammed through the front door and stomped to his boat. Kya ran to the house to retrieve the letter, but all she found were its charred remains in the garbage. She collected the remains and stored them in a glass jar. They were the only pieces of Ma she had left.

After the letter, everything reverted back to the old ways. **Pa was drunk all the time. He never took her fishing again and stopped coming home more often.**
