## Chapter 11: A Different Life—1970 and Beyond

Kya’s supporters, including Scupper, who’d shown up in court a few days earlier to support his son, were impatient for the verdict. Tom told them he couldn’t predict how long the jury would deliberate or what their verdict would be but reminded them that even with a guilty verdict, the fight wasn’t over.

The jury asked for documents twice. The first was the bus drivers’ transcripts. The second was the coroner’s transcript. The hours dragged, and as her support team sat unsettled, so did Kya in her cell. She had lived a life of loneliness, but waiting for the verdict created a sensation like she’d never known. **Thinking of never seeing her beautiful marsh again made her feel more alone than before.**

At four o’clock the same day, the jury had a decision. Tom delivered the news with a solemn expression. A verdict this fast didn’t bode well for Kya. The townspeople clustered back into the courtroom, which was at capacity within ten minutes.

Judge Sims asked Kya to rise. Jumpin' and Mabel clasped hands. Tate leaned as far as he could toward Kya’s back. The energy in the room had shifted from before. **The salivating eagerness of community to condemn Kya was gone. Now, most people stared at the floor. Tom’s words had shown them their folly.**

When the verdict of not guilty echoed through the breathless courtroom, everyone had different reactions. Kya’s supporters gasped with relief, cried, and hugged. Other’s comforted a sobbing Patty Love. Some grew angry, demanding an explanation and pointing the finger at the ineptitude of Sheriff Jackson. Others showed a similar disappointment, but inside, they were overjoyed. These few included Mrs. Singletary, Mrs. Culpepper, and Pansy Price. Soon, the roar died down, and people left the courthouse to return to their regular lives.

### Picking Up Where She Left Off

Jodie drove Kya home from the jail. She was anxious to see her shack and the environment that had saved her all those years. She rushed into the shack and touched every possession. Jodie had a bag of crumbs waiting for her, and she ran to the beach, tossing crumbs to her seabirds and crying with joy.

When Kya got back to the shack, she was surprised to find Jodie still in it, so used to being alone. Jodie asked Kya to sit and have tea with him. He wanted to stay and help her readjust for a few days, and he didn’t want what had happened to harden her even more against people. **Jodie saw the verdict as a new beginning and thought people would accept her now.**

Kya didn’t want to hear anything Jodie had to say. She wanted to be alone, as she’d always been. Kya left the shack and disappeared into the forest, but Jodie couldn’t bring himself to leave. He made dinner, hoping to try again when Kya returned, but she never did.

Kya waited for Jodie to leave before she returned home. She tried to paint, but the images were dark and angry. Kya didn’t know what to do with all the furious emotions she felt, and she was suddenly remorseful for the way she’d treated Jodie. She sank to the floor and cried. Later, Kya found a pelican feather on the beach. It reminded her of the one Tate had given her. She recited a poem by Amanda Hamilton about trying to break free but being haunted by her lover’s eyes.

### Tragedy Strikes Again

The day after returning home, Kya motored through the lagoon and into the channels of her land. She felt free on the water with nothing to stop her from working on her collection the whole day. **Somewhere deep in her mind, she thought maybe she’d see Tate.** Maybe she could invite him to eat the dinner Jodie made, which she hadn’t touched.

Tate was thinking similar thoughts. He had motored to the shallow waters surrounding Kya’s land early to collect samples. He wanted to be close to her, hoping he might see her out there. If he didn’t, he swore he was going to her house that night and would do his best to win her back.

Out of nowhere, the roar of a mighty engine swept over the water. Tate watched as a flashy airboat pulled toward him. In the boat, he saw Ed, Joe, and another man. Kya also heard the boat and moved closer. When she saw the men approaching Tate, she slid into the overgrowth and watched. The men talked to Tate, and his body language changed. His shoulders slumped, and his head dipped in surrender. **Joe pulled Tate into the boat, and the other man jumped into Tate’s. The two boats turned and headed to Barkley Cove.**

Kya was confused and anguished. She realized that seeing Tate had been the biggest motivator for her venturing into the water all these years. Even when she hated him, she always hoped to see him around a bend. Now, what would keep her moving forward if he was no longer there?

### Lost and Found

Tate stood over the grave of his father, guilt and remorse coursing through him. He’d spent so much time wrapped up with Kya’s case and trial, he’d neglected to spend time with Scupper. If he had, he may have noticed his father’s heart was failing.

Everyone from Barkley Cove attended the funeral, everyone but Kya. Fisherman and others who’d known Scupper patted Tate on the back and gave their condolences. After the service, Tate asked for his father’s forgiveness. He felt in his heart that Scupper would forgive him anything. Scupper’s appearance at Kya’s trial was his way of saying he understood Tate’s heart. **Tate looked over the water and hoped Scupper was on a red fishing boat wherever he was.** He set a record player next to the fresh grave and put on Scupper’s favorite opera record.

When Tate got back to the dock, he climbed in his laboratory vessel and saw a feather on his seat. It was the breast feather of a night heron, a bird not normally seen this close to the sea. He knew who had left it.

Tate motored to Kya’s lagoon and waited on the beach as she exited the shack. When she was close enough, he grabbed her and pulled her in. He told her he loved her and always had. She told him the same. Tate said there couldn’t be any more running. If she was going to love him, it had to be completely. Kya grabbed his hand and led him into the woods.

That night, they slept on the beach, and Tate became a resident of the shack a day later. As they walked along the shore, **Tate asked Kya to marry him. She told him they were already married according to nature, and he accepted that as enough**.

### Ever After

Kya and Tate settled into a routine. They ate breakfast every morning, then explored the estuaries, with Tate performing his duties for the lab and Kya collecting specimens for more books. At night, they drifted in her boat and swam naked in the moonlight.

The contractor who’d renovated Kya’s home built a lab for Tate and a studio for Kya behind the shack. They expanded the bedroom and living area inside, and the shack became a cozy cabin. Jodie and his wife, Libby, often visited, and the four of them would explore the marsh.

**Kya never stepped foot in Barkley Cove again.** Her life and trial became folklore around town, and the townspeople spoke of seeing her moving through the water in her boat as though she were a mythical creature. Theories were postulated over the years about what had happened to Chase Andrews, but nothing ever came of them. Everybody believed that Sheriff Jackson had mishandled the case and was wrong for accusing Kya. He was never reelected, and each new sheriff attempted to reopen the case, but eventually, the circumstances of Chase’s death became lore, as well.

One afternoon years later, Tate pulled ashore and told Kya that Jumpin' had passed. Kya felt a chasm of grief open up inside. Like Scupper’s funeral, the whole town showed up for Jumpin’s. Again, Kya did not attend. She held a private ceremony on her beach and said goodbye in her own way. After the funeral, Kya took a jar of homemade jam to Mabel’s. Mabel embraced her, and the two women cried in each other’s arms. **Mabel said Jumpin’ thought of Kya like a daughter, and Kya said Jumpin’ was her real pa.**

Saying goodbye to Jumpin’ brought up feelings of Kya’s mother. She took a moment to say goodbye to her past. She remembered the day Ma walked down the lane in her crocodile shoes, but this time, Ma stopped and waved. Kya felt a release for the first time. Her grief was replaced by joy when Jodie started bringing his children, Murph and Mindy, to visit. Finally, Kya was surrounded in the shack by family.

### Growing Old Together

Barkley Cove was not spared from gentrification over the years. Jumpin’s wharf became an upscale marina, and the little shops on Main Street became boutiques. Grits became polenta, and every establishment was desegregated. **Tate worked at the lab for the rest of his career, and Kya published seven more books, all of which won awards.** She was given an honorary doctoral degree from UNC but never accepted invitations to speak.

Kya and Tate were inseparable. They’d tried to conceive a child, but it never happened. As her relationship grew on solid ground, so did Kya’s understanding of connection. She saw that human love was more than just mating rituals, but she didn’t regret growing up in a world dictated by the laws of nature. She was connected to the land in a way no one else could understand. **The land had raised her, and it was as much a fabric of her life as anything humans could provide**.

One afternoon, when Kya was sixty-four, she didn’t return from exploring in her boat. Tate went to search for her and found her lying back in the boat, seeming to be sleeping. When he got closer, fear gripped his heart. He shouted her name, but she didn’t move. Tate pulled her up by the shoulders, her long hair, now stark white, flowed behind her. He screamed his anguish to the sky and held her, rocking back and forth.

Tate buried Kya below an oak tree near the water. All the people who had once condemned her lined up to pay their respects. They had grown to marvel at the way she had survived and the life she was able to make for herself with everything that had happened. On her tombstone, Tate chose an epitaph he felt represented Kya’s life well. **She had become a legend in their community, and her nickname was now distinguished.** The tombstone read: “Catherine Danielle Clark, ‘Kya’, The Marsh Girl, 1945–2009.”

### What’s Left Behind

After all the mourners had left, Tate walked to Kya’s studio and labeled the samples she hadn’t gotten to yet. Her looked at her collection, fifty years in the making, and knew he would keep it just as she’d left it. She’d wanted it donated to Tate’s lab, but he wasn’t ready to let go yet.

Tate went back to the cabin and started preparing food for the birds. He stirred a pot of mush absentmindedly, thinking of Kya. Then, he saw something that brought him back. Next to the kitchen stove lay the wood pile Kya had always kept stacked high, even in the warm months. At the edge, he noticed the new tiles they’d installed didn’t reach underneath the pile.

Tate leaned down and moved the wood aside until he saw a cutout in the floorboards. He lifted the boards and revealed a hidden compartment encompassing a dusty cardboard box. Inside the box were several manilla envelopes, all labeled “A.H.” and a smaller box. **The poems of Amanda Hamilton lay inside each envelope written in Kya’s hand.** Tate couldn’t believe it. His wife was the poet and had secretly reached out to the world, sharing her most private feelings, and no one had ever known.

There was another envelope that housed only one poem called “The Firefly.” The words described something unmistakable. Kya’s poem was about watching a lover fall into another world, taking his life and their love with them. Tate gasped. He made sure no one was outside before he reached for the smaller box. **He didn’t need to open it to know it held Chase’s shell necklace.**

Tate sat at the table that night going over what must have happened the morning of October 30. He saw her disguised on the buses, riding the riptide and avoiding the moon based on her keen knowledge, luring Chase toward her, her hands on his chest as she moved him closer to the open grate. She knew how to cover her tracks and vanish without a trace.

Tate made a fire and burned the poems and piece of rawhide the shell had hung from. He replaced the boards and wood. He took the shell to the beach and placed it on the sand, where it became just another shell among so many others. **The tide came in and washed the shells back to sea, taking Kya’s secret with them.**
