## Chapter 6: A Beautiful Woman—1965 to 1966

At nineteen, Kya had become a tall, lean, striking young woman. Her hair was long and coal black, and her eyes were large and captivating. She had remained sheltered all these years, with only her collection, textbooks, and poetry to keep her company. **She’d grown accustomed to her life, but she never lost the longing for others.**

One day, Kya sat on Point Beach along the coast between her shack and Jumpin’s watching the tide roll in and out. A crush of voices suddenly filled the air. Kya ran into the forest and watched as a group of young adults scurried over the place she had previously sat. They were the same group she’d seen a few times, the kids who’d scorned her as children now grown up.

The girls included Tallskinnyblonde and Roundchubbycheeks, along with two others, and a handful of boys tossing a football. She recognized one of the boys as Chase Andrews. On occasion, Kya was forced to venture into Barkley Cove, where she’d heard these people snickering behind her back. **She didn’t want to envy them, but she couldn’t help it, especially the girls and their close female bond.**

Kya was transfixed by Chase and his strong tan shoulders. At one point, the football was tossed close to where she was hiding. Chase caught it, and when he pulled back to throw, he saw Kya behind a tree. He threw the ball, then turned and stared at her in the eyes, a small smile creeping across his mouth.

Kya held her breath and felt a warm sensation course through her body. As he ran away, she was overcome with desire. Kya didn’t want to want Chase. In her heart, love no longer existed. She tried to stay away from Point Beach, **but her desire for human contact was stronger than her will, and she went back again and again, hoping to see him.**

### Coming Back to Life

The warmth of being noticed by Chase sizzled like an addiction. It had broken open a part of Kya she’d shut down, and when she went to Jumpin’s the next time, she asked him about Mabel and his family. Jumpin' was surprised at the change in her after so long, but he knew better than to show it.

A few days later, Kya returned to Jumpin’s. Jumpin' wasn’t at his usual post, but someone else was at the wharf—Chase Andrews. Chase approached Kya with all the confidence of someone used to being adored. He asked her if she would join him for a picnic over the weekend. **Kya was apprehensive, but she agreed, not wanting to miss the opportunity to be in someone’s presence again.**

Instead of going straight home, Kya drifted in the open water and stared at the sky. She recited poetry from memory, including one from unknown local poet Amanda Hamilton she’d read in the newspaper. The poem was about love being set free from its cage and allowed to wander the shore. It made her think of Tate, and the old hurt and anger roiled up inside.

What Kya didn’t know was that Tate hadn’t abandoned her, at least not in the way she thought. Tate was ready to leave Chapel Hill as planned the day before the Fourth of July, but his professor at the lab invited him to join a birding expedition over the weekend. He would be the only student in a group of renowned ecologists. There was no way he could refuse.

**Fifteen days later, Tate arrived in Barkley Cove desperate to see Kya and apologize for standing her up.** He headed for the shack, sure that she would forgive him when she heard about his prestigious invitation. As he glided into the channel to the shack, he saw Kya’s boat tied up along the shore. A few feet in front, she was low to the ground examining some type of creature. She hadn’t heard his boat or seen him approaching.

Tate watched, thinking of how beautiful she was barefoot and engulfed in the natural world. He smiled at the care and patience she took seeking and discovering the organisms of the marsh. Then, out of nowhere, Kya stood up on alert. The low hum of another boat was advancing, and Kya dashed into the woods. She was still a distance away, but her hiding spot had brought her close enough for Tate to see her face clearly. Her eyes were wild like a caged animal.

The other boat was a small fishing vessel driven by an old man. He passed through the channel and out to the open sea without seeing either Kya or Tate. Tate hadn’t seen this type of feral behavior from Kya since the feather game. He was taken aback and realized that even if her mind belonged in his new world of laboratories and academics, her life did not. **He knew, in that moment, he would have to make a choice. A life with Kya or a life as an intellectual.** He turned his boat around and headed back to town, ashamed that he didn’t even say goodbye.

### A Second Chance

Kya wandered down to the beach the night before her picnic with Chase. Under the stars and rhythmic chirping and croaking of crickets and frogs, she waltzed across the sand, dreaming of all the ways she wanted Chase to touch her. The way he’d stared at her at Jumpin's had increased her desire. It was a confident look of wanting.

When she met Chase the next morning, her desire shriveled and gave way to anxiety.**** Chase pulled his boat next to hers along the shore down from the marsh and reached out to help her aboard. If she took his hand, it would be the first skin-to-skin contact she’d had in years. After a moment of hesitation, she finally took it and climbed into his boat.

Chase took her to a beach farther down the shore, far from town and her shack. They walked along the sand, not talking and not holding hands, but every few feet, their fingers brushed between them. Kya worried that Chase was only hanging out with her out of curiosity, rather than real interest, but she reasoned it didn’t matter. **All she wanted from Chase was a reprieve from loneliness. Her heart would never be involved enough to get hurt.**

They sat on the sand, and Chase picked up an unusual shell. Kya quickly identified the name of the species and said it was rare to see it so far north. Chase stared at her confused, obviously not expecting the Marsh Girl to speak like a biologist. The information didn’t impress him one bit. He just thought the shell was cool. He gave it to Kya, since she knew so much about it.

Chase spread a blanket and pulled out the lavish picnic he’d brought: fried chicken, ham, biscuits, potato salad, and cake. He gave Kya a soda, the first in her life. Kya knew Chase’s mother was likely the one who’d packed the picnic, and she knew there was a good chance she’d had no idea who it was for. As they ate, they spoke of the water and seabirds flying above, nothing deep or personal.

They hadn’t touched the whole meal, but when it was over, Chase leaned in for a kiss. His hands fluttered softly against her face and neck, then one hand slid over her blouse toward her breast. They tipped backwards, and suddenly Chase was on top of her. In one motion, he positioned himself between her legs and pulled her blouse up. **Kya pushed against his chest, wriggled free, and yanked her shirt down. Her black eyes burned into him.**

Chase spoke calmly, telling her everything was okay. He tried to touch her face, but Kya jumped up. She’d imagined him touching her the night before and understood mating rituals of the wildlife in the marsh, but sex was different. Her only experience was the close call with Tate, and she realized she wasn’t ready. She should have known this was all Chase wanted. Men were no different than any other male species. They only came around when it was time to mate.

It was true—initially Chase had only asked her out so he could be the first to bag the Marsh Girl. But after seeing her eyes ablaze, he was struck by her beauty and raw power. He apologized and tried to get her to calm down, but Kya turned and ran into the woods. She followed the pattern of blackbirds until she was back by her boat. **She was ashamed of how much she’d wanted to be touched, so much that she’d made herself easy prey.**

### Wanting to Believe

The next time Kya saw Chase was ten days later sitting alone in his boat off the shore of Point Beach. She knew what he’d done was wrong, but he’d also stopped when she said to and apologized. Her loneliness convinced her to give him a second chance.

When Kya motored up to his boat, Chase again apologized. He offered to show her a view of the marsh from the top of the fire tower. The fire tower stood in the swamp on the other side of Barkley Cove, a place Kya had never ventured before. Once at the top, Kya greeted the full form of her true soulmate for the first time. The marsh was beautiful in its entirety.

**Chase** **said he knew he was out of line before and would never pressure her again. In response, Kya took a necklace from her pocket.** She’d made it with the shell they’d found on the beach. She was planning on wearing it but, in the moment, decided Chase should have it. Chase put it on, letting his fingers linger on the shell.

Chase wanted to see where Kya lived. Kya couldn’t imagine showing him the rundown shack, but she didn’t want to mess up this opportunity to be accepted by another, so she agreed. When Chase entered the shack, he was greeted with ten years of specimens lining every inch of the shack. He examined them, surprised that she’d amassed such a large and intricate collection, had painted all the illustrations and organized them so skillfully. Again, his interest waned. He didn’t understand why you would go to so much trouble for stuff you see lying around outside.

Tate was the only other person who’d ever been in the shack in almost ten years. He had always seemed to belong there, but Chase was different. Kya felt on display and ashamed of her meager home. So she was surprised when Chase complimented her, saying he didn’t know anyone else who could have survived the way she had.

Feeling the moment upon her, she asked Chase why he was spending time with her. He admitted that lust had been his motivation, but he’d changed. Now, Chase just wanted to be near Kya and get to know her.

Kya led him to the beach, a piece of stale cornbread in her hands for the birds. As Kya fed the birds and became engulfed in their gleeful dance, Chase felt a stirring inside. **He’d never intended to have feelings for the feral Marsh Girl, but he couldn’t help but be entranced by her bravery and beauty.** He asked if he could come back again, and Kya nodded.

### Just Like Heaven

During the first week of their relationship, Chase visited Kya every night. They’d take his boat and explore the marsh estuaries. One weekend, he took her farther up the coast than she’d ever been. The water was clear and uninhabited by water plants like in the marsh. Kya avidly took notes on everything she saw. She motioned for Chase to slow down whenever deer or nests were present, and she collected whatever new specimens she could find.

Chase thought Kya’s habits were ridiculous. He was annoyed with her concern for the wildlife and questioned why she cared so much. When Kya told him she wanted to learn about the marsh, he said all she needed to know was when the fish were biting. **Kya laughed despite herself. For the first time, she betrayed her own interests for a man.**

Chase and Kya never met in town and never went on normal dates. They were isolated in their courtship, but Chase always remained the gentleman. Then, one night, they were huddled around a small beach fire under a blanket when Chase asked to kiss her. They kissed passionately, but Chase didn’t push for more.

Things continued in this way, but after the first couple of weeks, Chase’s visits became more sporadic. Once again, Kya was consumed with longing as she waited on her beach for the sounds of Chase’s boat, never knowing when he might show up. To shake herself out of this desperate, hopeful routine, she packed a bag and decided to go to the secret cabin.

Being away from the possibility of Chase’s visits was a relief. Without the sick worrying, Kya was free to explore and read. She’d started going to a library in Sea Oaks, a larger town down the coast, where no one knew her or whispered about the Marsh Girl behind her back. She checked out college-level science books and read to her heart’s content in the cabin.

When Kya returned to her shack, she found Chase, shaken from the surprise of not finding her there when he wanted her. He started scheduling his visits and was always punctual.

**Kya started fantasizing about what it might be like to be part of Chase’s real world.** She imagined them picnicking with his friends, marriage, and children, but every time she thought about broaching the subject, she clammed up.

Months had passed since that first picnic on the beach, and Chase had kept his promise to not pressure her. One day, they were lazing on his boat off the coast, and Chase suggested they go swimming. He told her he wouldn’t look when she took off her clothes, but when she pulled her shirt off, he stared at her bare chest. Slowly, he began undressing her down to her underwear. To be touched was glorious, and Kya moved against him. But when he tried to take off her underwear, she stopped him.

Chase protested that it had been long enough and he’d been good. Kya asked what would happen after she gave in. How could she be sure he wouldn’t abandon her once he got what he wanted? Chase said no one ever had guarantees, but he was falling for her. Wasn’t that good enough? Kya searched his expression, looking for a trace of the love he’d professed, but his face was hard and gave nothing away. **Still, she wasn’t alone, and that seemed good enough for now. She told him she’d be ready soon.**

### An Old Flame Extinguished

Kya was gliding through the channels one day when she saw Tate in the distance. It wasn’t the first time she had spotted Tate out in the waterways, but he was closer than before. She watched as he now expertly collected samples in official-looking lab vials. **Tate was out of her league, and she knew it.** She rowed silently away.

A while later, Tate was home from graduate school and decided he was going to visit Kya. It had been five years since he’d left her on the shore before heading to college. He knew he’d been a coward for never contacting her, but he wanted her back and would beg for her forgiveness.

Since that day he’d come back after the Fourth of July, he’d continued to believe that Kya wouldn’t fit in his new world. He’d tried dating a few women, but they were never Kya. So when Tate heard that a federal research lab was being built in Sea Oaks, he decided he would apply to be a scientist there. He would finish his degree and move to the marsh with Kya.

Tate neared the channel to the marsh and saw Kya motoring fast in her boat. He tried to get her attention, but it was focused elsewhere. Chase’s boat was coming toward her. Tate’s heart dropped. He’d heard people talking in town about the possibility of this relationship, but seeing it hurt him. **It also hurt Tate that Kya had no idea that Chase was living a different life in Barkley Cove, one that included other women.** Still, Tate had mistreated Kya, too, and could not bear judgment on Chase’s actions. He cursed himself for leaving Kya and returned to town.

### What the Future Holds

Kya made a trip into Barkley Cove one day when she needed something Jumpin' didn’t carry. When she was leaving the Piggly Wiggly, she almost ran straight into Chase’s parents. Patty Love was dressed immaculately, as usual. Kya knew who they were, as they did her, and she hoped to receive some acknowledgment from them. **But Chase’s parents stopped abruptly and made a wide circle around Kya, like she was a walking plague.**

That night, while she and Chase floated in his boat, Kya mentioned running into his parents. She asked if she might meet them soon. Chase promised she would and held her hand, but he didn’t look at her when he said it.
