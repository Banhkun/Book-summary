## Prologue: 1969

A swamp should not be mistaken for a marsh. A marsh is alive, full of light, winged birds, and grasses stretching through glistening water toward the sky. The marsh meets with the sea and holds various creeks and lagoons that reach like fingers for the open water.

A swamp, however, is devoid of light and life. It lies in the dark, and life decays and transforms into its most basic cellular level in stagnant, fetid water. **It was fitting, then, when the body of Chase Andrews was discovered on October 30, 1969, in a swamp along coastal North Carolina.**

If it hadnâ€™t been for two boys from town, who found the body below the old fire tower, the body would have continued to decompose and sink into the muddy water. The swamp would have enveloped it without circumstance or judgment. After all, it was just another mass of cells returning to the earth.
