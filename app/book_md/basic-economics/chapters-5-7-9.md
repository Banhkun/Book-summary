## Chapters 5-7-9: Business Operations

The book explains the economics behind a number of business operations, including the role of middlemen, the cost of inventory, and executive compensation.

### Changes in Markets

Businesses need to respond to a variety of changes:

  * Social changes
    * In the 19th century, the majority of people lived in small rural communities, with high cost of goods to small scattered stores. Montgomery Ward operated a mail order service, delivering products at lower costs than those charged by rural stores. But as urbanization happened in the 1920s, urban department stores became more efficient, leading to the rise of JC Penney. 
    * Grocery chain A&P was dominant for decades, from the 1930-50s. Located in central cities, A&P stores had operational efficiency that allowed charging lower prices. However, the automobile led to suburbanization, which led to supermarkets and their advantages of scale (including lower delivery costs per unit, and larger transaction sizes with lower overhead per $).
  * Economic changes
  * Technological changes
    * Rockefeller produced new products from petroleum, extracting more value and reducing the price of its main product kerosene, instead of letting it go to waste. 
    * Newspapers were the primary means of disseminating news, until the Internet made them largely obsolete.
    * Digital cameras made film photography like with Kodak obsolete. (Ironically, Kodak invented the digital camera.)
  * Business model changes
    * With the rise of credit cards, retailers often made more profits from managing their own credit card programs than from actually selling goods.
  * Changes in business leadership



**Often companies fail to adapt because their calcified ways of doing things are not efficient at producing the new type of product people want.** Howard Johnson’s fast food chains failed to compete with McDonald’s because its restaurant practices were less efficient at creating fast food than McDonald’s practices, which were optimized from the start.

### Specialization and Middlemen

**A company is limited in the range of functions it can perform efficiently.** Only a certain number of links in the value chain can be mastered and operated efficiently by the same set of people.

General Motors is excellent at making automobiles, but it leaves tire manufacturing and car sales to others. Compared to local dealerships, it is too much for GM to track local conditions across the United States, decide where a lease location is most effective, understand the trade-in value of a Honda in Seattle vs Miami, etc. Similarly, authors don’t own their own bookstores, and companies often hire outside marketing agencies.

**Middlemen exist when they can do their part of the chain more efficiently than others can.** Put another way, middlemen are able to get more value from a company’s output than the company itself can, so it bids the price of the output higher than the company would be willing to buy from itself.

(Shortform note: changing capabilities mean the company can both bring a capability in-house and outsource something formerly in-house. Eyewear brand Warby Parker sells direct to consumers (using the Internet as distribution) instead of paying for presence in retail stores, thus cutting out a middleman like Sunglass Hut. Conversely, tech companies used to build and manage their own computer servers at great expense, but now have largely outsourced to convenient providers like Amazon Web Services.)

**Developing countries tend to have more middlemen, which is often lamented as waste, but reflects the reality of more limited capabilities by providers at each step of the chain.** Instead of ten farmers taking time off to carry their produce to town for sale, one middleman collects the produce of many farmers and drives it to a buyer. (In contrast, in the US, a farmer may own vehicles and siloes that are so efficient they make a middleman unnecessary). Society as a whole saves on the amount of resources required to get the produce on the market, with the cost being the profit made by the middleman.

Similarly, in developing countries, there are often more middlemen between the manufacturer of goods and the consumer. **The limiting factor here is the poverty of the consumer, who can buy much less at once.** In Africa you might see small traders sitting with their wares outside retail stores, selling volumes as small as half a cigarette. Here, the store owner clearly sees it as less efficient to break down their packaged goods into minute quantities and to handle tiny transactions, and is thus content to outsource that consumer need to a middleman. And higher in the chain, it is not efficient for Nabisco or Philip Morris to break down their pallets into individual-cigarette sized packages, so middlemen do this distribution job for them.

**In more prosperous countries, technology reduces the number of middlemen** , with each producer producing more output, storing it more efficiently, and transporting a greater volume on highways; and with wealthier consumers buying more in one shopping run.

### Peak Capacity

In industries with fluctuating demand, enterprises often need to **reserve enough capacity to handle peak volume, which means there is excess capacity at non-peak times**. In non-peak times, prices will lower to attract budget-conscious consumers - like cruise ships offering reduced fares in the off season.

In one amusing situation, a Ritz-Carlton in Cancun was offering rooms at $169 a night, while a Best Western was $180 a night. Why? Budget-conscious travelers tend to prebook in advance to lock in rates, leaving the higher-priced hotels more subject to fluctuations. When travel reduced in 2001, luxury hotels had to discount their goods to fill excess capacity.

These principles often don’t apply in government projects - a tollway tends to charge the same amount no matter the time of day, even though it’s stuffed during rush hour and idle in off hours. For efficiency, **ideally the toll should increase in peak demand times and be costless in other times, shifting demand to other hours**. This would smoothen out demand and even reduce the amount of capacity required, lowering the cost of construction. However, politically these efforts are unpopular, given the number of toll payers who have inflexible schedules and would be disadvantaged at certain times.

### Inventory

In a related concept, **inventory costs money and doesn’t earn any. Inventory is a substitute for knowledge** \- if a factory knew exactly what parts were needed at what times, there would be no inventory needed.

Japanese manufacturers practice “just in time” inventory, where their inventory might just last an hour. They can rely on this because of high reliability from upstream manufacturers and delivery services, who themselves compete on quality and price in the market economy. Reliability is a matter of economic life and death for these vendors.

**When the suppliers are unreliable, it makes sense to keep a larger inventory and even manufacture your own components, to guarantee your output.** This leads to waste of scarce resources.

In the Soviet Union, state-run enterprises often provided unreliable service and poor quality. In turn, private enterprises, who had little profit incentive to force down costs (because of price controls) while having strict quotas to meet, often made their own components. This was wasteful, since parts were being produced redundantly.

  * (Shortform note: a vicious cycle may also be in effect here - the more inventory a company keeps, the less need there is for external suppliers, which worsens the suppliers’ quality further, which in turn encourages keeping more inventory.)



Other factors of uncertainty increase the need for inventory, such as in sub-Saharan Africa, where geographical locations are cut off by weather sporadically throughout the year. Here maintaining large inventories is necessary, but adds inventory costs and reduces standard of living.

Sometimes economic uncertainty, like in recessions, leads companies to draw down their inventory instead of maintaining a constant inventory:sales ratio. In this way, a “jobless recovery” from a recession may occur as vendors sell goods off their shelves without replenishment.

### Limited Liability

**In corporations, the owners are not personally responsible for the financial obligations of the organization.** This is unlike partnerships, family businesses, or individual proprietorships.

This limited liability is **critical to encourage pooling of capital from vast numbers of people to pursue ambitious, risky ventures.** These businesses are often too large to be financed by a few individuals, and so they must raise capital from individuals directly or through intermediaries like pension funds. Without limited liability, **if shareholders could be personally responsible for the corporation, the barrier to investment raises considerably, and risky projects may not be born.**

What about the well-being of lenders, who have limits to how much they can collect from limited liability businesses that go bankrupt? Lenders understand the implications of limited liability and adjust their risk estimations accordingly, requiring higher interest rates.

### Corporate Governance

Much is said about the separation of ownership and management, and how managers can run enterprises for their own interests at the expense of shareholders. Consumer advocates have pushed for greater involvement for shareholders in managing the business.

**Yet many shareholders want the rewards of investing without the bother of managing.** This is evidenced by the fact that large shareholders could start their own businesses if they really wanted managing responsibilities.

In other words, **corporations are undemocratic because shareholders _may not want_ them to be democratic**, nor would they want outside observers with no financial stake to have a say in the management of a corporation.

When an outside investor buys enough stock to take over corporations, this may not be a tragedy - they have both the incentives and expertise to improve an enterprise in a way that common shareholders may not.

### Executive Compensation

The average pay of CEOs in public companies in the S&P was $10 million a year. While this is a lot, it’s also less made by some athletes and entertainers. It’s also less than the average pay for CEOs at private corporations owned by a small number of financiers, who have the incentive to set the right pay level, and thus may reflect the market price for CEOs.

**Severance packages of millions have been criticized, but it is far better to terminate a failing CEO that can cost a company billions.**(Shortform note: also, if an incoming CEO knows she’ll receive a severance package if terminated, it gives her greater courage to undertake risky actions to change the company’s fortunes, rather than stay timid merely to keep her job.)
