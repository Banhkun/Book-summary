## Chapter 12: Other Problems in Labor Markets

### Unemployment Statistics

Unemployment rate is usually defined as the percentage of people who are **_looking for jobs_** who are unemployed.

If the base - the number of people who are _looking_ for jobs - **decreases due to giving up** or going back to school or retiring, then **the unemployment rate can decrease even if the number of people without jobs increases**.

Furthermore, comparisons across countries and cultures can be problematic. Countries with more generous welfare and unemployment policies, like France, can remove people from the labor force, thus decreasing unemployment rate. For instance, over 70% of people aged 55-64 work in Switzerland, compared to 37% in France, whereas the unemployment rates do not look as stark.

An alternative metric is to **measure what percentage of the adult population outside of institutions (colleges, the military) is working**.

The unemployment rate can never reach zero because of “frictional unemployment” - the time and effort for employers and workers to find each other. This should be distinguished from long-term unemployment.

### Safety Laws

Thomas Sowell admits that one aspect of labor regulation has special exemption - safety laws that protect the general public. Examples include working hour limits for pilots and truck drivers, where accidents can endanger many others. Employers and employees may not consider the externalities of their work, so safety laws are useful safeguards.
