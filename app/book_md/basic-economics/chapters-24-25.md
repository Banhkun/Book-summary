## Chapters 24-25: Myths about Markets

Many misconceptions have been addressed above. We’ll summarize important ones here for good measure.

### Myth: The Market as a Thing, Not as Humans

A market is just humans engaging in transactions among themselves. When it’s treated instead as a depersonified, third-party entity, **rhetoric is allowed that takes away freedom from humans to transact on mutually agreeable terms.**

Instead, restricting markets should be treated as subjecting humans to the will of third parties. (Shortform example: for instance, wage control laws may be seen as “preventing landlords and tenants from exchanging on the natural market price, thus leading to undersupply and increasing homelessness.”)

### Myth: Profits as Gratuitious

Profits have been seen, at different times throughout history, as gratuitous overpayment beyond costs that restrict standard of living of people at large. Implicit in this is the assumption that whatever profits entrepreneurs and investors earn exceed the value they contributed.

However, it’s clear that without private property rights and financial incentives, as in the Soviet Union, living standards simply worsen. **People simply do better jobs when they have a personal incentive to do a better job than when they don’t.**(Shortform note: deeper reasons for this are not explored in the book, but are likely contributed to through innate biology and general inability of humans to act like self-sacrificing drones in a hive.)

No one would say that wages were just arbitrary charges added to the price of goods for the benefit of workers, when the product would not exist without the workers, and they wouldn’t work without being compensated. Yet the same should be considered true of entrepreneurs and investors - the profits are incentive for the company creators to start the company and produce the service. This is just not often considered because the risks of failure and difficulty of work on that level are more opaque than the profits gathered.

An economist would argue - **the profits an owner earns are exactly the measure of the owner’s contribution to production**. If the same contributions were available from others at lower cost, then those options would already exist.

### Myth: Different Prices for the Same Thing

It may seem befuddling that an identical product is priced differently at two different stores. How can this exist in an efficient market?

**Physically identical things often have different prices because of different conditions.** Cheerios may be more expensive in a modern supermarket with warm customer service, generous refund policy, in a location with more expensive real estate, and more consistent inventory; than in a remote budget warehouse store with spotty inventory.

### Myth: “Reasonable” or “Affordable” Prices

Saying prices should be more reasonable is to say that economic realities should adjust to our budget or what we are willing to pay. This, of course, is wishful thinking in a world of scarce resources.

In an effort to reduce prices, governments may forcibly lower prices without lowering corresponding costs. The costs to produce something are what they are; instead the costs are shifted from the buyer to society at large, like through taxes or lower quality goods.

### Myth: Brand Names are Just Psychological Tricks

Brand names are sometimes considered a psychological trick to charge a higher price by persuading people there is a quality difference that doesn’t exist.

Functionally, **brand names signal higher quality because the brand owner has more to lose by offering low quality**. If you drive into town and eat at a local diner and get poisoned, you have less recourse and the diner owner has less to lose - he may simply disappear or go bankrupt, with little consequence to anyone else.

In contrast, if you get poisoned at a McDonald’s, you can publicize the story or sue for damages, which can instantly extend to lower business at thousands of other branded stores. **Thus owners of brands like McDonald’s have more at stake to insure quality, which itself increases quality.**

**Brand names aren’t guarantees, but they do reduce the range of uncertainty.** They force producers to take responsibility for what they make, suffering consequences for poor quality.

(Shortform note: this might imply that brand names have greater value in remote regions with fewer pre-existing brands and weaker legal recourse for mistreatment, possibly explaining the rapidity of “globalization” and brands worldwide.)

**Brand names are substitutes for scarce knowledge.** Instead, in a world of plenty knowledge, if you know how to assess quality among offerings without brand names, you can likely get a better deal than just relying on the brand name.

Interesting point: in the absence of brands, as in the Soviet Union, consumers learned to read barcodes to identify goods that came from more reliable factories. People still desired to find the best goods, and the barcodes served as unintentional brands.

### Myth: Non-profit Organizations Can Be as Efficient as Companies

Normal profit-and-loss businesses have strong incentives to respond to feedback from both customers and investors. These outside forces counteract the tendency of insiders to use the organization’s resources to benefit themselves - an owner who reinvests little of the company’s profits may find her product failing relative to competition, thus reducing the very ability to earn profits in the future.

**Non-profit organizations are thus insulated to varying degrees from responding to this feedback.** Legally, a non-profit cannot distribute surplus income to shareholders, which means there is less incentive to be efficient.

Furthermore, non-profits face less pressure from its customers, since it doesn’t rely on them to survive. Non-profits are often funded primarily by donations, and secondarily by revenue. This often means the **product offered is heavily subsidized** , and “customers” (the recipients of the product) are not paying the full cost of the product or receiving it for free.

In turn, this means the **customers wield much less pressure on a non-profit** than they otherwise would as fully-paying customers of a profit-and-loss business. In other words, even if an organization’s customers decided to completely boycott the company, the organization would still survive from donations. In cases where the non-profit issues grants of money, the recipients are in no position to influence the way the non-profit operates.

Similarly, **donors to non-profits cannot closely monitor what happens to donations**. Many of the largest donors may be deceased. It’s thus common for organizations to veer from their original founding mission to benefit current officials. Granting academic tenure in universities, allowing professors to shirk their duties, can be considered one example that is unheard of in for-profit companies.

As with other market distortions (like artificially low prices in rent control), non-profits can behave in ways that reduce inefficiency, like hiring discrimination, because there is a surplus of applicants.

It might be tempting to consider that non-profits may be as effective as for-profits. If true, this would suggest that **non-profits should take away customers of for-profits and grow larger over time. In reality, the reverse is more likely to occur** , where non-profits hospitals, universities, and even social aid programs have increasingly been displaced by for-profit organizations.

(Shortform note: from the most generous viewpoint, **nonprofits may be subsidizing services that for-profit enterprises underestimate the value of, or find difficult to extract value from** \- like malaria bednets or teaching kids how to read (because you can’t take a fraction of their future wages). Basic science research may be too high-risk and take too long to commercialize for any single company to fund adequately. Governments should provide these services, but we already know how misaligned political incentives are.)

### Non-Economic Values

Economics can seem too calculating and ignorant of “non-economic values.” Instead, Thomas Sowell argues economics is merely a way of weighing one value against another - it does not prescribe anything like making the most money possible or how to make use of wealth. In this sense, all values are “non-economic values.”

**People dislike economic arguments when they prefer not to consider tradeoffs of their values against anything else.** If they want to preserve a historic building, they don’t want to consider how that money might be better used vaccinating kids in Africa. To them, economics is a nuisance that obstructs them from what they’ve set their hearts on doing. In reality, we live in a resource-scarce world with constraints that requires tradeoffs.

**The value of a human life is particularly controversial.** Many justifications of great expenses rest on being “worth it just to save one human life.” **But clearly a life doesn’t have infinite value** \- few would favor spending the entire GDP of the US to keep one person alive for 1 minute longer. Given that this extreme is untenable, the reality must be somewhere on a spectrum and not an absolute.

Furthermore, this argument ignores alternative ways to save human lives in other ways, like generating more wealth. If a human life is by consensus valued at 1 million dollars, then a policy that costs 10 million dollars can no longer be considered worth it “to save one human life” since it effectively costs 10 human lives.

A related feeling is the decrying of Wall Street greed - that the demands of financial analysts are insensitive to the idealistic needs for newspapers or American manufacturers to continue existing without a profit. But this ignores the needs of many other people who are stakeholders in financial investments - like millions of pension holders who don’t want low rates of return on money invested in newspapers. People who make arguments like these are **asking for special treatment of an in-group at the expense of other individuals** , often summarized in impersonal terms like “the marketplace.”

### Imprecise Predictions in Economics

Economics is rigorous in the sense that data are used to resolve mutually contradictory theories. However, it suffers from the inability to conduct controlled experiments, reducing its precision and repeatability.

Yet fields like astronomy don’t allow controlled experiments and are still highly accurate - why? In economics as in meteorology, the principles are sound, but there is great complexity in the combinatorial interaction between variables, as well as the uncertainty around which principles apply in a particular situation at a particular time.
