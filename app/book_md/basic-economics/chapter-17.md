## Chapter 17: Money, Banking, and Inflation

**Money facilitates the production and distribution of wealth.**

Barter of goods and services is awkward - if you make a chair, you may not want enough apples for the value of a chair, nor will the apples retain value for long. If you do accept apples, you may then need to spend time finding someone else who will trade for apples. You might also produce fewer chairs, knowing it’s difficult to get paid for your chairs.

**Money allows chairs and apples to be exchanged for an intermediary thing, which can be subdivided into very small units.** When people agree on what will be used as the intermediary of exchange, that becomes money. To an individual, **money is equivalent to wealth only because it can be exchanged for real goods and services**.

### Banking

**What purpose do banks serve?** First, they guard money, for which they have economies of scale compared to individual businesses.

More importantly, **banks supply businesses with money and lines of credit to bridge them over unpredictable drops in income and allow them to undertake large investments.** Here banks also have economies of scale and risk pooling, reducing lending costs below those of their customers. In turn, businesses that borrow can operate on a larger scale, reducing cost and improving societal standards of living.

These loans arise from money deposits, which enable distribution of resources through the economy with banks as an intermediary.

A bank makes efficient use of its deposits for 2 reasons. First, not all depositors are going to want all their money at the same time, so they need only hold a fraction of the reserves. Secondly, banks settle transactions between each other not by transferring the literal amounts, but rather settling the difference in total balance.

Because of this efficiency, banks practice **fractional reserve banking** , wherein they **hold only a fraction of the reserves needed to cover deposits** (in the US, the reserve requirement is about 10%). They then issue loans and earn interest. These credits are re-deposited in other banks, allowing further rounds of expansion to occur.

The bank’s leverage and creation of credits means that a bank’s collapse would cause credits to disappear, reducing monetary demand.

The Federal Reserve is a central bank run by the government. It determines the reserve requirement, lends money to the banks at interest rates it specifies, thus indirectly controlling the interest rate the general public receives.

Finally, banks also finance consumer purchases by extending consumers credit and paying for purchases.

In countries with lower trust in banks, like in India, much money is held in gold, **which means a large portion of wealth does not finance investment to create additional output**. Further, in countries with primarily state-run banks, money is often lent at a low interest rate to subsidize government projects, rather than finding the best use of the money with the highest returns.

#### Bank Regulation

The government tries to reduce banking risks, but may create policies with unintended consequences.

  * State deposit insurance laws forbade banks from having branch offices. While intended to protect local banks from larger banks headquartered elsewhere, it concentrated risk by forcing a bank’s depositors and borrowers in the same place, thus subjecting them to the same risk.
  * Deposit insurance creates a moral hazard wherein banks may adopt riskier investments, since its losses are effectively covered by an outside entity.
  * The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 sought to lower the barrier for home ownership for low income individuals, which pushed banks to lower mortgage loan approval standards to meet government quotas. This contributed to the mortgage loan crisis in 2008.



### Inflation and Deflation

#### Inflation

**Inflation is a general rise in prices.** It happens when people have more money without a corresponding increase in the volume of output - thus people bid against each other and increase prices.

**To increase wealth, government officials are often tempted to create more money and spend it** \- an opaque and subtle change - rather than increase taxes. Not only are taxes inherently disliked by voters, they tend to reduce output since they reduce the rate of return on activities.

For example, fighting a war may require half a country’s output. For the government to buy this output, instead of taxing everyone a higher amount, it may choose to create more money for itself. This increases money supply just as consumer goods become more scarce (since output is diverted to warfighting). This leads to inflation.

**To prevent government abuse of creating more money, many countries have preferred using money that has an inherently limited supply, like gold.** When money is “backed” by gold, it means that gold limits the amount of paper money that can be issued. It does not prevent inflation or deflation, but it keeps both within narrower limits. Increases in supply of gold (like discovering large gold deposits) can increase prices.

Similarly, gold is preferred by some as a store of value, even though gold earns no interest. Increases in the price of gold reflect worry about inflation that can erode the power of official currencies. Likewise, long periods of price stability see gold prices fall.

Inflation disproportionately affects the poor, since the rich often have their wealth invested in assets that rise in value with inflation, like stocks or real estate.

**Doubling the money supply while fixing the amount of goods may more than double price level, since people may lose faith in the money and increase spending to convert money into assets, bidding up prices.** This can lead to runaway inflation, as happened in Germany in the 1920s. In runaway inflation, producers find it risky to produce, since by the time they sell their output the price may represent less purchasing power than what they spent.

#### Deflation

**Deflation is a general decrease in prices.** It occurs when less money circulates relative to output.

**Deflation can be a problem because debts are fixed in the absolute amount of money that is owed, even though that number now represents increased purchasing power** , effectively raising the payment amounts. For instance, in a deflationary period, a debt of $1000 started 5 years ago may now represent $1300 in purchasing power, and so the debtor likely has to pay a greater fraction of his income than before. Aggravating the problem, income tends to decrease in deflationary periods. Trouble for debtors becomes trouble for creditors as debtors default.

Similarly, companies that have already incurred costs for services at pre-deflation prices can no longer charge pre-deflation prices for their goods. This threatens the survival of the company.

Similarly, when wages were specified in contracts, workers who kept their jobs earned more purchasing power than originally signed. However, employers tend to let go of workers since they are now more relatively expensive.

In deflationary periods, **people hold onto their money for longer since employment and business stability are now more insecure**. This causes fewer purchases, less production of new goods, with less demand for labor and unemployment, which then feeds back into holding further money in a vicious cycle.

During the Great Depression, the US government made mistakes by raising the interest rate, fixing wage rates at pre-depression levels, and propping up prices of farm products - all moves that hampered investment and employment.

Aggregate demand is created not just by the government but also by credits and leveraged lending. When credits are liquidated, this reduces aggregate demand, just as if the official money supply had contracted.
