## Chapters 14-15: Insurance, Human Capital, Natural Resources

This chapter considers other vehicles dealing with risk and time, such as insurance and human capital.

### Insurance

Like speculators, **insurers take on risk from individuals because they can weather individual risks by pooling large numbers.**

Insurers also seek to reduce risk, charging lower prices to safe drivers and reducing premiums for losing weight. **Higher prices for more risk conveys to people the costs created by their chosen activity or behavior and incentivizes them to reduce risk.**

From the individual’s perspective, insurance also reduces risk - the cost of insurance has to be less than the cost of uninsured risk, otherwise the transaction wouldn’t happen. Without insurance, the higher cost must be priced into the product - **thus, the cost of an insured product is lower than the cost of an uninsured product.**

Insurers take money from premiums and invest - approximately 66% of life insurance companies’ income comes from premiums, and 25% from earnings on investments. Insurers aren’t just making outsized profits - competition reduces the cost of premiums to a market equilibrium.

When an entity becomes large enough, they can self-insure at cheaper rates. Car rental agency Hertz may own enough cars that it can assess risk across its fleet and price risk into the rental cost, perhaps better than an insurer can. It may not make sense to transfer risk at a cost without reducing actual risk, since the outside insurer has its own management costs and needs room for profit.

#### Insurance Problems

While insurance generally reduces risks, insurers also have to deal with a few problems:

  * **Moral hazards** , where the knowledge of being protected actually increases risky behavior. Thus calculations of current risk may not reflect real risk after insurance.
  * **Adverse selection** , where riskier people tend to buy insurance while non-risky people don’t, in ways that are currently opaque to the insurer. If the insurance company assumes the risk level over the entire population, but only riskier people buy insurance, the insurer may underprice insurance and discover later their costs are higher than expected.



Government regulation can increase or decrease these problems. By requiring all drivers to have insurance, this reduces adverse selection problems. However, requiring all banks to buy insurance increases moral hazard and risky investments by banks, since depositors don’t apply as much due diligence to risky behaviors by banks. This contributed to the savings & loan association losses in the 1980s.

The situation is worse when prices are clearly distorted. The public National Flood Insurance Program insures homes where private insurers would not, and charges premiums far below what is necessary to cover costs. This means taxpayers pay for risky behaviors, often because it is politically beneficial to provide disaster relief. Unlike insurance, which is meant to reduce risk, **mispriced government aid can create more risk**.

#### Morality of Insurance

Much is said about how it’s “unfair” for a young driver living in Detroit to pay much higher insurance than in Milwaukee, even if they are otherwise the same. Similarly, it can be considered discrimination to charge higher premiums to people with higher genetic risk of disease, even if it’s not their fault.

Thus, laws have been put in place that forbid risks to be reflected in insurance premiums. In France, charging different premiums by gender is banned, even though males live shorter lives and have more car accidents.

**The overall effect is that premiums must rise, because:**

  * Risky people are not being priced out of the market.
    * Cheaper-than-efficient car insurance means more unsafe drivers are on the road.
  * The higher cost of risky people must be spread among less-risky people.
    * Thus lower-risk people are subsidizing higher-risk people.
  * A greater risk of adverse selection leads to mispriced premiums.
    * If male and female life insurance premiums cost the same, even though males are riskier, then the company risks having more males than expected buy the premiums, thus making the price unprofitable.
  * Insurers risk litigation from buyers who claim discrimination.



(Shortform note: as Thomas Sowell says, economics is not about morality, the same way math is not about love. Insurance is about risk, not moral faults.

It seems that the desire to avoid insurance “discrimination” is essentially a decision by society that people whose situations are not their fault should have their suffering reduced, _even_ if it costs society at large its scarce resources.)

### Human Capital

Examples of human capital investment include formal education, work experience, and parenting. Parenting can be considered repaying the investment made by the parents’ previous generation.

**A college major that doesn’t produce useful output in the economy has correspondingly low pay, serving as a signal to people to stop making such investments to avoid wasting scarce resources.**

Countries where higher education is new tend to produce large numbers of educated people who now feel certain trades are beneath them (e.g. physical labor), but tend not to study difficult subjects with skills valuable to employers (e.g. engineering or science). While these people have trouble gaining jobs in the private sector, to reduce social tension, governments create swollen bureaucracies to employ these new graduates.

#### Humans Issuing Stocks

By taking loans, students in effect issue bonds. A lender gives a student money today to pay tuition, to receive more money back in the future.

But why don’t people act like corporations and issue stocks, so that their investors can capture a return of the person’s future income?

The author suggests this is due to:

  * the lower variance of their success, compared to companies. If most students expect to be steadily employed after graduating, they can predict how much in loans they can support, and loans can make better financial sense.
  * legal problems
  * social attitudes. Successful students may feel resentful at having to contribute a share of their income after having already paid back the initial investment made in them - but this is the reward for the lender’s risk, including students who do not pay off their loans.
  * institutional inertia



But **riskier people who cannot secure loans for their careers _do_ tend to sell forms of equity.** Entertainment agents take percentage shares in future earnings of young actors and musicians, thus making it worthwhile to invest resources in them. Lenders are not willing to accept this risk, and agents may have more knowledge in choosing stars, thus reducing their risk compared to industry outsiders.

### Natural Resources

Much is said about natural resources “running out.” However, natural resources are not all available at a single price - resource reserves that are easier to discover and refine have cheaper prices. Even a single oil field may have only a fraction of its reservoirs tapped until the marginal unit becomes unprofitable. Furthermore, technology tends to reduce cost, so currently unprofitable reservoirs may later be profitable with new technology.

A more accurate statement is that the price and the cost determine the degree of natural resource exploration and processing. **As existing resource reserves are used up, the price rises, and additional exploration and harvesting becomes profitable.**

### Miscellaneous Points about Risk

  * Diversification can reduce your overall risk by holding a variety of financial instruments rather than concentrating on one.
    * This has been in practice in centuries past: shipowners found it more prudent to own 10% of ten different ships, compared to 100% of one ship.
  * Risk and uncertainty are different. Risk is calculable (the chance of a male dying at age 70) while uncertainty is not (whether the government will increase interest rates)
    * Uncertainty can cause consumers to sit on money, decreasing demand.
  * Because time is money, people who control time and delays can extort the counterparty or thwart her activities.
    * Slow-moving bureaucracies are an example. In the worst cases, bribes are required to cut through red tape.
    * Raising the retirement age allows the government to escape huge pensions, under the guise of “ending mandatory retirement.”
  * Politicians exploit time by:
    * Supporting immediate benefits that are paid off later (when they are out of office and don’t have to deal with the problem)
    * Creating good-sounding policies to get re-elected but that show their full negative effects much later, when few think to connect the policy with the problem
    * In this later worse time, the politician may even boast that things were never this bad when she was in office, then blaming her successors.
  * People have foresight and can over-respond to signals.
    * In inflationary periods, people spend money faster but also hoard consumer goods and assets, increasing the existing imbalance between reduced goods and the increased money supply.
    * Making money available to help children with learning disability increased diagnoses with learning disabilities - organizations running disability programs and low-income parents alike faced these incentives.
