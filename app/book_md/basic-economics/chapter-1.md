## Chapter 1: What is Economics?

Economics is the **study of the use of scarce resources that have alternative uses**. Examples of resources include land, labor, natural resources, and capital.

There has never been enough resources to satisfy everyone _completely_ \- tradeoffs _must_ be made on an individual and societal level. The decisions around **how to allocate these scarce resources to produce the best output** is the central question of economics.

As an analogy, in a battlefield with wounded soldiers, there are never enough doctors and nurses to go around. Some wounded are past the point of being saved, others have a chance if they get urgent care and will die if they won’t, and others will recover without any urgent treatment. Thus the limited medical resources must be allocated to maximize output - this is an economic problem.

The allocation of resources is critical to a nation’s wealth. There are poor countries with rich natural resources, and rich countries with few natural resources.

Economics is a study of **causes and effects**. Therefore, economic policies are important to judge by their **consequences and incentives** , rather than their goals and motivations. A well-meaning policy can have terrible unintended consequences, sometimes buried in second-order and third-order consequences.
