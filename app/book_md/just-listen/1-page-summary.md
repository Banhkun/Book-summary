## 1-Page Summary

If you want someone to buy what you’re selling, or if you’d like to convince conflicting people to cooperate, you first need to influence them to listen to you. The problem is, people are often closed off to conventional methods of persuasion because they’re busy grappling with their own emotions, needs, and goals.

So, rather than pushing the idea you want them to agree with, you should first focus your attention on the other person: Listen to understand their perspective and empathize with their struggles. Once their needs are met, they’ll be more willing to listen to you in return. And from there, you’ll be in a better position to connect with people and change their minds or behavior.

Mark Goulston is a psychiatrist and professor, whose communication experience ranges from breaking through to suicidal individuals to coaching companies on how to listen effectively for success. He co-authored _Get Out Of Your Own Way _(1996), _Talking to Crazy _(2015), and _Trauma to Triumph _(2021). _Just Listen_ (2009) shares the lessons and methods he’s learned throughout his career about listening effectively as a way to influence others.

In this guide, we’ll discuss:

  * Why listening opens people up
  * How to break through emotional barriers
  * How to help others feel understood, interesting, and valuable
  * How to overcome listening obstacles



In this guide, we’ll compare Goulston’s ideas to those in books such as _Leadership Strategy and Tactics_. Our guide also discusses what other experts have to say about Goulston’s advice, adding nuances and actionable tips to implement in your daily life.

### Listening Opens People Up

To help you understand why listening is the most effective way to open people up to your ideas, we’ll start by explaining how this method fulfills the universal desire to be heard.

#### Listening Fills the Empathy Void in Others

**When your thoughts or feelings are heard and appreciated by another person, you feel understood, more relaxed, and grateful to whoever’s connecting with you**. These positive feelings encourage you to open up in return.

Goulston argues **that empathizing with someone’s thoughts or feelings is impactful because it fills an empathy void that we all experience**. He explains that this void exists because we naturally empathize with the world around us and develop expectations that our empathy will be reciprocated, but this often doesn’t happen. As a result, we’re left craving empathy. This is why we typically experience intense feelings of relief and gratitude when someone does extend empathy to us. For example, when someone acknowledges our overlooked efforts at work or listens to us explain our silent struggles at home, we feel grateful and inspired to reciprocate.

> **Is It Possible to Be Excessively Empathetic?**
> 
> Although empathy is a powerful tool for connecting with someone, it’s possible to exhaust yourself by being _too_ empathetic. One study found that participants who performed the most empathetic behavior at work, such as listening to coworkers vent or taking on others’ work, found it harder to connect with their families at home. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to prevent empathy exhaustion:
> 
>   * Distribute the empathy load to other people. For example, you can encourage your coworkers to support each other communally by holding open-floor meetings where people can vent and troubleshoot each others’ problems.
> 
>   * Take time to focus on your needs. For example, schedule breaks during your workday to meditate or do something you enjoy.
> 
>   * Invest your empathy in a way that’s mutually beneficial. This tip aligns with Goulston’s argument that extending empathy to someone will inspire reciprocal empathy from them.

### Listen to Others to Overcome Their Resistant Emotions

In this section, we’ll discuss how to get through someone’s emotional barrier, which is the first step to connecting with them and opening their mind to your ideas. Goulston says that **most people aren’t receptive to outside ideas unless their emotional barriers are broken down**. By addressing the emotional burden of the person you’re trying to connect with, you’ll help them clear their mind of immediate stress, which will make them receptive to your ideas.

First, we’ll explain how stress makes people emotional and prevents them from listening to you. Then we’ll discuss why listening causes people to release their resistant emotions. Finally, we’ll describe some techniques to help you listen successfully.

#### Guide the Brain From Primal To Pragmatic

Understanding how the brain works under stress will help you get your message across to people—even if they’re dreading a looming deadline or bawling over a breakup. To start, we’ll lay out the relevant areas of the brain’s organization. Goulston highlights three parts of the brain:

  1. **Reptile layer** : This is the area of your brain that controls your impulsive, primal stress responses to danger.
  2. **Mammal layer** : This part controls your emotions.
  3. **Human layer** : This part collects information from the other two brains and uses it to make rational decisions.



When we’re under stress, our brains shift to our reptile or mammal layer, which makes it difficult to think rationally. So, **to help a panicked person listen effectively to your ideas, address the emotions of their lower brains to guide them back to their higher brain**.

When we perceive an immediate threat, our **reptile brain** instinctively knows we can’t waste time thinking, so we react impulsively to avert potential danger. For example, if you hear a tree cracking above your head, you probably won’t consider why it’s cracking—you’ll just start running. Our **mammal brain** isn’t as rationality-resistant as the action-focused reptile brain, but it’s dominated by emotions, which can still make reasoning difficult.

> **Is the Three-Part Brain Model Valid?**
> 
> In _Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain_ , Lisa Feldman Barrett argues that the three-part brain model is misrepresentative of our brain’s function and of our relationship to other animal brains. She explains that the three-part brain model was established in the mid-twentieth century by Paul MacLean, who based his theory on an outdated idea that the appearance of brains indicated their capabilities. More recent research reveals that although different parts of our brains may be visually distinct, this doesn’t mean these parts are limited to specific functions.
> 
> In fact, many parts of our brain have to cooperate in order to perform regular functions like breathing or creating a plan. Further, Feldman explains that even though human brains may differ from other animal brains in anatomical appearance, the neurons in our brains share very similar genetic structures, which have a significant role in determining brain function. Thus, the scientific basis of Goulston’s model for guiding people from resistant emotions to rationality is debatable.
> 
> Even if Goulston's brain model is inaccurate, his idea that emotions cloud our ability to think logically aligns with recent research. One study found that participants experiencing high levels of negative emotion (fear or guilt) were less effective at solving logical problems than participants with neutral emotions. Interestingly, participants who had positive emotions (pride or inspiration) also performed worse than neutral participants. So, if you’re trying to influence someone to listen to you, you may have to overcome their negative emotions _as well as_ their positive emotions.

#### Help Your Listener Release Their Emotions

To break through someone’s emotional barriers and help them access their **human brain**(or rationality), Goulston provides de-stressing strategies you can use. To start, **don’t bother telling the other person to relax. By doing this, you’ll send an implicit message that you’re calm and they’re not**. Goulston says this can cause people in an emotional state to become _even more_ emotional. Additionally, don’t get defensive and rebut someone’s points when they present a problem to you. Doing this will send an implicit message that the person you’re talking to is wrong and what they’re saying is unimportant. This will make the person you’re talking to feel isolated, which will also fuel more negative emotion.

(Shortform note: Telling someone to “just relax” is an impractical approach for more than one reason. Our bodies take anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes to go from stressed to relaxed, so it’s actually impossible to shut down an emotional response in an instant. Additionally, research shows that if you try to suppress your feelings by pretending to relax, the emotions you’re dealing with will intensify. So, address emotions instead of suppressing them, and be patient—relaxing takes time.)

Instead, encourage the emotional person to vent to you and _just listen_. By thoroughly listening to people, you’ll make them feel heard and respected. Additionally, you’ll show them that you’re on their side. As a result, they won’t feel threatened and their reptile response will relax. Instead, they’ll trust and appreciate you, which will open them up to listen in return.

(Shortform note: As you listen to someone vent, avoid taking anything they say too personally by focusing on the big picture of the situation. In this case, the “big picture” to keep in mind is connecting with the person who’s venting so you can influence them to change their mind or behavior. Another thing to consider is that any criticism you receive may not be aimed at you, but instead, your role. Realizing this can help you take some of the heat off of yourself, which will prevent you from taking criticism too personally and becoming defensive.)

To help someone overcome their emotions, Goulston recommends the following seven steps:

**Step 1: Look for physical signs of distress** : stiff shoulders, angry face, crossed arms, and so on. If the person’s arms are crossed, get them to uncross their arms by eliciting an emotional response that requires them to express themselves with their arms. Goulston claims that by getting an emotional person to uncross their arms, you’ll open them up mentally and physically, which will allow them to vent to you. You can do this by saying something provoking that makes the person so emotional they have to use their body to express their feelings.

(Shortform note: According to a body language expert, crossing your arms doesn’t always mean you’re closing yourself off from people. Instead, he explains that we use this behavior to soothe or restrain ourselves when we’re experiencing stress. In this view, Goulston’s strategy to uncross someone’s arms by invoking an emotional reaction will disrupt their coping strategy, making them _even more_ emotional and irrational.)

**Step 2: Ask the stressed person to explain their problem to you**. During this process, let them vent and resist the temptation to question anything the other person is saying. Also, don’t offer solutions or stop the venting process because you’re uncomfortable. When they pause, encourage them with gentle words to tell you more. It may be tempting to start talking when they stop venting. However, because this person will be exhausted from their catharsis, they won’t be receptive to what you say. By continuing to listen and process what the other person is saying, you’ll let them know they’ve been heard and you’ll also disarm them because they’ll realize you’re not going to attack their points and start a debate.

(Shortform note: In an article published since the release of this book, Goulston explains an additional tip for helping people vent thoroughly: Pay attention to the words they emphasize. Then, when they pause their venting, ask them to elaborate on their feelings around those words you identified.)

**Step 3:** Once the other person has finished venting, **repeat the problem they’ve described and ask them to verify whether it’s correct**. If they adjust what you’ve said, repeat the problem again with the adjustment they’ve made. Use a respectful, sympathetic tone as you do this. Once they approve what you’ve repeated, they’ll feel understood and accepted, which will motivate them to begin listening to you. Additionally, Goulston says the act of approving what you say will move the person you’re talking with from a disagreeable disposition to a mode of cooperation.

(Shortform note: By repeating what the other person says to you, you help them realize what message they’ve communicated, which prevents them from repeating themselves and how they’re coming across, which can lead to new insights and help them adjust their way of thinking. For example, someone complaining about their parents might not realize they’re resentful of their parents until they hear you explain the essence of their complaints.)

**Step 4: Ask how the problem they’ve described makes them feel**. By labeling the emotion, you’ll lower its intensity. At this point, the person you’re guiding should be moving from their reptile brain (instinct) to their mammal brain (reason).

(Shortform note: If the person venting to you is struggling to identify the emotion they’re feeling, remember the four basic feelings—glad, sad, mad, and scared—and ask them which of these seems most accurate. From there, they’re likely to get more specific.)

**Step 5: Acknowledge that it’s important to fix the problem _now_ to convey your understanding that their problem is urgent**. Ask them how they think the problem can be solved. This will transition them into their higher, human brain.

**Step 6: Show empathy** for the person you’re trying to influence by acknowledging how difficult their problem must be for them.

**Step 7:** Finally, **offer encouragement** by ensuring they can get through the problem that’s causing their stress. For example, you could reinforce their capabilities and build their confidence by referencing a time when they overcame a challenge. Then, let them know that you’re willing to help them solve their problem and prevent it from happening again.

(Shortform note: Validating, empathizing, and encouraging someone to solve the problems at the root of their emotions is key to turning venting into something constructive and healthy. Research shows that simply complaining to someone leads you to ruminate and focus on the negative thoughts you share even more. So, when someone vents to you, ensure the conversation is oriented toward solutions.)

**Troubleshooting:** If after using the steps above, you’re still struggling to get through someone’s emotional barrier, Goulston says to try these additional tips:

  * Ask the person if you’ve ever made them feel disrespected or unvalued. If they’re resistant to venting to you because they have a problem with you, this question may help them open up.
  * Engage in an activity together. By performing an activity that requires some level of cooperation, you may lower their defenses and help them feel comfortable enough to open up to you. For example, if you need to have a conversation with your child about something important, ask them to fold laundry with you as you begin your conversation.



(Shortform note: Research shows that an effective way to increase trust and cooperation between you and another person is to share a meal together. One study even found that eating the same type of food as another person further enhances your bond. So if you’re planning on influencing someone to open up to you, line up a meal that’s preferable for both of you.)

### Listen to Make Others Feel Understood, Interesting, and Valuable

Now that you know how to use listening to penetrate the resistant emotions of others, we’ll talk about how you can make people feel understood, interesting, and valuable. Doing this will push people past the point of listening to considering and acting on your ideas.

First, we’ll talk about why it’s important to **understand** other perspectives. Next, we’ll discuss how **showing interest** in others can make people more interested in you. Finally, we’ll explain why **making people feel** **valuable** wins them over.

#### Understand the Other Person’s Perspective

When someone has ideas or emotions that are different from yours, don’t try to criticize their ideas or force your way of thinking on them. This will only motivate them to dig their heels in and solidify their stance. Instead, **try to look at the world from the point of view of the person you’re trying to influence and understand _why_ they believe what they do**. This will make them feel understood, less alone, and less defensive—and as a result, they’ll be more likely to consider your ideas.

(Shortform note: In _Leadership Strategy and Tactics_ , Jocko Willink emphasizes that understanding why someone disagrees with you will help you counter their points more effectively.)

If you’re trying to influence or cooperate with someone with whom you’re having a conflict of ideas, here are the steps Goulston says you should take to understand their perspective:

  1. Choose an emotion you think the other person is feeling.
  2. Tell the other person that you’re trying to understand what they’re feeling, and that you think it’s _blank_ (anger, fear, frustration, and so on). Ask them if this is correct. If it’s not, ask them what they’re feeling. Clarify how _strongly_ they feel this emotion.
  3. After they’ve vented about _what_ they’re feeling, ask _why_ they think they have this feeling. Here is where they will move past their emotion and start discussing the issue at hand.
  4. Finally, ask what needs to happen for this feeling and situation to improve. Ask what they can do to execute their plan. Ask what you can do to help. 



(Shortform note: In an article published since this book was released, Goulston explains that to truly understand someone, you must get to know their personal capabilities, goals, and external circumstances. Doing this will not only help the other person feel appreciative of your awareness, but you’ll also be able to better accommodate their priorities and limitations when you convince them of an idea or offer solutions to their problems. To gather this information, keep these categories in mind as you engage in conversation.)

##### Now Ask Them to Understand You

**After hearing the other person out** , encourage them to imagine what _you_ are thinking or feeling by using an analogy. Then, compare that analogy to the real issue and explain how whatever they're doing makes you feel a similar way. For example, if you’re upset that someone struggles to offer you their attention while you’re talking with them, you could ask that person if they’d be upset with someone that’s constantly looking at their phone while they’re trying to talk to them. Then, you could explain that when they don’t offer you their attention, it makes you feel a similar way.

> If you’re unable to communicate your hurt feelings through the analogy alone, consider your approach. Experts say that to effectively communicate your feelings and move toward a solution, you should follow these three steps:
> 
>   * **Anticipate a positive outcome**. When you believe that confronting someone will end poorly, you risk suppressing these emotions until they build up and cause you to lash out at the other person. On the other hand, believing that your conversation will be constructive will help you initiate the conversation and stay calm.
> 
>   * **Don’t blame the other person for the way you feel**. By blaming the other person for the emotions you’re feeling, you’ll likely cause them to become defensive and closed off to hearing you out. Instead, simply state the emotion you’re experiencing. If the person cares about you, they’ll instinctually ask why you feel that way. When this happens, they’re opening up to you.
> 
>   * **Offer a solution.** Instead of explaining what you’d like them to _stop_ doing, explain what you’d like them to do _differently._ It’s less aggressive and will encourage them to consider how they can meet your request.
> 
> 


#### Get Interested to Be Interesting

To gain someone’s attention and curiosity, focus on learning about them instead of talking about yourself. Goulston explains that if you try to sound interesting, you risk coming off as annoying or self-obsessed. Instead,**by displaying sincere interest in the person you’re talking to, you’ll likely inspire them to reciprocate interest in you.** Displaying interest in others indicates that you’re self-confident rather than insecure. (Shortform note: When you show you’re confident by displaying interest in someone, they’re more likely to be influenced by you. Research shows that when we determine whether something is going to be successful, the most important influence on our opinion is the opinion of a confident person.)

Here’s how you can develop more interest in the people you’d like to connect with and influence:

  * **Investigate**. Instead of viewing a conversation as an opportunity to impress the person you’re trying to connect with, view it as an investigation of that person. Everyone has something unique and interesting about them. Seek that information.
  * **Ask for advice**. This makes people feel interesting, intelligent, and valued.
  * **Ask “big-picture” questions** about their goals.



> **Gratitude Versus Flattery: How Does Displaying Interest Win People Over?**
> 
> Similar to Goulston, the author of _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ , Dale Carnegie, explains that when you display interest in someone, you make them feel valuable. However, Goulston says people open themselves up to you in return because they feel grateful to you, whereas Carnegie argues that by displaying interest in someone, you convince them you have good judgment, which is what opens them up to your influence. He explains that we tend to think highly of ourselves, so when someone shares our interest in _us_ , we think they have good taste.
> 
> Carnegie also shares a few straightforward tips for displaying interest in someone:
> 
>   * Remember people’s birthdays and wish them well.
> 
>   * If you’re trying to influence someone that speaks another language, display interest in them by trying to learn some of their language.
> 
>   * Greet people with enthusiasm and call them by their name.
> 
> 

> 
> **When Showing Interest Backfires**
> 
> When it comes to romantic relationships, experts say that when you display consistent interest in a potential partner, this increases their friendly feelings toward you, but it also causes them to desire you less. On the other hand, if you pique a potential partner’s interest in you and then display little interest (“play hard to get”), you’ll increase their romantic interest in you. However, playing hard to get will also make the other person feel frustrated and resentful toward you. So, the key to a healthy relationship is to balance between offering friendly interest and desire-inducing behaviors like flirtation and teasing.

#### Make Others Feel Valuable

When people feel valuable, they’re more willing to enthusiastically support you. Goulston says that this fills people with a sense of purpose, which is one of the most generous things you can do for someone. As a result, they’ll be willing to support you however they can. (Shortform note: Experts say that making others feel valuable isn’t just generous to the person you’re valuing, it’s generous to _yourself_. Not only does valuing someone inspire them to value you in return, the act of making someone feel good about themselves in itself makes you feel more connected, trusting, and happy.)

One way you can show someone that you value them is by delivering meaningful thank-yous. **By displaying thoughtful gratitude, you acknowledge the level of emotion and effort that someone invested in you**. This will strengthen your relationship with the person you’re thanking and motivate them to support you in the future. Goulston says that to deliver a meaningful thank you, highlight a specific thing they did for you, acknowledge the effort or difficulty they faced, and explain the positive difference their action made.

(Shortform note: Another way to show your gratitude for someone is by offering them more of your time. Because time seems so scarce during our busy lives, we appreciate when someone takes a moment to spend time with us. Thank someone by creating a window in your day to check in on the person you’re grateful for or write them a handwritten thank-you note (which takes far longer to create and deliver than an email does.)

It’s one thing to show gratitude to those who help you, but Goulston says**it’s even more crucial to make the _troublesome_ people in your life feel valuable**. If someone in your life often starts conflicts or bothers you for attention, Goulston says making them feel valuable will help persuade them to change their behavior in a positive way. He explains that people who use troublesome behaviors to seek attention tend to do so _because_ they don’t feel valued. Therefore, if you satisfy this need, you’ll remove the need for their attention-seeking behavior, you’ll make them feel appreciative toward you, and they’ll be willing to support you.

(Shortform note: By making someone feel valuable, you can spur a spiral of self-improvement. In _Leadership Strategy and Tactics_ , Jocko Willink argues that designating responsibility to someone empowers them to become more accountable for their actions and committed to plans. This is because when we have ownership over a plan, we’re more likely to solve problems that occur with it, whereas if something goes awry with someone else’s plan, we’re more likely to blame them for it.)

### Obstacles to Listening Well

Now that you know the basic rules for listening well, we’ll discuss how to approach internal and external challenges that can make listening difficult. By becoming aware of these challenges and preparing for them, you’ll be able to handle them appropriately. First, we’ll explore internal obstacles to listening, such as biases, dissonance, and personal limitations. Then, we’ll talk about how to effectively connect and cooperate with difficult people.

#### Address Internal Obstacles

First, we’ll discuss how to overcome **personal biases** by becoming aware of how you judge others and by assuming there’s more to others than you might think. Next, we’ll talk about how **cognitive dissonance** occurs, why it can disrupt interactions with others, and how to overcome it. Finally, we’ll explain why it’s beneficial to be honest about **your weaknesses**.

##### **Overcome Personal Biases**

Goulston says that whether we like it or not, the things we hear and the judgments we make about other people are influenced by unavoidable personal biases. The problem is, when we judge someone based on our biases, we use preconceived knowledge that may or may not accurately represent them.

Here are two ways to manage your biases and listen more effectively:

  1. **Memorize your biases:** Goulston says we judge people based on five categories (gender, age, ethnicity, education, and emotionality). The simple habit of memorizing and staying aware of these categories as you assess someone helps you spot biases that might not apply to them. 
  2. **Use hypothetical justifications:** When you have a conflict with someone, make a list of the negative words you’d use to describe them. Then, write five possible reasons that the person is acting the way they are. Next, imagine how your feelings about this person would change if any of these five things were true. Finally, have a conversation with them to discover the real reason they’re acting the way they do.



> **Combating Bias With Action**
> 
> What causes bias? **Biases are caused by our brain’s natural tendency to organize information into patterns, to take shortcuts, and to inform our decisions based on our limited memory**. This results in generalizations about people that can cause us to overlook their individual characteristics.
> 
> There are two main categories of bias that influence our daily judgments and actions: _explicit_ bias and _implicit_ bias. Explicit bias consists of our conscious beliefs, whereas implicit bias refers to our subconscious beliefs. In _Just Listen_ , Goulston seems to be referring to implicit biases.
> 
> Can we really change our biases? Research shows that biases can be changed, but it takes more than increasing your awareness of what your biases are and how they form. The most data-proven bias improvement program involves learning what bias is, taking a test to measure your personal level of bias, and then combatting bias with the following actions:
> 
>   * Point out stereotypical views when you experience them. This aligns with Goulston’s advice to maintain awareness of the categories that we use to define people so that you can identify biases more readily.
> 
>   * Get to know people as individuals and empathize with them. This tip is compatible with Gouslton’s advice to have conversations with people to discover the real reasons behind their actions or beliefs.
> 
>   * Look to exemplars that defy stereotypes. For instance, one study demonstrated that young girls who participated in science activities and fostered personal connections with female scientists were more likely to view STEM as a possible career path.
> 
>   * Spend time with people who have backgrounds and views different from your own.
> 
> 


##### Become Aware of Your Dissonance

When you’re on the same page with someone, they’re more likely to listen to you, but your interactions with others are often clouded by dissonance. **Dissonance occurs when you’re perceived differently than the way you think you’re presenting yourself** or when _you_ perceive someone differently than _they_ see themselves. This prevents you from connecting with other people, which means you’ll have a hard time influencing them.

For example, someone might think they’re being confident and interesting when they ask you out, but to you, they seem arrogant and overbearing. Because you’re perceiving the other person differently than they think they’re coming off, you reflect different emotions back to them and you never land on the same page.

**Dissonance also makes us feel unheard and powerless**. This can make us defensive and emotional, which prevents us from listening to others. For example, imagine a lady at a retail store who’s passionately concerned about returning a faulty product and finding a replacement. She’s frantic because her grandchild’s birthday is tomorrow and she needs a new gift. Customer service perceives her emotion as aggressive and reflects this aggression back to her, which makes her feel like she isn’t being understood, so she becomes increasingly frustrated. The difference in perception here prevents the two people from reaching a speedy and satisfying solution.

(Shortform note: Experts say that dissonance occurs because our natural biases create blindspots that cause incomplete perceptions of other people. Additionally, our ability to read emotions is imperfect, which can lead us to misperceive someone’s behavior and intentions. For example, we tend to accurately interpret more obvious emotions such as anger, fear, surprise, and disgust, but nuanced emotions such as nervousness, confusion, and disappointment are typically more difficult to pinpoint.)

Here are two ways Goulston says we can overcome dissonance:

1) Ask people you trust to list your worst traits. **When you become aware of the negative ways people are perceiving you, you can change them** by consciously identifying and avoiding your negative traits on a daily basis. Because people are usually hesitant and uncomfortable giving negative feedback, you could instead ask people to list two ways you can improve. This way, you’re hearing ways you can improve in the future rather than reflecting on ways you’ve failed in the past. This is easier for them to say and for you to hear.

(Shortform note: In _The Miracle Morning, _Hal Elrod says to identify areas for personal improvement by emailing your close friends and family to ask what your three biggest flaws are. Encourage the people you email to be honest and reassure them that you’re using their feedback to grow as a person. Then, view the feedback from a constructive perspective.)

2) Prevent dissonance by preemptively cautioning whoever you’re interacting with that you may offend them, but that you don’t mean to. This is particularly useful when you’re engaging with people who belong to cultures different from yours.

(Shortform note: If you’ve already __ offended someone unintentionally, experts say not to blame them for overreacting, and don’t defensively argue that you didn’t mean to offend them. Instead, apologize for hurting their feelings and ask what exactly you said to make them upset so you can avoid repeating it in the future.)

##### Acknowledge Your Weaknesses

Goulston says that if you hide an obvious weakness, people will think you’re dishonest. This is because if you don’t acknowledge a weakness everyone can see, people may think you’re trying to hide other issues. And if people don’t trust you, they won’t listen to you. Goulston says it’s better to be upfront about your weaknesses so you can establish trust and influence.

(Shortform note: Other ways to establish trust include accepting the vulnerable things people share with you rather than judging them. Additionally, maintain long-term trust by keeping this information private.)

When you admit your weaknesses, the following happens:

  * People respect your courage and honesty. 
  * You demonstrate strength and adaptability.
  * You feel more comfortable because you aren’t putting extra effort into covering something up. This comfort will be obvious to whoever you’re trying to influence and make them feel more comfortable and open as well. 



(Shortform note: Goulston explains how being honest about your weaknesses commands respect and trust. In addition to this, you’ll also open yourself up to receive support from people who are willing to help you improve. Once people are aware of the skills you’re trying to develop, they’ll be able to give you constructive feedback on your progress.)

To acknowledge your weaknesses effectively, Goulston says to **describe your personal weaknesses clearly and concisely, then explain how you’re going to handle them**. For example, imagine you have irritable bowel syndrome and you’re interviewing for a job. You tell the interviewers that this problem can cause you to make spontaneous and urgent trips to the bathroom. You explain that this is a symptom you can’t control, but that it won’t get in the way of your duties at work because you plan for spontaneous disruptions by scheduling extra time to commute to work. Further, the nature of your health condition has helped you hone skills that strengthen you as a job candidate, such as adaptability to unexpected disruptions.

(Shortform note: To overcome your weaknesses, capitalize on your strengths. Do this by writing a list of your strengths and weaknesses, then grouping your weaknesses with strengths that you think could compensate for them. When you encounter situations that challenge one or more of your weaknesses, try to apply one of your related strengths to the situation.)

#### Adapt to People Who Are Difficult to Influence

Goulston warns that toxic or difficult people can destroy your life because they consistently display negative emotions despite your efforts to listen and empathize with them. This can result in a lot of futile time and effort spent trying to listen and connect with people who only respond with negative emotions. This exhausting and toxic behavior can rub off on you over time.

(Shortform note: Toxic people don’t just rub off on you, they can spread their negativity throughout entire companies and cause significant costs. One study found that firing a toxic employee saved companies an average of twice the amount of money as a top performer returned in cost savings. This is because toxic workers not only drag down morale with their contagious negativity, they also cause their coworkers to leave, which leads to turnover costs.)

Here are Goulston’s strategies for getting through to **needy people, bullies, narcissists, and psychopaths:**

**Confront needy people by being honest** about how they’re affecting you and what changes need to happen, and explain that you’ll need to end your relationship with them if they don’t change.

(Shortform note: By being direct about the way a needy person is affecting you, you’ll give them a chance to realize their effect on others and adjust their behavior. Oftentimes, needy people aren’t aware of their negative impact because people view them as fragile and avoid offending them. If they’re surprised to hear your complaint, offer them specific examples of their problematic behaviors. Deliver your honest feedback with respect but treat them like they’re strong. By beating around the bush or shying away from your primary complaints, you’ll only be prolonging their behavior. Finally, encourage them to fulfill their emotional needs from a professional.)

**Stand up to bullies and act indifferent to their provocative behavior**. Bullies will come after you if they sense that you’re weak. So, look them in the eye and display body language that shows confidence and comfort (stand up straight and let your arms hang freely).

When you can afford to take some risk (your job isn’t on the line, for example), you can try a more aggressive approach with bullies. Call them out on what they’re doing and be honest about its effects on people and the bully themself. Because bullies usually don’t get called out for their behavior, this should surprise them and may even cause them to consider opening up to you and changing their behavior.

**When you’re trying to cooperate with a narcissist, make sure you split up responsibilities in a way that gives them work that is in their best interest.** This is because narcissists only care about themselves and will only do things well if those things serve _them_ well.

**Stay away from psychopaths.** If you encounter a psychopath, Goulston suggests you distance yourself as much as possible because psychopaths will ruin your life. Goulston says his techniques for connecting with people won’t apply to psychopaths, because they don’t feel emotion like we do and are, by definition, self-centered and manipulative.

> **Additional Tips to Help You Handle Narcissists, Bullies, and Psychopaths**
> 
> Research shows that the more narcissistic you are, the more likely you are to be a bully. Here are a few additional tips to help you handle narcissists and bullies in a safe and healthy way:
> 
>   * **Record harmful behavior in writing**. It’s common for narcissists to manipulate you through gaslighting (denying reality to make you doubt yourself). So, recording events can help you keep your personal record straight. Having a record of incidents is also beneficial if you eventually need to report the details about a bully’s behavior to a boss at work or authorities.
> 
>   * **Set boundaries**. To limit a bully’s negative influence on you, it’s wise to block them on social media and try not to think about them.
> 
>   * **Don’t blame yourself**. The negative behavior exhibited by narcissists and bullies is a manifestation of their own fears and insecurities, so don’t take it personally.

> 
> Although psychopaths can possess the qualities of narcissists and bullies, they’re additionally characterized as arrogant, manipulative, dishonest, unfeeling, and aggressive. Because of the toxic and dangerous behavior associated with psychopaths, experts echo Goulston’s advice to avoid psychopaths if possible. However, if you aren’t able to remove yourself from a psychopath altogether, here are some tips to help you handle psychopathic people safely:
> 
>   * Limit interaction: If you work with a psychopath, request that you engage with them through email. Research shows that psychopaths are better at negotiating during in-person interactions. So, limit your susceptibility to manipulation by limiting your engagement.
> 
>   * As with typical bullies, it’s helpful not to give psychopaths an emotional reaction when they try to victimize you. By giving in to manipulative games, you’ll make yourself a target.
> 
>   * Seek professional support from a therapist to help yourself cope with any emotional stress caused by the psychopath you’re dealing with.
