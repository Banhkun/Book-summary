## Exercise: Reflect on Shackleton’s Leadership

Ernest Shackleton won respect for his leadership under extreme circumstances. How can you incorporate some of his traits into your own leadership style?

* * *

Shackleton appealed to the ambition of the British Empire to get the government to support his expedition. How can you leverage the desires and goals of stakeholders you work with to achieve your goals?

When they found themselves stranded for the winter, Shackleton gave up on his dream in order to fulfill his duty as leader of the crew. Under what circumstances would you put the well-being of your team above the project’s goals?

While they lived on the ice, Shackleton was strategic about who slept in which tent so the men wouldn’t get on each others’ nerves. How can you be more strategic about the personalities of your team members when you distribute projects or assign people to collaborate with each other?

Each time Shackleton left a group of men behind, he also left someone he trusted in charge, along with detailed instructions on what to do. What is your own approach to delegating, and what can you learn from Shackleton’s example?
