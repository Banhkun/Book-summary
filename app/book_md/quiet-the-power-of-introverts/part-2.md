## Part 2: Biology and Temperament |Chapter 4: Predicting Introversion

Studies of personality support the premise that **introversion and extroversion can be biologically based**. Introversion is associated with traits observable in infancy, including high reactivity, alertness, sensitivity to nuance, and emotional intensity.

### High Reactivity

In 1989, developmental psychologist Jerome Kagan of Harvard began a longitudinal or years-long study of 500 four-month-old babies and was able to tell which ones would turn out to be extroverts and which would be introverts based on innate temperament.

By introducing stimuli such as voices, popping balloons, or smells, Kagan determined which infants were highly reactive (crying and throwing their arms around) and which were low-reactive. Counterintuitively, he predicted the highly reactive babies were likely to be quiet or introverts as teenagers, which turned out to be the case.

He did further testing of their reactions to new things—for instance, a clown and a woman wearing a gas mask—when the children were two, four, seven, and eleven. Most of the children turned out exactly as Kagan expected: high-reactive children turned out to be introverts while low-reactive children were extroverts.

### Alertness and Sensitivity

Kagan also found that **highly reactive children are more sensitive to their environment**.

Besides noting the children’s behavioral reactions to strange situations, Kagan measured their heart rate, blood pressure, and finger temperature, which are controlled by the amygdala region—or emotional control center—of the brain. One function of the amygdala is to detect new or threatening things and trigger a reaction, such as ducking when a ball comes at your head. He found that highly reactive infants’ nervous systems reacted strongly to unfamiliar things while quiet infants’ nervous systems were unaffected.

As highly reactive children grow, parents and teachers may notice a wary reaction to unfamiliar people or the first day of preschool and may assume a child is shy. But what they’re really reacting to is newness. High reactives are just more sensitive to their environment. One psychologist calls this “alert attention”—they notice not only alarming things, but also most things in general.

### Emotion

**High-reactive children also tend to more thoroughly process what they’ve observed and to apply more nuance to everyday experiences.** For instance, they may spend a lot of time thinking about others’ actions, considering potential reasons why another child did what he did.

Kagan found that **highly reactive kids seem to feel emotions more strongly as well** —for instance, they feel more intense guilt if they break something than low-reactive children feel. They’ll also concentrate more intensely on something that interests them.

### Nature Versus Nurture

Other studies of personality also support the premise that introversion and extroversion are biologically based. But **the temperament you were born doesn’t necessarily dictate what you do in every situation. Nurture and environment also play a role in shaping personality.**

According to one theory, people with certain inherited traits tend to seek out experiences that reinforce them. Children who are low reactive may seek out exciting, even dangerous experiences, building up a tolerance for risk over time. Chuck Yeager could become an astronaut because of his years of courting danger as a test pilot. Conversely, high-reactive children who are internally focused may become professors, scientists, writers, and artists, whose work involves more mental stimulation than external activity.

Yet environment still can affect temperament. Low-reactive, extroverted kids raised in nurturing environments can grow up to become high achievers like Oprah or Richard Branson. But some psychologists believe a low-reactive child raised by negligent parents or raised in a bad neighborhood could channel a bold temperament into bullying or delinquency.

High-reactive kids are also influenced by their environment. Science writer David Dobbs explained the effect of environment on children with what he called the “orchid hypothesis.” **Many children are like dandelions, able to flourish anywhere. However, others such as high-reactives are like the more sensitive orchids—they wilt easily, but with proper care become something extraordinary.**

Such children are strongly affected by their experiences, whether positive or negative. For instance, they’re more likely to react to marital tension or abuse with anxiety and depression. However, in a nurturing environment, they develop more social skills and have fewer emotional problems than low-reactive children. They’re conscientious and caring, disturbed by injustice and cruelty. While they don’t seek attention, they’re often highly successful at things that interest them.
