## Exercise: What Are Your Restorative Niches?

Even if you’re pursuing a goal important to you, acting out of character for too long takes a lot of energy. To recharge, you need to create “restorative niches,” where you can relax and be yourself. They can be places you go to get away from the pressure or mental breaks such as meditation.

* * *

Think of a situation where you had to act in a way that was out of character and stressful for you—for instance, giving a speech or socializing with the boss. What aspects required the most energy and when did you start running out of energy?

What did you do when your energy began to flag? How much did this action help?

What are some restorative niches you can build in to help you succeed at a similar event in the future?
