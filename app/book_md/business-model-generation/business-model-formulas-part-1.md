## Business Model Formulas, Part 1

Osterwalder and Pigneur argue that you can combine the nine elements into distinct patterns to create specific outcomes for your business. To illustrate this, they present patterns they claim are common across _all_ successful business models—a single business model can include several of them. Once you familiarize yourself with these patterns, you’ll understand how the combination of certain elements can create dramatically different results, and you’ll be better prepared to manipulate the elements to successfully position your business.

(Shortform note: _The Business Model Navigator_ presents an alternative way to approach business model patterns—it offers 55 patterns that you can pick and choose from, manipulate and combine to suit your needs. This method may be more suitable for established businesses looking to innovate existing business models.)

In this chapter, we’ll look at the first three formulas: Unbundled, Long Tail, and Multi-Sided Platforms. In the next chapter, we’ll explore the remaining two formulas, Free and Open, as well as specific formulas for nonprofit and beyond-profit organizations.

### Formula 1: Unbundled

Unbundled businesses split up their operations into three distinct business categories to increase efficiency—this is because each business category is driven by different factors and defined by its own set of rules and operating procedures:

**Businesses Focused on Product Innovation** :

  * **Focus** : This business category aims to create the most innovative product or service on the market.
  * **Example** : Apple is a business focused on software and hardware product innovation.
  * **Strategy** : Businesses focused on innovation need to hire talented designers and develop efficient systems to commercialize ideas quickly. 
  * **Resources** : Successful product innovation requires investment in research, development, and talented employees.



**Businesses Focused on Customer Relationship Management** :

  * **Focus** : This business category aims to nurture long-term relationships with customers.
  * **Example** : Apple is a business focused on customer relationships—it creates excellent customer experiences to encourage brand loyalty.
  * **Strategy** : Businesses focused on customer relationships need to look beyond the value of single transactions and focus on the lifetime value of their customers.
  * **Resources** : In addition to tailoring products and services to satisfy customers in each customer group, businesses need to invest heavily in developing their touchpoints and customer interactions.



**Businesses Focused on Infrastructure Management** :

  * **Focus** : This business category aims to operate as efficiently and as cost-effectively as possible.
  * **Example** : Apple is a business focused on infrastructure management because it offers cloud management services.
  * **Strategy** : Businesses focused on infrastructure management adopt strategies that minimize costs and optimize efficiency wherever possible.
  * **Resources** : Reliable and cost-effective infrastructures depend on economies of scale and standardized processes to keep costs down.



Since each category plays a unique role and relies upon different teams and departments to operate, management experts John Hagel and Marc Singer argue that businesses that offer services in one or more of these distinct categories can’t operate efficiently unless they split (“unbundle”) these services into discrete business identities.

Further, they advise that **businesses should focus only on one of these categories as their core service** , and outsource the rest to specialized companies. As long as more than one of these activities coexist on a single business model, each of the elements will include **conflicting priorities** that will create limitations or “tradeoffs” across the business.

> **Outsourcing Reduces Operating Costs**
> 
> The concept of “unbundling” directly counters traditional business philosophy, particularly regarding operating costs. Operating costs are defined by how much time, money, and effort it takes to exchange ideas, services, or assets required to operate a business. Traditionally, businesses operate on the assumption that it’s more efficient and cost-effective to manage all company processes internally, so they invest in creating various departments within their organization to manage all of their activities.
> 
> For example, you create your own marketing department, invest in hiring and training employees trained in marketing, and develop processes and systems so that this department can align with your needs as a business. You do this because you assume having your own marketing department will reduce your costs in the long term—if you outsource your marketing needs, you may have to spend additional time (send a brief or style guide, provide access to necessary materials, and resolve queries) and money to get every job done.
> 
> Business experts Hagel and Singer argue that this assumption is outdated since network developments allow specialized companies to work in sync with businesses. Further, they claim that businesses that attempt to manage all processes internally incur additional operating costs.
> 
> This is because **specialized companies focus on optimizing one single activity**. This single-minded focus grants them enormous advantages over businesses that need to share their resources to manage a range of activities. Specialized companies can direct all of their resources to:
> 
>   * Hire highly qualified and specialized employees
> 
>   * Gain deep industry knowledge in their specific area
> 
>   * Invest in the latest technologies
> 
>   * Develop processes so that they can easily work with other businesses
> 
> 

> 
> Businesses that leverage the capabilities of specialized companies gain resources without having to invest in the development, ongoing management, and integration of different departments and processes. Consequently, these businesses can focus their resources on their core activity, increase productivity, and decrease unnecessary overhead costs.

##### How to Leverage the 9 Elements

To avoid the conflicting priorities that limit “bundled” businesses, Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest you leverage your elements to “unbundle” as follows:

| **Customer Relationship Management** | **Product Innovation** | **Infrastructure Management**  
---|---|---|---  
**Customer Groups** | Focus on targeting specific customer groups.  | Outsource customer group research and development to external partners.  | Outsource to external partners—focus mainly on serving other businesses.   
**Value Offer** | Value comes from offering a high quality of customer service.  | Value comes from offering high-quality product and service innovations.  | Value comes from providing high-quality infrastructure services.   
**Touchpoints** | Create multiple touchpoints to facilitate customer interactions.  | Outsource the management of touchpoints to external partners.  | Outsource the management of touchpoints to external partners.   
**Interactions** | Focus on acquiring customers and building strong relationships to ensure customer loyalty.  | Outsource the management of customer interactions to external partners.  | Outsource the management of customer interactions to external partners.   
**Profit Sources** | Profit to come from long-term customer transactions—focus on their lifetime value.  | Rely on high-profit margins—innovative products and services sell for higher prices.  | Rely on low-profit margins—charge low prices but make profit from the high volume of sales.   
**Resources** | The customer base built from developing touchpoints and interactions will eventually become a resource.  | Talented and creative employees, as well as research and development facilities.  | The more the infrastructure expands, the more of a resource it will become.   
**Critical Actions** | Acquire customers and build trust to inspire customer loyalty.  | Manage research and development facilities, and attract talented employees.  | Develop and maintain the infrastructure.   
**Network** | Outsource infrastructure management and product and service innovation requirements to external partners.  | Outsource as much as possible so the business can focus on product and service innovation.  | Outsource as much as possible so the business can focus on infrastructure management. Develop partnerships to help develop and manage the infrastructure efficiently.   
**Expenses** | Invest heavily in marketing, developing touchpoints and interactions, to acquire customers.  | Invest heavily in talented employees to manage the research and development processes.  | High fixed costs will decrease as operations increase thanks to economies of scale.   
  
> Osterwalder and Pigneur refer to the recommendation from management experts that companies should narrow their business focus on delivering superior value in line with one of three value disciplines: product leadership, customer intimacy, or operational excellence. These value disciplines complement the three business categories and support the argument to “unbundle” the services.
> 
> Interestingly, companies that focus on the same value disciplines display similarities in the way that they operate, regardless of their industry. For example, the operating structures and workplace cultures of Federal Express and Walmart are almost identical _because_ they both pursue operational excellence.

> **The Benefits of Unbundling**
> 
> In order to function efficiently, Amazon has split into multiple divisions to better serve the varying needs of the massive number of consumers _and_ businesses it caters to.
> 
>   * Amazon Marketplace
> 
>   * Amazon Prime
> 
>   * Amazon Web Services
> 
>   * Amazon Kindle
> 
>   * Amazon Patents
> 
>   * Amazon Advertising
> 
> 

> 
> Each of these divisions has its own operating procedures, defined by its “value disciplines” to avoid unnecessary trade-offs or conflicts within the business as a whole. For example, Amazon Web Services provides infrastructure management and caters specifically to other businesses. Amazon needs to manage the way that it develops this service, and then acquires and interacts with these business customers in a very specific way. Since this is an entirely separate division, it has the necessary freedom to provide an efficient service and adapt to customer needs without being slowed down by the different priorities of other divisions.

### Formula 2: Long Tail

Long Tail businesses focus on creating a wide variety of diverse niche products and services for interested buyers—individually, each of these products sells very little, but **the combined sales of all of the products generate high revenues**. These models require cost-effective ways to manage large inventories, reach potential buyers, and facilitate transactions. Further, Long Tail businesses often encourage the co-creation of products by allowing individual users to produce and distribute their own creations—they need a powerful platform to facilitate this form of customer-business collaboration.

Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest the following layout for Long Tail business models:

**Customer Groups** | Focus on multiple niche customer groups as well as multiple niche suppliers—both groups are _interdependent._  
---|---  
**Value Offer** | Value comes from offering a wide range of niche products alongside a few mainstream products. Additional value comes from providing content production tools for users to co-create products.   
**Touchpoints** | Online methods are usually the most cost-effective.   
**Interactions** | Online methods are usually the most cost-effective. The level of interaction required depends on the nature of the products and services on offer.   
**Profit Sources** | Profit sources will come from combined sales across the platform, as well as paid advertisements.   
**Resources** | The larger the platform, the more of a resource it will become.   
**Critical Actions** | Develop, manage, and promote the platform to acquire niche content suppliers and customers.   
**Network** | Focus on developing partnerships with both professional and amateur niche content providers. In addition, focus on partnerships that will make the platform more functional or attractive to both suppliers and customers.   
**Expenses** | Platform management and development will incur the highest costs.   
  
> **Book Publishing: From Mainstream to Long Tail**
> 
> The Long Tail formula seems to fly in the face of the common advice to focus on a single niche product or service (in other words, to prioritize one thing and do that thing exceptionally well). Further, expanding your offerings according to the Long Tail formula could be the key to disrupting the market and winning big. Changes in the publishing industry are a great example of this.
> 
> Traditionally, publishers had to print and distribute books to bookstores before they could sell them. This incurred heavy printing, inventory, and distribution costs. Publishing houses were responsible for managing the editorial, marketing, production, and distribution costs for each title they published. They had to carefully plan their publishing schedules for both their frontlist (books to be published) and backlist (books previously published) titles to make a profit.
> 
> To evaluate frontlist titles, they weighed the projected sales (what they _expected_ customers to buy) against the editorial, production, and royalty costs the book would incur. They only approved books that seemed likely to make a profit.
> 
> To evaluate whether backlist titles should stay in print, publishers analyzed the book’s existing sales record to determine whether the book’s demand was worth the cost of printing further copies. If the publishers decided that the book was not worth printing, customers would have no awareness of this book or, if they did, they would find it difficult to find a copy.
> 
> In addition, brick and mortar bookstores had limited shelf space to stock books—they had to justify the inclusion of each and every title on their shelves. Therefore, the majority of bookstores stocked only the bestselling titles.
> 
> The fact is that publishers and bookstores didn’t really know what people wanted—**limited resources pushed them to make assumptions about what people wanted** and to fabricate demand through the use of mass marketing. In other words, customers bought these books because they didn’t have any other options.
> 
> **_Amazon’s Long-Tail Model_**
> 
> Amazon’s long tail model disrupted this model in two ways. First, it made more books available to customers through Amazon Marketplace. Second, it allowed authors to self-publish their own books through Amazon KDP.
> 
> Amazon Marketplace is not restricted by shelf space or inventory costs—print-on-demand facilities allow them to store books as electronic files instead of hard copies. **Amazon creates demand for books that brick and mortar bookstores don’t have the resources to carry** —it makes customers aware of a wide variety of books (based on buying patterns and preferences), creates demand by displaying customer reviews, and facilitates the purchase of these books. It’s interesting to note that more than half of Amazon’s book sales come from books that are not sold in traditional bookstores—Amazon created a new market based on books customers actually want.
> 
> Amazon KDP authors have the option of doing all of the editorial and design work for their books, or they can pay for additional services to manage and promote their books. This means that **Amazon KDP doesn't have to cover the editorial or marketing costs for publishing these books**.
> 
> Since there are no inventory costs or author advances to pay, Amazon KDP doesn’t lose out financially if a book doesn’t sell. When a customer purchases a book, Amazon KDP prints the book and deducts this printing cost from the sale price of the book. So they only pay the printers and authors as and when a book sells, and all parties profit from the first sale. Millions of authors use Amazon KDP to self-publish books, and while they don’t sell every one of these books, **the aggregate sales of all of the books allow Amazon KDP to thrive**.

### Formula 3: Multi-Sided Platforms

Multi-Sided Platforms enable direct interaction between two or more different but interdependent groups of customers. This pattern is most obvious in a marketplace such as Etsy—this business facilitates exchanges between buyers and sellers, and it **requires participation from both parties to offer value and operate successfully**. In other words, if sellers stopped listing items on Etsy, customers would see no value in visiting the site. If customers stopped shopping on Etsy, sellers would see no value in listing their products. **The more active users that a platform can attract, the more value it can offer to both parties**.

Osterwalder and Pigneur suggest the following layout for Multi-Sided Platform business models:

**Customer Groups** | Focus on a minimum of two interdependent customer groups.   
---|---  
**Value Offer** | Value comes from the platform—it facilitates efficient and cost-effective interactions between the customer groups.   
**Touchpoints** | Online methods are usually the most cost-effective.   
**Interactions** | Online methods are usually the most cost-effective. The aim here is to facilitate interactions _between_ the customer groups.   
**Profit Sources** | Each group produces a different revenue stream depending on the fees they pay to use the platform (for marketplaces, sellers usually pay subscription fees while buyers have free access).   
**Resources** | The more customers the platform can provide benefit to, the more of a resource it will become.   
**Critical Actions** | Develop, maintain, and promote the platform to ensure it meets the needs of individual customer groups.   
**Network** | Focus on developing partnerships that will make the platform more functional or attractive to all customer groups.   
**Expenses** | Platform management and development will incur the highest costs.   
  
> **The Negative Impact of Network Effects on Sellers**
> 
> Marketplaces are generally free for buyers to use—buyers only pay for the products and services they buy, not for using the platform. However, sellers are expected to pay various transactional fees for the benefits they receive from using these platforms, regardless of whether or not they make a sale. The platform promises to deliver them more attention, more visibility, and more opportunities to sell their products, and **sellers are willing to pay for instant access to the platform’s global customer base**.
> 
> As discussed, a multi-sided platform increases in value the more people use it. However, the more saturated these marketplaces become, the more difficult it is for sellers to stand out and attract the attention of buyers. In other words, the platform relies on having more sellers to function, but the more sellers it hosts, the more difficult it becomes for existing sellers to ensure the long-term viability of their business.
> 
> **Over-saturation of the platform creates a high risk of sellers moving to other, more beneficial platforms**. Sellers may no longer see the value in paying fees to be part of an over-saturated platform and end up switching to competing platforms that offer slightly different benefits (for example, different customer groups, varying fee structures, and transaction costs). Or they choose to use multiple platforms to expand their market reach and make more sales.
> 
> For example, consider Amazon Handmade and Etsy. Both platforms facilitate transactions between buyers looking for handmade products and sellers of handmade products, and they both offer slightly different fees and benefits. Handmade sellers can pick and choose between the two platforms (as well as multiple other handmade marketplaces) depending on the nature of their products and services, and the best return on their investment and time. Consequently, multi-sided platforms are forced to compete fiercely on both price and quality to keep their sellers from switching to competitor platforms.
