## Exercise: Challenge Assumptions to Generate Ideas and Solutions

Sometimes, we get stuck on seeing things a certain way and find it difficult to think of more efficient or creative alternatives. Reframing questions can help you to challenge your assumptions to generate new ideas and solutions for your business model.

* * *

Think of one product or service you intend to offer and the customer group you intend to serve. What is the worst possible feature you could add to this product or service? What would upset your customer group?

Why would this feature upset your customer group? What problems would it create?

What if you changed your customer group or offered your product or service to a different market? Would anyone be happy to pay for this feature?

What is the complete opposite of this terrible feature? How can you use your answer to improve the product or service you intend to offer?
