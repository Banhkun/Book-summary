## Exercise: Start Planning a Speech

Use Carnegie’s tips to jump-start your public speaking skills.

* * *

Before making any speech, Carnegie recommends that you identify and develop ideas that you feel passionately about. What contemporary topics, issues, or interests most appeal to you?

Of these interests, pick one that most ignites your enthusiasm. Below, list a few ways you could begin developing your thinking on that topic (for instance, by asking yourself questions about why it interests you).

Next, think through whether your speech would work best as an informative, persuasive, action-inspiring, or entertaining speech. Explain why you chose that speech objective.

Finally, determine where you might speak on this topic—for example, is there a local public speaking program you could join, or does your community hold open political meetings you could speak at?
