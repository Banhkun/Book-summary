## Exercise: Spark Her Arousal

Kerner explains that before you begin to touch your partner's clitoris, you need to get her sufficiently aroused. To do this, you should engage in _at least_ 10-15 minutes of foreplay. However, you can start the arousal process hours in advance if you plan ahead.

* * *

Based on Kerner’s foreplay advice, what kind of sexy hints might you give your partner in the hours before your session to spark her arousal and let her know you want her? (For example, you might send her sexy texts or photos, ask her suggestive questions, or gift her some new lingerie.) List a few ideas here.

Are there any particular fantasies that you or your partner have that would intensify arousal during your session? Record any possible ideas below. (For example, you might have a specific role-playing situation in mind or fantasize about using restraints like handcuffs or ties.)

Describe a few of Kerner’s foreplay recommendations that you’d like to try in the minutes immediately before making first contact with your partner’s clitoris and explain how you’ll incorporate them. (For example, you can decide to give her a massage and incorporate it by starting at her scalp and slowly moving down her body until you reach her vulva.)
