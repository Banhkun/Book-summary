## Part 2: The Western Diet and Diseases | Chapter 4: What We Know and Don’t Know

To create eating habits that support better health, we need to fix the relationship between humans and food as part of the overall food chain. To do this, we need to leave the Western diet behind. But what about all those already experiencing poor health? Has the Western diet destroyed their chances for a healthy life?

### Is the Damage Reversible?

**The Western diet has spread throughout most of the civilized world and beyond. The decline in health of those who follow it is no secret.** But until 1982, what was unclear was whether the damage could be reversed. A study of 10 Aborigines in Australia provided the first grain of hope that it could.

In summer 1982, a research scientist, Kerin O’Dea, asked 10 formerly bush-dwelling Aborigines to return to their previous lives as hunters and gatherers to see if their health improved. Since moving to civilization years before, all had developed Type 2 diabetes and were at high risk for heart disease. They’d also developed “metabolic syndrome,” a disorder in which the body is unable to metabolize carbohydrates and fats appropriately through insulin production.

When the Aborigines returned to the bush, they lived by the coast and consumed seafood, birds, grubs, and kangaroos. In search of more plants, they moved inland and ate freshwater fish, turtles, crocodiles, birds, kangaroos, yams, figs, and honey. This diet was vastly different from the one at the western settlements, which included mostly flour, sugar, carbonated drinks, alcohol, and cheap meat.

After 7 weeks, O’Dea tested their blood and found that every aspect of their health had improved.

  * They each lost an average of 18 pounds.
  * They had decreased blood pressure.
  * Their triglyceride levels normalized.
  * There was an increase of omega-3 fatty acids in their systems.



The results revealed that **the negative health outcomes experienced by western populations could be reduced by changes in diet**. The beauty of O’Dea’s study was her lack of focus on nutrients. She didn’t break down the nutrients in the foods the Aborigines ate. She focused, rather, on their overall dietary patterns.

The focus on dietary patterns makes it difficult to pin down exactly what needs to change in the Western diet, but it raises a lot of questions about whole foods and health. These questions are more important than ever:

  * Two-thirds of Americans are obese. 
  * One-fourth have metabolic syndrome. 
  * Approximately 54 million people are pre-diabetic. 
  * Type 2 diabetes has increased by 4% since 1990 (about 20 million people). 



But if this information was known in 1982, why are we still stuck in the Western diet culture?

### Western Denial

**Most nutritional studies focus on nutrients, not foods or dietary patterns. But these are two of the most important factors to consider if a shift in nutrition and health can happen.** Almost every nutritional study, from the Nurses’ study to the Women’s Health Initiative, fails to address the main staples of the Western diet: processed foods, added fats, sugar, and scant amounts of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. However, this was not always the case.

**Today, cancer and heart disease are so common, there’s a feeling of inevitability surrounding them.** People look to medicine to save them and can’t imagine a time when these illnesses weren’t prevalent. But before the second world war, the rates of killer diseases were low. During the early 1900s, scientists started to notice a higher frequency of killer disease diagnoses. Reports from health professionals, who’d witnessed the entry of Western civilization into remote indigenous cultures and the domino effect of disease that followed, piqued their interest. Discussions about the relationship between industrialization and health began in the research and science communities.

One person heavily involved in this discussion was a Canadian dentist named Weston A. Price. Price moved to Ohio in the 1930s and started to see a rapid decrease in formally healthy teeth. He proffered that the new modern diet was responsible for increased tooth decay.

In 1934, Price was one of many who debated whether hygiene or the modern diet was to blame for the increased dental problems. Hygiene won the day, likely because it was easier to change and more profitable for dentists. Following this, Price closed his practice and traveled to isolated communities unaffected by the modern diet. His findings included the following:

  * People who ate traditional diets showed no evidence of oral degeneration or malformations.
  * Their diets were much higher in vitamins A and D, almost ten times more than in the diets of modern society.
  * One diet wasn’t better than another because all focused on fresh animals and plants raised on and grown in unadulterated soils.
  * The health of the people was better when the health of the animals was better. 
  * Butter made from cows fed grasses had higher levels of vitamins A and D than those raised during the winter. 



Price saw the connections among soil, grass, animals, and humans. He reasoned that t**he industrialization of food broke the natural order of things in two ways: depleting soils of nutrients, thereby the food grown in them, and destroying the surviving nutrients through processing**. These actions intervened in the natural momentum of nutrients in the food chain, and the physiological needs of the human body were no longer satisfied.

Although some scientists were interested in Price’s ideas before the war, everything changed with WWII. During the war, industry was helping save lives and protect the country. No one wanted to hear it criticized. With the war’s end and America’s victory, the industrial machine was firmly in place. Industrial agriculture saw a chance to take over and did. Everyone forgot about Price and his theories until the 1960s, when organic agriculture entered the scene.
