## Part 1: Nutritionism in America | Chapter 1: The War Between Food and Nutrients

American eating habits took a sharp turn in the 20th century, when the focus on positive nutrition turned from whole food to nutrients (chemical and mineral compounds found in food). Although the theoretical aspects of this shift sprouted between the late-19th and mid-20th centuries, the effects didn’t become wholly obvious until the 1980s.

On grocery store shelves in the 1980s, **food identified as food was being replaced by packages identified by their nutrient components, whether bad or good.** Words like cholesterol, fiber, and saturated fats replaced eggs, grains, and meat. This new strategy suggested that the inclusion or exclusion of these substances equaled positive or negative health for consumers. Real food became antiquated. Nutrients took over as the shiny new, lab-tested giant of healthy eating—eat the good and avoid the bad to find physical Nirvana. The events that led to this shift and those that have followed created the Western diet.

### How Nutrients Came to Be

The work of an English doctor and chemist would change the face of the American diet forever. William Prout was the first person to isolate and identify the three main compounds in food, called macronutrients: fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Following on Prout’s coattails was German scientist Justus von Liebig, one of the founders of organic chemistry. **Liebig took these macronutrients and broke them down further into a handful of micronutrients he claimed were solely responsible for digestion and growth.**

Following this logic, Liebig created bouillon and the first baby formula to concentrate these vital nutrients. However, a few observations challenged his assertion:

  * Doctors found that babies fed Liebig’s formula were not thriving.
  * Sailors were suffering a number of health ailments despite receiving plentiful amounts of fats, proteins, and carbs. 
  * In contrast, oranges and potatoes had a curative effect on the sailor’s health. 



These observations led to further research, and from those efforts came vitamins. Vitamins became the new best thing in nutritional science. Deficiency conditions, like beriberi and scurvy, cleared up because of certain vitamins. Then vitamins were linked to growth and vitality. **By the mid-20th century, vitamins took center stage as the answer to the question of what to eat, leaving whole foods further behind.**

#### Cementing Nutrient-Focused Science

In the 1960s, the government sought answers to the growing health crisis in America, including the increase of killer diseases and malnutrition. The Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs was formed to research the relationship between food and health. At the head of the committee was South Dakota Senator George McGovern. For several years, scientists studied food consumption and health in America and discovered some interesting patterns.

  * During World War II, meat and dairy were strictly rationed, and rates of heart disease were reduced. 
  * After the war, when rationing was no longer required, coronary heart disease skyrocketed in America. 
  * Other cultures who maintained a plant-based diet after the war did not experience the same results. 



**These findings created** **the “lipid hypothesis,” whichstatedthat fat and cholesterol, mostly from meat and dairy, led to increased rates of heart disease.** This hypothesis motivated the committee to create the _Dietary Goals for the U.S._ guidelines in 1977. This report advised Americans to reduce their consumption of red meat and dairy. It did not exist for very long.

The meat and dairy industries strongly criticized the committee’s findings, including cattle ranchers in South Dakota—Senator McGovern’s constituents. As a result, a retraction was printed that changed the advice from “eat less red meat and dairy” to “choose meat and dairy that reduce saturated fats.” With this change, a domino effect occurred in the industrial, political, and social spheres.

  * The focus was taken from the problematic food and put on a problematic nutrient. 
  * If the actual food was not responsible for negative health, then the powerful meat and dairy industries were not, either. 
  * McGovern was voted out of office by food-industry lobbyists, which sent a powerful message to other government entities who might broach the topic again. 
  * **The concept of “eating less” was erased from nutritional guidelines forever.**



#### The Ensuing Aftermath

The problem with the changes made to the report was the lack of acknowledgement of how certain foods differ from one another. The report suggested that all meat was equal nutrition-wise. But beef, poultry, and fish are about as similar as cars, bikes, and skateboards. Saying these three meat items are similar vehicles for a simple nutrient, saturated fat, is like saying the three transportation devices are the same because they get you to your destination.

This flawed logic was perpetuated by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in their report on diet and cancer. Rather than report their findings in a food-by-food manner, they used a nutrient-by-nutrient manner. For instance, the report spoke of the benefit of antioxidants in vegetables, but not the benefit of any specific vegetable.

With the Senate’s guidelines and the NAS report, **science had officially begun our current obsession with nutrients over food**. With the help of the food industry, marketers, and media sources, America entered the _Age of Nutritionism_.

### What Is Nutritionism?

“Nutritionism” focuses on the benefits of foods as a sum of their parts, rather than the whole. The term was coined by a sociologist as a way to explain this new way of regarding food and health. To understand what nutritionism is, you must understand a few key aspects encompassed in the term.

#### 1\. Nutritionism is not a synonym for nutrition.

The suffix “-ism” denotes a system, philosophy, or ideology. Therefore, **nutritionism is an ideological concept regarding the science of nutrition, not a field of that science**. Ideologies are grounded in marginally examined hypotheses made about observed relationships among pieces of information.

Regarding nutritionism, the assumption is that nutrients are the gateway to understanding food, or the parts compose the whole. Because nutrients are invisible and intangible, a subsequent assumption is that the public is not equipped to understand their nuanced details. People must rely on science to tell them what the value of food is.

  * Think of this idea as similar to religious faith and looking to a priest to bridge the gap between God and Heaven and the living world. 



The reductionist assumption that food is eaten solely for health benefits is understandable when food is valued only as a vehicle for nutrient transportation. This assumption is further supported when science becomes the authority for disseminating the value of nutrients. **The resulting mindset is that certain nutrients are valuable and certain nutrients are harmful.**

#### 2\. Every good nutrient must have an antagonist.

To ensure the public’s interest in the good nutrient, a bad nutrient is offered up as the enemy. The past decades have seen wars waged between carbohydrates and proteins, proteins and fats, and fats and carbohydrates.

In addition to the conflicts between these “super power” nutrients, smaller civil wars are waged within each: simple carbs vs. complex carbs, animal protein vs. plant-based protein, and saturated fats vs. polyunsaturated fats. Currently, the virtuous omega-3 fatty acids are being promoted over the devious trans fats.

**This type of nutritional duality creates an environment ripe for a revolving door of fad diets and shifting loyalties among nutrients.** These shifts happen in the blink of an eye based on whatever way the science winds blow.

#### 3\. The compounding effects of whole foods are irrelevant.

When we only consider foods as valuable for their nutrient make-up, we ignore the internal workings of whole foods. An example of this short-sightedness is the current state of milk.

Milk has become nothing more than a vessel for delivering protein, lactose, fat, and calcium. For decades, food science has attempted to simulate the beneficial effects of these nutrients in milk-like substances. From Liebig’s first attempt to develop a suitable baby formula, several other iterations have entered the market. However, despite the changing compositions of ingredients and added nutrients, there has never been a time when babies fed formula have thrived as well as those given human milk.

If baby formula has the same chemical compounds as milk, it should react similarly in the body. But it doesn’t. The question must be asked: What inherent interactions are happening within the whole milk product to create this advantage?

**The boundaries between whole foods and processed foods diminish when food is only valuable as the sum of its parts.** Nutritionism would have you believe that a box of cheese-food product fortified with essential nutrients is as healthy or healthier than actual whole milk cheese straight from the farm. This suggestion is extremely beneficial for the nutritionism movement, but it may be extremely dangerous to your health.

### Nutrient Home Invasion

The relationship between nutritionism and processed food manufacturers is akin to that of criminals and accomplices. **Stating that any food, even synthetic food, can be made healthy or healthier than real food through scientific modifications justifies the value of processed foods. This justification reinforces their appeal to the public.** Yet, the modifications may not always lead to healthier people. The history of margarine is a good example.

In the 1800s, margarine was created from hydrogenated vegetable oil as a cheap alternative for butter. But after the lipid hypothesis, margarine manufacturers swept in with claims that their product was healthier than fat- and cholesterol-laden butter. The hydrogenated vegetable oil could be injected with all sorts of good nutrients to support optimal health.

Unfortunately, solidifying vegetable oil with hydrogen creates trans fats. At the time, no one knew that trans fats were even more dangerous than the saturated fats they were replacing. But once scientists saw the link between trans fats and killer diseases, margarine got a face-lift to reduce trans fats. A new war was waged against trans fats as though they’d never been promoted. This was a positive step for future consumers, but those who’d been eating margarine in good faith for decades may not have been so lucky.

How was it possible for this dangerous food source to rise to the status of shining star of nutritionism? Again, the U.S. government played a large role.

#### Validating Fake Food

**Americans were almost saved from the manipulative marketing of the food industry, but the power of the industry thwarted that effort.** In 1906, the publication of Upton Sinclair’s novel _The Jungle_ created a crisis for the food industry. The novel exposed the horrific conditions and unethical processes involved in meat and by-product manufacturing. The public urged the government to do something to protect them from these adulterated and unhygienic products.

In response, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 created mandates requiring all synthetic foods be labeled “imitation.” **The idea was simple: if a food was packaged to represent traditional real food but was modified in some way, it must be outed as such.** Enter the food industry, which fought with everything it had for decades to repeal the mandate. They complained the rule undermined innovation in food science to address the lipid hypothesis and relationship between food and killer diseases.

The efforts of the food industry were again bolstered by scientific organizations. The American Heart Association spearheaded a campaign against saturated fats in favor of vegetable oil. It recommended that foods be modified to remove the bad fats and cholesterol. To ensure the public would eat these healthier foods, they promoted the removal of the “imitation” label. The AHA believed the label placed a negative light on modified foods.

With this scientific backing, the Food and Drug Administration adjusted the mandate in 1973. **The new laws stated that any “imitation” product equal or superior to the real item in nutrient value could be sold without labeling it as synthetic.** With this step, the FDA became the newest member of nutritionism, inducting the American public by proxy.

Food manufacturers had a field day without the restrictive labeling requirements. Any food with “unhealthy” natural fat, such as yogurt and cream, could be modified with hydrogenated oil. Soy protein could now masquerade as animal protein in products like Bacon Bits. Egg substitution products appeared on the scene, joined by non-dairy creamers.

The assumption was that science could perfectly simulate the benefits of real foods without the negative natural components. But as the baby formula example illustrates, that claim has never been validated. Still, the passive public were none the wiser, and the food industry was off to the races. Enter the golden age of processed food.
