## Introduction: Why Food Is in Need of Defense

For decades, Americans have sought to determine which foods support optimal health. A multi-million dollar food marketing and science industry have dedicated their efforts to finding this answer. **But the solution to what to eat can be boiled down to a basic principle:_eat mostly plant-based real food in moderation_.**Seems easy, right? So why all the fuss?

The tried and tested days of tradition are gone. In those days, fresh and unprocessed foods dominated the culture and family guided eating decisions. Now, we have grocery stores full of processed foods and a government food pyramid about as trustworthy as the money-making schemes of the same name.

Food products no longer look like whole food. They are modified for mass production, easy consumption, and low cost. They come with health claims stamped on their packages to guide the would-be savvy shopper. The existence of a health claim on a food package should be the first red flag to consumers. Real food doesn’t need a health claim. Processed foods do.

We have given the power to decide what to put in our bodies to science, government, and media. The need for humans to be told what to eat, something our ancestors were able to figure out for themselves for centuries, shows just how far we’ve fallen down the confusing dietary rabbit hole.

**The dietary guidelines for optimal foods and eating habits are changing more than once per generation. These changes are motivated by information doled out by those who gain the most from consumer confusion.** If people stopped needing dietary advice, the following consequences would occur:

  * The food industry would lose millions of dollars in marketing and product revenues.
  * Nutrition scientists would have nothing to study.
  * The media would have less to write about regarding food trends and health.



With all of this at stake, why would these industries work to stabilize nutritional information or make deciding what to eat easy?

They wouldn’t. Instead, these industries have created an atmosphere that supports three prominent myths about food:

  1. Nutrients are more important than food type.
  2. Nutrients are complicated and require scientific explanations.
  3. Eating is simply a means to a healthy body.



Through these myths, we’ve become victims of the oppressive message that science knows best when it comes to food. And we’re told that everything we need to know about what to eat can be found on dietary labels.

One problem with this mindset is that food is not merely an engine that fuels biological health. **Eating is a cultural practice as much as it is an avenue toward health.** Food is also meant to be enjoyed. It helps create cultural, community, and individual identity. Sharing meals strengthens family and social bonds.

These aspects are not represented by the mass-marketing of processed foods and nutrition science. Instead, they have gone by the wayside of a cultural obsession with the body. Unfortunately, this obsession hasn’t led to healthier bodies.

### The American Paradox of the Western Diet

Americans are increasingly falling into the trap of _orthorexia_ —an unhealthy obsession with healthy eating. No other culture in the world worries about food as much as we do. But for all the worrying and efforts to standardize the link between food and health, we are more unhealthy than ever before _**_ (and, subsequently, than any other culture).

The American paradox is the opposite of the French paradox. The French paradox explains how the French are less concerned about nutrition yet eat a richer diet and are healthier than Americans. By contrast, **all the rules and concern regarding food in America add up to an increase in the rates of four “killer” diseases: heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer.**

Before the industrialization of food in the mid-20th century, these diseases were not as common. The introduction of and reliance on processed and refined foods, pesticides, growth hormones, modified fats, and three staple ingredients—corn, soy, and wheat—created the “Western diet” and set the health of Americans into a tailspin.

In other cultures that have not adopted the Western diet, these diseases are low in frequency. In contrast, cultures that have adopted the Western diet quickly see an increase in the number of people afflicted with obesity and killer diseases.

The Western diet is a well-oiled machine. It focuses more on refining a heavily processed diet for maximum benefit than questioning why the food is not healthy to begin with. Non-industrialized fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are not prominent in many mainstream dietary considerations because the effort to acquire these foods is more difficult. Short of cultivating a private farm, access to these foods has always been limited.

However, the increased popularity of farmer’s markets, organic farms, and ethical livestock rearing has made it possible to cut ties with industry-driven food sources. Subsequently, these better food options are also more advantageous for the environment and psychological health of consumers.

**What you eat has actual consequences on physical and psychological health.** Moving toward a new era of real food, or food-as-food, will help shift the cultural dietary paradigm away from the destructive Western diet.

In Part 1, you’ll learn about the ideology of nutritionism and the way science and government perpetuate it. In Part 2, you’ll learn what the Western diet is and how we came to rely on it. And in Part 3, you’ll learn how to move away from the Western diet and toward better health.
