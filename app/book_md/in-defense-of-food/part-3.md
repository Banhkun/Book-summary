## Part 3: Kicking Nutritionism to the Curb | Chapter 6: Saying Goodbye to the Western Diet

To change your habits away from the Western Diet, you must differentiate the theories from the problem and work to address the latter. The different theories of nutritionism presented in this summary may create more confusion about what you should eat and what not to eat. Many of them contradict each other or overlap. For instance, is it a lack of omega-3s that leads to disease or an influx of refined carbohydrates? If carbohydrates are the problem, what does that mean for the lipid hypothesis?

It’s natural for scientists and the general public to want a one-stop solution that is easily proven and disseminated. Yet, **allowing the one-nutrient mentality to serve as the endpoint of the issue is narrow, short-sighted, and ineffective in helping guide you to good choices**. Think of who is actually benefiting from these theories. Is it the consumer, who is yo-yoed between this nutrient and that nutrient? Not really. The main beneficiaries of nutritionism, again, are the food and science industries.

  * Theories help the food industry know which products to make and how to market them. They are road maps for how to continue promoting the Western diet instead of changing their businesses. 
  * Theories help the science industry know which drugs to make and push, what research to fund, which procedures and treatments to prescribe, and which diet plans and medications to promote. It’s more profitable to treat the effects of the Western diet than help a society become less dependent on medicine. 



The good news is that theories are just that—ideas that attempt to explain a problem or phenomenon. **Regardless of the theory, the problem remains the same—eating a Western diet leads to Western diseases.** The “how” and “why” are less important than the “what,” meaning you have to treat the whole problem, not just the symptoms.

### What Is the Solution?

It seems like the obvious answer is “don’t eat the Western diet,” but that advice is not as simple as it sounds. Our culture is deeply embedded in the Western diet and nutritionism ideology, and many of us don’t live in environments where returning to ancestral traditions is truly possible. **Whole foods are not what they used to be. The beef you eat is not the beef your ancestors ate**.

  * Your beef was likely raised in a stockyard and fed the Western diet.
  * Hormones, antibiotics, and industrial waste and chemicals were likely introduced. 
  * The soil used to grow the corn or grain the cows eat was likely fertilized with industrial-grade fertilizers. 



Although a whole food, this product has been adulterated by industry and has less nutritional value than before. Does this beef count as a whole food? Perhaps not. This brings up one of the main issues you’ll find in the following advice on how to shift your eating away from the Western diet. **How a food is produced is just as important as what the food is and how you eat it.**

The guidance that follows attempts to provide a new way of thinking about food that focuses on the food chain and the relationship between the health of the environment and human health. You have to expand your mind beyond nutrient-specific advantages and disadvantages when thinking about healthy eating. The suggestions in the next sections do not focus on specific foods, nutrients, or calories. They focus on ways to think about food and shopping that lead to a variety of healthy meals.

It takes work to change your eating habits and to eat better. The simplified food industry and foods have spoiled the expectations for eating. We want food to be fast, easy, and inexpensive. **More effort, time, and resources are needed to leave the Western diet behind, but that is the trade-off for better health.**
