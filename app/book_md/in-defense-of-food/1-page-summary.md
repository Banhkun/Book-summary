## 1-Page Summary

American society is inundated with food. There are thousands of options of what to eat and a myriad of ways to eat it. So why does food need defending? In _In Defense of Food_ , Michael Pollan distinguishes between real food and processed food and how the reliance on the latter leads to a society plagued by Western diseases.

### Where We Went Wrong

Since the mid-20th century, **Americans have looked to the government and scientists to tell them what to eat and what not to eat**. As we’ll see, a decision that was once successfully made by families guided by tradition was turned over to those who benefit most from consumer confusion.

The industrialization of food changed how food was produced and the nutritional value of food. Farmers started using pesticides and chemical enhancements to fortify soil for faster production, tainting the plants grown in it. A reliance on three main staples—corn, soy, and wheat—infiltrated the industry as refined carbohydrates, processed sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats. **Nutritional science and industry successfully shifted the focus from real food to nutrients and implied that eating was solely intended to bring about physical health.**

We have willingly handed the chef’s hat to the multi-million-dollar food and science industries, losing the culture of food along the way. We’ve become obsessed with health labels and eating by the numbers, but none of this has resulted in better health. In fact, **an increase in the rate of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and obesity is the result of the industrialization of food and the advent of the Western diet**. Getting us back on track to healthier bodies and minds requires a paradigm shift about food production and food culture.

### The Heavy Hand of Nutritionism

The only rule about eating that you need to understand is _eat mostly plant-based real food in moderation._**_ _This idea is simple enough and should be easy to follow. What has prevented us from following this simple rule is the rise of nutritionism. **Nutritionism is an ideology about nutritional science, not an actual branch of that science.** The focus of nutritionism is on isolating certain nutrients—proteins, carbohydrates, certain fats, and antioxidants—as the cause of either good or bad health. The concept is “eat more of the good nutrients to live longer.”

But this narrow view of health and eating ignores the other advantages of food. These advantages include the holistic benefits of whole foods and a more traditional food culture.

The focus on nutrients led to the lipid hypothesis, a theory developed in the 1960s that states that fat and cholesterol, mostly from meat and dairy, lead to increased rates of heart disease. Originally, the hypothesis was used to urge consumers to eat less animal protein and dairy, but the powerful and influential meat and dairy industries fought back.

**They used the concept of nutritionism to shift the blame from the unhealthy whole foods to unhealthy nutrients.** Their efforts changed government guideline language from “eat less animal proteins and dairy” to “eat proteins and dairy that help reduce saturated fat.” With this shift, nutritionism gained a massive hold over America’s food culture.

#### The Birth of Imitation Food

The science and food industries tightened their grip on the American diet after winning another major battle against real food. In the early 20th-century, the Food and Drug Administration stipulated that “imitation” food, or food made with artificial ingredients or chemically altered, must be labeled as such. With food manufacturers now touting the benefits of nutritionism and processing foods to match, they feared the negative response consumers might have to this label.

With the help of the American Heart Association, who recommended that foods be modified to reduce cholesterol and saturated fats, the food industry was successful in repealing the mandate. Now, **any food-like product that equaled or surpassed real food in nutrient value could be sold without a warning label.** The age of processed food kicked into high gear.

### The Low-Fat Fiasco

The issues with nutritionism and processed foods would be nil if we were actually getting healthier, but we’re not, thanks to the lipid hypothesis. The lipid hypothesis made saturated fats the main enemy of health. People believed that removing saturated fats from food and replacing them with “good” fats, like hydrogenated seed oil, was the best solution to improving health. The low-fat food revolution began, with hydrogenated oil becoming the fat of choice to be added to all foods to make them healthier. This decision had far-reaching consequences. Many believe **the current obesity and diabetes epidemics in America correspond with the rise of low-fat foods in the 1970s.**

The process of solidifying vegetable oil using hydrogen creates trans fat. Scientists and food marketers urged Americans to eat more trans fat in low-fat foods. Unfortunately, the evidence supporting this recommendation was flimsy from the start.

American eating habits during and after WWII formed the assumptions that led to the lipid hypothesis. During the war, meat and dairy were rationed and heart disease was low. After the war, eating resumed as normal, and heart disease increased. But the researchers failed to acknowledge that people ate less during the war and exercised by walking more because of rationed gasoline. Also, post-war eating became increasingly industrial, with hydrogenated oil in foods like margarine already soaring in popularity during that time.

It wasn’t until the 1990s that scientists realized the deadly effects of trans fat. But by that time, it was too late. **Low-fat foods had taken overthe American diet, and Americans got fatter and sicker.**

### The Western Diet and Diseases

Most nutritional studies in America have one thing in common—none of them examine the types of food promoted by the Western diet. They only look at nutrients. But when you ignore the effects of processed foods, added fats, sugar, and scant amounts of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains on the body, you’re missing a big piece of the puzzle.

**Scientists know that the Western diet is linked to killer diseases and that cultures who adopt the Western diet fall victim to these diseases shortly after.** What was not known before was whether the negative effects could be reversed. However, studies now show that reverting back to traditional dietary patterns involving whole foods can mitigate the damage done. To create eating habits that support better health, we need to fix the relationship between humans and food as part of the overall food chain.

### Five Shifts that Changed the Relationship Between Humans and Food

When one aspect of the food chain is disrupted, it affects the entire food chain. If the soil is unhealthy, the plants grown will be unhealthy, as will the animals who eat the plants and the humans who eat the animals. We once had a close familiarity with our food and used our senses and instincts to determine when food was good or bad. Our bodies also knew how to accept the food and what to do with it. But five shifts created distance between people and food and led to a host of health issues for the entire food chain.

#### 1\. The Rise of Refined Foods

The advent of refined carbohydrates is one of the most fundamental changes in the history of food and one of the most damaging to the human body. In the past, we ate whole wheat ground in stone mills. Stone grounding retained the germ in the wheat, which contains most of the nutritional value. But the invention of steel rollers during the Industrial Revolution changed how grains were processed. **The rollers now removed the germ, creating a fine white flour devoid of nutrients and more resilient to spoilage.** Corn, rice, and sugar also went through similar processes.

By removing the nutrient-rich germ, the internal synergistic interactions of the whole grain was lost. The refined flour now broke down into glucose quickly without fiber to slow its release. The problem with this simplified digestion process is that the body reacts by producing excess insulin. The influx of insulin makes you think you’re hungry and leads to overeating. In the worst case, your body can’t produce enough insulin to match the excess sugar, and Type 2 diabetes results.

#### 2\. The Simplification of Food

After WWII, farmers began adding nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to soil to increase the rate of plant growth. At the same time, farms that once raised a diverse species of crops and livestock started growing mostly corn and soybeans. Both actions created plants lacking in nutrients.

When plant growth is sped up, the time allotted for plants to soak up nutrients is shortened. And with the three growth elements readily available, plant roots have no need to dig deep to seek vital minerals. This lack of nutrients makes plants more susceptible to pests and disease, which require the use of pesticides to fix. The pesticides seep into the plants and are digested as toxins in the body.

Likewise, reducing the ecological diversity of farms to one or two crops means less diversity in the nutrients going back into the soil. **The human body requires a myriad of minerals and nutrients to function properly, and the likelihood of two species providing anywhere close to the appropriate amount is small** , especially when those species are industrially grown.

#### 3\. Sacrificing Value for Abundance

The efforts to simplify how food is grown, make food more durable, and reduce the number of food species have stripped most of the nutritional value of whole foods on the market today. **The result is a food inflation, in which it takes more food today to gain the same nutritional benefits of food in the past.**

Corn, soy, and wheat are high-yield crops. They’re grown quickly and in abundance. Corn and soy are easily manipulated for use as sweeteners, fats, and proteins, and their use in most processed foods allows food to be cheap. Livestock are also fed these crops, reducing their value both in price and nutrition. **Cheap and easy food is now the standard in the American diet, but it comes with the cost of poor nutrition.**

#### 4\. The Absence of Plants in the Diet

The shift from green plants to the three staple crops creates a disadvantage for human health. Plants are high in micronutrients, such as antioxidants, vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids. Grains and seeds are high in omega-6 fatty acids and macronutrients, or fats, carbohydrates, and protein. Macronutrients are high in calories, and an overabundance in the body is linked to many Western diseases.

Furthermore, omega-6s promote inflammation and reinforce cell walls, which makes metabolism difficult. Omega-3s, in contrast, support metabolism by making cell walls permeable, reduce inflammation, and seem to regulate heart rhythms. **Both fatty acids compete for cells and enzymes in the body, so the ratio of the two is likely the significant determining factor for your health.** A diet higher in green plants than seeds and grains will help push the ratio to your favor.

#### 5\. The Shift in Food Culture

The shift in focus from whole foods and traditional meals to nutrients and fast processed food has significant effects on our health and food culture. The problem is that we see food as a mere mechanism for nutrient consumption. The faster and easier we can get those nutrients the better. **We are so ingrained in the eat-on-the-go mentality that whole foods play a small part, if any, in our eating habits.** In addition, Western diseases have become so common, they feel inevitable.

Our complacency with the state of food and culture makes it easy for science and industry to continue producing fortified food instead of addressing the underlying issues of diet and lifestyle. To stop the Western diet from continuing its rampage on society and health, we need to reclaim the lost quality and culture of our food.

### Saying Goodbye to the Western Diet

To change your habits away from the Western diet, you must differentiate the theories from the problem and work to address the latter. **Regardless of the theory, the problem remains the same—eating a Western diet leads to Western diseases.** The “how” and “why” are less important than the “what,” meaning you have to treat the whole problem, not just the symptoms.

The following rules can help you cut ties with the Western diet.

**What to eat:**

  * **Eat only real food, meaning whole foods or food with ingredients your great-grandmother would recognize.**
  * Eat more green plants, and make meat a side dish to vegetables. 
  * Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables to consume a variety of nutrients.
  * Eat wild plants and game, which are high in nutrients.



**What not to eat:**

  * Don’t eat food with more than five ingredients or containing high-fructose corn syrup.
  * Avoid foods with health claims. Real food doesn’t typically come in packages, and when it does, it often doesn’t need a label expressing how healthy it is. 
  * Avoid industrialized meats and produce.



**How to eat:**

  * **Eat slowly and with other people.**
  * Eat meals at tables. Don’t eat snacks.
  * Eat smaller portions and listen to your body to know when you’re full.



**Where to get food:**

  * Shop at farmer’s markets or join a community-sponsored agriculture group.
  * Grow a garden and cook your meals at home. 



**When you understand where food comes from and prepare it yourself, you become part of a healthier food chain.** When the whole food chain is respected and supported, your health and the health of the natural world will be, as well.
