## Chapter 3: Why Scientists Have Gotten It Wrong

Several factors make the study of nutrition difficult: 1) the focus on nutrients makes studying food benefits difficult, and 2) the tools used to measure nutritional data are lacking in methodology. These factors make it hard to truly understand food and eating habits. However, this problem doesn’t stop scientists from claiming their findings as fact.

### Studying Nutrients Instead of Food

**When you take the nutrient out of the context of food, you miss influential relationships within whole foods and the numerous possible benefits beyond the one identified.** Other important variables pertaining to health are also ignored, such as diet patterns, lifestyles, and human physiology. _**_

No two humans are alike. There are specific inherent differences that either support or hinder nutritional health.

  * People have genetically predisposed metabolisms that break food down in different ways and at various speeds. 
  * Some people are unable to digest lactose. 
  * Some bodies break down fats in a way that always leads to high cholesterol regardless of what they eat. 
  * Digestive systems vary in ecology, so they digest and process calories differently.
  * Bacteria in the gut plays a large role in health and differs from person to person. 



The human eater is not a robot that reacts to food in the same way every time. Your body is constantly adjusting to your environment, and the science on the physiological makeup of the digestive system is incomplete. (Shortform note: What this means is that human health statuses cannot be generalized anymore than singing voices can.)

Likewise, no two whole foods are alike. Whole foods also have a complex internal structure in which various compounds work together depending on type and size. **Whole foods behave differently in the body than nutrients do, and since people consume whole foods, not isolated nutrients, nutritional science should focus on food.**

The reluctance to see the whole from the parts is ingrained in the field of study. The general paradigm of all scientific study is to isolate a variable to add to or remove from a sample to observe the effect. But to reduce scientific assessment of food to one variable leads to false assumptions. An example of the problem with this approach is the antioxidant revolution.

#### The Curious Case of Antioxidants

Scientists know that there is a connection among fruits and vegetables and cancer. To determine what this connection was, they isolated the various components and discovered the benefits of antioxidants. One benefit is that antioxidants seem to occupy cell receptors so free radicals—which destroy cells and cause cancer—can’t.

**The nutritionism strategy is to isolate this nutrient in supplement form to create the same benefits.** But antioxidant supplements have proven ineffective in providing the same benefits. The following factors could be why:

  * The antioxidant alone may not be what reduces free radicals, but rather the role of antioxidants in the whole food. 
  * How the antioxidant-rich food is digested could improve antioxidant absorption.
  * An interaction with fiber or another compound could be what activates or promotes antioxidant behaviors.
  * The wrong antioxidant could be isolated. 



There are several antioxidants within each fruit and vegetable. For instance, in one leaf of thyme, there are dozens of antioxidants. There really is no way to determine which one, if any, helps the body and whether that help is an isolated or compound effect. The beauty is that you don’t need to know. **The great thing about eating food instead of nutrients is that you don’t have to worry about what each nutrient is doing. You can just eat the food and get the benefit.**

#### The Zero-Sum Fallacy

Nutrient-focused science is a zero-sum game, meaning if you’re eating more of one thing, you’re eating less of something else. Increase trans fats to reduce saturated fats. The focus tends to be on eliminating one thing by adding another. But not eating enough of a good thing also has an impact. **What you’re not eating is just as important as what you are.** Another gander at the lipid hypothesis helps illuminate this point.

Science says that saturated fat in animal proteins is the problem, but what if the whole animal protein is the culprit? Maybe the simple act of eating animal protein reduces the amount of fruits and vegetables consumed. Maybe a larger portion of fruits and vegetables in the diet helps manage the effect of saturated fat. If this were the case, lean beef technically would be no better for you than regular beef.

**Nutritionism is so focused on removing the bad, it fails to acknowledge good foods that don’t require scrutinization.**

### The Tools Used to Study Nutrition

One of the biggest problems with nutritionism is that the evidence supporting it is based on faulty tests. **Several mechanisms are used to study both foods and eating habits, and all of them come with limitations.**

#### Studying Food and Nutrients

It’s hard for nutritional scientists to study diet by isolating one factor. If they remove meat from a trial diet, they reduce the total calories of the diet. The question becomes which action created the results: the removal of meat or the fewer calories consumed? If they try to fix this by adding calories with healthy fats, carbs, or proteins, which variable is responsible for the outcome? When one food element is removed, the entire sample is altered.

Many scientific research studies use the placebo effect to test variables among subjects. But adulterated foods don’t taste the same as foods in their natural state, making placebos an ineffective tool.

**Also, food isn’t the only factor that affects health. Nutritional research is further compounded when lifestyle is considered.** Two examples show the importance of lifestyle in health.

First, the Mediterranean diet, considered one of the healthiest in the world, consists of high amounts of olive oil and fish. The diet was observed with several subjects in Crete, Greece in the 1950s. This population undoubtedly lived different lifestyles than Americans.

  * They were more physically active.
  * They fasted frequently for religious purposes.
  * They ate fewer calories in general. 
  * They ate a lot of wild plants.



The Mediterranean diet may, in fact, be sublime. But we don’t know if the benefits are from the types of food eaten, the Greek lifestyle, or a combination of these.

The second example is the role of supplements in healthy peoples’ daily routines. Supplement takers are likely to be healthier, with or without the supplements. They are typically more educated, wealthier, and more interested in their health in general. **If the benefit of supplements is determined by the health of supplement takers, it’s a benefit based on faulty evidence.**

#### Studying Eating Habits

There are three main study mechanisms used in nutrition research—case-control, long-term cohort, and large-scale intervention studies—and all of them contain flaws.

In **case-control studies** , researchers study the eating habits of people with specific illnesses to determine the cause. The problem is that people typically change their diets at the onset of illness. What they currently eat may not be what they were eating when the illness developed. Also, the ubiquitous nature of food marketing and media coverage of FDA guidelines, most people have a general knowledge of what foods are deemed good and bad. This information may cause people to falsely blame foods they know to be bad.

**Long-term cohort studies** track a group of subjects before illness occurs. The most famous one is the Nurses’ Health Study, which studies the effects of nutrition, environment, and lifestyle of thousands of nurses. The study was limited in scope from the beginning. The study sample of nurses were not diverse enough. Many led similar lifestyles, and almost all ate a Western diet. Therefore, dietary changes were marginal, or not radical enough to truly show differentiations.

The second issue with the study was the reliance on a food-frequency questionnaire to gauge eating habits. It should come as no surprise that people lie all the time about their food consumption. In fact, this behavior is so common, validation studies were created to account for it. Those studies showed that people tended to eat between one-fifth and one-third more food than reported.

This questionnaire was also used in the best-known **large-scale intervention study** , the Woman’s Health Initiative. In intervention studies, one group serves as the control group, and another group serves as the experimental group receiving the intervention. In this case, approximately 49,000 women were studied, and 40% were asked to reduce their calories from fat to 20% of their total caloric intake. After eight years, no significant changes to their health were found.

One problem was the focus on dietary fat, not food. There was no distinction made among the different fats. Therefore, fats from olive oil or avocados were counted the same as fats from low-fat foods and animal protein. Also, the women in the control group were part of society, so they likely were aware of nutritional trends toward low-fat foods and ate accordingly. In the end, both groups could have been eating basically the same low-fat diet.

### One Final Consequence of Nutritionism

**More than affecting our bodies, nutritionism has a negative effect on our mental health.** Paul Rozin, a psychologist from the University of Pennsylvania, has conducted numerous studies regarding the thoughts of American eaters surrounding food. His results showed the following:

  * Almost half of Americans believe that eating small amounts of high-calorie foods increases your total calorie intake more than large amounts of low-calorie foods. 
  * A third of Americans believe that a fat-free diet is better than a diet with even the smallest amount of fat included, despite the necessity of fat in the body.
  * When shown a picture of a piece of chocolate cake, the most-given word Americans associated with it was “guilt.” In contrast, the same study was done with the French, and the most popular response was “celebration.”



Some scientists are promoting the addition of orthorexia nervosa to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health as an official eating disorder. Therapists are seeing this unhealthy obsession with healthy eating coming up more and more with their patients.

**Thanks to nutritionism and its supporters, we are fatter, sicker, and more mentally unstable regarding food than ever before.** It’s time for a change that actually leads to better physical and mental health for all.
