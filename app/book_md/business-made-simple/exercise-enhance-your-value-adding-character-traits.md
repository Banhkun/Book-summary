## Exercise: Enhance Your Value-Adding Character Traits

Consider which of Miller’s 10 value-adding character traits you could improve, and determine specific actions you can take to do so.

* * *

Review Miller’s 10 value-adding character traits. List three that you either don’t yet possess or could improve on.

Now, for each trait, list several specific ways in which improving on it would benefit you in the workplace. How would enhancing these traits help you grow? (For instance, if you work on seeing yourself as an active agent in your life, you might be asked to take on more projects and you could ensure your voice is heard more often.)

Finally, write down one or two specific actions you’ll take this week to build on those traits at work. (For instance, to see yourself as a more active agent in life, you might schedule a meeting with your boss to discuss improvements to the team’s workflow you’ve been thinking about.)
