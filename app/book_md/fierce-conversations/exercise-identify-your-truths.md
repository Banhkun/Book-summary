## Exercise: Identify Your Truths

Scott argues that the key to having courageous conversations is uncovering the most important aspects of your life that need to be discussed. In this exercise, you’ll examine your thoughts, feelings, concerns, and desires about your _life path_ so you can determine what you need to talk about, and who you need to talk to.

What about your life at the moment is making you unhappy, and what might you be avoiding thinking or talking about? To answer this question, consider your relationships, goals, circumstances, and so on. For example, maybe your best friend is moving away and you haven’t yet addressed that situation.

Have you gone through any changes lately that need to be addressed? For example, since your friend is moving away, she’s spending more time coordinating her move and less time hanging out with you. This has caused you to spend more time alone and less time being social.

What do you want, why do you want it, and how will you get it? For example, maybe you want to spend more time socializing because it makes you feel happier and more fulfilled. Since your friend is moving away, you’ll need to make a plan with her regarding how you’ll stay in touch, and you’ll probably need to start building relationships with new friends.

Based on the truths you uncovered from this exercise, who do you need to have courageous conversations with? For example, you probably need to have a conversation with your best friend about your loneliness and your desire to make a plan to keep in touch once she leaves. You also probably need to have a conversation with your other close friends to let them know that you’re feeling lonely and to ask for their support.
