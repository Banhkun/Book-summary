## Exercise: Try on the White Hat

Work with the white hat on a problem of your choice.

* * *

Think of a decision you currently face, either at work or elsewhere in your life. What objective information will help you to make an informed choice? (Be as general or as specific as you like, but mark any general information that needs further investigation or confirmation.) Try to prevent any interpretations or emotions from sneaking in.

What important information is missing? What have you noted that seems vague or out of date?

Evaluate the information youâ€™ve noted above. Is it genuinely balanced (might you have unconsciously selected it to favor one side or the other)? How might you go about finding some balancing information?
