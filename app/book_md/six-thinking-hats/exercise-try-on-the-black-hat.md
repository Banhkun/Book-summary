## Exercise: Try on the Black Hat

Work with the black hat on a problem of your choice.

* * *

Consider the project or initiative that youâ€™ve been thinking about in previous exercises. What design flaws can you spot? What are the weaknesses in the current approach as it stands right now?

Think of some similar initiatives that have failed in the past. What went wrong?

What could go wrong for your project? List all of the possibilities you can think of. Be as harsh and critical as you can.
