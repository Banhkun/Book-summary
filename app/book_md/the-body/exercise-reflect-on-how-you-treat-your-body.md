## Exercise: Reflect on How You Treat Your Body

In this exercise, we’ll consider how your own needs and preferences might affect how you apply what you’ve learned about nutrition, hygiene, sleep, and medical overtreatment.

* * *

We discussed how the human body is maladapted to eating processed foods. Bryson believes our bodies are optimized for a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, while others have argued that we’re better adapted for ancient farming. Imagine that modern technology has been suddenly wiped out, and you have the choice of joining either a tribe of hunter-gatherers or a primitive farming community. Which would you choose, and why?

We discussed how shaking hands is, unfortunately, a very effective way of spreading pathogens. If you were tasked with choosing a different social greeting to replace the handshake in Western culture, what would you choose and why?

We discussed the importance of getting enough sleep, seven to nine hours for a typical adult. How much sleep did you get last night? And how do you feel today? Based on how you feel today, how much sleep do you think is optimal for your body, and how would you have to structure your daily schedule to achieve it?

We discussed the problem of medical overtreatment. Think back to the last time you or someone you know received medical treatment. Briefly describe the experience. In hindsight, was everything that the doctor ordered helpful? What parts of the treatment might you have done without?

Based on your answers to the four previous questions, or anything else you learned in this guide, describe at least one thing you could do this week to take better care of your body.
