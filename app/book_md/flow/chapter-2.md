## Chapter 2: How Consciousness Works

At different points in human history, such as Republican Rome, having control over the inner workings of your mind was considered necessary for fitting into and succeeding in society. People preferred thinking things through rather than acting on instinct. Today, it’s more popular to act on instinct, and we consider people who seek control of their emotional states uptight or operating outside of the norm. **Yet evidence shows people who master their inner life are generally happier than those who don’t.**

To control your consciousness, you’ll first learn about what your consciousness is and how it operates. Then, you’ll learn how controlling it facilitates flow experiences.

### What Is Consciousness?

Consciousness is a mental state of awareness in which we perceive, process, and act on information and sensory input. Information includes feelings, ideas, and perceptions. **Because consciousness gives you the ability to process and prioritize information, it can be thought of as “intentionally ordered information.”** Having the ability to act is also key: If you weren’t conscious, you could still process information, but your body would only be able to react in a pre-programmed way rather than by deciding how to act. For example, if you dream that a relative had a car accident, you can’t act on that information, for instance by verifying it, because you’re unconscious.

Having the ability to filter information means you can learn to control your reactions _regardless of whether you’re happy about what’s happening or not_. For example, if you’re not chosen for a promotion at work, you can choose to feel defeated by the experience, or you can view it as an opportunity to learn and further hone your skills until you’re promoted.

#### Consciousness Has Limits

Research can help us estimate how much information the brain is able to process. Here are some figures:

  * **The brain is capable of processing up to 125 bits of information per second.** That means we can process up to 7,560 bits per minute, and half a million in an hour.
  * **In a 70-year lifetime, we can process 185 billion bits of information.** All of our thoughts, feelings, and actions come from this.



Yet it’s unclear whether we regularly reach this capacity. Some experts think we’ve evolved to facilitate information intake so that we focus only on important information and constantly expand our processing capacity.**** For example, when you learn to drive, it takes all of your concentration at first, but eventually becomes easy, freeing your attention for other things. We’re also able to compress information for ease of processing. For example, a story in the Bible might contain a lesson distilled from the experience of many people that we can learn readily with one reading.

But Csikszentmihalyi is skeptical that consciousness can be constantly expanded. First, despite our ability to compress information intake, we still spend 15 percent of our waking hours eating and doing basic bodily maintenance, such as showering. Though these tasks don’t require much concentration, we don’t have the capacity to focus on much more while doing them. **And while we may be able to process a considerable amount of information, we tend to seek leisure experiences that require less information processing.**

For example, in the one-third of our waking hours that aren’t spent working or tending to bodily functions, we tend to seek out activities like watching TV. When watching TV, we take in some visual and auditory stimuli, but taking pleasure in it doesn’t usually require much memory or thinking—you don’t have to concentrate to watch TV like you do for other activities, like learning a language. Other leisure activities, like looking out the window, are similarly undemanding on our consciousness.

So while it’s possible we have the capacity to process 185 billion bits of information in our lifetime, the amount we actually process could be much lower based on the activities we choose to do. Also, because there is so much information to perceive, only a select amount of everything you’ve felt, perceived, suffered, and so on becomes part of your consciousness. When it does, it becomes part of your life—how you reflect on the world and understand it.

### Intention and Attention: Giving Order to Consciousness

Consciousness means having an awareness of many experiences and ordering them. This order can come from intention: what you want.

For example, if you’re hungry, you may feel agitated or your stomach may growl. Thinking about food may start to order your consciousness until you satisfy your hunger. However, someone could perceive their hunger and decide not to act on it. They might be dieting, trying to save money, or participating in a political protest. In this way, our intentions are prioritized and organized as goals. Most people’s intentions are basic, like trying to live a healthy life. **But people whose intentions break from the social norms of their times, such as artists or poets, show it’s possible to have intentions that differ from those we’re conditioned to seek.**

Achieving your goals requires directing your attention. Your attention is the process your consciousness uses to take in and evaluate information. Here’s how it works:

  1. **Something comes to your attention.** For example, if you’re driving, you don’t need to think about the movements of each car around you, as long as they behave the way you’d expect. But if a car in front of you is swerving slightly out of its lane, it comes to your attention.
  2. **You identify what’s happening.** You compare what’s happening against your other memories of similar events. In the car example, your consciousness is trying to determine if you’re seeing a distracted driver, a drunk driver, an inexperienced driver, or something else based on previous experience.
  3. **You decide what to do.** Once you’ve identified what’s happening, you decide how to act. For example, if you think the driver may be drunk, you may pull over and call 911. 



This complex sequence of events happens in seconds or less, repeatedly, every day. You can also think of attention as an investment of energy, or psychic energy. Doing work requires energy, and you need to replenish it regularly to do work consistently.

**Because our thoughts, feelings, and memories are shaped by how we direct our attention, it’s the most important tool we have to order our consciousness and improve our quality of life.** Successful people cultivate the ability to focus their attention on exactly what they want to focus on so they can achieve their goals. This means not getting distracted and focusing on the goal for as long as it takes to achieve it.

#### Factors That Shape Attention

A variety of factors affect how people choose to focus their attention:

  * **Personality traits.** Labels such as “high-achiever” or “introvert” refer to how people direct their attention. For example, if a high-achiever and an introvert go to a party, the high-achiever might spend the evening networking with potential business partners while the introvert might chat with just one party-goer they connect well with. 
  * **Culture and occupation**. For example, Eskimos can differentiate between different types of snow and a clinical diagnostician can spot symptoms that the average person wouldn’t recognize. 
  * **Sense of self.** Your self both directs your attention and is shaped by your attention. The self is composed of your consciousness—the experiences, thoughts, feelings, actions, and goals you’ve developed for yourself over your lifetime. Many people focus their attention based on accidental experiences. For example, Sam Browning was an average 15-year-old who had vague ideas about going to college, living in the suburbs and getting married. Then, his father took him on a trip to Bermuda and he swam on a coral reef. Browning was fascinated by what he saw and decided to focus his attention on becoming a marine biologist. This unexpected event imposed itself on Sam’s consciousness: **Prior to the experience, he wasn’t focusing his attention toward marine biology, but the experience persuaded him to reorder his attention and create new goals to bring himself similar experiences in the future.** Why? He liked the experience, perhaps because it resonated with his previous experiences with beauty or nature. 



### Psychic Entropy: A Threat to Ordered Consciousness

You evaluate every piece of information you encounter to determine whether it supports or threatens your goals. When you encounter information that doesn’t fit with your goals, it can cause psychic entropy, or disorder—when your consciousness is diverted from your goals. You may experience emotions like fear, worry, or jealousy, that make it difficult to work on your goals. You have to divert part of your attention to dealing with the information so that it no longer poses a threat. Long-term disruptions to consciousness may cause you to abandon a goal entirely.

Note: The information that you receive may not be inherently positive or negative, but you may evaluate it through the lens of your goals, attach a negative meaning to it, and decide you’re under threat.

**Example 1** : Julio Martinez, a factory worker, discovered that his vehicle had a flat tire. He needed to get it repaired, or get a new tire. Either way, he wouldn’t have enough money to pay for the repair until his paycheck came through the next week. He depended on the car to get to work, and maintaining his job was of utmost importance to him because all of his goals depended on earning money. On the factory floor, he could usually do his part and have time to talk with his coworkers on the assembly line before the next item came down the belt. **But during the time he had the car trouble, he felt distracted, could barely finish the work on each item before the next one came along, and he snapped at a coworker who commented on his slowness that day.** If Julio had had more self-confidence and trusted himself to overcome the issue, he might not have considered the situation as threatening and wouldn’t have been so distracted and irritable.

**Example 2** : Jim Harris was a high school sophomore whose parents had divorced a year before. Jim lived with his mother during the week and spent the weekend with his dad. There were two problems with this arrangement. First, Jim’s friends were too busy to spend time with him during the week, but his dad lived too far away for Jim to spend time with his friends on the weekends. Second, Jim’s parents got angry at him whenever he expressed a positive sentiment about one parent in front of the other. One day, Jim’s sister found him lying in bed with an empty bottle of aspirin nearby. They were able to get Jim to the hospital in time to save him. From then on, his parents were more careful about how they treated Jim and how they talked about each other. If Jim’s identity hadn’t been so tied up with his relationship with his parents, he might not have felt so threatened by the split.

### Flow: Optimally Ordered Consciousness

When you get feedback—information—that affirms your goals, working on them is easier: You feel you’re doing well and making progress, which dissipates your worries. This is the opposite of psychic entropy, or disordered consciousness. Your experience is in line with your self and its goals, and you can devote attention where needed.

**Csikszentmihalyi calls these kinds of experiences flow experiences because people describe feeling like they’re floating and their energy is flowing in the direction they choose.** It still requires concentrating on directing your attention where you want it to go, but it feels right and takes less effort because it’s in line with your goals. Doing activities that produce flow experiences as frequently as possible has three benefits:

  1. **You become more self-confident because you feel skilled and capable, and you’re investing energy toward goals you’ve deemed worthwhile.** As you build self-confidence, you’re able to accomplish more for yourself and society.
  2. **You improve your experience of life.** Even boring tasks are rewarding when made to align with your goals.
  3. **You become a more complex individual.** Complexity has two parts. First, you feel a sense of _differentiation_ because you’ve done something that makes you feel capable and unique. Second, you feel a sense of _integration_ : Your consciousness is well-ordered, and you feel in balance with the different parts of who you are. Note: Differentiation and integration need to be balanced. If you were only differentiated, you’d achieve great things but might be a self-centered person; if you were only focused on integration, you would value being connected with others but wouldn’t act independently. 



**Example 1** : Rico Medellin is a factory worker who enjoys optimizing how quickly he can do his task, which should take 43 seconds. By refining how he moves and uses tools, he has improved his time to an average of 28 seconds per unit. He does it partly so he can receive a bonus, but mostly to prove to himself that he can. Knowing that he’ll eventually reach the lower limit on how quickly he can do the work, he’s taking courses on electronics to find other work where he can enthusiastically apply himself.

**Example 2** : Pam is a young lawyer at a law firm. She spends most of her days doing research or making action plans for more senior partners. She is so immersed in the work that she loses track of time and forgets to eat. Though she frequently encounters obstacles, she views them as challenges she can overcome.

#### Uses of Consciousness: An Important Caveat

Some people think of consciousness as an entity with mystical powers waiting to be unlocked. For example, they believe that with the right training, they can use consciousness to work miracles or look into the past or the future. People who claim to have such powers aren’t necessarily liars; they’re often self-delusional—their mind is overly receptive and tells them they have special powers. Some people—for example, professional musicians—may appear to have special powers, but their ability stems from advanced training and practice. Though it may be possible to accomplish additional feats of consciousness in the future, like bending spoons with brainwaves, we should focus our energy on learning to order our consciousness—a useful but underutilized skill.

> **Using Consciousness to Its Fullest: “E” and “R’s” Story**
> 
> Csikszentmihalyi offers two peoples’ stories to illustrate the power of using consciousness to achieve your goals.
> 
> A European scholar and businesswoman, “E” is an accomplished professional who fills her days with business meetings as well as active leisure tasks, such as reading, writing, and being curious about the world around her. For example, she enjoys going to art galleries and talking with her chauffeur about their impressions. She takes time to recharge using simple means, such as standing in the sunshine on the lakeshore with her eyes closed, or taking a nap when she has a gap in her schedule. She manages to live life to the fullest despite facing extreme hardship growing up: Her family became impoverished during World War I and in World War II, “she lost everything, including her freedom.” Her trick is refusing to give her attention to unproductive thoughts and activities.
> 
> “R” is a scholar and author, but is E’s opposite in terms of personality. He’s not a memorable person, but is intensely curious about the world and strives to learn what he can about the way the world works, exploring things that others take for granted. He likes understanding the world and perhaps expressing what he has learned, but he isn’t looking to make judgments. He is well-regarded by the select people he is close to and has a calmness with which he approaches the world.
> 
> Both E and R are just two examples of how people can efficiently direct their limited attention. Whether your life is enriching and rewarding or poor and unhappy depends on how you focus your attention.
