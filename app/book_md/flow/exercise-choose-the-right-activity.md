## Exercise: Choose the Right Activity

Reflect on enjoyable, flow-producing activities mentioned in this chapter.

* * *

Consider flow-producing physical activities and activities that engage the senses. Which of these activities have you done and enjoyed?

Choose one activity from the previous question to think about in more detail. Which characteristics of that activity made it enjoyable?

Think of a physical activity or activity that engages the senses that you didn’t enjoy. Based on the list of how to order a flow activity—setting a goal, measuring your progress, concentrating on the activity, understanding the challenges involved, developing the skills needed to act on new opportunities, and not getting bored—identify one or two ways that the activity fell short for you.

Which flow-inducing activities would you like to do more often? What pleasurable activities can you modify to be more enjoyable or flow-inducing?
