## Chapter 5: Find Flow Through Movement and the Senses

Everyone experiences highs and lows, but many people haven’t learned techniques to escape the lows. This chapter discusses how to reorder your consciousness using physical activity and the senses to find flow and improve your experience of everyday life.

### Mining an Untapped Resource: Physical Activity and Senses

There are a variety of enjoyable ways to use your body. Every sense we perceive—such as tasting and hearing—and movement we’re capable of making corresponds to one or more flow experiences. **The ability to run, throw, swim, or sing could all yield flow experiences if you work on them in the context of a goal or social setting that offers structure and challenge.** Yet many of us don’t use goal setting to actively cultivate our senses or physical ability to maximize our enjoyment of life, leaving the senses, to provide us with chaotic, disordered information.

For example, if you don’t train yourself to run efficiently, you might feel clumsy or move in inefficient ways that make it less enjoyable. Training gives order to your consciousness and helps you feel more in harmony with the world around you. To achieve this, find the motivation and discipline to set goals and develop the skills to achieve them.

### Choosing the Right Activity for You

To find the right physical or sense-related activity for yourself, such as running or listening to music, pick something you have a genuine interest in. Otherwise, you may do something because you think you “should.” Though you may successfully stick with the activity, you won’t enjoy yourself. For example, don’t do pilates just because you think it’ll make you healthier; do it because you want to be healthier and you think it’ll help you be healthier and overcome a challenge.

#### Ordering an Activity: The Key to Finding Flow

To transform an activity into a flow activity, create a framework for what you want to do and how you’ll measure progress. Here’s how:

  1. **Set a goal.** Write your main goal and any related, smaller goals you need to achieve first. 
  2. **Decide how you’ll measure your progress.** This could be any unit of measure. For example, if your goal is to decrease the time it takes you to run a mile, you’d measure progress in time.
  3. **Concentrate on the activity.** Flow comes with focus. Choosing an activity that is challenging enough will help you concentrate on it. 
  4. **Study all aspects of the activity to understand its nuances.** For example, if your goal is to improve your golf game, you might study different putting techniques.
  5. **Develop the skills needed to take advantage of any new opportunities.** When you first set a goal, you may not be aware of all the opportunities available to you. As you learn of them, develop the skills you need to take advantage of them.
  6. **Don’t get bored.** Once you’ve mastered your goal, your activity won’t feel challenging and may become boring. Recognize when you’re starting to get bored and create a new goal to challenge yourself.



**Example:** An activity as simple as walking can be made into a flow experience using the previous principles. For instance, your walking goal could be following a specific route, seeing a new sight, or finding the most efficient way to move your body. You might create challenges for yourself such as interpreting the activities of people you see, getting from one point to another using the shortest route possible, or observing the architecture of buildings you pass. Walking is a simple activity, yet there are many ways to make it more enriching for yourself following these principles.

We’ll now discuss some of the most tried-and-true physical and sensory activities that produce flow.

### Yoga and Martial Arts

Yoga and the martial arts are examples of physical activities developed in the East that encourage mastering your consciousness.

#### Yoga

Hatha Yoga was developed 1,500 years ago by Patanjali. “Yoga” is the Sanskrit word for “yoking,” or the practice of becoming one with God. This occurs over eight stages, each building on new skills. Note: Stages three and four correspond to physical activities, while stages one, two, and five through eight correspond to mental activities.

**Stages 1 and 2: Change your attitude.** These stages focus on reducing your mental chaos before you attempt to control your consciousness. In the first stage, called yama, or “restraint,” you reduce thoughts and actions that could harm others, such as lying and stealing. In the second stage, called niyama, or “obedience,” you build discipline through doing routines, such as studying, worshipping God, or cleaning. Organizing activities into patterns makes it easier to control your attention.

**Stages 3 and 4:** **Develop physical habits to overcome your senses.** Developing physical techniques to work through the demands of your senses helps you focus your attention and find flow. These are the stages westerners know best. Stage three, called Asana, or “sitting,” consists of holding postures or positions without getting tired. Stage four, called pranayama, consists of controlling your breathing in order to relax the body.

**Stage 5:** **Redirect the senses.** In this stage, called pratyahara, or “withdrawal,” you learn to withdraw your attention from senses so that you’re only aware of the sensory input you choose. This mirrors flow because it’s a form of controlling your consciousness.

**Stage 6:** **Concentrate on one thing.** This stage, called dharana, or “holding on,” is the opposite of pratyahara: You learn to concentrate your attention on one stimulus for a sustained period of time.

**Stage 7:** **Forget yourself.** In Dhyana, or intense meditation, you learn to focus on one thing without needing an external stimulus. In the process, you don’t focus attention on yourself.

**Stage 8:** **Become** **self-collected**. In this stage, known as samadhi, you become one with a universal power. People who achieve this stage describe it as one of the most joyful experiences of their lives.

People disagree on whether Yoga is a true flow experience. Though it contains many elements required for flow, such as concentration and self-forgetfulness, some argue that whereas flow is focused on strengthening your sense of self, yoga is about getting rid of the self. **But Csikszentmihalyi argues that yoga is a well-structured flow experience because you have to control your consciousness up to the final stage, and you have to be in control of and aware of your self in order to break from it.** Only people who have reached a certain level of control over their instincts, desires, and actions achieve this.

Like other practices, yoga is a product of the time and place it was developed in. Though it may produce flow, consider whether the investment of time and energy required to achieve it through this method is worth it to you.

#### Martial Arts

Martial arts are an assortment of sports that were developed for controlling consciousness in Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Examples include karate, jujitsu, and kung fu, which don’t require a weapon and originated in China; and kendo, or fencing, which originated in Japan. These sports are designed to improve the spiritual and mental health of the person doing them. Over time, practitioners are able to do them without having to think about each individual move: Mind and body act together in a harmonious way.

### Dancing and Acting

Dance is one of the oldest flow activities. It’s complex and appeals to people of all ages. Both informal dancing, such as dancing in a club, and specific genres of dance, such as ballet, can create flow experiences. Teenagers who went clubbing reported a sense of connection with the people around them, and they enjoyed the challenge of producing movements that matched the music and the movements of other dancers. Professional dance requires dedicating yourself to grueling training. Many professional dancers forgo marriage and having children, yet they feel dance is something they can’t live without.

Acting is another example of a flow-producing activity that doesn’t necessarily require professional dedication. Just playing charades allows you to break from your normal behavior for a short time, adding variety to your life that can produce flow.

### Sex, Sexuality, and Romance

Having sex, discovering your sexuality, or who you are as a sexual being, and developing romantic relationships are some of the most universally rewarding activities. Sex in particular guides a lot of our behavior: You may dress and groom yourself to find a partner or keep an existing one, and you may work to earn money to support a relationship. **The urge to have sex is rooted in human evolution, and it can be so powerful that it redirects attention from other activities**. As a result, cultures have devised a variety of methods and institutions to keep this urge in check.

Generally, sexual stimulation is pleasurable. However, the same sexual act in different contexts can bring any emotion, from pleasure to disgust, or even terror. Overall, sex is like any other activity: If you don’t make it enjoyable, as opposed to just pleasurable, it can become boring. For instance, people in long-term relationships may get bored having sex with the same person. Many people find their first love the most enjoyable, and don’t feel as fulfilled in later relationships.

How have different cultures made sex enjoyable? Here are two ways:

  1. **Sex professionals.** Cultures sometimes create a class of sex professionals that are skilled in entertainment such as music, dance, and acting. The Geishas in Japan are one example. 
  2. **Eroticism.** Eroticism generally means developing skills to make sex more varied and enjoyable. Examples include publications such as _The_ _Joy of Sex_ and the _Kama Sutra_ which were created to add challenge and variety to sex. Rituals and celebrations are another example of how societies have combined sex with religion and other culturally sanctioned practices. Examples include fertility rights and the Greeks’ Dionysian festivals.



Note: Both of the above techniques were typically limited to people who had the time and resources to enjoy them. And, improving sex alone won’t make a relationship last. To do so, include the following two elements:

  1. **Romance or making the relationship more enjoyable.** Acts of romance, such as sharing your feelings with a lover, add complexity and challenge to romantic relationships that make them more enjoyable. However, romance techniques weren’t developed in Europe until the late Middle Ages. Troubadours, or French minstrel singers, traveled to different castles in the Romance region of France, singing songs about romantic practices. Soon after, the practices spread through the upper classes throughout Europe. This approach can be applied by all today.
  2. **Genuine care.** It sounds simple, but one way people make relationships more interesting is by learning to express genuine care for a partner beyond sex. **Taking an interest in understanding the person’s goals and dreams and supporting them can provide a lifetime’s worth of enjoyable challenges.** For example, once you and your partner have a decent understanding of each other’s dreams, you may decide to raise children together or plan adventures like traveling or building a home.



### Engaging the Senses

Like physical activity, different senses have corresponding flow experiences. This section offers an overview of the flow experiences associated with tasting, hearing, and seeing.

Note: Enjoyment comes from the process of engaging or disengaging the senses at will, and activities associated with either course of action can be enjoyable. For example, you could meditate in the afternoon, then go to an art gallery in the evening and both could provide enjoyment.

#### Taste: Eating and Cooking

Like sex, eating tends to be naturally pleasurable because we’ve evolved to do it for survival. In Csikszentmihalyi’s studies, people tend to feel most relaxed at mealtimes, and every culture has developed ways to make eating enjoyable. Until recently, U.S. food culture consisted of preparing food without delighting in the sensory experience it can provide. Now, “foodies” and others are making enjoyable eating more commonplace.

The world’s cuisines developed as a flow activity. People looked at the ingredients available and learned how to cook using the best techniques and combinations of ingredients. This kind of experimentation with food happened in all classes. Here are some examples:

  * People learned that eggs help hold foods together and salt acts as a preservative. 
  * Those who worked for royalty searched for ingredients and cooking techniques to add variety to the royals’ diet.
  * Some peasant women in Eastern Europe were expected to know how to cook a different kind of soup for every day of the year in order to be eligible for marriage.



But there are plenty of ways to not enjoy food. If you eat just to get the calories to live, you may find food pleasurable, but you won’t enjoy it. To find flow in eating and cooking:

  1. **Focus attention on what you eat.** Over time, you may develop a more discerning palate, take an interest in a certain kind of cuisine, and learn to produce a complete meal composed of various dishes. For example, someone who takes an interest in Middle Eastern cuisine may know where to get the best spices for a certain dish. 
  2. **Approach them with curiosity.** This may help you cook and taste your food with more intention, learning to appreciate it. Enjoyment comes from feeling a sense of control over the experience.
  3. **Be disciplined about your desires.** As with other flow experiences, it’s possible to overdo it on food. This is one reason gluttony is a deadly sin in the Bible and Puritans eschewed enjoyment: If you take too much pleasure in sensory experiences, you’ll divert energy away from other pursuits and may develop an addiction. But avoiding something because you think you have to or you’re afraid of what it’ll do to you can make you defensive or closed-off. At that point, the self can’t grow and develop. Instead, enjoyment happens when you _choose_ to be disciplined about your desires.



#### Hear: Hearing and Playing Music

Most cultures use music as a way of ordering consciousness. For example, hearing music can direct people to feel a certain way—solemn at funerals or energized at political rallies. It also helps restore order to our consciousness when a piece of information isn’t compatible with our goals. For example, one police officer reported listening to the radio to soothe himself after stressful workdays filled with making arrests.

These days, music is widely available on our smart devices and some argue that this wide availability improves our quality of life. **But like other flow activities, it’s about paying attention to the activity, not your access to it—just because you can play music 24/7 doesn’t mean it’ll be a flow experience.** If you take your access to it for granted, you might not enjoy it as much.

On the other hand, anticipating a concert for weeks and engaging with it deeply for the few hours it happens could be a flow experience. You might have a sense that the performance is special and won’t ever be repeated in exactly the same way, or you may feel a sense of belonging with a large group of people. Emile Durkheim refers to this as “collective effervescence”; concerts and religious events are two examples. **Witnessing the same event, processing the same information as the group, and potentially feeling the same feelings are all ingredients for producing a flow experience.**

Though listening to live music has the ability to focus your attention, it’s possible to find flow by listening to recorded sound, too. To do so, people tend to:

  * Set aside time for listening.
  * **Create an appropriate listening atmosphere.** This might include adjusting the lighting or sitting in a comfortable seat.
  * Decide what they’ll listen to and what their goals are ahead of time.



There are three different levels of engagement with listening to music:

  1. **Sensory.** In this stage, you feel pleasure from hearing elements of sound that are naturally pleasing, such as the sound of chords, or the rhythm of the bass. 
  2. **Analogic.** In this stage, you go beyond the sensory pleasures of music to think about the music, including the emotions or images it evokes in you. For example, one of Tchaikovsky’s pieces uses bells to conjure images of a horse-drawn sleigh moving through the forest. Certain songs help people reach this stage by providing lyrics that illustrate the emotion or story the song is conveying. 
  3. **Analytic.** This stage is the most complex because it involves moving beyond the first two stages into processing the structure of the piece—how it creates harmonies, patterns, and more. For example, someone capable of accessing this stage may ask how two recordings of the same song by the same piano player differ and discover that in the later performance, they don’t play the piece as quickly. 



##### Playing Music

Learning to make music can also provide enjoyment. You improve your sense of self through ordering sound with pleasing orders of notes, harmonies, and rhythms. For example, playing a symphonic instrument or singing in a choir are two easy ways to produce something orderly and pleasing while relating to your fellow musicians and an audience. You can also create music through software in real time. It’s best to learn to make music when you’re young, but it’s never too late to begin.

There are two main barriers children face to playing music:

  1. **Lack of funding for music education.** Many children learn to appreciate music and play instruments at their schools, but when funding for schools is tight, music education is often cut.
  2. **Pressure to perform well.** It’s common for parents to pressure their children to perform well rather than enjoying the _experience_ of playing. Pressure can make music into a dreaded experience rather than an enjoyable one. In one extreme case, Lorin Hollander, a child piano prodigy, experienced so much pressure to perform well from his father, a professional violinist, that his hands became clawed and paralyzed during a recital. Hollander was so worried about criticism that his subconsciousness took over and prevented him from playing and having to face it. Eventually, he was able to play again and now helps young, gifted musicians find enjoyment in their musical practice.



#### See: Looking at Cities, Nature, and Art

Seeing is one of the most overlooked ways to cultivate enjoyment. We typically use this sense for basic tasks, like finding our sunglasses or staying on a paved path. Sometimes, we’ll pause to admire an especially beautiful sight, but most people don’t train themselves to use their vision in more enjoyable ways.

Some seeing activities that produce flow include:

  * **Interpreting a cityscape.** Though a fairly commonplace experience, the extra attention it takes to look closely at a city and note its architectural features can provide an enjoyable experience. One study participant reported doing this activity each workday during his commute on the elevated train, noting that it makes him feel part of the city while also being removed from it.
  * **Staring at nature.** You can derive enjoyment just by looking at a nature scene because it offers many different visual stimuli—stars, waves, leaves—and may change day-to-day. 
  * **Looking at a work of art.** Seeing a good piece of art can be pleasing to the eye, and it’s enjoyable when you gain a better sense of the world or your place in it. It may provide an opportunity to abandon your own self and feel a connection with others. For example, looking at a painting of bathers in the river on a summer day may help you understand that experience even if you’ve never done that activity.
