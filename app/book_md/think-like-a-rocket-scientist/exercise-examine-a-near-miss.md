## Exercise: Examine a Near Miss

Varol believes the best way to learn from success is to examine your “near misses.” Let’s try that now.

* * *

Describe your most recent “near miss”—a time when you got lucky, or an experience that went well but could easily have gone very poorly.

Think of the steps leading up to the near miss. What did you or your team do well?

In the steps leading up to the near miss, what could you or your team have done better?

If you undertake a similar project in the future, what changes will you make to the process based on this analysis?
