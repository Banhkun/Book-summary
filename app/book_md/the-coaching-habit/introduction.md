## Introduction: Why You Need a Coaching Habit

Most companies recognize that yesterday’s leadership tactics are becoming less and less applicable in today’s increasingly fast-paced business environment. They’re thus shifting towards a coaching model, where managers empower their employees to find solutions and take action, instead of dictating what their employees should do. This landscape has led to the birth of a multitude of coaching seminars and programs, where managers spend the day trying to learn to be more effective coaches. But few go back to their workplace and apply what they’ve learned. In fact, out of the 73 percent of managers who’ve received coaching training, only 23 percent say that the training has been helpful.

We’ve seen what good coaches can do in sports—they inspire and motivate their players and lead a team to victory. In much the same way, coaches in the workplace can bring out the best in their employees and increase productivity. However, many managers and leaders avoid coaching, thinking that it’s too complicated, too awkward, or too impractical. Others believe they’re _already_ coaching, when all they’re really doing is giving advice.

As we’ll see, true coaching is imperative to being a good manager. In _The Coaching Habit_ ,**** you’ll learn how to turn coaching into an informal, effective daily habit.

### The Benefits of Coaching

Whatever it is that’s keeping you from coaching, there are three reasons why you should put in the time and effort to make it a daily habit:

  * **It empowers your team members.** If most of your team’s responsibilities need your input and approval, then that means you’ve trained your team, perhaps inadvertently, to become overly reliant on you. This not only increases your workload but also makes you a potential bottleneck. By coaching your team, you train them to become more self-sufficient, effective, and efficient, all while lightening your load.
  * **It allows you to refocus.** You can lose sight of your goals when you keep getting pulled in several directions at once. Coaching can help you and your team remember what’s important.
  * **It clarifies your purpose.** Having coaching sessions can help both you and your direct reports see the meaning behind the work you’re doing, motivating you to perform at your best.



In short, coaching helps your team members grow and develop while making your work easier, more focused, more meaningful, and more enjoyable.

In order to be effective and sustainable, your coaching should cover seven essential questions:

  * The Conversation Starter Question: What’s on your mind?
  * The Follow-Through Question: Anything else?
  * The Laser Beam Question: What’s the central challenge for you?
  * The Empowerment Question: What do you _want_?
  * The Heavy Lifter Question: How can I support you?
  * The Commitment Question: What’s the cost of saying ‘yes’?
  * The Insight Question: What insights did you gain?



In the following chapters, we’ll discuss each of these questions and why they’re important to effective coaching, and explore ways to make them habitual. Asking these questions is a habit that will help you get over a big hurdle of effective coaching: talking too much and not listening enough. It’s a habit that can refresh and revamp your daily interactions with your team members and other people at work (like your customers and your boss) and ultimately transform the way you and your team work. But learning new habits means unlearning old ones that you might have, like automatically offering solutions or not coaching at all.

(Shortform note: You should view these seven questions as individual tools rather than as a system—you don’t need to use _all_ the questions one after the other. In any coaching situation, choose whichever questions feel most natural, applicable, and useful.)

### How to Form a New Habit

For coaching to be truly effective, you need to turn it into something that you routinely do—a habit. It sounds simple, but building a habit can be a challenge. You only need to recall all your failed New Year’s resolutions to see how difficult it can be. Simply declaring that you’ll exercise more, that you’ll stop spending and start investing, or that you’ll start coaching isn’t enough to form a habit. You need to approach it systematically in three steps:

#### 1) Pinpoint Your Old Habit

You can’t get rid of an old habit if you don’t know what it is in the first place, so be clear and specific about the habit you’re trying to change.

  * For example, you may have the bad habit of frequently stepping in and making decisions for your team members without letting them work through problems themselves.



#### 2) Determine Your Triggers

Once you have your old habit in mind, figure out what _triggers_ it. **There are five common types of triggers: location, time, emotional state, other people, and the immediately preceding action.** Thinking in terms of these five categories may help you determine your triggers—once you realize what they are, you can more consciously stop yourself from engaging with them and performing your bad habits.

  * For example, you may be triggered to make decisions when you feel impatient (emotional state), when you’re trying to get out of the office at the end of the day (time), or whenever you deal with a team member who has a reputation for being indecisive (other people).



#### 3) Specify Your New Habit

Just as you’re clear and specific about the old habit you want to change, you need to identify the new habit that you want to form. In this case, you want to form the new habit of asking your team members one of the seven essential questions.

  * For example, instead of stepping in to rescue an indecisive team member, your new habit might be to step back and ask her what’s on her mind or why making a decision is a challenge for her. 



(Shortform note: Read our guide to Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit to learn more about identifying your triggers, breaking bad habits, and forming good habits.)

#### Build Up Good Coaching Habits With Practice

When starting your new coaching habit, or any habit for that matter, you’ll encounter a lot of challenges, so make it as easy as possible by practicing and mastering _one_ part of the new habit at a time.

The best way to build up your confidence and consistency with your new coaching habits is to try them out on receptive team members, rather than those who may have been resistant to coaching in the past. Additionally, you can inform friends and colleagues of the new habits you’re trying to put in place and ask them to support you and help keep you accountable.

**Most importantly, remember that failure is inevitable and _normal_ —nobody perfects a habit on their first attempt.** Keep trying, even if it takes a few tries.****
