## Exercise: Identify a Bad Coaching Habit

One of the keys to becoming a better coach to your team members is to recognize when you’re prone to a bad habit and visualize a good coaching habit to take its place.

* * *

Describe your bad habit. Remember that it’s key to be _specific_ about what your habit is, so use the clearest terms possible.

What is the trigger that usually sets this habit off? Recall the five common triggers: location, time, emotional state, other people, immediately preceding action.

What is the _good_ habit you’d like to start performing?
