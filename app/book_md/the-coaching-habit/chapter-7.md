## Chapter 7: The Insight Question: “What Insights Did You Gain?”

As a manager, it’s part of your job to help your direct reports learn new skills and become better, more successful workers. Projects and problems present many teaching moments, but the lessons from those experiences may not always stick. **The best way to help your team members absorb new information is by asking the last essential question, “What insights did you gain?”**

### Why This Question Is a Good Coaching Habit

“What insights did you gain?” not only encourages your team members to identify and retain a concrete lesson they learned, but also makes them feel like you care about them. As a bonus, their answers can clue you in on how to better coach them in the future.

There are three science-backed reasons why asking, “What insights did you gain?” leads to increased learning:

#### 1) Double-Loop Learning

Single-loop learning is solving a problem outright. Double-loop learning, according to business theorist Chris Argyris, is where we learn best—this involves questioning the procedure and goals underlying issues you’re trying to solve.

  * For example, single-loop learning might look like stopping a marketing campaign that doesn’t seem to be working. Double-loop learning might look like _why_ the campaign isn’t working—is it targeting the wrong demographic? Is it succeeding in unexpected areas and failing in expected areas?—and adjusting accordingly. 



Asking your team members, “What insights did you gain?” prompts double-loop learning as they reflect on the issue and question their approach to it.

#### 2) Memory Retention

Psychologists have found that when we learn something, we immediately start to forget it. Asking, “What insights did you gain?” stops the process of forgetting.

(Shortform note: Read our guide to Make It Stick to learn more about this psychological phenomenon and get more memory-retention strategies.)

#### 3) The Peak-End Rule

The peak-end rule states that when people recall an event, they tend to remember the emotional _peaks_ and the _end_. Therefore, if an experience ends on a high note, people will recall it more positively.

  * For example, you organize a meeting that’s overall very dull. However, during the last five minutes, you do a fun, informal “awards ceremony.” The attendees recall the meeting as an overall fun experience.



Asking, “What was most useful for you?” at the end of a conversation means that the experience will end with the team member thinking about the most useful parts of the conversation. According to the peak-end rule, this will cause him to recall the entire conversation as a useful and positive experience.

### How to Make It a Habit

Instead of rushing your team member off at the end of a coaching session, finish strong by asking, “What insights did you gain?”**** This gives your team members the chance to reflect on the important information they picked up and is an elegant way to signal the end of the conversation.

**Additionally, share what insights _you_ gained. **Being a manager doesn’t mean your learning has stopped. Sharing your perspective and insights reinforces the idea that your coaching conversations aren’t one-sided.
