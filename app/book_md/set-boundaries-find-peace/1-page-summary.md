## 1-Page Summary

_Set Boundaries, Find Peace_ aims to empower you to improve your relationships by learning to set **boundaries, which are standards for how you’d like to be treated**. The author, Nedra Glover Tawwab, is a practicing clinical therapist and social worker who is well known for using her Instagram page to bring awareness to mental health topics.

In _Set Boundaries, Find Peace_ , published in 2021, Tawwab argues that**in order to maintain healthy relationships, you need to understand, set, and reinforce healthy boundaries in your relationships**. Tawwab provides examples of both healthy and unhealthy boundaries and offers insight into common problems her clients experience while learning to set boundaries.

In our guide, we’ll first explain what healthy boundaries look like, as compared to boundaries that are too weak or too strict. Then, we’ll show you how to identify, set, and reinforce healthy boundaries in your relationships. Next, we’ll look at different types of relationships that can make boundary-setting difficult and offer strategies for these situations. Finally, we’ll discuss major and minor boundary violations and provide recommendations for how to respond when your boundaries are violated. We’ll also provide insight into the psychological research that shapes Tawwab’s work, while offering contrasting opinions from other mental health professionals and researchers.

### Healthy Boundaries and Unhealthy Boundaries

According to Tawwab, your**boundaries are your standards for how you’d like to be treated in your relationships**. They can be explicit or implicit. For example, you might explicitly set a boundary with your roommate that you expect them to stay out of your room while you’re on work calls. By contrast, you might implicitly expect your roommate to not take money from your wallet without asking. As Tawwab notes, our tendency to be either explicit or implicit about our boundaries is shaped by our childhood relationships with our parents. If your parents had many unspoken rules and expectations, then you’ll tend to have implicit boundaries, whereas if your parents clearly expressed their rules, you’ll be more likely to have explicit boundaries.

(Shortform note: It’s especially important to understand your own explicit and implicit boundaries when it comes to sexual relationships. As experts note, when a sexual partner makes you feel uncomfortable, but hasn’t violated any of your explicit boundaries, it may be because they have violated an implicit boundary. When something like this happens, it’s important that you speak up to stop what’s happening and communicate your discomfort. If you’re feeling especially uncomfortable or unsafe, you may want to leave the situation entirely.)

Tawwab believes that setting healthy boundaries allows you to feel safe and comfortable in your relationships. When you set boundaries, you make sure that the people in your life know how you’d like to be treated, which can make things more comfortable both for them and for you. On the other hand, if you don’t set boundaries, you’ll likely experience resentment, anxiety, and exhaustion in your relationships. Without boundaries, your friends, coworkers, and loved ones will fail to live up to your standards, as they won’t know what those standards are in the first place. Inevitably, you’ll be frustrated and disappointed when these failures happen.

(Shortform note: In addition to helping improve your relationships, setting boundaries can also have a positive impact on your health. According to mental health experts, setting boundaries is part of the process of self-care, which is an approach to wellness that stresses the ability of individuals to take charge of their own health and health care. Within the framework of self-care, learning how to set boundaries is a key strategy you can use to protect your mental and physical health.)

Your boundaries are informed by your personal history. Depending on your past relationships, you might develop boundaries differently. Tawwab specifies two types of unhealthy boundaries that people often develop: **weak boundaries and strict boundaries** (or as Tawwab refers to them, porous boundaries and rigid boundaries).

> **Your Cultural Background Informs Your Boundaries**
> 
> One aspect of your personal history that shapes your boundaries is the culture you grow up in. For example, US culture emphasizes individual autonomy and success, which leads people to develop boundaries that protect their own individual needs and interests. By contrast, in cultures where the family is the fundamental unit of society, people tend to form boundaries that prioritize the needs of the family over the needs of the individual.
> 
> While it isn’t inherently unhealthy to prioritize either yourself or your family, when taken to extremes either one of these paradigms can become unhealthy. For example, if you prioritize your own needs to such a degree that you shut others out, your boundaries may prevent you from forming close relationships. On the other hand, if you’re always putting others before yourself, your boundaries may stop you from pursuing your own goals and tending to your own needs.

Tawwab’s first type of unhealthy boundary, **weak boundaries, are boundaries that are too flexible to protect your needs**. Weak boundaries make it hard to say no to people, even when you’re already feeling overwhelmed. Other signs you may have weak boundaries include a desire to make everyone happy, fear of rejection, and needing approval from others.

(Shortform note: In addition to failing to protect your needs, weak boundaries may also lead you to over-prioritize others’ needs. Experts note that people with weak boundaries choose to tend to others before dealing with their own problems. This can lead you to become increasingly withdrawn in your relationships, as other people’s needs continually boot yours offstage.)

For example, suppose you’d like one of your coworkers to contribute equally on shared projects, but you always end up covering for them as deadlines approach. While you’d rather not take on the extra work, you always agree to do it, out of a desire to help your coworker. In this scenario, you have a weak boundary with your coworker—because you’re unable to say no, you end up stretching yourself thin. As a result of the weak boundary, you overwork yourself, and you may even feel resentful toward your coworker.

If you weren’t allowed to prioritize your needs as a child, you may end up with weak boundaries as an adult. As Tawwab notes, this is especially common in adult children of parents who struggled with addiction.

(Shortform note: Tawwab’s belief that boundary issues often stem from childhood hardship reflects many of the ideas included in attachment theory. Attachment theory states that relationships in your formative years will affect the way you relate to others as an adult. For instance, if you’re constantly forced to put your needs aside as a child, you’ll likely form anxious attachments as an adult. If you’re an anxious attacher, you’re likely to engage in people-pleasing behavior, attempting to ensure other people’s needs are met while ignoring your own, in much the same way as Tawwab describes a person with weak boundaries behaving.)

#### Strict Boundaries

Strict boundaries are the second type of unhealthy boundary that Tawwab describes. **Strict boundaries are the opposite of weak boundaries—they lead you to push people away in an attempt to keep yourself safe**.

If you have strict boundaries, you might refuse to forgive friends for minor offenses and instead opt to cut them out completely. While cutting people out instead of working to set boundaries and resolve issues might keep those people from hurting you, setting such strict boundaries may lead you to lose friends and experience loneliness.

(Shortform note: In addition to cutting people out, you’ll tend to avoid conflict if you have strict boundaries. You'll refuse to engage in difficult discussions, even when you need to advocate for yourself in your relationships. Keep in mind that while it’s natural to feel uncomfortable during conflict, productive conflict can also help individuals and relationships to grow.)

According to Tawwab, you might develop strict boundaries if others have taken advantage of you in the past. Strained relationships with family and friends who ask to borrow money, as well as a history of being taken advantage of in romantic relationships are common factors that can lead you to develop strict boundaries.

You may have strict boundaries if you experience fear of vulnerability, an inability to share, or you cut people out without first making an effort to repair the relationship.

(Shortform note: The characteristics and origins of strict boundaries are similar to the traits of someone with an avoidant attachment style. People who have avoidant attachment styles avoid forming intimate relationships. Much like people with strict boundaries, avoidant people tend to cut off relationships at the first sign of conflict. Experts believe that this tendency often stems from childhood experiences of neglect. Because of these experiences, avoidant people develop strict boundaries to prevent themselves from being harmed by neglectful behavior in adult relationships.)

#### Healthy Boundaries

In contrast to weak and strict boundaries, **healthy boundaries allow you to prioritize your needs without pushing others away** or allowing them to take advantage of you. You probably have healthy boundaries if you’re able to maintain close and comfortable relationships, you’re comfortable saying no, and you’re also comfortable when people in your life say no to you.

(Shortform note: Having healthy boundaries is about more than just prioritizing your own needs. As experts note, boundaries define the space between people, keeping us from controlling each other and losing independence in our relationships. As part of respecting others’ independence, being able to respect other people’s needs and opinions—even when they differ from your own—is also an important part of having healthy boundaries.)

An example of healthy boundaries would be saying no to taking a friend to the airport in the middle of an especially busy workweek. If you have weak boundaries, you might stretch yourself thin by agreeing to the request, and if you have strict boundaries, you might consider stepping back from the relationship to avoid giving too much to the other person. However, if you have healthy boundaries, you’ll feel comfortable saying no to your friend while maintaining a positive relationship.

Tawwab believes that healthy boundaries develop when the trauma of past relationships doesn’t strongly affect your current ones. Of course, we’re always affected by our pasts to some degree, but if you have healthy boundaries, you’re also likely to be relating to your past in a healthy way.

(Shortform note: Tawwab’s conception of healthy boundaries mirrors the secure attachment style. People tend to develop a secure attachment style when they have trusting childhood relationships with their parents or guardians. If you have a secure attachment style, you’re able to trust the people in your life well enough to communicate honestly with them, even in difficult situations. This approach to communication naturally lends itself to establishing healthy boundaries.)

### How to Set Boundaries

Now that we know what healthy boundaries look like, let’s focus on how to set healthy boundaries. According to Tawwab, **setting boundaries is a three-step process**. First, identify the boundaries you’d like to set. Second, clearly communicate those boundaries. Finally, take action to reinforce your boundaries.

(Shortform note: In addition to Tawwab’s three steps, some authors include a fourth step: taking time to care for yourself after setting your boundaries. As we’ll soon discuss, Tawwab also recommends taking time out after difficult conversations, but some psychologists feel that rest is so crucial to maintaining healthy boundaries that it should be considered a separate stage of the process.)

#### Step 1: Identify Your Boundaries

As Tawwab describes, before you can communicate your boundaries to others, you’ll need to identify the boundaries you’d like to set. There are two categories of boundaries you’ll want to consider: personal boundaries and social boundaries.

According to Tawwab, your **personal boundaries are your standards for how people should treat your physical body**. Personal boundaries specify what level of physical and sexual contact, if any, you’re comfortable with in your relationships.

To identify your personal boundaries, reflect on a situation where physical touch made you uncomfortable. Ask yourself what specifically made you uncomfortable and how you’d like to be treated in the future. Once you’ve identified a situation where you’d like to set a personal boundary, define the boundary by writing down a statement that includes both the behavior that makes you uncomfortable and what changes you’d like to see.

> **Values-Based Boundary-Setting**
> 
> While Tawwab’s approach to personal boundary-setting focuses on specifically defining acceptable and unacceptable behaviors, other authors define personal boundaries more flexibly. These authors see boundary-setting as a continued effort to live by your values in your relationships.
> 
> Specifically, these authors caution against offering ultimatums when setting boundaries. While Tawwab doesn’t recommend setting unreasonable ultimatums, she often frames boundary-setting in terms of defining strictly unacceptable behaviors and enacting consequences in response to these behaviors.
> 
> As opposed to Tawwab’s approach, values-based boundary-setting focuses less on specific behaviors and consequences, and more on making an ongoing effort to honor your values. As part of this effort, you take time to share your values with the people in your life. In these conversations, you use your values to explain why certain behaviors make you upset, and work collaboratively toward a solution that fits within your values.

For example, Tawwab writes that if you notice that you like hugging friends but not people you’ve only recently met, you may have identified a personal boundary. You could define this boundary as follows: “I’m not comfortable hugging people I’m not close to. Next time we see each other, I’d rather shake hands or wave hello.”

(Shortform note: Tawwab’s example scenario, in which someone gives you an unwanted hug, can be an especially tricky issue in the workplace. Experts recommend that if you’re uncomfortable with the way a coworker wants to physically touch you, you should stop them and speak up. In these situations, the law may even be on your side—in some cases courts have ruled that unwanted workplace hugs are a form of workplace sexual harassment.)

As compared to personal (physical) boundaries, your **social boundaries set expectations for behavior in your relationships**. As Tawwab notes, this includes standards for how others should speak to you and about you, how you share your time with others, and how others should treat your belongings.

To identify your social boundaries, consider a social situation in which someone else made you feel uncomfortable. Then, write a statement that describes the behavior that makes you uncomfortable and how you’d like to be treated in the future.

For instance, If you feel upset when relatives make jokes at your expense, it’s probably a good idea to set social boundaries in those relationships. An example boundary might sound something like: “Those kinds of jokes make me uncomfortable. I’d prefer it if you could keep it positive when talking about me.”

(Shortform note: Your social boundaries may also include boundaries you set with yourself about how much time you’re willing to spend socializing. With the advent of social media, the fear of missing out (FOMO) has become increasingly common. FOMO can lead you to stretch yourself thin in the attempt to make it to every social function you’re invited to

#### Step 2: Communicate Your Boundaries

Once you’ve identified your personal and social boundaries, it’s time to set those boundaries in your relationships. To do this, you’ll want to **clearly and directly communicate your boundaries as you’ve defined them** in the previous step.

(Shortform note: While direct communication can be a strong strategy, the cultural background of the other person may impact the way your message is received. Specifically, Western cultures tend to value direct, explicit communication, while Eastern cultures tend to communicate differences more subtly. The kinds of communication people respond best to are informed by their personal histories, which is an important factor to consider when preparing to set boundaries.)

Tawwab argues that the best time to communicate your boundaries is during or immediately after an uncomfortable situation. Communicating your boundaries immediately helps end uncomfortable situations as quickly as possible, and also prevents resentment from building. On the other hand, if you don’t speak up immediately, other people will have no way to know you’re uncomfortable with a certain behavior, which means they’ll likely continue their behavior. If weeks or months go by and you still haven’t spoken up, your negative feelings about the incident are more likely to fester into resentment.

(Shortform note: While it’s often best to communicate your feelings in the moment, don’t fret if you aren’t always able to do so. When someone in your life upsets you, it can be difficult to maintain enough composure to express your feelings clearly. What’s important is that you take the next available opportunity to clear things up and state your boundaries before resentment has time to build. In situations like these, experts recommend that you clear things up within a week, while the incident is still fresh in mind.)

For instance, suppose your partner says something that embarasses you in front of your parents. While you’re a little upset, you decide to put it aside to avoid making a scene. Then, the next time you’re all together, they do it again. Naturally, you’d feel even more upset and embarrassed the second time, and you’d also probably begin to feel frustrated with your partner. By speaking up in the moment the first time it happened, you would have avoided being embarrassed twice, _and_ you’d also prevent frustration from building between you and your partner.

Tawwab stresses the importance of being assertive when communicating your boundaries. **By being assertive, you let others know that you’re serious** about your boundaries. By contrast, if you adopt an apologetic tone, it sends a message to others that your boundaries may have wiggle room.

(Shortform note: Counterintuitively, experts believe that assertive communication can help you avoid unnecessary conflict. Assertively communicating makes it clear to others how you’d like to be treated, which gives them the information they need to avoid upsetting you. By contrast, apologetic communication may send mixed messages to the other person about how you feel.)

Similarly, **you should avoid explaining your reasoning**. While it may feel natural to tell others why your boundaries are important, Tawwab notes that explaining yourself only creates opportunities for others to argue with you.

(Shortform note: While Tawwab writes that you shouldn’t explain your feelings when setting boundaries, other authors believe that sharing more about why you feel what you feel can positively impact difficult conversations. These authors argue that by sharing your story, and listening to the stories of others, you can build mutual empathy and understanding, which helps others treat you more respectfully.)

For example, suppose you offer to let your brother use your car for a few hours, and he doesn’t bring it back until the next day. If, as Tawwab prescribes, you choose to be direct and assertive, you might say something like “When you borrow my car, I need you to return it on time, otherwise I won’t be able to lend it to you.” Statements like these make it clear what you expect from your relationships.

By contrast, if you choose to explain yourself, you might say something like “I need my car to get to work, pick up the kids, and run errands.” While you might intend to provide clarity, your explanation only gives your brother room to argue by saying that you can walk or use public transit to do all those things.

Tawwab recommends that you **take time to rest and let difficult emotions settle after communicating boundaries**. It’s important to give yourself a break after setting boundaries because communicating boundaries can be difficult and uncomfortable, especially if you’re new to it. Taking time to eat a comforting meal, read a book, or chat with a friend are all things that can help you decompress after setting boundaries.

(Shortform note: In addition to the emotional benefits of rest, taking adequate time to de-stress has been shown to improve decision-making and general cognitive functioning. By taking time to rest after difficult conversations, you ensure that you’ll be your sharpest self for any follow-up conversations or future boundary-setting decisions.)

##### Set Boundaries With Yourself

In addition to helping you relate better to others, **setting boundaries can also be a useful tool for self-improvement**. Tawwab notes that by setting boundaries with yourself in areas such as finance, social media usage, and time management, you can break free from bad habits and begin forming new ones.

(Shortform note: Some experts believe that setting financial boundaries for yourself can help affirm your self-worth. These experts argue that by placing limits on your spending, you make a conscious choice to value your own happiness over the pursuit of material possessions. And, as a result of the choice to spend more responsibly, you’re likely to feel better about yourself. This leads to a virtuous cycle, where the less you focus on materialistic concerns, the better you feel about yourself, and vice versa.)

Setting boundaries with yourself involves exercising the discipline to be able to say no to yourself. For example, imagine trying to finish a key work assignment while your family group chat is in the middle of a heated argument. By setting a boundary with yourself to avoid looking at your phone until your assignment is finished, you’ll be able to work free from distractions.

(Shortform note: In addition to exercising discipline, you should also treat yourself compassionately as you learn to set boundaries with yourself. Like anyone else, you’ll struggle and make mistakes as you adjust to new boundaries. It will naturally take some time for you to break from habits, and accepting this can help keep you from becoming discouraged and unmotivated.)

#### Step 3: Take Action to Reinforce Your Boundaries

The final step in the process of setting boundaries is reinforcing your boundaries through action. Specifically, Tawwab recommends that you **_restate_ your boundaries so that others know you’re serious, and set consequences for boundary violations**.

Tawwab argues that restating your boundaries is just as important as initially communicating them. It’s important to repeat your boundaries because people need to hear a piece of information many times in order to internalize it and make necessary adjustments. In addition to helping others internalize your boundaries, repetition lets others know that you’re serious about your boundaries, and that they haven’t changed since the last time you spoke.

> **Repetition Is an Interdisciplinary Communication Tool**
> 
> The kind of repetition that Tawwab recommends for reinforcing boundaries can also be a useful tool for communication in other areas of your life. In the business world, experts describe how repetitively communicating helps keep workplace teams on the same page. Especially in a modern remote workplace, where employees may clock in on different days and from different time zones, communicating information multiple times can help ensure that nobody misses out on important information.
> 
> In addition to helping keep employees on the same page, repetitive communication can be an important tool for strengthening your organization’s values and identity. In _The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive_ , author Patrick Lencioni argues that having frequent conversations about your company’s values can help employees feel a sense of camaraderie and purpose in their work. In both business and boundary-setting contexts, repetition helps people internalize important information.

As with communicating your boundaries, **the best time to restate boundaries is when violations occur**. While it can be tempting, don’t let things slide even once, as this sends the impression that your boundaries aren’t serious and don’t always apply.

(Shortform note: When correcting unwanted behaviors, some authors suggest that taking a positive approach to the conversation will make it easier for the other person to accept your boundaries. Avoid scolding the other person; instead, express your confidence in them, and encourage them to do better next time.)

Finally, Tawwab notes that you should decide in advance what to do if someone continues to violate your stated boundaries. This may include consequences. Consequences can feel mean, but they often help others to understand that you’re serious about your boundaries. And, even if others choose not to adjust to your boundaries, consequences can also protect you from further harm and discomfort.

For example, suppose your boss routinely asks you to work weekends, despite the fact that your contract specifies you’ll have time off on Saturdays and Sundays. When stating your boundaries, you could include as a consequence that when asked to work on the weekend, you won’t respond and won’t come in. Even if your boss refuses to respect your boundaries and continues to pester you, this consequence protects your boundaries and your time.

> **Natural Consequences as a Boundary-Setting Tool**
> 
> If you’re struggling to identify fair consequences for boundary violations, consider taking advantage of natural consequences. Originally a parenting concept, natural consequences are exactly what they sound like—unwanted outcomes that result from someone’s choices. Parenting experts argue that you should allow children to experience the natural consequences of their behaviors whenever possible, as it gives them the opportunity to learn from their mistakes firsthand.
> 
> In a boundary-setting context, natural consequences hold similar advantages. They help the other person directly learn from their mistake, without you having to engage in punishment. Consider the previous example, in which your boss asks you for extra help on the weekends. By refusing to go in on weekends, you set a natural consequence. Instead of attempting to discipline your boss, you simply allow him to experience the results of his own scheduling and staffing errors.

##### How Not to Set Boundaries—Communication Patterns to Avoid

As opposed to the healthy, effective methods for communicating and reinforcing boundaries we’ve covered, **many people use passive aggression, aggression, and manipulation to communicate their needs**. Whether or not they realize it, everyone exhibits these behaviors at times—even you. This isn’t because we’re bad, selfish people, but rather because boundary-setting is difficult, especially if you’ve never been taught to do it. Unfortunately, these common tendencies don’t help us maintain healthy relationships. Because of this, Tawwab recommends that you look out for these patterns and avoid them.

> **Avoid Passive Communication**
> 
> In addition to the three negative communication patterns Tawwab outlines, some authors list a fourth negative pattern: passive communication. Passive communicators usually don’t see their own needs as important. Because of this, passive communicators almost never share their needs with others. Instead, they prefer to focus on meeting the needs of others in their relationships.
> 
> In the long run, passive communication isn’t an effective strategy for building fulfilling relationships. Without knowing how you feel and what you need, the people in your life won’t have the information they need to be good to you, and you deny them the chance to get to know you more intimately.

As Tawwab describes, passive aggression involves doling out consequences for violations without first taking time to communicate your boundaries. It can be easy to fall into this pattern—when someone does something you don’t like, many people find it natural to sulk or retaliate. However, behaving passive-aggressively usually doesn’t help you get your needs met because **the other person won’t know what they’ve done wrong or how to do better until you tell them**.

(Shortform note: If you’re struggling to avoid passive-aggression, it may be worth talking to a therapist about it. Mental health professionals note that passive-aggression sometimes presents as a symptom of untreated mental illness. If your passive-aggression is related to mental illness, seeking treatment may make it easier for you to cut down on communicating this way.)

Aggression is exactly what it sounds like—getting upset and raising your voice, shaming people, and picking fights in response to unwanted behaviors. While aggressive communication can help you get your point across, it will also make others afraid of you and may even make them retreat from the relationship entirely. Because of these damaging effects, Tawwab argues that aggression isn’t an effective tool for maintaining relationships.

(Shortform note: While Tawwab argues that aggression isn’t generally a good communication tool, other authors argue that aggressive communication can be helpful in certain situations. If you’re in a situation that you’re worried might become dangerous, taking aggressive action may help you to exit the situation quickly.)

Finally, manipulation involves using indirect methods to try to get what you want without directly communicating your boundaries. Often, Tawwab argues, manipulators try to use guilt to get other people to do what they want. Just like aggression, manipulation makes other people feel fearful and uncomfortable, and it may cause people to resent you or leave relationships with you. Because of this, manipulation ultimately isn’t a very useful communication tool.

(Shortform note: Because manipulators try to control situations subtly and indirectly, it can be difficult to recognize manipulation in your relationships. For instance, in addition to overt behaviors such as bullying and insults, manipulation can include subtle methods, such as a refusal to engage in conflict, as well as “love bombing.” In _Why Does He Do That?_ , Lundy Bancroft explains that “love bombing” is a pattern of behavior in which a manipulative person offers excessive affection at the beginning of a relationship to win you over. Then, they withhold their affection in an attempt to gain leverage over you. If one of your relationships falls into this pattern, it may be a sign that you’re being manipulated.)

As an example, suppose you’re feeling overburdened at work, and one of your coworkers approaches you to ask if you can handle a challenging project for them. The healthiest option would be to immediately and explicitly state your boundaries, saying something like “I appreciate that you’re having a difficult time, but I can’t help you with this project.” On the other hand, if you choose to manipulate your coworker instead of directly expressing your boundaries, you might lie and say that you heard management was disappointed in your coworker's lack of initiative. While this behavior might convince your coworker to finish the project on their own, you’d probably also make your coworker upset, especially if they found out you lied to them.

### Common Problem Areas for Boundary-Setting

Now that we know how to identify and set boundaries, let’s look at some specific contexts that can make boundary-setting more difficult. Specifically, Tawwab notes that **it’s common to struggle with setting boundaries with loved ones and at work**. We’ll look into both of these situations below and provide strategies to help you set boundaries in these complicated contexts.

(Shortform note: Tawwab offers recommendations for setting boundaries with loved ones and at work, but sometimes you may encounter someone who makes boundary-setting difficult outside of those contexts. When communicating boundaries with a difficult person, experts recommend focusing on yourself and your personal limits, and not on the other person. When you focus on yourself in the conversation, the other person is less likely to feel confronted. In turn, they’ll be more receptive than if you begin the conversation by criticizing their behavior.)

#### Setting Boundaries With Loved Ones

According to Tawwab, it’s normal to experience difficulty setting boundaries with your loved ones. Because your loved ones have probably known you for quite a while, they’ve likely become attached to routine ways of interacting with you. When you try to change these longstanding routines, loved ones often struggle to adjust, as they may fear that your new boundaries will create distance in the relationship. As a result of this uneasiness, it may take them some time to adjust to your new boundaries.

(Shortform note: It’s especially common to experience boundary issues with your loved ones after getting married. Parents often struggle with feeling relatively uninvolved in their children’s lives, as those children try to juggle the demands of both sets of in-laws. If you’re recently married and struggling to set boundaries with your parents, remember that they’re likely feeling insecure, and do your best to remind your parents that they’re important to you as you set your boundaries. And, if you’re the parent of a newly married person, remember that your child now has more responsibilities to balance than ever before, and do your best to give them the space they need to adjust.)

##### Communicate in Advance

To help give your loved ones the time they need to adjust their expectations, **begin communicating your boundaries as far in advance as possible** rather than waiting until a boundary violation happens, especially if you know an important occasion is coming up.

(Shortform: The idea that it’s best to communicate potentially upsetting information as soon as possible isn’t unique to boundary-setting. In the world of public relations, firms often prepare to respond quickly to potential crises, because prompt, forthright communications help reassure consumers. By contrast, waiting to issue a statement allows time for the public to spread and dwell on negative rumors.)

In particular, this can be helpful when setting boundaries around holiday travel. If you decide not to attend a family gathering, let everyone know as soon as you can. By communicating this information early on, you give your family time and space to come to terms with things. On the other hand, the longer you wait to express your boundaries, the more time your family will have to get excited to see you, which will deepen their disappointment if you cancel at the last minute.

(Shortform note: When setting boundaries around holiday travel, be honest with your loved ones and attentive to their feelings, in addition to communicating in advance. It’s important to be honest with them about why you can’t make it home, because it helps them to respect your decision. If you make up an excuse, you risk being caught in a lie, which will hurt everyone’s feelings and damage your relationships. Similarly, it’s important to hear and acknowledge your loved ones’ feelings about holiday travel. Taking the time to listen will reassure them that you care for them, regardless of how you choose to spend your holidays.)

##### Communicate Explicitly

Additionally, Tawwab notes that it’s easy to assume that you don’t need to communicate your boundaries to your loved ones because they know you well enough to understand how you’d like to be treated without having to be told. However, **friends, partners, and family members can’t read minds** , which means that, as always, it’s best to explicitly state your boundaries with them, regardless of how close your relationships are. Clearly setting expectations in these relationships not only helps you avoid discomfort, it also helps your loved ones meet your expectations and make you happy, which is almost always what they want.

(Shortform note: Psychological research backs up Tawwab’s assertion that loved ones don’t always know how we feel. Recent research suggests that romantic partners are good at knowing when you’re happy, but struggle to recognize when you’re feeling upset. Unfortunately, knowing when we’re happy isn’t much use in boundary-setting situations, as you’ll most often need to set boundaries in response to situations that make you upset. As the research suggests, loved ones won’t know you’re uncomfortable until you tell them.)

Another hurdle for setting boundaries with loved ones is the temptation to let small infractions slide to avoid conflict with the people you love. **While it’s natural to want to spare your loved ones’ feelings, you can damage relationships by refusing to speak up**. If you don’t speak up about behaviors that make you uncomfortable, others will naturally believe you’re okay with those behaviors and will continue unknowingly upsetting you.

(Shortform note: When addressing infractions with loved ones, it’s important that you take time to understand your own feelings. If you’ve let things slide in a close relationship and resentment has started to build, you may find yourself getting upset about completely benign behaviors, due to your general frustration. Figure out what you’re really upset about before you bring your concerns to your loved ones. When you know your feelings, you’ll be able to clearly express them to the other person. By contrast, if you bring a disorganized tangle of frustrations to a loved one, they’ll find it difficult to understand what you really need.)

Because of this, Tawwab argues that you should always speak up when your needs aren’t being met in your close relationships. Speaking up immediately when your loved ones make you uncomfortable allows them to learn from the mistake and prevents resentment from forming.

(Shortform note: As you attempt to bring up your concerns as soon as possible, be sure you pick an appropriate time to have boundary conversations. If the other person is busy with work, family, or friends, it’s probably not a good time to start a difficult conversation, as the other person won’t be able to give you their full attention. Instead, try and pick a comfortable time and location, in which both of you have time to share your feelings and decompress afterward.)

##### Set Boundaries Around Supporting Friends

According to Tawwab, a common pattern in friendships is that one person ends up providing more emotional support than they’re comfortable with. Naturally, people complain to their friends about relationships, family, and work, but sometimes, friends can get carried away and unload too many emotions on one another.

(Shortform note: It’s especially important to set boundaries when a friend is struggling with something that’s particularly upsetting for you to engage with. When you’re personally affected by the discussion of a specific subject, it can be difficult to provide support without exhausting yourself or becoming upset. For instance, if you’re the child of an alcoholic, it may be distressing for you to revisit those memories when offering support to a friend struggling with alcohol abuse. In these situations, it’s best to acknowledge that you’re not able to offer the support that your friend needs. That way, they’ll be able to look elsewhere for the support they need, and you’ll be able to continue the friendship without draining yourself.)

If a friend is asking for more support than you can give, it’s best for the relationship if you speak up immediately. While setting boundaries with friends can lead to feelings of guilt, in the long run, the relationship will be better off for it. By speaking up and setting boundaries, you enable the other person to be a better friend to you.

(Shortform note: If you experience guilt after setting boundaries with friends, it’s important to remember that you’ve not only done what’s best for the relationship, you’ve also done what’s best for you. By setting boundaries, you avoid pouring out too much energy supporting friends. And, when you have more energy, you’ll be able to function better, both for yourself and in your relationships.)

#### Setting Boundaries at Work

Tawwab argues that **it’s especially important to explicitly state your boundaries in the workplace** because your coworkers may not always know you intimately—coworkers whom you aren’t close to won’t know how you’d like to be treated until you tell them. Just like with loved ones, it’s best to communicate explicitly with your coworkers regardless of how close your relationships with them are. Give your coworkers the chance to respect you by communicating your boundaries in the office the same as you would in other relationships.

(Shortform note: Some authors believe that setting boundaries in the workplace can help you avoid burnout. These authors argue that the best way to improve your job satisfaction is to set boundaries and advocate for yourself in your workplace. At many companies, boundary-setting is appreciated, as managers appreciate hearing feedback that helps them manage more effectively.)

Not every workplace conflict can be solved by boundary-setting. If your workplace includes toxic behaviors such as sexual harassment or wage theft, and those behaviors continue even after you communicate your boundaries, you may need to take other actions. Specifically, Tawwab advises that you document misbehavior, reach out to human resources and management (if they’re sympathetic), and consider finding a new job if necessary.

(Shortform note: If you’re faced with toxic behavior at work that can’t be solved by setting boundaries, there are other actions you can take to defend yourself. Specifically, if you believe you’re being discriminated against at work, you can file a claim with a government agency such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Agencies such as the EEOC exist to ensure that workers are treated fairly and can help you access workplace protections and legal recourse if necessary.)

### Boundary Violations

Now that we know how to set healthy boundaries in a variety of contexts, let’s consider what happens when others violate our boundaries.

According to Tawwab, **boundary violations often happen as a natural part of the boundary-setting process**. Even the most respectful people will take a little time to adjust to new boundaries in a relationship, and in the meantime, they’ll likely slip up and default to old behaviors. While this adjustment period can be painful, violations that occur during this process provide you with an opportunity to reinforce your boundaries, thereby strengthening your relationships in the long run.

(Shortform note: It’s important to recognize the distinction between boundary violations that occur naturally as part of an adjustment process, and violations that occur because the other person doesn’t respect your boundaries. When someone doesn’t respect your boundaries, they’ll bring the subject up again and again, questioning and arguing about your needs. On the other hand, when someone simply slips up, they’ll tend to react more apologetically, recognizing their own mistake.)

In addition to honest mistakes, Tawwab reiterates that people may push back against your boundaries because they’re afraid that their relationship with you will change or end. Reasserting your boundaries without backing away from the relationship can help the other person feel more secure, which may lead them to push back against your boundaries less.

(Shortform note: Pushback against boundaries can often take subtle forms, such as people taking a rude or aggressive tone of voice when they don’t respect your boundaries. While it can be tempting to ignore subtle pushback, it’s best to address the situation immediately to avoid having to deal with continued pushback.)

Not all boundary violations are equal. **Some violations are relatively minor, causing only slight distress, while others are more major, causing more intense harm and requiring a more drastic response**. We’ll define both minor and major violations below, and provide strategies for responding when your boundaries are violated.

#### Minor Violations

According to Tawwab, **minor violations are mild, everyday occurrences that are more annoying than they are distressing**. These kinds of violations won’t ruin your day or your week, but they are noticed and felt.

(Shortform note: While major and minor boundary violations differ in severity, minor violations can still cause serious harm, and should be taken seriously. For instance, while they may be minor compared to other forms of aggression, subtle racial remarks known as microaggressions can negatively impact the mental health of their targets. When you’re repeatedly subjected to microaggressions, you may become depressed and experience diminished cognitive function and productivity. Thus, these minor violations are worth setting boundaries around.)

For example, suppose you set a boundary with a close friend, stating clearly that you can’t lend them money anymore. The next week, when you’re going to see a movie together, they ask to borrow a few dollars to buy popcorn with. While this mild boundary violation won’t put you out much, it’s still a violation and will likely still cause you some degree of annoyance.

#### Major Violations

On the other hand, **major violations are serious breaches of trust that directly harm you and your relationship**. According to Tawwab, these kinds of violations hurt deeply, and may require you to take drastic action to protect yourself.

To return to our prior example, suppose that you have the same friend over for dinner later that week. The next morning, while getting dressed, you realize that a necklace your grandmother gave you is missing. It turns out that your friend took the necklace and pawned it for cash. Given that the necklace was of significant sentimental and material value, this major violation makes you extremely upset and forces you to reconsider your friendship.

(Shortform note: Major boundary violations often involve power imbalances that make it difficult for you to safely address them. For example, a negative comment about your appearance from a stranger probably won’t seriously impact your life, no matter how you choose to respond to it. However, if a person in a position of power over you, such as a landlord, a professor, or an employer makes an inappropriate comment, it’ll likely cause a greater degree of stress, as you’ll risk more if you decide to stand up to them.)

#### How to Respond to Boundary Violations

When a major or minor boundary violation occurs, Tawwab recommends that you immediately reassert your boundary. **If you’re not okay with how someone is treating you, speak up immediately**. If you experience a major violation and the other person continues behaving in a way that makes you uncomfortable after you reassert your boundary, you may need to leave the situation altogether.

If boundary violations become frequent in one of your relationships, Tawwab suggests limiting your interactions with the person in question. Finding ways to limit time spent with people who don’t respect your boundaries can be an especially useful tool when you don’t have the option to leave the situation completely. In these situations, limiting the amount of time you spend interacting with the offending person can minimize your discomfort.

(Shortform note: Sometimes, people who repeatedly violate your boundaries do so in an attempt to get a response from you, much like a playground bully. If you’re dealing with a bully, it can be helpful to ignore that person entirely. By refusing to argue or engage, you deny them the satisfaction of knowing they’ve made you upset, which will make them less likely to try the same tactic in the future.)

For example, suppose you have a manager at work who makes inappropriate comments about your appearance. Even though you’ve talked to him about it, he refuses to listen, and because you need the income from your job, you can’t just stop showing up. In this situation, one option would be to limit your interactions with this manager, asking to be scheduled on different days, and working on separate projects whenever possible.

As we have mentioned, **when you experience frequent major boundary violations, you may sometimes need to leave the relationship entirely**. Tawwab believes that cutting people out should be a last resort—because it may not be possible to ever return to the relationship, you should only cut someone out when they leave you no other options.

(Shortform note: If you’re struggling to decide whether to remove someone from your life, experts recommend considering whether interacting with someone makes you happy. If interacting with someone consistently leaves you feeling unhappy and uncomfortable, it’s probably not worth continuing the relationship.)

Lastly, Tawwab stresses that you should try not to blame yourself when your boundaries are violated. Instead, take pride in the fact that you’re doing the hard work of setting and reasserting your boundaries. No matter how much effort you put into setting healthy boundaries, some people may still choose not to respect them. When someone chooses to behave in a way that makes you uncomfortable, it reflects negatively on their character, and not on yours.

(Shortform note: Part of setting boundaries is learning to accept that you can’t control other people. No matter how much effort you apply, you simply can’t force others to change. Instead, spend that energy thinking about how you’d like to handle things going forward, and what actions you can take to better protect your own boundaries.)
