## Exercise: Assess Your Relationship to Digital Platforms

Kuang and Fabricant write that some companies have leveraged principles of behavioral psychology to make people addicted to digital products such as social media platforms, apps, and games. This represents a shift away from companies utilizing user-friendliness as a way to improve people’s lives and instead using it to take advantage of people for profit. Use the following exercises to assess the beneficial or harmful roles of social media and digital products in your life.

* * *

Write down one of the digital products that you use regularly. This could include things like a social media app like Instagram, a specific website, or a game that you play on your phone. How does the experience of using this product enhance your life? Does it help you feel connected to people, help you relax, or is it educational?

Write down any ways that the digital product has a negative impact on your life. For example, it might be something that distracts you from work or makes you feel anxious.

Now that you’ve identified potential harmful effects of the digital product, how might you adjust your relationship with it to make it truly user-friendly: something that meets your needs and aligns with your values? This might mean deleting an app and using the web version instead, limiting your use to specific time frames, or another modification to your current practice.
