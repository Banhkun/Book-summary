## Exercise: Practice Doubting Every Message

The fifth step of the Toltec path to enlightenment asks us to doubt every message we hear. Start by doubting just one message.

* * *

Think of the last time you heard something that made you feel bad about yourself. What was the message? (For example, an advertisement for a diet pill might send the message that your body isn’t good enough as it is.)

Who benefits from you believing that message? What do they gain from your belief? (For example, the company that makes the diet pill might get your money if they convince you that your body isn’t good enough.)

Thinking as objectively as you can—is that message true, or is it someone else’s skewed version of reality? (There are no right or wrong answers; what’s important is that you’re taking the time to think about it instead of accepting the message at face value.)
