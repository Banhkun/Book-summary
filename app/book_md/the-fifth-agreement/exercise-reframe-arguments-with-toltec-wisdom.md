## Exercise: Reframe Arguments With Toltec Wisdom

One way to implement the Toltec path to enlightenment is to reframe arguments. Take a moment to practice that skill here.

* * *

Think of the last argument you had with a friend, family member, or coworker. Briefly describe what happened, how you reacted, and how the other person reacted.

The first step of the Toltec path to enlightenment is “use your words wisely” (because our words dictate how we see reality). Read back over the description of your recent argument. Did the words you used paint anyone in a negative light? If so, rephrase your description to be more neutral and accurate. (For example, instead of saying, “My brother was such a jerk,” you might say, “My brother raised his voice.”)

In the third step, the authors remind us to communicate openly instead of trying to guess other people’s intentions. Write a brief note explaining your thoughts after your recent argument and asking the other person to clearly explain their thoughts. (For example, you might explain that you’re still upset, or that you’re worried the argument is part of an ongoing pattern in your relationship.)
