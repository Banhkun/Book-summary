## Exercise: Consider What Lincoln Would Do

Think about how Lincoln would approach a leadership challenge you’ve faced or are facing.

* * *

Describe a challenge you’ve faced or currently face in a leadership position.

How did you communicate with your employees throughout this challenge? Did you use Lincoln’s approach (making yourself accessible and building strong relationships)? If not, explain what approach you used.

How did you make sure you did what was ethically right? Did you use Lincoln’s methods (sticking to your core values and keeping your emotions in check)? If not, what methods did you use?

Describe your decision-making process during this challenge. Was it similar to Lincoln’s (consulting together, deciding alone, planning and sticking to that plan)? Explain your answer.
