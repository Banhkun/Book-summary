## Part 1: Vulnerability | Chapter 1: Shame and Empathy

**Shame is insecurity that attaches to self-identity and gets in the way of action or vulnerability.** It causes people to believe that they’re unworthy or unloveable. For example, if you feel shame about the way you look, and someone rejects you romantically, you may believe that you’re not “attractive enough,” diminishing your self-worth in the process.

**Shame relies on people believing that their experience with insecurity is unrelatable, creating a sense of loneliness.** This often causes people to believe that no one else could _possibly_ understand their situation, leading to the development of three factors that allow shame to grow: secrecy, silence, and judgment.

For example, a common form of shame is known as “imposter syndrome,” or the feeling that you’re a fraud. Imposter syndrome requires that you believe that the people around you are more qualified than you are and can’t understand your insecurity. This may lead you to keep your fears to yourself (silence), prevent others from seeing any potential weaknesses (secrecy), and increase your awareness of the failures of others (judgment).

Though shame feels isolating, **everyone experiences it**(with the exception of severe psychopaths). While no one _wants_ to share their insecurities, talking about shame is the only way to diminish its power because, once you know that you’re not alone, shame loses its leverage.

#### Guilt, Blame, Embarrassment, and Humiliation

Though the terms are often used interchangeably, **shame isn’t the same as guilt, blame, embarrassment, or humiliation.**

##### Guilt Versus Shame

**Guilt is attached to an action or behavior, not your identity.** Guilt makes you say, “That was a bad decision.” Guilt can be a useful tool to stop making poor decisions. For example, an alcoholic feeling guilt about a relapse usually won’t give up on recovery because, while they know they made a bad decision, they don’t believe they’re a “bad person.”

**Shame is attached to identity, not to an action or behavior.** Shame makes you say, “I am a bad person.” Shame often causes people to fall further into unhealthy behavior. For example, an alcoholic feeling shame about their relapse will often spiral further into their addiction because they believe they’re irredeemable.

##### Blame Versus Shame

**Blaming is the discharging of emotions that are often unrelated to the inciting incident.** For example, your partner comes home late one night, causing you to get less sleep. The next morning, you accidentally drop a mug on the floor. You may blame your clumsiness on the fact that your partner disrupted your sleep while, in reality, they had little to do with you dropping the mug.

**Shaming, on the other hand, is a pointed attack that targets someone’s insecurities.** For example, your partner comes home late one night. You know they’re upset that they haven’t been able to spend time with the family, but you’re exhausted and frustrated. You begin yelling at them for spending too much time at work and not enough time with the kids, causing them to fall deeper into their shame.

##### Embarrassment Versus Shame

**Embarrassment is a temporary moment of discomfort.** While embarrassing situations can be hard to handle in the moment, their emotional impact often lessens with time. For example, if you trip on your way to accept an award, you may feel embarrassed in the moment. However, with a bit of time, the experience loses its impact, potentially becoming humorous.

**Shame is long-lasting and crippling.** Often, people remember shameful experiences years after they’ve occurred. For example, if you were told as a child that you should never sing because you sound terrible, you may avoid public singing for the rest of your life because you never want to relive that experience.

##### Humiliation Versus Shame

**Humiliation is a demeaning experience that you believe you _didn’t_ deserve. **Humiliation doesn’t impact self-worth and often leads to anger. For example, if a teacher yells at you for showing up a minute late to class, and you don’t feel you deserved that kind of response, you may feel upset, but you don’t think less of yourself.

**Shame is a demeaning experience that you believe you _did_ deserve. **Shame impacts self-worth and often leads to retraction or silence. For example, if your boss calls you an idiot in front of your colleagues, and you believe them, your shame may cause you to say nothing and internalize your insecurity.

> **The TOSCA Test**

> **The TOSCA test determines your proneness to shame, guilt, and blame by gauging your immediate responses to different scenarios.** Based on your responses to these scenarios, you can acknowledge your tendencies, helping you notice them in real-life situations. For example, you drop red wine on a white carpet. What’s your first response? Do you:
> 
>   * Find the host immediately and apologize for what happened. (Guilt)
> 
>   * Look around to see if anyone saw what you did, then slip away unseen. (Shame)
> 
>   * Ask yourself, “Why are they serving red wine if they have a white carpet?” (Blame)
> 
> 


#### Common Sources of Shame

**Shame often develops in childhood and lingers throughout adulthood.** The roots of shame are often built at home or at school as a result of interactions with authority figures such as teachers or parents. For example, if a teacher calls a student “stupid” in front of the class for forgetting to put their name on their paper, that student may develop shame around their intelligence.

One study showed that 85% of people feel the impact of being shamed in school. Of those people, half of them were shamed for their creativity (or lack thereof). This has caused many to avoid creativity well into their adult years, causing what many in the business world are calling an “innovation crisis.”

**In addition to negative interactions with teachers and parents, negative interactions with siblings often cause shame.** Siblings know each other’s triggers and often abuse that knowledge through name-calling, physical abuse, and other cruel practices. These often occur during fights and are usually outlets for unrelated anger.

For example, if Johnny had a rough day at school, and his sister, Kelly, makes a joke at his expense, Johnny may make a cruel comment about Kelly’s appearance in retaliation. If self-image is something that Kelly struggles with, this comment could feed into her shame and drive her deeper into her insecurity.

##### Shame Triggers

**Shame triggers are topics that evoke emotional responses based on your insecurities.** These triggers are often the result of your upbringing and can elicit one of three negative responses:

  * **Silence:** You say nothing and internalize your feelings. This leads to disconnection as you shut yourself off emotionally. 
  * **Complacency:** You people-please and overcompensate to pretend that nothing’s wrong. This causes disappointment as you succumb to the pressures of others.
  * **Aggression:** You lash out and, often, shame other people in retaliation. This perpetuates and exacerbates shame culture.



For example, if you feel insecure about your body, and someone makes an off-hand comment about someone’s weight, you may feel an emotional response to their comment, leading you to do one of the following:

  * You walk away and dive into your work. When people ask you what’s wrong, you say nothing. (Silence)
  * You overcompensate by also making fun of the person your colleague was talking about. Later, you feel disappointment for commenting on someone else’s weight. (Complacency)
  * You tell your colleague to back off, then make a comment about _their_ appearance. Your colleague feels shamed and takes it out on someone else. (Aggression)



**These triggers are often developed in childhood but carry on into adulthood.** For example, if you were raised to believe that laziness is unacceptable, you may view taking breaks or getting sick as unacceptable because they keep you from working. This may cause you to make unhealthy decisions and overwork yourself to avoid your shame.

#### Handling Shame

Unfortunately, shame is a part of life. There isn’t a way to eradicate it, but you can deal with it healthily:

**First, understand that self-worth has no prerequisites.** You don’t have to do anything to be “worthy” of love and belonging. If you feel you have to prove yourself, you’re allowing your shame to dictate your behavior.

**Second, when bad things happen, don’t allow them to dictate your self-worth.** Don’t allow your guilt or humiliation to turn into shame. For example, if you make a bad decision, tell yourself, “I made a bad decision, and I’m working to fix it.” Conversely, avoid saying, “I am a bad person, and, because of that, I can’t fix anything.”

**Third, accountability is important, but never at the cost of shaming.** This applies to how you’re treated as well as how you treat others. For example, if your child gets a bad grade on a test, don’t shame them by calling them “lazy” or “dumb.” Instead, say, “I think you made some poor choices about studying, and I know you can do better because you’re smart, and you’re capable.”

This also applies to self-accountability. Your actions speak louder than your words, and if you resort to shaming yourself when you make mistakes, people around you will notice. For example, if you tell your children never to call themselves “stupid,” but you call yourself “stupid” after making simple mistakes, your children will note your hypocrisy and ignore your advice.

**Fourth, practice shame resilience.** Shame resilience is the ability to recognize and discuss shame. There are four keys to shame resilience:

  1. **You’re willing to call shame, “shame.”** Don’t try to bury or brush off your feelings as that will only lead to them coming back stronger due to repression.
  2. **You know what you're feeling ashamed about and you know what triggered it.** For example, you may feel insecure about your intelligence after someone gives you feedback on your work. 
  3. **You can separate your reality from other people’s expectations.** For example, if you struggle with being perceived as weak, the only way to deal with your shame is to accept that you can’t realistically live a healthy life while repressing or hiding your emotions to appear “strong.”
  4. **You can reach out to people you trust and talk about your shame.** These should be people who have earned your trust and who can bear the weight of your story. For example, if you’re feeling insecure about your body, you could call your best friend and talk through your shame.



**Lastly, develop a few practices that help you identify and handle shame:**

  * Know your physical responses to shame. When you feel these responses, you know that you’re in shame and can work to handle it healthily.
  * Practice authenticity. When you feel shame emerge, don’t overcompensate and don’t shrink away. Be true to yourself and know that you are enough.
  * If you feel yourself spiraling, tap the center of your forehead. This helps engage the prefrontal cortex, which processes rational thinking. 
  * Take the time to process your emotions, especially in critical moments. Walk away for a moment if you need to. This helps you avoid habitually responding negatively to your shame.



#### Empathy: The Antidote to Shame

**Empathy is the ability to see the world as others see it and understand another person’s feelings.** Shame can’t grow in an environment of empathy because understanding eradicates insecurity.

Empathy isn’t the default for most people because it can be challenging or uncomfortable. It requires setting your personal perspective or problems aside and meeting someone at their current emotional level. There are two key elements of empathy: perspective-taking and nonjudgmental understanding.

##### Perspective-Taking

**Perspective-taking is the ability to look at a situation from another person’s perspective instead of your own.** Everyone has a “lens” through which they experience the world. To be empathetic, separate yourself from your personal “lens” and accept that someone else’s lens is just as important.

What’s a minor issue to one person may be a serious catastrophe to another. For example, your friend drops a plain-looking mug and starts to panic. From your perspective, dropping the mug may be a minor issue as you assume your friend could just buy another cheap one. However, what you don’t know is that the mug was given to them by their grandmother who recently passed away.

**Children often learn perspective-taking from their parents.** Because of this, this practice is particularly challenging for white, middle-class, Judeo-Christians because many people in that demographic were taught from childhood that their perspective was _the_ perspective. This makes it challenging for them to set aside their own “lens” to try to see the world from a different point of view.

##### Nonjudgmental Understanding

**Nonjudgmental understanding requires the setting aside of personal shame to prevent judgmental feelings or actions.** We judge people based upon our _personal_ shame because it gives us a false sense of security. For example, if you feel insecure about the way you look, and you see someone walk by who’s overweight, you may think, “Well, at least I’m not as bad as _he_ is,” providing yourself with shallow validation.

Judgment is particularly hard to avoid in parenting. When your children experience things that are shame triggers for you, it’s easy to respond from a place of judgment, passing your insecurities on to your children. For example, if appearance is a trigger from your past, and your daughter said that someone made fun of her for the way she looked, your judgmental reaction may be, “Well, if you just wore your hair back like I told you to, this wouldn’t have happened.”

To practice nonjudgmental understanding:

  * **Say, “Me, too.”** When someone’s in the midst of shame, hearing, “I understand where you’re coming from because I’ve been there, too,” helps alleviate the isolation often associated with shame.
  * **Make eye contact and listen.** Body language often reveals judgment. If you’re not making eye contact or seem disinterested, people may assume you’re disregarding or judging them. Take the time to give all of your energy to the person you’re speaking with. 
  * **Meet others where they _are_ , not where you want them to _be_. **The last thing someone in shame wants to hear is, “Just get over it,” or “It’s not that big of a deal.” Respect their emotional state and work _with_ them to help them out of their shame instead of making them feel even smaller.



##### Empathy Versus Sympathy

**Where empathy is the ability to meet and relate to someone in an emotional place, sympathy is only the ability to _recognize_ when someone’s in an emotional place.** Sympathy amplifies shame because it calls out shame triggers without creating connection, leaving the person in shame feeling isolated.

To understand the difference, consider the following analogy: Your friend is stuck in a hole. Empathy is equivalent to seeing your friend in the hole, getting a ladder, climbing down into the hole, sitting with your friend for a while, then climbing out together. Conversely, sympathy is equivalent to seeing your friend in the hole, calling down, “I’m sorry you’re down there,” then walking away.
