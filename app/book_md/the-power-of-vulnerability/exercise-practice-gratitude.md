## Exercise: Practice Gratitude

Gratitude is one of the most important aspects of wholehearted living. It prevents foreboding joy (a fear of the “other shoe dropping”) and allows you to maintain perspective.

* * *

List three to five things that you’re grateful for in this moment. Explain _why_ you’re grateful for each.

How does this list affect your perspective? (For example, if you’re having a rough day, does this list bring some light into your day? If you’re having a good day, does this elevate it further?)

Who could you share this gratitude with today? List two to four people. (These could be family members, friends, or colleagues.)

What “mundane” moments could you be grateful for today? List several. (For example, having family dinner or going on a walk with a close friend.)
