## Exercise: Rediscover Creativity and Engage in Play

Creativity and play allow you to express your emotions and release your inhibitions.

* * *

What creative activities interest you? List several. (These don’t have to be activities that you’re an expert in. They can be anything creative, from glass blowing to voice lessons.)

With this list in mind, how could you get started on one of these activities in the next month or two? (For example, if you have an interest in painting, is there a local studio or an online class you could sign up for?)

What kind of play do you enjoy? Describe it, then list two to four activities that fit into this kind of play. (This could be any activity that fits the properties of play: time spent without purpose, you don’t want it to end, and it leads to a loss of self-consciousness. This could range from recreational sports to board games.)

With this list in mind, how could you engage in play with your friends and/or family within the next month or two?
