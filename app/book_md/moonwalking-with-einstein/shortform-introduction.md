## Shortform Introduction

_Moonwalking with Einstein_ is part memoir, part pop science. Author Joshua Foer became interested in memory when he tried to find out who the smartest person in the world was. There wasn’t a quantitive answer—some people measure intelligence by IQ, whereas others use scientific or artistic achievement as the benchmark. However, in his search, Josh _did_ come across someone who was, if not the world’s smartest person, at least a strong candidate: Ben Pridmore, the reigning world memory champion.

At the time, Josh was working as a journalist, and as a result of his new interest in memory, he decided to write a piece for _Slate_ magazine on the 2005 US Memory Championship. There, he met mnemonists Tony Buzan, Lukas Amsüss, and Ed Cooke.**All of them told Josh he could learn the same memory techniques the competitors were using—none of them had innate memory talents.** If Josh practiced an hour a day, they said, in a year, he’d be good enough to compete too. Ed offered to coach Josh, and Josh embarked on a year-long experiment to improve his memory.

_Moonwalking with Einstein_ was written in 11 chronological chapters that cover Josh’s year of studying memory and learning memory techniques. This summary rearranges the content into thematic, rather than chronological, parts:

  * Part 1 covers the science and history of memory—what memory is, how it works, how it relates to other mental faculties, and how it’s treated in the educational system.
  * Part 2 covers the memory techniques that Josh learned in order to compete as a mental athlete. Some of these techniques have everyday applications.
  * Part 3 covers some notable characters in the memory community and profiles savants such as Kim Peek (“Rain Man”) and Daniel Tammet (featured in the film _Brainman_).
  * Part 4 describes Josh’s experience training to become a mental athlete and competing in the 2006 US Memory Championship.
