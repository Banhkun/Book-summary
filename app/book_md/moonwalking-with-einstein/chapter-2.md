## Chapter 2: Memory and Other Mental Faculties

Having covered memory as its own entity, we can now consider it in relation to many other intangibles such as expertise, identity, and our perception of time.

### Expertise and Memory

How are memory and expertise related? Let's say you're an expert cab driver—you have a great memory for directions and you never get lost. Which came first—your great memory for directions, which led you to a career driving a cab? Or your career driving a cab, which required you to develop a great memory for directions?

Before we can understand how memory impacts expertise, we need to understand the general process of becoming an expert. K. Anders Ericsson (who studied SF) has been researching memory and expertise for decades. He’s found that **expertise comes from perception and memories, not intuition or reasoning.** When an expert encounters a situation, they don’t have to think consciously or analyze; they simply recognize a pattern they’ve seen before. They know what information matters, what doesn’t, and they instinctively know how to apply it in the most appropriate way.

**Experts do a form of chunking—they use memories that are already in their brains to make associations and connections.** Therefore, you need to have a good memory to be an expert.

##### Example #1: Police Officers

When Ericsson studied police officers, he put them in front of a big screen and showed them multiple scenarios, including one of a man walking towards a school with what might be a bomb strapped to his chest. **The more experienced officers knew what to do without thinking** —they yelled at the man to stop and pulled out their guns. When he didn’t, most of them shot him. The experienced officers didn’t just see a man going towards a school; they noticed everything about him, such as a nervous twitch. They then compared what they observed to what they’d seen before, and acted.

The less experienced officers let the man walk into the school because they didn’t have the context to interpret the man’s actions.

##### Example #2: Chess

Historically, chess has been a test of intellect—you have to be smart to plan moves many turns in advance and predict your opponent’s behavior. However, **when Russian scientists tested chess players’ perception and cognition in the 1920s, the chess players didn’t do any better than the average person.**

Adriaan de Groot also looked at chess players in the 1940s. De Groot set up boards in a way that there was an objectively correct but not clearly visible move. He gave the boards to masters and asked them to think aloud. He learned, to his surprise, that **chess masters don’t analyze the board or plan moves, they just instinctively see the ideal move right away, usually within five seconds.**

Further studies of master chess players, such as where they focus their eyes on the board or what parts of the brain they use, revealed that they chunk the board. To make moves, masters recognized configurations that they’d seen before and knew the outcomes of. Researchers concluded that **the best indicator of skill at chess is your ability to memorize board positions, not your intelligence.**

However, **while masters were good at memorizing boards, they weren’t better than anyone else at general memorization.** In fact, when given chess boards that were just random arrangements of pieces in locations that could never happen in a real game, they weren’t even good at memorizing those. This is because a random arrangement of pieces on a board doesn’t have any context—a player never would have seen an impossible-to-arrive-at arrangement before.

#### Skill Acquisition, Plateaus, and Practice

Ericsson has studied experts in different fields and discovered some commonalities between them.

##### Stages of Skill Acquisition

There are three stages of skill acquisition:

  1. **Learning.** In this stage, you’re experimenting and learning what’s most efficient.
  2. **Streamlining.** In this stage, you’ve got a handle on the activity. You’re making fewer mistakes and learning faster.
  3. **Autopiloting.** In this stage, you’re proficient at the skill and you don’t have to concentrate to do it anymore. Once you hit this stage, it’s actually possible to see the change in your brain in an fMRI scan—the parts of your brain that you use for consciously reasoning don’t light up as much.



##### Plateaus

It takes conscious effort to improve, so once you reach the autopiloting stage, you’ll plateau. Psychologists used to think that plateaus were inherent human limitations, but they’re usually not.**To improve at something, we have to practice attentively and bring ourselves back to the first stage of skill acquisition.** There are four ways to stay out of the autopiloting stage:

  1. Concentrate on technique.
     * For example, high-level musicians practice exercises and work on the hardest parts of pieces, rather than the easier parts.
  2. Focus on goals.
  3. Solicit feedback.
  4. Practice failing.
     * For example, if you want to improve your typing speed, it’s helpful to make yourself type faster than your usual pace and allow mistakes. Once you’ve figured out why you’re making mistakes, you can fix them.



**The human race as a whole hasn’t hit any plateaus.** Every Olympics, people beat existing records. Students in high school learn math that ancient philosophers spent thirty years studying. This might partly have to do with improvements in technology such as better equipment, but it probably has more to do with improvements to training methods.

**Barriers tend to be psychological** —for example, until Roger Bannister broke the four-minute mile, no one thought it was possible. Then, only six weeks later, John Landy beat it too. These days, the four-minute is simply an expectation if you want to be a professional middle-distance runner.

##### Practice

Studies have found that how long you’ve spent doing something isn’t a great indicator of how good you’ll be at it. (However, it usually takes at least 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert.) **Your practice method is more important than how long you spend doing it.**

**Even if you’re already an expert, if you don’t practice deliberately, you can actually get worse.** For example, mammographers don’t tend to get any better at their jobs as time goes on. This is because mammographers don’t get any feedback—if they miss a tumor, they won’t find out until much later, when they’ve probably forgotten the details of that particular mammogram. They can overcome this by evaluating old images that have a known outcome to test their skills.

### Identity and Memory

What does memory have to do with our identities? Historically, memory was a measure of character and virtue. Memorizing things helped you absorb them. For example, memorizing an oral poem about ethics was a way of internalizing ethics, so that any time a situation came up, you knew how to respond appropriately and morally. **Memorization was meant to be humanizing.**

In modern times, we can learn about ethics and morals in ways other than memorizing. However, memory is still related to who we are. Your memory is a record of what’s happened to you over your life and influences how you make new memories in the future. **To create a new memory, you link your current perceptions to what’s already in the web in your head—everything you encounter is influenced by everything you’ve already encountered.**

### Time and Memory

Our perception of the passing of time is influenced by our memories because we remember events in relation to other events. For example, you might remember you broke your arm the summer after 2nd grade, or you got married a month after Obama got elected. **The thicker your web of memories, the longer your life will feel.** You can thicken the web by making new memories by doing exciting, memorable, novel things.

The opposite is also true—**the more your life is caught up in routine, the faster it feels like it passes.** Have you ever had the feeling that a year’s gone by and you don’t know how it happened? This is because you weren’t making very many memories. Boredom compresses time.

(Shortform note: To learn more about how to expand time by creating defining moments in your everyday life, read our summary of The Power of Moments.)

#### Studying Time

Chronobiologist Michel Siffre wanted to find out what happens to humans when they have no way to measure time. He lived in an underground cave alone for two months with no access to a clock, calendar, or the sun. There was little to do and no one to speak with, so nothing interesting happened and he made few memories. **Siffre became amnesic and after the two months of the experiment, he thought only one month had passed.**

Writer William James also commented on the connection between memory and time. **Your life seems to go faster as you age because you aren’t doing as many memorable things.** When you’re a child learning about the world, you’re constantly encountering things you’ve never seen before. As an adult, you have to work to find things you haven’t seen before.
