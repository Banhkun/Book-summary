## Exercise: Memorize Words Using the Methodical Method

Words are easiest to memorize when you transform them into images.

* * *

Consider the sentence, “I like cake.” You could transform this sentence into an image by picturing an eye (“I”) riding a bike (“like” rhymes with “bike”) towards a giant piece of cake. How else could you picture it?

How could you change “How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child!” (Shakespeare) into an image?

How could you change the phrase “O Thou bright jewel in my aim I strive” (Phillis Wheatley) into an image?

How could you change the phrase “Our home and native land” (Canadian national anthem) into an image?

Write all four of the lines you just memorized in the box below.
