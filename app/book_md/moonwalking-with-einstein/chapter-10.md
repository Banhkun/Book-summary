## Chapter 10: Mnemonists

Throughout the author’s year-long exploration of memory, mental athletes were constantly telling him that **anyone can learn memory techniques. Unlike savants, there’s nothing unusual about the brains of mnemonists.**

However, mnemonists do tend to belong to a particular subculture. They dress unusually, enjoy juggling, often don’t have impressive day jobs, and many of them are male, young, and white.

### World-Class Mnemonists

The best mnemonists compete internationally. Here are some notables:

#### Tony Buzan

Tony Buzan is one of the most notable figures in the memory world, and other mnemonists have mixed feelings about him. Half of them think Buzan is a genius whose methods will transform the educational system, and the other half think he’s an unscientific moneymaker.

When Buzan was a child, his best friend Barry was put in the “dunces’ class” while Buzan was in the most advanced classes. However, Barry was very good with nature and animals—he could identify everything. **Buzan realized that there was something wrong with the system—if the school thought Barry wasn’t smart when he clearly was, the system must be misdefining intelligence.**

Buzan’s second ah-ha moment was in his first university class. Whenever his instructor took attendance and someone was missing, the instructor would call out their address, phone number, birthday, and parents’ names. Buzan asked the instructor how he’d done this. The instructor refused to tell him for a long time, but one day he explained the Major System to the entire class.

**Buzan again realized the failings of the educational system—the Major System was a game-changer, and no one had ever taught it to him until now.** He was sure there were other important things he’d missed. He couldn’t find a book about how to best operate your brain—and there still isn’t one—but he did find the _Ad Herennium_.

Buzan learned memory techniques and then worked as a substitute teacher and taught them to students. **He came up with a particular method of note-taking called a Mind Map, which is a bit of an on-paper memory palace.** A Mind Map involves drawing lines between main and subsidiary points and using lines, color, and images to connect things. Scientists at the University of London studied Mind Maps and found that they resulted in about a 10% increase in retention than mainstream note-taking techniques.

Buzan now makes his living selling books about memory. He’s been more successful selling books than he has getting his techniques into the curriculum.

Buzan started the World Memory Championship in 1991.

#### Ed Cooke

Ed Cooke is a British mental athlete and a grand master of memory. (To be a grand master, you have to be able to memorize 1,000 random digits in less than an hour, the order of ten shuffled decks of cards in less than an hour, and the order of one deck in less than two minutes.)

Ed was the author’s memory technique coach. He finished in eleventh at the 2005 World Memory Championship after flubbing the speed card event.

#### Ben Pridmore

Ben Pridmore competes internationally in the memory competitions. Interestingly, he didn’t learn about the existence of memory techniques until he went to his first World Memory Championship. Up until then, he’d been using rote memorization. After learning techniques, he won the World Memory Championship in 2004.

In 2005, Pridmore planned to beat a world record by memorizing the first 50,000 digits of pi. However, an obscure Japanese mnemonist beat him to it by memorizing 83,431. It took Ben six months to clear pi out of his memory palaces.

#### Lukas Amsüss

Lukas is an Austrian mnemonist and has achieved the rank of grand master of memory. He and Ed co-founded a society of memorizers called the KL7. KL stands for “Knights of Learning” and the 7 represents the original seven members. Lukas and Ed also have plans to start the Oxford Mind Academy, which is like a gym for brains, with Ed and Lukas acting as personal trainers.

#### Dr. Gunther Karsten

Gunther Karsten is another international mental athlete. He’s won all of Germany’s national contests since 1998. He wears earmuffs and sunglasses with tape covering most of the lenses to ward off distractions.

#### Corinna Draschl

Corinna Draschl is an Austrian mnemonist. She competed in the World Memory Championship at 15 and won the poetry memorizing event. She uses the emotional method.

#### Clemens Mayer

Clemens Mayer is an eighteen-year-old law student from Bavaria and one of Gunther’s students. He won the World Memory Championship in 2005.

### Attendees at the 2006 US Memory Championship

After a year of training, the author competed in the 2006 US Memory Championship. These are some of the people he encountered:

  * **Scott Hagwood** won the US Memory Championship four times. He’s a member of the KL7 and was a play-by-play analyst at the 2006 US Memory Championship. He uses luxury homes in magazines as his memory palaces.
  * **Tony Dottino** founded the US Memory Championship in 1997. He was the host of the 2006 US Memory Championship.
  * **Ram Kolli** won the 2005 US Memory Championship and came second in the 2006 US Memory Championship. His weakness is cards.
  * **Maurice Stoll** was a finalist in the 2006 US Memory Championship. His specialty is speed numbers and he’s one of the few Americans to have ever competed in an international memory competition.
  * **Paul Mellor** was a finalist in the 2006 US Memory Championship. He’s a marathon runner and teaches police officers a practical application of the memory arts—how to memorize license plate numbers.
  * **Erin Luley** was a finalist in the 2006 US Memory Championship. She’s a 17-year-old swimmer.
  * **Chester Santos** competed in the 2006 Memory Championship. The author doesn’t think Chester liked him because of how he’d written about the competition the year before (making the US competitors sound like slackers and amateurs)
