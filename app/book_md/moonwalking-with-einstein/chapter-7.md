## Chapter 7: Memorizing Words

In Chapter 6, we learned the fundamental memory technique of the method of loci, which involves creating images to later place in a memory palace. Chapter 7 covers how to transform words into such images.

Our brains aren’t very good at perfect recall because it’s evolutionarily ineffective. The brain uses 20% of the oxygen we breathe and 25% of our glucose even though it only comprises 2% of our body mass. **Our brains tend to drop words because the actual words aren’t important—it’s the meaning behind them that matters.**

For example, in the Watergate hearings, John Dean reported conversations word-for-word. When compared to a tape recording of the actual conversations (Dean didn’t know about the existence of the recorder), there were discrepancies. Dean didn’t get the quotes word-for-word and sometimes he didn’t even get the content right. Overall, though, he remembered the gist of things correctly.

There were two historical approaches to memorizing a speech or text:

  * _Memoria rerum,_ which is remembering the meaning of the words. This was the preferred method.
    * For example, Cicero suggested a speechwriter creating a single image for each topic.
  * _Memoria verborum_ , which is remembering a text word-for-word. This method has some downsides:
    * Inefficiency. If you remember everything word-for-word, you have to create and place many images.
    * Instability. If you needed to know every word in order, if you forgot a word somewhere in the middle, you wouldn’t be able to get any further.
    * (Note: Carruthers, author of _The Book of Memory_ , thinks that this approach was only ever meant to be used for single words or phrases, not long texts.)



### Word-for-Word Memorization

While memorizing meaning is likely more relevant in your daily life than remembering exact wording, there are cases in which you might need to memorize word-for-word. There are two methods: the methodical method, and the emotional method.

#### The Methodical Method

The _Ad Herennium_ recommends memorizing poetry word-for-word by repeating a line a couple of times and then trying to transform it into images. How do you transform a word like “and” into an image? There are a few options:

  * **Create a visual dictionary.** Assign images to abstract words, and then whenever you come across the word, you have an instant substitution.
  * **Punning.** It’s going to be easier to remember which images correspond to which words if you connect them somehow. One way to do this is punning, which is when you use a similar-sounding word in place of the actual word.
    * For example, Gunther, a German memorizer, visualizes the word “and” as a circle, because “and” rhymes with “rund,” which means round in German.
  * **_Memoria sillabarum._** At its most extreme, you can assign images to syllables and then break words into syllables. Choose a concrete word that starts with the syllable as an image. This creates a sort of rebus puzzle.
    * For example, mathematician and theologian Thomas Bradwardine assigned the image of an abbot to the syllable “ab-” and a crossbowman (_balistarius_) to the syllable “ba-.” To remember Abba, he could picture a crossbowman shooting an abbot.



This method tends to be more popular with men.

#### The Emotional Method

The emotional method is similar to Method acting. **First, you break the text into chunks (or “beats”) and then you assign an emotion to each section.** This allows you to retain the meaning of the text (unlike the shot abbot above), which allows you to create additional anchors to already existing memories.

Studies have shown that **if you do an action related to a phrase you’re memorizing, you’re more likely to remember it.** For example, if you’re trying to remember “Stir the soup,” you'll remember it better if you actually stir soup while memorizing the line.

This method is more popular with women.
