## Part 1: The Science of Memory | Chapter 1: What Is Memory?

Part 1 (Chapters 1-5) covers Josh’s research on memory, including science, history, and culture. Chapter 1 explains what memory is from a scientific perspective.

**Our brains are made up of a web of neurons, and physiologically, a memory is an arrangement of connections between neurons.** Whenever you think or encounter a sensation, this alters the connections. For example, thinking of the word “chocolate” might also make you think about the taste of sweetness, the color brown, and Valentine’s Day.

However, science doesn’t know yet how cells actually “contain” a memory. No one has seen a memory. Scientists have a good idea of what happens between and inside brain cells, and they can look at which parts of the brain light up when people are thinking, but they don’t know that much about thought and memory themselves.

What science does know is that **we only consciously remember things when cued.** Because our brains are a web rather than a straight pathway, we can’t search our brains in any linear way. **We remember something when we think about something else that’s connected to it in the web of associations.** For example, if you met someone whose name you’ve forgotten, you might have to think about what the person did for a living or where you met them in order to cue the memory you’re actually looking for.

Additionally, **“memory” isn’t a single entity—it’s many different systems and facets.** Some people have good memories for names and faces, while others are better at numbers.

### Parts of the Brain

The study of memory necessitates the study of the brain. Memories are created in, stored in, and affected by different parts of the brain:

  * **Neocortex.** This is the brain’s wrinkly-looking outer layer. It stores memories.
  * **Hippocampus.** This is involved in converting our perceptions into long-term memories. The right posterior section is involved in spatial navigation, which, as we’ll see, is an important aspect of memory.
  * **Medial temporal lobe.** This contains the hippocampus and is involved with long-term memory.
  * **Basil ganglia.** This is involved in learning habits.
  * **Cerebellum.** This is involved in learning motor skills.
  * **Frontal and parietal cortices.** These are involved with recalling long-term memories.



**When we use our brains, they physically change—we can form new neurons and rearrange connections.** This is known as neuroplasticity. For example, neuroscientist Eleanor Maguire studied the brains of London cabbies-in-training. She found that their right posterior hippocampi (responsible for spatial navigation) were 7% larger than the average person’s because they spent so much time memorizing the layout of the city.

### Types of Memory

There are several different classifications and types of memory, some related to specific parts of the brain.

#### Declarative vs. Nondeclartive Memories

There are two different types of individual memories:

  * **Declarative.** Declarative memories are conscious memories—things you know you know, such as what your name is. The hippocampus is involved in forming these types of memories. They’re further divided into two categories:
    * **Episodic.** Episodic memories are memories of life experiences and are anchored in a when and where. For example, you remember that you ate spaghetti for dinner yesterday.
    * **Semantic.** Semantic memories are memories of concepts and facts. They aren’t associated with a place or time. For example, you remember that dinner is the third meal of the day.
    * Episodic and semantic memories both require the hippocampus and medial temporal lobes, but they also depend on different parts of the brain and different neural pathways.
  * **Nondeclarative.** Nondeclarative memories are unconscious memories. They’re formed using the neocortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. These memories have a lot to do with what people think of as our sense of self—how we think, who we are.
    * For example, it takes a lot of brainpower to ride a bike—you have to balance, avoid objects, and so on, but you don’t have to consciously think about any of this after you’ve learned.



#### Working vs. Long-Term Memory

The brain uses at least two different systems to store memories:

  * **Working memory.** Your working memory keeps track of whatever’s currently the focus of your consciousness. It acts as a filter between your experiences of the world and your memory of it. Only if the brain deems something relevant will it be stored more permanently. **Your working memory can only hold on to five to nine different things at once.**
    * Think of your working memory like the CPU of your computer. It stores whatever your computer is working on at the moment, and only for as long as you need it.
    * For example, if there’s a pigeon on the sidewalk, you only need to remember its existence long enough to walk around it.
  * **Long-term memory.** The long-term memory stores things you need to remember for longer than a few moments.
    * Think of your long-term memory like the hard drive of your computer. It stores things for a much longer period of time, up to a lifetime.
    * For example, your birthday is something you’re going to need to remember every year, so it’s stored in long-term memory.



**Scientists think that sleep is important for consolidating our memories.** For example, in experiments with rats, scientists look at rats’ brains while they’re awake learning to run a maze and then while they’re asleep. Asleep, their neurons are firing in the same patterns they did while learning the maze. **Dreams could be part of the process of creating long-term memories.**

#### Internal vs. External Memories

Memory exists outside of our brains, too. There are two different ways to store memories:

  * **Internally.** Internal memories consist of the information individuals keep in their heads.
  * **Externally.** External**** memories consist of memory aids such as books, calendars, phone books, and so on. External memory transcends our own lifetimes and allows us to share information in our memories with others. In modern times, people tend to rely on external memories rather than internal ones.
    * An extreme version of an external memory is called lifelogging, in which you externally keep track of everything that happens to you. Lifelogger Gordon Bell wears a camera around his neck, records all his speech, and scans every piece of paper he reads. He stores the information on a hard drive and adds about a gigabyte per month.



An external memory can’t yet completely replace an internal one. Gordon Bell **can’t search for anything in his external memory without a cue—a search term—from his internal memory.** For example, one day, Bell wanted to find a website he’d visited. The only thing he could remember was that at the time he’d been on the website, he was also talking to a realtor on the phone. In his external memory, he could look up the time of the phone call and then look up what else he was doing at the time.

**In the future, it may be possible to seamlessly connect our internal and external memories.** Neuroprosthetics that allow direct communication between the brain and a machine already exist. For example, there’s a type of cochlear implant that transforms sound waves into electrical impulses. These impulses are then sent to the brain stem. This allows deaf people to hear.

### The Strengths of the Human Memory

When it comes to memory, the brain has three particular strengths. The first is remembering visual and spatial information. When the human memory evolved, the most important things to remember were what vegetation was edible and the routes between food and home. We didn’t need to remember things like shopping lists of historical trivia because they didn’t help us stay alive.**As a result, by nature, the human brain is good at remembering images and places** (like those of food and home).

Example #1: The two-alternative picture recognition exam. In this test, a subject is shown several images, each for less than half a second. Then, after waiting half an hour to allow some forgetting, **the subject is again shown each image, paired with another image that the subject hasn’t seen before. Almost everyone can remember which images they’ve seen.** Even if the alternate images are very similar (for example, both are bells but with different sized handles), the brain is good at recognizing the one it’s seen before.

Example #2: The Baker/baker paradox. In this test, a researcher shows two different subjects the same person. The researcher tells one subject that the person is a baker and the other that the person’s surname is Baker. Two days later, the researcher asks both subjects for the word associated with the person. **The subject who was told to remember “baker” is more likely to remember her word than the subject who was given the name “Baker.” This is because the profession of a baker has more associations with other information in the network of our brains.** We know that bakers wear tall hats, make cookies, smell like dough, and so on. Even if you can’t remember the word “baker” specifically, you might get the impression of something baker-associated, like bread, when you look at the person. The surname Baker, however, has no existing associations except the image of the person.

Example #3: **Synesthetes (people whose brains process information using more than one sense) tend to have good memories because their brains automatically attach an image or feeling to abstract concepts.** For example, S, a subject in a study by neuropsychologist A.R. Luria, saw words as colors and numbers as people. Whenever S encountered the number 7, he saw a mustached man in his mind.

**Secondly, the brain is also good at remembering things that have some sort of structure, such as rhythm, rhyme, alliteration, and music.** For example, you’re more likely to remember a crusty crab making a grab than a crustacean reaching out.

Thirdly, **the brain is also good at remembering things it finds interesting, such as humor and sex.**

### Can We Improve Our Memories?

If our brains are naturally good at remembering certain things and naturally bad at remembering others, is there anything we can do to improve our memories? Is memory like vision or height—you’re stuck with what you’ve got—or more like a skill you can improve? For a long time, scientists thought our memory abilities were fixed, but in a study that took place from 1981-1983, K. Anders Ericsson and Bill Chase found that**people can train and improve their memories.**

Ericsson and Chase tested the memory of SF. **SF took digit span tests, which measure a person’s ability to hold numbers in their working memory,** for 250 hours over two years. In the test, someone reads out a new number every second and the test subject must remember the sequence.

**Initially, SF, like most people, could only remember about seven digits.** He remembered them by chanting them over and over to himself, which is called a phonological loop.

Then, however, he came up with a new method. **SF was a runner, so he started thinking of the random digits as running times.** For example, 4, 1, 1, 9 became 4 minutes and 11.9 seconds, the time it might take him to run a mile. Using this method, **by the end of the testing, SF could remember over 70 digits.** (There’s more on this technique, called chunking, in part 2.)

### Photographic and Eidetic Memory

Most people have probably heard of a “photographic memory,” which is the ability to take a mental snapshot of something detailed, such as a page of a book, and recall it in perfect detail. How does that work, considering everything we’ve learned about the memory so far?

**It probably doesn’t work—there’s no scientific evidence to back up the existence of a photographic memory.** Only one case of a photographic memory was ever recorded in scientific literature, and the research has some holes in it. A Harvard student named Elizabeth could allegedly look at a pattern of random dots with her right eye, then a different pattern with her left eye, and then mentally layer the dots on top of each other, which formed an image where the dots overlapped (similar to a “Magic Eye” stereogram). However, the validity of these test results was called into question when the scientist who studied her, Charles Stromeyer III, married her and she was never tested again.

John Merritt, another researcher, tried to duplicate the study with others. He published the two-dot test in newspapers and magazines, hoping he’d find someone who could do the same thing Elizabeth had. People responded, but once in a lab, none of them could do it.

**Eidetic memories, however, are real.** People who have eidetic memories can remember images longer than the average person, but not in more detail than the average person.
