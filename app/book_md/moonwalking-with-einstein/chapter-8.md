## Chapter 8: Memorizing Numbers and Cards

Chapter 7 covered how to transform words into images. Chapter 8 covers how to transform numbers and the order of decks of cards into images.

### Memorizing Numbers

There are several, ever-evolving systems for memorizing numbers. (Techniques are always evolving because mental athletes push the sport to new levels at every competition.) This summary will discuss two methods: the Major System and PAO. **The Major System is useful for things like phone numbers and credit cards, but to do the kind of heavy lifting required for international memory competitions, you’ll need to use PAO.**

#### Major System

The “Major System” was invented by Johann Winkelmann and is **a code for translating numbers into words, and then into images.** Here are the steps:

  * **Learn the code.** Each number has a letter or choice of two letters assigned to it:
    * 0=S
    * 1=T/D
    * 2=N
    * 3=M
    * 4=R
    * 5=L
    * 6=Sh/Ch
    * 7=K/G
    * 8=F/V
    * 9=P/B
  * **Transform numbers into sounds.**
    * Example #1: 05=SL.
    * Example #2: 3928=MPNV
  * **Transform the sounds into words**. You can add as many vowels as you need for sense, and you can transform multi-digit numbers into multiple words.
    * Example #1: SL becomes “sail.”
    * Example #2: MPNV becomes “map Nevada.”
  * **Transform the words into images.**
    * Example #1: The word “sail” becomes an image of a brightly colored spinnaker sail.
    * Example #2: “Map Nevada” becomes an image of a map of Nevada.
  * **Put the images into a memory palace.**



#### PAO (person-action-object)

In the PAO system, instead of assigning letters to single-digit numbers, you **assign an image of a person acting on an object to every two-digit number.** This system generates some bizarre (and therefore memorable) images. Here are the steps:

  * **Come up with an image of a person acting on an object for every whole number between 00 and 99.** You can use whatever images are memorable to you, though mnemonists suggest not including your family members if your actions are especially lewd, because you’ll have to picture the images.
    * Example #1: 45 is Tiger Woods putting a golf ball.
    * Example #2: 78 is Brittney Spears singing into a microphone.
    * Example #3: 89 is the queen of England scratching her armpit.
  * **Chunk long numbers into six-digit groups.**
    * For example, if you had to memorize a 12-digit number such as 457889897845, you’d break it into two groups, 457889 and 897845.
  * **Combine the person from the first two digits with the action from the second two digits and the object from the last two digits.**
    * For example, 457889 is Tiger Woods (45’s person) singing (78’s action) into an armpit (89’s object); 894578 is the queen of England putting a microphone. Instead of remembering the 12 digits, all you have to remember is the two images. 
  * **Place each image in your memory palace.** The best mnemonists place multiple images in a single location.
    * For example, together in the shower, Tiger Woods might be singing into an armpit and the queen might be putting her microphone.



While you have to come up with a person, action, and object for a lot of numbers, once you have the images memorized, you have a built-in system for creating an image for any number between 0 and 999,999.

##### Advanced Number Memorization

**The more advanced version of PAO is to come up with a person, action, and object for every _three-_ digit __ number** between 000 and 999, which allows you to generate unique images for every number between 0 and 999,999,999.

Another advanced version of PAO applies specifically to binary digits. **When memorizing binary digits, give each chunk of digits their own image.** For example, mental athlete Ben Pridmore assigned the image of a card game to 1101001001. He’s come up with 1,024 images, one for every ten-digit combination. Using this technique, Ben was able to set a world record for learning 3,705 binary digits in 30 minutes.

### Memorizing Cards

Memorizing decks of cards works similarly to the PAO system for numbers. You **assign each card an image of a person, place, and object, and then create an image that represents three cards.** Here are the steps:

  * **Come up with an image of a person acting on an object for every card.**
    * Example #1: the six of clubs is Albert Einstein writing on a blackboard.
    * Example #2: the queen of diamonds is Michael Jackson moonwalking on grass.
    * Example #3: the five of hearts is Scooby-Doo defecating on a criminal.
  * **Combine the person from the first card with the action of the second and the object of the third.**
    * For example, the three-card sequence of the six of clubs, queen of diamonds, and five of hearts would result in an image of Einstein moonwalking on a criminal.
  * **Place the images in your memory palace.** A deck of 52 cards will produce 18 images.



If you find you’re mixing up cards, **you can change your images, but the original will live in your memory somewhere.** This old image could potentially reappear in a competition and confuse you, so think carefully before changing images.

##### Advanced Card Memorization

Some mnemonists, including the author, use an advanced version of this system in which they **create a person-action-object image for every possible combination of _two_ cards**. This allows them to compress 52 cards into nine unique images.

If you’re competing in speed card events, there are a couple additional things to keep in mind:

  * Practice flipping cards quickly, or two cards at once, to shave seconds off your time.
  * When you’re speed-memorizing, you don’t have time to create a vivid, richly detailed image. Before the competition, spend time with each of your images and imagine the people’s character in detail. Imagine them being in your house and doing daily activities so you get used to them in any context. Then, on competition day, you’ll be able to recall an image from just a detail.
