## Exercise: Create Memorable Images

Our brains are naturally good at remembering images. Transform information into visuals in order to remember it better.

* * *

Write down the first three items on your to-do lists. (If you don't currently have a to-do list, you can use this example: 1) buy milk, 2) make a dentist appointment, 3) bake a cake.)

How would you transform the first to-do on your list into an image? Remember that the image will be more memorable if itâ€™s multisensory, funny, lewd, novel, concrete, and personal.

How would you transform the second item into an image?

How would you transform the third?

Now, picture all three images. What original piece of information does each correspond to?
