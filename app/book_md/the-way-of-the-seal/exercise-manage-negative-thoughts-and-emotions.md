## Exercise: Manage Negative Thoughts and Emotions

Divine recommends managing your unhelpful thoughts and emotions to bolster your mental fortitude and achieve your goals as a business leader.

* * *

Reflect on a time that a negative thought or emotion entered your mind and interfered with your ability to focus on a goal you wanted to achieve. What was the feeling or thought, and how did it get in the way?

Divine recommends that you respond to your negative self-talk with positive, action-oriented language. For example, if you fail a test and say to yourself, “I can’t believe I didn’t pass that test—I’m so stupid!” you could reframe it by brainstorming a new study strategy. How could you respond to your negative thought by reframing it with positive language?

Divine says controlling your response to stress through deep breathing allows you to process information clearly. How can you remember to try a breathing strategy next time you feel stressed?
