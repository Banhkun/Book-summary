## Perfection and Making Mistakes

Here’s the attitude to adopt: **You will NEVER binge again. Remove the possibility of failure from your mind.** Do not think, “I’ll try”—think “I will.” This is the only attitude that succeeds with impulse control.

Stick to the food plan to perfection. Don’t give yourself 90% leeway—multiplied over days, this exponentially decreases the effectiveness until you’re back to 0. **Just like a drop of sewage ruins a bottle of champagne, don’t eat even one spoonful off your food plan.** This counts as binging. The only way to maintain 100% is to stay at 100% every day.

Consider marriage vows. Does anyone say, “There’s a 90% chance I’ll stay committed to you, but there are a lot of attractive people out there, so no guarantees!” No—the only good commitment is a 100% commitment.

### Making Mistakes

But—if you fail, don’t be ashamed. Forgive yourself.

**Treat yourself like a child who’s genuinely trying to accomplish something important.** If your 5 year old daughter wants to learn to ride a bike but falls off, would you say, “OK, this is a sign that it’ll never work. You should never even try again, it’s just hopeless.“

Don’t make yourself feel weak for making a mistake. It takes strength to get back up again. The weak give up entirely after a mistake, and that’s what the Pig wants you to do.

Picking yourself back up again is exercising your strength. Pause and reflect on what went wrong.

  * Your Pig will want you to avoid reflection because it gets the chance to Binge again. Do not use guilt avoidance as an excuse.
  * Remember the depth of your commitment before you binged. You took a serious oath to commit to your food plan. You must take a mistake seriously to figure out what went wrong.



**The simple way to never binge again is to never binge again.**

How do you resolve the paradox of believing in perfection before a binge, while recognizing after a binge that you’re fallible and can make mistakes?

  * To believe otherwise is to invite the slightest opening for the Pig, and the Pig will take a mile.
  * After each binge, you should believe that you’re ready to renew your vows again and dedicated to never binge again. 
  * No matter how many times it takes, you must continue to believe that you will Never binge again. Over time you will get stronger, better at hearing Pig Squeals, and have weaker cravings. 



Binges occur most often because you failed to hear the Pig’s Squeal, not a problem with the food plan. So reflect carefully before thinking about changing the plan.

#### Pig Squeals on Mistakes

> _Pig Squeal:_ Well, you’ve violated one food rule, so what’s the point of following the others? It’s either 100% or 0%. Give in now, and you’ll do better tomorrow.
> 
> Response: **If you fail by 1%, don’t take it as an excuse to fail by 100%.** If you take a bite of a Never food, does it make sense to go out and buy a box of donuts and a pound of chocolate bars, and go to town?
> 
> If you jaywalk and violate a law, does it make sense for you to then steal a car, because if you’ve broken one law you might as well break them all? Of course not.
> 
> If an Olympic archer misses the bullseye once, this is no excuse to shoot the rest of her arrows off-target.
> 
> Catching Binges earlier and doing a lot less damage has material benefits.

> _Pig Squeal_ : Dwell on your guilt! You should feel terrible about yourself for days, weeks! This will make up for your binge. This way you know that if you binge in the future, you’ll be able to make up for it by feeling guilty!
> 
> Response: The only purpose of feeling guilt is to recognize the mistake and improve for the future. There’s no use dwelling on guilt after that point.
> 
> If you burn yourself on a hot stove, **do you walk around for a month beating yourself up afterward**?
> 
> Do not use feeling extra guilty as an excuse to binge the next time, as though you’ve “paid off your debt.”
> 
> Do not make guilt feel like the payment for a binge. This will make it easier to binge next time, knowing you’ll make up for it with guilt.

> _Pig Squeal_ : Don’t feel any guilt! Don’t even think about your mistake. Just forget your food plan, because you’ll always fail at some point, and then you’ll just feel guilty again!
> 
> Response: Guilt is a natural healthy response to bad behavior, so you can correct it. You should not eradicate it entirely. Treat your vow to follow your food plan as serious. Breaking it is serious and requires reflection.

> _Pig Squeal_ : Look at your failure. You’re weak! How many times are you going to do this before you accept it’s impossible? 100% perfection is lunacy. It’s only a matter of time before I get out again.
> 
> Response: A weak person gives in and gives up, but I will keep renewing my vow to forever lock the Pig in its cage.
> 
> As long as I stay 100% committed to dominating the Pig, I will make steady progress until I beat it into submission.
> 
> I have full control over my behavior. Therefore I always have 100% ability to keep the Pig caged. If I can Never Binge Now, I will Never Binge Again at any point in the future.

> _Pig Squeal:_ Just taking one spoonful off isn’t a Binge. This is too strict! One spoonful never hurt anyone.
> 
> Response: A Food Plan is 100% clear on what’s allowable and not. Deviating from this invites fuzziness, and fuzziness invites the Pig to take a mile.

### Adjusting the Food Plan

Here’s when adjusting the Food Plan makes sense:

  * If you feel your Food Plan is too strict to meet your nutritional or happiness needs.
  * When you get new information about how to eat to better meet your goals.
  * When you better differentiate your pleasures from the Pig’s toxic impulses.



But changing the Food Plan requires a series of thoughtful steps, much like amending the US Constitution requires a drawn-out process, for good reason. **Don’t change your plan day to day without major thought and commitment—otherwise the Pig might be writing your plan.**

Here are steps to take:

  * If you’ve binged, let the binged food pass through your system so you’re not under its influence. Do not let instant gratification change how you’ll behave in the future. In the meantime, follow your previous Food Plan.
  * Make a copy of your previous Food Plan and date it. You might revert to this plan later.
  * Propose new changes to your plan on paper. **Articulate specific reasons for each one.**
    * Any Conditional that you repeatedly binge on might be better off as a Never
  * Review your previous food plans. Were any of them better? Did the Pig convince you to abandon a perfectly good plan?
  * Make sure the new rules are still 100% clear and unambiguous. Don’t allow the Pig any vagueness.
  * After a serious analysis, forgive yourself, and make a 100% confident, renewed commitment to perfectly follow your Food Plan forever.
