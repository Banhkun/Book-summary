## More Pig Squeals

## More Pig Squeals

The Pig complains a lot to get you to binge again. It provokes thoughts, feelings, or impulses to revert to your bad habits.

**Since you’ve committed NEVER to binge again, any squeal _must_ be coming from the Pig.**

Hard squeals to recognize, and how to deal with them:

_Just a Little Bit Pig Squeals_

  * You’re getting really good at this, so I can’t do much harm anymore. Let me out so we can binge safely just a little, then lock me up whenever you feel like it. 
  * You’ve been doing so well for a month! You deserve a binge!
  * You can binge once out of every ten meals. It won’t kill you! It’ll make it so much easier!
  * Just this one last time...please?! We’ll start again tomorrow!



Response:

  * **Give the Pig an inch and it will take a mile, and you know it.** Binging even once makes it so much easier to fall downhill all the way back to where you started.
  * You need to aim for 100% perfection on your food plan at all times.
  * There is no need for Cheat days. This implies breaking the rules, and you don’t want to give yourself ANY lenience. If you must, make it a Conditional.
  * This is worth 100% completion on. If you were constructing a building, you wouldn’t knock down a floor after you built two, would you?



> _Pig Squeal:_ You should be grateful for what you have. Wanting things is the enemy of happiness!
> 
> Response: It’s true that I should be grateful to be content. But this doesn’t mean that I shouldn’t have any goals. Otherwise, there would be no learning or growth whatsoever. I can balance gratitude with ambition.

> _Pig Squeal:_ You can exercise it off later today. Or maybe you already exercised, and so you deserve a little binge.
> 
> Response: It doesn’t matter how much exercise you did. The plan is the plan, a binge is a binge. Nothing justifies breaking the food plan.

> _Pig Squeal:_ I’m not an idiot. I’m in your brain, so I’m just as smart as you are. You need to listen to my intelligent arguments for Binging!
> 
> Response: You must treat the Pig like an idiot. It uses your intelligence for destructive purposes only. It is NOT thinking for the best of you.
> 
> (Shortform note: consider treating the Pig like it’s a sociopath whose only goal is to manipulate you to do what it wants. You don’t want to be made the better of, do you?)

> _Pig Squeal:_ I might not get you now, but I’ll get you later! You’ll slip up at some time, like Thanksgiving, or Tom’s birthday party, or when your boss yells at you!
> 
> Response: The easy way to never binge again is to never binge now—at all times.
> 
> The difference between that attitude and the “one day at a time” attitude is that the latter implies powerlessness—“all I can control is today.” The former is power: “I Never Binge Now therefore I will Never Binge Again.”

### Pig Squeal Journal

Because your Pig doesn’t need to be rationalized with, you don’t have to keep a Pig Squeal Journal. If you recognize the Squeal, you can just ignore it.

But writing down Pig Squeals might make you better at detecting them. A simple way to do this is to let the Pig take control of your fingers and type its reasons for eating in the morning, or when you crave something.

Eventually you’ll realize all Pig Squeals boil down to “it tastes good” or “I want the Food High”—at this point, the Pig Squeals will become less frequent.
