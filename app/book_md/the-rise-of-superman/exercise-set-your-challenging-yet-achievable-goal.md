## Exercise: Set Your Challenging Yet Achievable Goal

According to Kotler, we can encourage flow by setting challenging yet achievable goals that we’re passionate about. Let’s practice creating a flow-inducing goal.

* * *

Think about a broad goal that you’re passionate about. What personally motivates you to achieve this goal? For example, your broad goal might be to become a concert pianist because you enjoy making others happy through your music.

Now, break your goal into several small, achievable chunks. And since Kotler explains that feedback is important so you can adjust your approach, make sure you can obtain some form of feedback once you complete each chunk. For example, your first small goal might be to play a complete piano piece in a public space.

Next, a flow-inducing goal must be challenging—Kotler specifically recommends the goal be 4% harder than what you’re currently capable of achieving. Based on the chunks you broke your overarching goal into in the last question, how can you make them slightly harder? For example, you could try to learn a piece of music with more complex rhythms than you’ve worked with before.

Finally, if you get stuck while working toward your challenging yet achievable goal, what are one or two relaxing or enjoyable activities you can do to give your mind a break?
