## Nurture Love in All Its Phases

Think of your relationship as a garden—understand that you will need to put work into keeping your love alive and growing. You will need to treat your garden differently as the “seasons” (or phases) of your love change:

  * **Spring:** Falling in love is a lot like springtime. Your love is budding and everything feels warm and easy. During spring, you must remember that nothing stays perfect forever. 
  * **Summer:** As you get more comfortable in love, you’ll begin to realize that your partner isn’t perfect. The first “weeds” (or disagreements) begin to grow and must be plucked. During summer, you must remember that relationships are not easy. You have to be willing to work hard under the hot sun to nurture your partner’s needs. 
  * **Autumn:** Once you’ve put in hard work during the summer phase, you have the chance to reap the rewards and enjoy the harvest. This is a golden phase in which love matures. During autumn, remember to appreciate the beautiful love you’ve worked for.
  * **Winter:** In the winter phase, love withers and pulls back within. You and your partner will hide away in the cave and the bottom of the wave in an effort to grow. During winter, remember to work on healing yourself so that you’ll be ready to enjoy the spring when it inevitably returns. 



### When Love Shifts

It is very common in relationships to experience sudden shifts from love to frustration. Read this list of examples and see if you can relate to any of these within your own relationship:

  * You feel confident in your relationship one day and then suddenly feel insecure about your partner’s devotion the next. 
  * You feel happily independent in your relationship one day and then suddenly feel needy and desperate for attention the next. 
  * You crave sex with your partner one day, but the next time he or she wants to initiate sexual intimacy, you don’t want it anymore. 
  * You’ve been excitedly waiting to see your partner, but when he or she comes home, you suddenly feel uninterested, repelled, or disappointed. 



Shifts like these are confusing and often lead people to mistakenly assume that their relationship has faded. In reality, **the safety and security of your relationship have allowed unresolved negative feelings from your past to rise back to your consciousness.**

### Unresolved Negative Emotions

When you feel safely and securely in love, negative feelings from your past may begin to resurface. In fact, the way you were raised and any unresolved emotions you experienced in your childhood still play a role in the way you express your feelings today.

#### Why Unresolved Emotions Resurface

The negative emotions that you weren’t able to express as a child have been suppressed within you for years. Because your parents were your primary examples of communication growing up, you have to learn how to overcome the unsuccessful communication skills that were ingrained in you. For example:

  * If your parents punished you for all of your childhood mistakes, you’ll have to learn how to say “I’m sorry” and deal with mistakes lovingly as an adult. 
  * If you were punished or ridiculed for crying as a child, you’ll have to learn to come to terms with grief and express negative emotions in your adult relationships.
  * You might have difficulty trusting your romantic partner if you were betrayed by a trusted adult in your childhood. 



**When you are finally at a place of emotional safety and security, the negative feelings associated with your past will resurface in your consciousness so that they can be expressed and healed.**

Unfortunately, it isn’t always easy to identify when your unresolved emotions are presenting themselves to be healed. Mistaking an old emotion for a present emotion can create conflicts in your relationship.

For example, imagine that Ben harbors feelings of abandonment because his father left when he was a child. Later in life, Ben enters a healthy, loving relationship. Ben doesn’t understand why he sometimes feels rejected and abandoned by his partner. It is because he is projecting past, unresolved pain onto his present relationship.

If, like Ben, you let your negative emotions drive you into a conflict with your partner, the feelings will become suppressed again only to resurface the next time you feel safe and loved.

#### Unresolved Emotions Cause Conflict in Relationships

**In relationships, 90% of conflicts are related to unresolved emotions from the past.** Only 10% of conflicts are actually directly caused by a present issue.

For example, imagine that someone lightly pokes your arm. You would most likely not feel any pain. But if you had an open wound on your arm, it would be intensely painful for someone to poke it.

This illustrates how emotional wounds from our past make us more sensitive to certain kinds of conflict. Without an awareness of the ways that your unresolved feelings affect you, you will likely end up in a conflict with your partner over something that is only 10% your partner’s fault.

If you ever notice a sudden change in your partner’s sensitivity levels, remember that she could be dealing with negative emotions that have resurfaced from the past. Try to recognize the open wound, and do everything you can to avoid poking it. Understand how you would feel in the same situation, and give your partner understanding support while he works to heal.

#### Healing Unresolved Emotions

When negative emotions surface in times of conflict, remember that they are most likely unresolved issues from your childhood. It’s important to nurture these feelings so that they can heal. Writing a Letter of Love is a great way to do so. Take the time while you are writing to treat yourself like a child. Ask yourself “What’s wrong? Why are you feeling this way? How can I help you feel better?”

> **Example of Self-Awareness**
> 
> After several months of falling in love in a new relationship, Lisa suddenly began to criticize everything her partner did. She was constantly annoyed with him. So she sat down to write a Letter of Love.
> 
> Lisa discovered that feelings of low self-esteem were resurfacing from her childhood and making her feel as though she wasn’t good enough for her partner. By being aware that the real problem was her lingering doubts in herself, she could release her frustration with her partner.

Another way to help yourself heal any unresolved emotional pain is to seek out a support group. The potential for growth and healing grows as the number of people you share with grows.

As adults, many people try to silence their unresolved, childlike emotions through overeating, overworking, drinking, and other addictive behaviors. For example:

  * A man’s tendency to obsess over success and achievement is an attempt to earn love and heal his emotional wounds. 
  * A woman’s tendency to obsess over beauty and perfection is an attempt to feel worthy and heal her emotional pain. 



Silencing your negative feelings only pushes them back down. These feelings will continue to resurface until you can express and heal.

#### Why Couples Need Counseling

As you grow more and more intimate in a long-term relationship, the more safety and love you feel. As a result, your deepest and most painful feelings finally reveal themselves. Most people do not know how to effectively heal these painful feelings on their own. Sometimes, you might even be tempted to run from your loving relationship rather than diving into your deepest feelings. In times like these, it is wise to consult a therapist.

The best way to heal your deepest negative emotions, you must share them. In therapy, you are free to access your unresolved emotions without the risk of projecting them onto your partner. Even long, loving, successful relationships benefit from therapy to help resolve deep-seated emotional pain.

### Lasting Relationships

Reading this guide and learning to appreciate your partner’s natural differences is a great first step in building a lasting relationship. You should feel hopeful that you will be able to make it through every season of your love.

But don’t forget, some phases of love will feel better than others. That doesn’t mean that your love is any less strong or less healthy than it once was. It just means that you need to work a little bit hard to nurture warmth and kindness with your partner.

Think of your relationship as a journey that you are going on with your partner. Be forgiving of any steps backward and appreciative of every step forward.

Refer back to this guide whenever you feel that you or your partner have forgotten the best ways to give and receive love. It’s natural to forget new things when you’re learning. So if you only remember one thing from this book for now, it should be this: **You and your partner are _supposed_ to be different. Love your partner for who they are and for all the ways they’re different from you. **
