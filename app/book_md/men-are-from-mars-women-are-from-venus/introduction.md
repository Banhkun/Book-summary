## Introduction

Men and women tend to get into conflict over their natural differences. But when you learn to think of men and women as coming from different planets, and therefore **recognize the inherent differences between men and women, you will be more successful in relationships with the opposite sex**.

(Shortform note: Throughout this book, published in 1992, author John Gray uses the terms sex and gender somewhat interchangeably. He also makes some generalizations about men and women that might seem outdated today. Challenge yourself to look for insights about yourself and your romantic partner in the descriptions of both sexes.)

Imagine that men come from Mars and women come from Venus. By understanding life on both planets, you will begin to understand _why_ men think one way and women think another. Then you will learn to be more tolerant and forgiving of people of the opposite sex. **You will discover creative solutions to miscommunication problems, understand the best way to show love and support, and learn how to get more fulfillment out of your relationships.**

Once you are aware that men and women are naturally different, you will be able to set more realistic expectations for yourself and your partner. Often (usually unknowingly), you expect people of the opposite sex to act, think, and feel the way _you_ do. You expect your partner to love you the way that you love them, and to behave the way that you behave. This is a recipe for disappointment because you have already forgotten to appreciate the ways that your partner is naturally different from you.

> **Martians and Venusians Come to Earth**
> 
> One day on Mars, the Martians were looking out through their telescopes. All of a sudden, they noticed beautiful creatures on another planet. They had discovered the Venusians of Venus. Immediately, the Martians began to feel a kind of love they had never known. They quickly invented spaceships and traveled to Venus to take care of the marvelous creatures there.
> 
> All along, the Venusians had known that something great was on its way. They welcomed the Martians to their planet and gave their love generously to them. Although they were from different planets, the Martians and Venusians celebrated their differences and learned to live together harmoniously.
> 
> Eventually, the Martians and Venusians traveled to Earth. But the planet’s atmosphere had strange effects on them—they developed amnesia. All of a sudden, the Martians and Venusians forgot that they originally hailed from different planets. They could no longer understand and appreciate their innate differences.
> 
> Men and women have been in conflict ever since because **understanding and appreciating one another’s differences is the key to healthy relationships.**

### Qualities and Values of Martians and Venusians

#### Martians

A Martian is primarily concerned with**autonomy, achievement, power, and efficiency**. **His sense of self is centered around his ability to solve problems and reach goals by himself**. These values are reflected in everything that a Martian does and says.

Because a Martian is so focused on handling his own problems, he does not particularly like to talk about his problems or accept advice, unless he consults a trusted expert. So on Mars,**** it is understood that when a man talks to another man about his problems, he has already attempted to solve them alone—now he is asking for advice or solutions.

A Martian presents himself in a way that signals power—by wearing a uniform or buying things like fast cars and high-tech computers.

#### Venusians

On the other hand, a Venusian is primarily concerned with **relationships, love, connection, and aesthetics. Her sense of self is centered around her ability to nurture others, communicate her feelings, and build quality relationships**. These values are reflected in everything that a Venusian says and does.

Because a Venusian is so focused on communication, she finds fulfillment in talking about her problems with others. So on Venus, it is intuitively understood that communication is a sign of caring and respect. The way women show love to other women is to offer support without having to be asked.

A Venusian presents herself in a way that signals expression—by changing outfits to fit her mood or nurturing a beautiful garden.

(Shortform note: Some chapters in this summary have been organized in a new order to improve the clarity and flow from topic to topic.)
