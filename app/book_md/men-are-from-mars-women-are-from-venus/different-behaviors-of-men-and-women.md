## Different Behaviors of Men and Women

When you remember that men and women come from different planets, it makes sense that men and women naturally behave differently. By understanding how and why men and women behave the way they do, you’ll be able to achieve greater harmony in your relationships.

### How Men and Women Receive Love

All humans need love, regardless of gender. But **men and women naturally crave different kinds of love**.

Many times, both a man and a woman in a relationship feel as though they give more love than they receive. But the truth is that they are _both_ giving love, but not in their partner’s desired manner.

Awareness of your partner’s love needs will guide you in how to show your love and support in the way they most want to receive them.

#### The Twelve Types of Love

There are 12 types of love.

  * Men primarily need **trust, acceptance, appreciation, admiration, approval, and encouragement**. On Mars, every man instinctively knew to show their love for each other in these primary ways. 
  * Women primarily need **caring, understanding, respect, devotion, validation, and reassurance**. On Venus, every woman instinctively knew to show their love for each other in these primary ways. 



It is important to note that both men and women need all 12 types of love. But men and women each have six _primary_ needs that must be fulfilled in order to truly feel loved and give love in return.

Understanding your partner’s six primary love needs and how they relate to your own is a critical aspect of any relationship. Once you learn to give love the way your partner wants to receive it (details below), your relationship will blossom.

##### Reciprocal Love Needs

The most practical aspect of the six primary love needs of men and women is that they are reciprocal. Giving and receiving love the right way keeps both partners fulfilled. Here are some examples:

  * **Men need acceptance, women need understanding:** A woman can fulfill a man’s need for accepting love by allowing a man to be himself and not trying to change him. Once a man feels **accepted** for who he is, he is more likely to show **understanding** the next time his partner does offer advice. 
  * **Men need appreciation, women need respect:** A man can fulfill a woman’s need for respect by making a gesture of love, like bringing home flowers. Once a woman feels **respected** , she will naturally want to show her **gratitude** for her partner.
  * **Men need admiration, women need devotion:** A woman can fulfill a man’s need for admiring love by showing her amazement at his best characteristics. Once a man feels **admired** , he will be secure enough to **devote** himself to the relationship. 



#### Fulfilling a Man’s Primary Needs

**The most effective way for a woman to fulfill a man’s love needs is to empower him**. Showing your man that you love him the way he is makes him feel trusted, accepted, appreciated, admired, approved of, and encouraged.

**The most _ineffective_ way to show love to a man is to try and change him.** Because Martians are naturally focused on achievement, your male partner is extremely sensitive to feeling like a failure. Though you might think that you are showing support to your partner by helping him improve, it feels to him like you are saying “I want you to change because you aren’t good enough.”

Here are some ways to fulfill your male partner’s primary love needs of acceptance, trust, appreciation, approval, admiration, and encouragement:

  * Remember that he will feel rejected if you try to change him.
  * Be patient and trust that he will learn lessons in his own time. 
  * Reflect on whether you are expressing negative feelings in an effort to change his behavior.
  * Allow your partner to ask for advice when he wants it.
  * Refrain from making decisions on behalf of your partner.



When you empower a man, without suggesting any changes, you fulfill his primary love needs.

#### Fulfilling a Woman’s Primary Needs

**The most effective way for a man to fulfill a woman’s love needs is to communicate with her**. Listening is a way to shower a woman with caring, understanding, respect, devotion, validation, and reassurance.

**The most ineffective way to show love to a woman is to invalidate her feelings when she tries to communicate.** Because Venusians are naturally focused on connection, your female partner is extremely sensitive to feeling invalidated or unheard. Though you might think you are showing support to your partner by helping her brush off her negative feelings, it feels to her like you are saying “I don’t care about what you are feeling because I don’t care about you.”

Here are some ways to avoid invalidating your female partner’s feelings while listening to her:

  * Remember that anger is a result of misunderstanding. 
  * Breathe deeply and let go of trying to control her feelings. 
  * Reflect on whether your resistance might be coming from your inability to help. 
  * Allow your partner to finish speaking before offering a different opinion. 
  * Refrain from feeling blamed. Don’t jump to your own defense. 



When you listen to and communicate with a woman, without jumping to anger, you fulfill her primary love needs.

### How Men and Women Respond to Stress

One of the most drastic natural differences between men and women lies in their response to stress.

  * **A man withdraws into his “cave.”** He needs to be alone to focus on the problem and come up with a solution. 
  * **A woman reaches out**. She needs to talk about her problems in order to find comfort from her stress. 



#### Men Go To Their Cave

When a man is under stress, he rarely wants to talk about what’s bothering him. So he goes into his “cave,” his private mindset. Remember, men from Mars are primarily focused on autonomy and competence. Talking about his problems would make him feel like he’s not able to solve them himself. In the cave, a man’s primary focus is on discovering how to solve his own problems.

While in the cave, a man is usually distant, preoccupied, and forgetful. He is unable to be fully present in his relationship until he has found a solution and emerged from his cave.

As a man, it is important to know your own tendency to go into your cave.**Be aware of how quickly you might shift from being warm and loving to being withdrawn and unresponsive.** Try to be compassionate of your female partner if she feels neglected while you are in your cave.

##### Why Men Go into The Cave

There are many reasons a man might feel the need to withdraw into his cave:

  * He needs time to think about a problem and find a solution.
  * He is upset and doesn’t want to lose control of his emotions in front of others. 
  * He is refraining from saying something he might regret later.
  * He needs to find his individuality. Especially when in love, men tend to feel as though they are losing themselves. Time in the cave makes them feel powerful again. 



##### How Women Respond To the Cave

Ideally, women should understand that going into the cave is a necessary step for a man to deal with stress. It is unfair to expect a man in the cave to be able to open up or talk about his feelings. Don’t take it personally—remember that he is from Mars.

Here are the six ways to support your partner through his withdrawn period:

  1. **Don’t disapprove of his natural need for alone time**. When a man withdraws, it is easy to become insecure or angry. After all, a woman would only stop communicating if she was totally uninterested in regaining intimacy. You might begin to imagine the worst and assume that he no longer cares, but remember that he is from Mars. He is handling his stress differently than you would. 
  2. **Don’t offer solutions or try to solve his problems for him**. Remember, your male partner needs you to trust him to solve problems independently. 
  3. **Don’t attempt to nurture him by asking about his feelings**. You might feel that worrying about your partner is a way to show that you care. But in order to have a fulfilling relationship, you must provide a man with the kind of caring _he_ desires. 
  4. **Don’t sit in close proximity and wait for him to start talking**. The worst thing you can do when you see a man going into his cave is to try and follow him. Imagine that there’s a dragon guarding the cave! You will be burned if you do not respect a man’s need to be alone. 
  5. **Don’t pity him or worry about him.** It feels unnatural to a woman to leave a man alone, or _abandon_ him when he is upset—that would never happen on Venus. But you will boost your partner’s self-esteem when you show that you aren’t worried about his ability to deal with stress. 
  6. **Do something fun while he takes the time he needs.** Your partner will be relieved that he doesn’t have to worry about your happiness on top of his other problems. He might even be able to come out of his cave sooner if he knows that you are happily waiting for his return. 



Remember, your male partner isn’t choosing to pull away from you. His need for the cave is a natural part of his Martian background. **Accept his method of coping and trust him to come back to you**.

#### Women Talk About Their Problems

When a woman is under stress, she needs to talk about everything that’s overwhelming her so that she can sort through her feelings. So she reaches out to those closest to her. Remember, women from Venus primarily focus on connection and expression. While stressed, a woman’s primary concern is to talk to someone she loves about every single past, present, and future problem she can think of and get it off her chest. While stressed, a woman is usually emotionally involved, talkative, and sensitive.

As a woman, it is important to remember your tendency to talk about everything that is overwhelming and bothering you.**Be aware of how your complaints might sound like blame to your male partner.** Try to be appreciative of your male partner if he listens to you and your stress.

##### Why Women Need to Talk

There are many reasons a woman might feel the need to discuss her stressors. Sometimes the exact reason a woman needs to talk is the same reason a man falls silent:

  * **She needs to convey necessary information**. (While this is only one reason a woman might want to talk, this is the _only_ reason a man chooses to talk.)
  * **She hopes to explore the topic and discover her stance**. (A man stops talking until he knows his stance.)
  * **She’s upset and needs to talk until she feels more centered**. (A man goes quiet to avoid saying something he’ll regret later.)
  * **She hopes to create intimacy through conversation.**(A man withdraws once he feels too closely intimate.)



##### How Men Respond When Women Talk About Stress

Ideally, a man should understand that talking through problems is a necessary step for women to deal with stress. It is unfair to shut your partner down when she needs to vent. Don’t take her complaints as blame or criticism—remember she’s from Venus and she’s just talking to feel better.

Unfortunately, many men don’t understand that women from Venus respond to stress differently than they do. These men tend to assume that women only want to talk about their problems to assign blame or get a solution (because those are the only two reasons why a man would choose to talk about _his own_ problems). Often, these men forget about women’s innate differences and therefore find it difficult to listen to their partners because they feel attacked.

**One thing a woman can do to help her male partner understand that she’s just venting, not blaming, is to show appreciation**. When your male partner listens to you talk about your stress, take a moment to say something like “I’m so relieved that I can talk about all of this with you” or “I feel a lot better. Thank you for listening.” You could also remind your partner of the things he has done to make your life better. For example, if you are complaining about the house looking messy, you could take the time to thank him for doing the dishes.

Sometimes when you talk about your problems with your male partner, he will feel attacked and assume that you are blaming him for everything that’s bothering you. Because he came from Mars, he might forget that you’re only talking to feel better. If you sense this happening, say these magic words: **“It’s not your fault.”**(This only works if you truly believe that your problem is not your partner’s fault. If there is ever a time that you _do_ feel like blaming your partner, refer to the chapter “Handle Conflicts Lovingly” to learn how to cope.)

**One thing a man can do to help clarify whether or not his female partner means to sound blaming is to communicate and ask questions**. When your female partner comes home complaining about never having fun together anymore, don’t immediately assume that she’s blaming you for being boring. Instead, ask “It feels like you’re saying it’s all my fault that you’re bored. Is that how you feel?” That way, you give her the opportunity to take back any blame.
