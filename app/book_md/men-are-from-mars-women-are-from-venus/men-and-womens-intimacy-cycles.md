## Men and Women’s Intimacy Cycles

Men and women have different rhythms and intimacy cycles when they’re in love.

  * Men get intimate with their partner, then distance themselves and withdraw, then come back to intimacy again. 
  * Women rise on the wave of love, then fall into dissatisfaction, then swell with love again. 



### Men Are Like Rubber Bands

When a man is in love, he goes through a natural cycle of intimacy that is a lot like a rubber band. First, the man is very close and intimate. Then he begins to pull away. Once he has stretched to his maximum distance, like a rubber band, he snaps back into the relationship with the same level of intimacy he felt before he stretched.

The rubber band cycle comes naturally to a man in love—he might not even realize that he tends to pull away every time the relationship becomes more intimate. As a woman, it is important to be aware of this cycle, understand why it’s important for men, and know how to react to your partner’s fluctuations of intimacy.

#### Why Men Pull Away

When a man is in love, he feels the need for intimacy. However, because he is from Mars, he also feels the need for autonomy. The rubber band cycle gives the man a chance to fulfill both needs.

Reasons a man needs to stretch away:

  * He craves independence.
  * He has spent energy fulfilling his partner’s needs, and he needs time to regain his energy.
  * He doesn’t want to be responsible for anyone else for a while. 
  * He needs to take care of himself.



Throughout the cycle of stretching away and springing back, a man continues to love and care about his partner. He doesn’t choose to pull away, it’s instinct.

Many men don’t even realize that their natural intimacy cycles have a profound impact on their female partners. **As a man, do your best to reassure your partner before you stretch away**. You can say something like “I need to be alone, but let’s talk about this again once I’ve thought it over.” If nothing else, say the magic words: **“I will come back.”**

Unfortunately, men often pull away (without reassuring their partner) at the precise time a woman wants to create intimacy. There are two primary reasons for that:

  1. A woman can tell when a man is stretching back. In order to try to bring him back, she wants to talk and create intimacy.
  2. When a woman opens up about her feelings with a man, intimacy is created. This triggers the man’s need to pull away and gain some autonomy.



**When a man is pulling away, it is important to allow him to do so. Wait to talk and create intimacy until he has snapped back into the relationship**.

(Shortform note: If you’re unsure how to tell when a man is pulling away, be sure to read the chapter “Improve Communication in Your Relationship”—specifically the section “Translate Martian to Venusian.”)

#### Obstructing the Rubber Band

Some of the biggest problems that couples experience in relationships come from obstructing the natural cycle of male intimacy. This happens in three ways:

  1. The couple is always together and the man never has a chance to stretch.
  2. The woman may unknowingly block the man from stretching by making him feel chased or punished. 
  3. The man might be unconsciously afraid to pull away because of his memories of his parents. If his mother was always disapproving of his father’s need to stretch away, the man might feel afraid of losing love by distancing himself. 



In all of these cases, the man never has the opportunity to stretch back and gain his autonomy. He will become moody, irritable, uninterested, and defensive. So it’s no wonder that this often results in conflict.

##### Chasing and Punishing

**When your male partner begins to pull away, or stretch, do your best not to chase or punish him**. Remember that this is his natural cycle.

Chasing your partner when he needs to stretch back and be alone only delays the process of him feeling independent and being ready to come back into the relationship. Some ways you might be unknowingly chasing your partner:

  * **Physical:** When your partner walks out of the room, you follow him. When your partner wants to do something alone, you go with him. 
  * **Emotional:** When your partner pulls away, you worry about him and feel sorry for him. When your partner needs quiet, you continue to ask him what’s wrong. 
  * **Mental:** When your partner stretches back, you attempt to make him feel guilty by asking questions like, “Why are you treating me so badly?” 



Punishing your partner after he stretches away will make him fearful the next time he feels a need for distance. This results in an obstructed intimacy cycle. Some ways you might be unknowingly punishing your partner:

  * **Physical:** When your partner snaps back to you, you reject his physical affection or deny him any attention. 
  * **Emotional:** When your partner returns to intimacy, you are angry with him. You don’t express your understanding. 
  * **Mental:** When your partner snaps back, you are cold and resentful. You stop trusting that your partner cares for you. 



**Giving up on chasing or punishing your partner will benefit both of you** :

  * He has the opportunity to regain his strength and independence.
  * You will feel more loved when your partner has the opportunity to miss you and crave closeness again.



#### When the Rubber Band Snaps Back

When your male partner snaps back into intimacy like a rubber band, he will be loving, caring, and unphased by the period of distance that he just went through. This is the time to talk and regain intimacy with your male partner. Try to initiate a conversation, but don’t expect _him_ to start talking right away.

As a woman, you will need to be the first to share your feelings. As you do so, be sure to show appreciation when your partner listens to you. This will make him feel loved, and he will be much more likely to open up and share his thoughts on what you’ve said.

Don’t pressure your partner into sharing before he’s ready. Instead, be **appreciative** that he has snapped back into intimacy and **accepting** that he’s not yet ready to share. **Encourage** your partner by expressing that his listening is valuable to you. (Shortform note: this goes back to the primary love needs of men from the last chapter.)

Another thing you can do to inspire your man to snap back into intimacy is to become more independent yourself. When your partner pulls away, spend time doing the things that you love to do, like hanging out with friends or going to a play. Remember, the farther away you allow your partner to stretch, the more powerfully he will come springing back to you.

### Women Are Like Waves

When a woman is in love, she goes through a natural cycle of intimacy that is a lot like a wave. First she feels great and has so much love to give to her partner. Then she begins to fall into a deep well of feelings, like hopelessness and loneliness. Once she has hit rock bottom, like a wave, she will rise and give love again. The wave cycle comes naturally to a woman. She may not even realize when she is down that she is much more reactive, vulnerable, and in need of love.

As a man, it is important to be aware of this cycle, understand what a woman needs when she is low, and learn how to respond to your partner’s fluctuations in intimacy.

(Shortform note: The cycle of the rubber band and the cycle of the wave are very similar, in that both describe feelings oscillating on a scale. The key difference is that when a man stretches away from his partner, he needs space and independence in order to return to intimacy. When a woman is low, she needs more connection and closeness to return to intimacy.)

#### Why Women Fluctuate

When a woman is in love, she feels happiness, trust, gratitude, and fulfillment. But because she is from Venus, she needs to value and express all her feelings equally. So she is also deeply connected to her pre-existing feelings of fear, sadness, and insecurity. When a woman crashes or goes down into her well, it is a time to express and heal those negative feelings.

(Shortform note: For more information about how to heal pre-existing negative feelings, refer to the chapter “How to Communicate in Times of Conflict,” specifically the “Where Your Negative Emotions Originate” section.)

A woman’s wave is directly related to her own self-esteem. When a woman feels good about herself, she is able to give love. But when a woman doubts herself, she begins to crash. When a woman is at the low point of her wave, she needs support more than ever.

Signs that a woman is crashing down:

  * **She feels insecure** : She might say “I need more from you.” 
  * **She feels overwhelmed** : She might say “There’s way too much to do.”
  * **She is uninterested** : She might say “Do whatever you want.”
  * **She is mistrustful** : She might say “What is that supposed to mean?”



Throughout the cycle of giving love and needing love, a woman continues to love and trust her partner. She doesn’t mean to become vulnerable or insecure in the relationship—it is a natural instinct. Many women don’t even realize that their natural intimacy cycles have a profound impact on their male partners.

**When a woman crashes, it is important to support her and allow her to feel her negative feelings. Once she hits rock bottom, she will be ready to rise, give love, and feel good about herself again.**

If you do not support your partner through her crashes, she might become hesitant to follow her natural cycle. Without having the opportunity to go down and relieve her negative feelings, a woman may become repressed, numb, and uninspired. Repressed negative emotions often lead to repressed positive emotions, as well, including love. She might withhold sex and affection or develop addictions like drinking, overworking, or overeating.

Here are three insights that might give you a sense of relief when dealing with a woman going down into her well:

  1. When you support your partner through her low period, she might not _immediately_ feel better. But she will feel safe to dive deeper into her feelings. As you go through many more cycles together, you’ll get better at supporting her through the feelings that often arise during her lowest spells. 
  2. You are not to blame for the negative feelings that arise when your female partner crashes. You cannot stop her from going through this cycle, you can only help her get through it. 
  3. You are not responsible for fixing a woman’s problems and helping her rise. She will naturally rebound on her own once she has hit the bottom of her emotional low. 



#### When a Woman is Down

When your female partner experiences a sudden change of mood and begins to go down into her well of emotions, don’t become defensive or assume that you are to blame. Remember that it is her natural cycle because she is from Venus.

Here are some of the most important things to remember when helping your female partner through her crash:

  * **Make her feel safe:** Go out of your way to show your partner that you are there to support her. Never judge her negative feelings or make unfair demands during her low period. 
  * **Don’t try to fix it** : Remember that you cannot pull your partner out of her low. Don’t offer suggestions or solutions. Just listen and sympathize, even if you cannot understand why she is feeling down. 
  * **Don’t expect an immediate lift:** Remember that your support might not immediately make your partner feel better. In fact, your partner might go even deeper into her negative feelings. This is actually a positive step! The closer she gets to the bottom, the sooner she will be able to rise. 
  * **Don’t get defensive:** Remember that your partner is working through _pre-existing_ emotions, as well as current ones. Know that most of the negativity your partner is feeling is natural, and not a result of your behavior. 



#### When a Woman Rises Up

As soon as a woman rises out of the well, she is back to her normal, loving, giving self. But this does not mean that those negative feelings and pre-existing emotions have been fully resolved. The next time she crashes, many of those feelings will surface again. Often, this causes recurring arguments.

Now that you understand your woman’s natural intimacy cycle, don’t allow those recurring emotions and arguments to come between you. Never say things like, “How many times are we going to talk about this?” or “I don’t want to talk about this again.” Instead, listen.

> **Example: Recurring Emotions**
> 
> When Chris and Pam got married, they didn’t have much money. Sometimes Pam would go through low periods and complain of being dissatisfied. Chris could easily understand her unhappiness. He resolved to work harder to bring home more money, and Pam felt cared for.
> 
> A few years later, Chris and Pam were wealthy. But Pam would sometimes still have low spells. Chris couldn’t understand Pam’s pain anymore. He felt that he had fixed all of her problems. Because Chris couldn’t understand her, Pam couldn’t feel truly loved. The more money Chris and Pam made, the less happy Pam became.
> 
> _What happened to Chris and Pam?_ At the start of their marriage, Chris could relate to the negative emotions that surfaced when Pam’s wave crashed. He felt that he could work hard and solve all her problems by making more money.
> 
> Later in the relationship, Chris could no longer understand why Pam was going in waves. He thought that money had solved her problems. He forgot that she was from Venus—regardless of her new wealth, Pam just needed support in order to rise back up from her well.
> 
> Once Chris realized that he could make Pam happy by simply validating her feelings, just like he had when they were poor, Chris and Pam experienced renewed love and happiness.

### The Rubber Band and the Wave

Sometimes, when a woman is crashing to the lowest point of her wave and needs to talk, a man is also stretching back his rubber band and can’t listen. Without an understanding of the natural intimacy cycles of men and women, this could cause conflict in a relationship. But once you know the natural differences between men and women, you can learn to work through these difficult periods together.

How a man can help a woman through her low point while he is pulling back:

  1. **Be honest about your limitations** : If you have nothing to give and need to stretch away, be honest with yourself that you are not in a good place to listen. 
  2. **Sympathize with her pain** : If your partner needs more love than you can give her, she might feel abandoned. Make sure your partner knows that you understand she’s hurting. 
  3. **Be reassuring** : Reassure your partner that you will come back to her. Tell her that you will give her the love she deserves once you’ve taken care of yourself. 



How a woman can go through her low point and allow her man to stretch away:

  1. **Accept his natural cycle** : If you want your partner to really listen to you, you’ll have to wait until he is ready to do so. Wait until the time is right to initiate conversation.
  2. **Get support elsewhere** : If you need support, go to your friends or family. Remind your partner that he is not solely responsible for your happiness. 



Ultimately, **a woman should be allowed to ask for love and reassurance when she needs it and a man should be allowed to have time to himself when he needs it**. Remember, a healthy relationship results from two people who commit to fulfilling each other’s primary love needs.
