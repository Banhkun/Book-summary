## Shortform Introduction

In _Tribal Leadership_ , Dave Logan, Halee Fischer-Wright, and John King describe how to improve an organization by leveling up its culture. An organization is made of tribes—socially networked groups of 20 to 150 people—and the cultures of those tribes determine the organization’s performance and its members’ happiness.

A tribal leader is someone who builds a higher-level tribe by coaching its members to develop their skills and become team players. As this leader coaches tribe members to higher stages, the tribe’s culture will transform, and the overall organization will perform far better. According to the authors, using the strategies in _Tribal Leadership_ will improve your bottom line, and your employees will become more motivated, productive, and happy.

### The Book’s Publication and Context

_Tribal Leadership_ was first published in 2008 by Harper Business, an imprint of HarperCollins. It’s the single book on which Logan, Fischer-Wright, and King have collaborated.

#### Historical and Intellectual Context

According to the authors, _Tribal Leadership_ draws from the work of Don Beck and Chris Cowan in _Spiral Dynamics_ , which presents a model of adult development that draws in turn from Clare W. Graves’s theory of emergent cyclical levels of existence. Graves, a professor of psychology at Union College, theorized that adults develop various psychosocial coping mechanisms to deal with existential challenges, such as conforming with group norms to preserve self-esteem.

Following Graves’s lead, Beck and Cowan developed Spiral Dynamics, a model to explain how individuals and value systems develop. Similar to Graves’s model, Spiral Dynamics holds that people develop value systems and corresponding behaviors in response to the demands of their environments—for example, Westerners in a modern society tend to seek individualistic success, pursue “the good life,” and act pragmatically to win.

In _The Listening Society_ , Hanzi Freinacht argues that numerous “domain-specific” models attempt to explain adult development along particular lines. _Tribal Leadership_ presents one such model, aimed at explaining adult professional development and organizational-cultural development within a traditional business context. The authors’ model follows the convention of describing various stages of development, and it uses values, language, and behavior as the metrics with which it delineates stages.

#### The Book’s Impact

Today, _Tribal Leadership_ is one of a bevy of business books that describe various approaches to culture and leadership, and it may have sparked early movement toward today’s paradigm of collaborative work cultures. At the time of first publication, the authors wrote extensively on Stage 3’s individualism-fueled problems; however, they acknowledge in the afterword of the 2011 edition that millennials resisted Stage 3 and instead demanded collaborative, fair workplaces. A decade later, that trend has unfolded into a sizable shift toward Stage 4, where teamwork predominates.

Additionally, _Tribal Leadership_ may have started the conversation about the power that informal workplace networks have over top-down structures. Throughout the book, the authors emphasize that tribes—which are social networks more than work teams—determine what gets done, and they avoid using traditional org charts to model how a business “should” structure itself. This approach is less precise, so it doesn’t give the comfortable feeling of certainty that comes with neatly boxing things up. However, the authors’ effort to communicate the messy, organic process of discovering and upgrading the tribes within an organization—which are harder to define—has led to network mapping approaches that have various advantages over org-chart-based restructuring.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Online reviewers applaud _Tribal Leadership_ ’s clear descriptions of various business cultures, its “aha” moments in its discussion of triad-based networking, and the chapter-by-chapter summaries of key points. Others praise the clear writing and effectively structured chapters.

Critical reviewers dislike the book’s focus on theory over practice, saying that the authors are consultants rather than practitioners. Some readers feel the book is repetitive, and some say that the authors get too caught up in their own model without providing evidence to support their claims.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_Tribal Leadership_ presents a thorough description of various corporate cultures. The authors’ detailed model of tribes and their development makes clear how culture impacts success, though they don’t show plainly that _their methods_ have created any such culture. Instead, they relate anecdotes of cultures that became effective through trial and error—and they acknowledge that many leaders develop their tribes instinctively, rather than by following a model.

The authors offer plenty of actionable tips for coaching individuals to higher levels of productivity and fulfillment. Moreover, the emphasis on tribes as social structures helps to make sense of why the shared mood of an organization determines how well people perform.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

The book’s chapters follow a clear progression, from introducing the main concepts to describing each stage in order, and are interspersed with chapters to elaborate on pivotal points in the process. While this organization is broadly effective, each chapter moves between descriptions of the individuals, tribes, and organizations at each stage, so it’s sometimes unclear to which entity the author’s tips and advice apply.

Further, the authors scatter various coaching tips and “technical notes” throughout each chapter. Each chapter ends with a succinct list of key takeaways that helps the reader to recall and retain the ideas.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Our guide presents _Tribal Leadership_ in four parts, focusing on the five stages and how to level up individuals and tribes. We’ll first introduce the key concepts, including what tribes and tribal leaders are, and we’ll then cover each stage:

  * **Part 1** introduces the book’s premises and key concepts.
  * **Part 2** discusses Stage 1 and Stage 2, the lowest-level stages.
  * **Part 3** explains Stage 3, the most common tribal stage. 
  * **Part 4** covers Stage 4 and Stage 5, the teamwork-based cultures that the authors recommend you strive to reach.



Since the authors present a developmental stage model, we’ve introduced additional stage models and concepts that make sense of the developmental approach. In particular, we compare their model to Spiral Dynamics, which the authors say influenced their work. Throughout the guide, we’ve also expanded on their perspectives with ideas from business books including _Leadership and Self-Deception_ , _What You Do Is Who You Are_ , and _Good Strategy Bad Strategy**.**_
