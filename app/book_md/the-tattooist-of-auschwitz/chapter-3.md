## Chapter 3: New Arrivals and New Nightmares

In the spring, Lale and Leon report to work one day to find a new shipment of people like they’ve never seen before. There are the usual men and women, but now there are children and the elderly, as well. Leon cringes at the thought of tattooing children, but Lale tells him to keep his mouth shut. Baretski informs them that the people are Gypsies, lower than Jews, and that there will be a lot of them.**** The tattooists are relieved that the children are not to be tattooed, but their presence is still unnerving.

That afternoon, Lale returns to his room to find that his empty block is now overrun with Gypsies. **He always assumed his solitude would eventually be disturbed, but he never expected that his new neighbors would be families comprising several generations.**

Lale doesn’t know much about Gypsies, but he worries about the safety of his stash of valuables. He decides to get to know them to assess the risk and walks into the block. He shakes hands with everyone, spending extra time with the old women. He says he will do his best to relay any information he has about their safety, and they are grateful. For many of them, Lale is the first Jew they’ve ever met. That night, Lale struggles to sleep in his new world of crying babies and fussy children. But over time, he gets used to it, and the Gypsies accept him as one of them.

**Lale spends many nights talking with his new companions. He learns about their culture and that the word “Gypsy” is derogatory.** They refer to themselves as the Romany. The children love Lale and often swarm him for treats when he comes back from work. Lale suggests that the Romany create a sort of school for the children, even just to educate them about their heritage. He often sits in on the lessons and asks questions to help further the discussion for the children. These lessons, taught by the older women, seem to give them a sense of purpose and a bit of peace.

Lale is fascinated by the nomadic life of these people, so different from his own. But there is one woman who stands out to him. She is older and, unlike the others, seems to have no family at the camp. One night, he finds her outside alone and sits next to her. They begin to talk, and he learns that her name, Nadya, means “hope.” She once had a son and husband, but both died of typhus years before. Lale tells her about his family. **Something about Nadya reminds Lale of his mother, and he becomes overwhelmed with homesickness.**

He thinks about his family, something he hasn’t allowed himself to do much of in the year he’s been gone. He prefers to think of them as safe at home, but now, he can’t help but wonder whether or not they are still safe. He reasons that there’s nothing he can do to help them, and allowing himself to fall down this rabbit hole of worry will lead to trouble. **He decides that if he can’t be there for this family, he can at least be there for Nadya.**

### Devil in a White Coat

Lale encounters a new member of the SS staff one day while tattooing arrivals. It starts with a whistle, an eerie sound within the confines of Auschwitz. He recognizes the tune but can’t place it. The whistling gets louder. Lale finally glances up and sees a new doctor walking toward him.

There is something more sinister about this doctor than the others he’s seen. Lale tries to focus on his work, but his concentration is disrupted when the doctor leans over and inspects the tattoo he’s giving. Lale holds his breath until the doctor walks away. **Baretski tells Lale the doctor is named Mengele and is so scary, even he is afraid of him.**

Later, the whistling returns behind Lale. He becomes so nervous, he accidentally stabs a woman with his tattoo needle. Blood oozes from the wound. Mengele comes closer and asks Lale if anything is the matter. Lale finally looks into the man’s face and sees eyes as black as coal. The doctor smiles a wicked smile and moves on.

Back in his room, Lale tries to wash the blood out of his shirt but then stops. He stares at the stain and decides to leave it. It will be a good reminder to stay alert when the doctor is around. **Mengele is dangerous and heartless, and he doesn’t want to draw his attention again.**

This reminder fails to work the next day. Mengele walks up and down the line of arrivals, studying the young women. He separates the women into groups, and Lale can’t discern what his criteria might be. The women all look healthy. Lale can’t stop staring, and Mengele catches him and whispers in the ear of an SS officer. The officer approaches Lale’s table, but instead of addressing Lale, he orders Leon to follow him. Lale tries to intervene, but he stops when the nose of a rifle is pointed at his face. Leon is taken away, and Lale sinks with guilt.

### Playing Games

One morning, **Baretski comes to Lale’s room and says that he and the other SS officers thought it would be fun to organize a game of soccer versus the prisoners.** He wants Lale to put a team together and have them ready for a match on Sunday. He gives Lale the day off to figure it out.

After Baretski leaves, Lale organizes his stash of valuables and food into little bundles. He puts aside food for the Romany, the men in Block 7, and Gita and her friends. He takes the jewels to Victor and Yuri for the day’s trade. When his business is finished, he sets to work convincing the other men to play in the soccer match.

At first, the other men are stupefied. Why would they want to play soccer with the officers? Many refuse, but one young man agrees. He says he knows of men who used to play professionally and will do his best to recruit them. Lale shows his gratitude by handing out the bundles of food. He’s heartened by the way the men share equally with each other. Not everything in this place is bad.

When Sunday comes, Lale is surprised to find six semi-pro players on his team. He’s grateful for them for agreeing to play, but he knows they’re not allowed to win. It’s too dangerous. **If they embarrass the SS, who knows what sort of revenge they’ll take on the team and the many prisoners crowding the field as spectators.** Among them is Gita and her crew. Lale wishes he could forget the game and take her to their spot, but all he can do is wave.

The prisoner team scores two goals quickly, jumping out to a 2-0 lead. Lale gets into the winning spirit, but his gut tells him it’s time for the team to pull back. He convinces the players to allow the officers to catch up. They’ll put on a good show so the prisoners watching can feel proud, but they need to make sure they lose the game. **The reality of where they are and the stakes involved hits home as ashes from the crematorium rain down on the field.**

Midway through the second half, Lale realizes he has no need to worry. The prisoners are so weak from starvation, they can barely make it up and down the field. The SS win by two goals, and Lale earns an “atta boy” from one of the senior officers.

### The Women

After the game, Lale and Gita sneak away to their spot. Gita is engrossed in searching through patches of grass. She tells Lale she’s looking for four-leaf clovers. They’re everywhere in the camp, and the women use them to curry favor with the guards. **The SS are notoriously superstitious, and if they offer a four-leaf clover, they can avoid beatings and sometimes get extra food.** Lale is incensed that he can’t protect the woman he loves.

Gita playfully throws a handful of grass at Lale, and they begin to play-wrestle. Lale pins her down and asks if he can kiss her. Gita raises her face to his. Their kiss is passionate, ignited by the long yearning each has felt since that first chocolatey kiss. The passion consumes them, and they lose themselves in it until the sound of a barking dog brings them back to reality.

Lale returns Gita to her friends in the yard and notices that something is off about Gita’s co-worker Cilka. He asks Gita what’s wrong with her, but she won’t say. She tells him there is nothing he can do to help and adds “my love” at the end. Lale forgets all about his concern for Cilka. He swims with delight in the bliss of those two words. However, when he sees Cilka looking distraught next to Gita the next day at the administration office, he makes a note to force the truth from Gita.

That afternoon, Baretski takes Lale to Auschwitz, but instead of setting up his table for work, he is told to report to Block 10. Lale quickly notices that Block 10 is not set up for residents like the others. He’s instructed to enter from the back, and when he turns the corner, he freezes. **In front of him stands a fenced-in compound filled with dozens of naked women, their faces gaunt and lifeless.**

Inside, Lale passes several prisoners lying on the ground like abandoned puppets. He is taken to a room full of at least 50 women matching the description of those outside. Mengele examines each one, touching them inappropriately as they silently cry. Some are sent away, but others are sent to Lale to tattoo. When the work is over, Mengele tells Lale that he will come for him one day. Lale shakes as he collects his tools. He exits the way he came. The compound is now empty of women.

That night, Gita enters her block after work to find a group of new arrivals. New arrivals are always met with hostility. The current prisoners know they will be peppered with questions they don’t want to answer. But one woman steps forward and calls Gita’s name. She is Gita’s old neighbor from home, Hilda Goldstein. Hilda tells Gita that everyone from home was rounded up and taken away, all but her brothers, who joined the resistance. **Hilda also says that Gita’s parents and sister did not make it. Gita crumbles to the ground, the other women watching silently, knowing the grief she feels.**

Gita knows that Hilda will surely die if she is assigned to hard labor. She asks her kapo to spare Hilda and suggests Hilda clean the latrine, a job usually performed by whichever woman angers the kapo. The kapo agrees for a price. Rumors of Lale’s enterprises have abounded, and she wants a diamond ring. Gita promises to make it happen.
