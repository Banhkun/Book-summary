## Chapter 4: Dark Days

By late summer, five crematoriums are operating at full steam. **More and more people arrive daily, and Lale is swamped with work, especially since Leon has still not returned.** He’s so busy, he hasn’t had a day off in weeks. And because there is always work, he has no need to get instructions from the administration office. He knows Gita will be consumed with worry and asks Baretski to explain where he is and that he’s alright. Baretski promises to tell her.

Lale finally gets a break from the constant stream of prisoners. He runs back to Birkenau to catch Gita after work. When Gita sees him, she almost faints with relief. She thought something had happened to him. Baretski did not deliver Lale’s message. The time away and her relief at seeing him fill Lale with the sensation of love. He finally tells her he loves her and feels as though he’s been waiting to tell her that his entire life. He tells her about his vow to make it out alive and that it now includes her.

The next day, Leon returns to work. He is pale, thinner, and more defeated than before. He struggles when he walks, and Lale can feel his ribs when he hugs him. **Leon tells Lale that Mengele held him captive. He was starved, tortured, and castrated.** Lale rails, cursing Mengele and promising to exact his revenge. But he sees that rage is not what his friend needs, and at the moment, there is nothing he can do anyway. He tells Leon to go to his room and help himself to the food hidden under the mattress.

Lale is despondent after learning about his friend. He feels like things can’t get much worse, but he is mistaken. Baretski tracks him down to perform a special job, one that doesn’t require his bag of tools. Lale sinks with fear when he is taken to one of the crematoriums. He doesn’t feel much better when he learns that the special job is differentiating between two dead men’s tattoos that look the same.

Inside the crematorium, Lale sees other prisoners at work, moving corpses from the gas chambers to the oven. None of them look at Lale when he passes. Lale can’t help but feel a kinship to these men. They are treated better because of the jobs they do, like him, but **he knows the other prisoners don’t like them because they do the enemy’s dirty work. He wonders if they feel the same way about him**.

Lale is taken to a pile of naked bodies. Death is all that exists in this room, and Lale wants out as soon as possible. Even Baretski seems unable to stomach the scene. Lale clears up the tattoo confusion and leaves the building without waiting to be excused. Baretski catches up to him and asks if Lale is okay. Lale is livid. He wants to know how many more innocent people must die at the hands of the Germans. Baretski is unfazed. He jokes that Lale is the only Jew to ever go inside an oven and leave alive.

### Abuse of Power

Lale leaves the crematorium in a fury and marches toward the women’s compound, barely registering two officers who stop him along the way. He tells them he is with the political department, and they let him pass. When he reaches Gita’s block, he hands the kapo a bar of chocolate and asks for Gita to be brought to him. The other women are at work, so he waits inside the empty block.

Soon, the door opens, and Gita walks in. When she sees Lale, she glares and backs away from him when he tries to approach her. Lale doesn’t understand why she’s being so cold until she starts to speak. Gita explains that when the SS come and take you away, you assume you’re about to die. When her kapo came to get Gita for Lale, she thought she was going to be killed, and the only thought she had was about never seeing Lale again. And now here he is, expecting love.

Lale doesn’t know what to say. **His privilege has kept him from understanding the fears the others live with daily. It was selfish of him to have scared her for his own pleasure.** Lale doesn’t have time to relay his shame to Gita. Suddenly, she charges and begins to thrash him with her fists. Lale stands still until she is finished, then kisses her. Gita’s fury turns to passion, and the two make love for the first time. They are now bonded, and he knows he will never feel this way about another woman. Gita is his love for life. When he leaves the block, Gita’s kapo tells Lale she likes sausage, too.

Lale gets a chance to repent for his manipulation of Gita when he is able to use his privilege for good. Three young boys knock on his door in the middle of the night and ask for his help. Lale lets them in, at first annoyed and less than sympathetic when they say one of them is in trouble. This boy had escaped but was captured, and now they don’t know what’s going to happen to him. Lale makes it clear. The boy will be hanged. Lale wants to know how this young man managed to make it out and why he was stupid enough to get caught.

The boy was using the restroom in the woods, but when he returned, his work group was already walking away. He feared being shot if he tried to catch up to them, so he went back into the woods. He was discovered when he tried to steal food in a nearby town. **Lale can’t believe how careless this boy was, but he softens, remembering his recent lesson regarding his privilege.** He leaves with his bag and sneaks through the searchlights.

He creeps into the administration building and finds his usual contact behind the desk. He arranges for the boy to be added to a transport leaving at midnight for a boys’ camp. When he returns to his room, he uses his tattooing tools to turn the boy’s number into a snake. None of the other boys in the transport have been tattooed yet. He tells the other boys to say goodbye to their friend and go back to bed. At midnight, he takes the boy to the transport and watches him board. He waits until the truck drives off, then sneaks back to his own waiting bed.

### Friends and Foes

Many people die over the following months. Some fall sick, some starve to death, some die from the harsh winter elements, others use the electrical fences to end their misery, and others are shot for various reasons. **More arrivals come in by the thousands, and Lale and Leon are busier than ever.** He rarely gets to see Gita, and only when they meet up in her block when the other women are at work. This arrangement always includes bribes to the kapo, and she starts to fill out her uniform from all the extra chocolate and sausage.

Things start to look up as the long winter transforms into spring. Even Baretski is in high spirits. Apparently, he’s been taking Lale’s advice about women, and his relationship with his girlfriend has grown stronger. Lale is surprised. He didn’t think Baretski had a soft bone in his body. But his surprise turns to dismay when Baretski asks him to get his girlfriend some nylon stockings.

Lale has kept his smuggling activities a secret from Baretski. The officer is young and emotionally unstable, and that kind of power over Lale could prove disastrous. But Baretski has found out, and try as he might, Lale isn’t able to deny it.**He feels even worse when Baretski says he thinks of Lale as a brother. Perhaps Lale really has crossed over to the dark side.** He tells Baretski he’ll have the nylons in a couple of days. Baretski, ever the comedian, jokes that Lale better or he’ll shoot him.

Lale heads to the women’s compound, but the whir of an airplane brings him to a halt. Up above, a small aircraft flies over the camp. At one point, it comes so low that Lale and other prisoners can make out the distinctive emblem of the U.S. Airforce. Lale’s heart jumps. What does this mean? Are they saved? Will the Americans finally see what’s happening to them and intervene? Will the world learn the truth?

Some of the prisoners shout and wave with joy. Others rush toward the crematoriums, pointing and yelling for the pilot to drop bombs on those buildings. **The plane passes overhead three times, and each time, more and more prisoners urge it to destroy the crematoriums.** Lale watches the whole thing in wonder. Finally, the plane flies off, and Lale snaps back to life. He slowly backs up until he is against a building. The firestorm of bullets starts almost immediately. Dozens of people fall to their death.

Lale heads back to his block. When he arrives, many of the Romany are distraught and crying. Some of the young children playing outside were hit by the bullets. **Lale stares at this new horror. He begins to recite the kaddish to himself, a Jewish passage meant to honor the dead.**

### The End of the Road

One day, Lale realizes it is early April, just weeks away from his two-year anniversary at the camp. He can’t believe he’s made it this long and can’t fathom how he’s done it. He also remembers the vow he made that first day. He tells himself to hold tight to that promise. It will be the thing that helps him keep moving forward.

**Lale and Gita grow closer, and he daydreams with her about escaping the camp and starting a family someday.** Gita thinks it’s a beautiful dream, but she has a hard time believing it. She can’t muster the same hope and has even refused to tell him her last name until they are free, as though revealing that piece of her would make her a real person.

At some point, Gita finally tells Lale what’s wrong with Cilka. A year ago, Schwarzhuber, a senior officer, summoned Cilka to a secret room. When she arrived and saw a four-poster bed, she knew what she would have to do if she wanted to live. This was also why she was allowed to keep her long hair. She’d been going to the room ever since. Lale is beside himself. He tells Gita that Cilka is a hero for doing what she needs to do to survive. It’s a form of resistance to not allow the Nazi’s to take her life. Gita asks if Lale considers himself a hero. Lale doesn’t know. He’s willingly defiled his people for his own benefit. What he hopes is to not be considered a collaborator when all was said and done.

After leaving Gita, Lale visits with Leon and other men from Block 7. It’s a sunny day, and he enjoys the small moment of community and peace. The siren blares, and he heads back to his block. The Romany children are out playing, but when they see Lale, they stop. Lale knows something is not right. **When he opens the door to his room, he finds two SS officers standing next to his bed, the entirety of his secret stash displayed.**

The officers march Lale at gunpoint out of the camp. Lale assumes he will be shot, but he is taken to Houstek’s office instead. Houstek demands to know the names of the women who smuggled the possessions out of the warehouses. Lale says he doesn’t know because he never asked for their names. Houstek is furious. Not only does he not get the information he wants, but now he has to find a new tattooer, too. He tells the officers to put Lale in Block 11.

During the ride to Auschwitz, Lale says goodbye to Gita and to the promises he made her. He takes a moment to remember the faces and names of his family members, reaching for the best memory he can find. He knows what his fate is. He saw what happened in Block 10 with Mengele, and Block 11 was the same. Men are tortured and often shot against the execution wall behind then, known as the Black Wall.

### A Familiar Face in the Darkest Hour

Lale sits in a dark cell for two days without one word from anyone. Then, on the third day, a large Jewish man enters the cell. Lale recognizes him immediately. The man’s name is Jakob, and Lale helped him his first night at the camp. He was bigger than two men, and Lale could see that he wasn’t going to survive on the meager rations he was given. Lale gave him his extra food that night. The last time he saw Jakob was when he was performing feats of strength to entertain the prisoners. SS officers had taken him away. Lale assumed he was dead, but now here Jakob was, working as a guard at death’s door.

Jakob is surprised to see Lale in the cell. Like everyone else, including Lale, he thought Lale was untouchable. **Jakob is truly hurt when he tells Lale that he must beat him until he turns over the names of the women.** He tells Lale he has no choice. He, too, must do his duty if he wants to survive. Lale understands and starts to think of a way out of this, but then Jakob surprises him by saying he will not accept any names from him.

Jakob will beat Lale and will make it look bad, but he’s not going to torture him like they want. He will kill Lale to keep him from suffering if he has to, but he will not take names. He doesn’t want any more innocent blood on his hands. If killing Lale means saving several others, he’ll do it for both their sakes. Lale tells Jakob to do what he must. **When he is alone, Lale comes to terms with his impending death. He hopes someone will tell Gita.**

The next day, Jakob takes Lale from his cell. He drags him into another room, one with handcuffs attached to the ceiling and a long switch on the floor. Two SS officers are there to observe, but they look thoroughly bored. Jakob punches Lale in the face. Lale sees Jakob rearing a leg back for a kick and backs up just as the foot lands. He feigns more pain than he actually feels. Another punch lands, this time breaking Lale’s nose. Blood gushes, and suddenly the officers are more intrigued.

Jakob puts Lale in the handcuffs and whips him several times on his back and behind with the switch. This time, Lale is not feigning the pain. Jakob grabs Lale by the hair and pulls his head back. **He screams for Lale to talk, but then he quickly whispers that Lale should say nothing and pretend to pass out.** Another punch lands in Lale’s gut, and he passes out. Jakob tells the officers that Lale doesn’t know anything. If he did, he would have said it. The officers leave, and Jakob takes Lale back to his cell.

For the next few days, Jakob brings Lale food and water and gives him clean shirts to wear over his wounds. Lale will be scarred for life, Jakob says, but he’ll survive. Lale isn’t so sure Jakob’s words are true when officers pull him from the cell the following day. He’s delivered back to Houstek, who accepts that Lale has no information. Still, he must be punished. He sends Lale to live in a block designated for hard labor.

### The Golden Boy

Lale’s new job is one he’s seen several times during his walks from Birkenau to Auschwitz. He and the other men are taken to the fields between the compounds and are forced to move large boulders from one side of a field to the other. When all the boulders have been moved, they must move them back. The last man to arrive is shot.

Lale performs as best as he can in his weakened state. He comes in second-to-last once, but he makes it through the day. On the way back to camp, Baretski appears by Lale’s side. **Lale knows that talking to Baretski informally will make him seem like a traitor to the others, but he has a plan and must risk it.** He tells Baretski to let Gita know where he is and to make sure she tells Cilka.

Baretski follows through and passes on Lale’s message. Gita’s relief that Lale is alive consumes her. She runs to her friends to share the good news and tells Cilka what Lale said. Cilka doesn’t know what she can do to help, but there must be something if he wants her to know. She finally understands that night lying next to Schwarzhuber in bed. She says she has never asked for anything or refused him before, but now she needs a favor.

The next day, Lale struggles through another grueling day of boulder moving. His body aches so badly, he feels resentment for a dead body he and another man are tasked with carrying. He stops, wondering who he has become. Back inside the camp, Lale sees Cilka and Schwarzhuber standing off to the side. **A guard tells Lale he is being sent back to his old block. Cilka came through.**

When Lale returns to his block, the Romany stare in disbelief. They all thought he was surely dead. Through the sea of people waiting to welcome him back, Lale sees Nadya. He walks to her and wipes away her tears. He is overcome with emotion and runs to his room, not wanting everyone to see him break down. He lies on his bed, unable to believe he is still alive.
