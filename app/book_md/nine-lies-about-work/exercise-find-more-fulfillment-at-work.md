## Exercise: Find More Fulfillment at Work

Buckingham and Goodall write that you should forget about work-life balance and find more fulfillment in your work by doing more of the tasks that you love.

* * *

List your work tasks in the past week and divide them into two categories: what you loved (something you looked forward to and that energized you) and what you hated (something you put off doing or passed on to someone else).

Look at the list of things that you loved. How can you incorporate more of these tasks into your work?

Look at the list of things that you hated. How can you do _less_ of this type of work or make it more bearable (for example, enlist a team member to help you)?
