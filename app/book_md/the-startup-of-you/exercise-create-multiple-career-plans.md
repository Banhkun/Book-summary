## Exercise: Create Multiple Career Plans

Develop three career plans so that you can adapt to changes in the modern work world.

* * *

First, describe your Plan A. What is the current career path you're on? In what ways are you currently using your skills and knowledge?

Next, to make a Plan B, consider something that you're interested in, which is different from yet related to Plan A. For example, if you work in HR, you might be interested in a career in coaching.

What's one way you can prepare yourself to pivot to your Plan B? For example, you could take courses, intern, or volunteer in that field.

Lastly, form a Plan Z by considering what you can fall back on if your first two plans don't work out. What's a temporary job you could take up to support yourself financially?
