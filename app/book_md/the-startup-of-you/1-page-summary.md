## 1-Page Summary

In _The Startup of You_ , entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha argue that, in the 21st century, you can no longer rely on employers to invest in your professional success. Instead, you must invest in _yourself_ and treat your career like a startup company—as something that’s always growing and adapting. By applying principles of entrepreneurship to your career (like developing a competitive edge, building a strong network, and taking smart risks), you can overcome unexpected obstacles, react quickly to opportunities, and build a successful career in the fast-changing modern world.

Reid Hoffman is the co-founder of LinkedIn and a successful investor who has backed over 100 startups. Ben Casnocha is the co-founder of the venture capitalist firm Village Global. Hoffman and Casnocha have also collaborated on the best-selling book, _The Alliance_.

In this guide, we’ll first explain how the world of work has changed and why the authors suggest that everyone approach their careers as if they were startup companies. Then, we’ll discuss what a startup mindset is and the three entrepreneurship principles that can help you craft a successful career. Along the way, we’ll supplement Hoffman and Casnocha’s strategies with those of other business professionals and provide actionable suggestions on how to apply their strategies to your career.

### The Modern Professional World: All Careers Are Like Startups

Hoffman and Casnocha argue that the work world has changed: Half a century ago, as long as you worked hard, you ascended the career ladder and then retired. Today, however, **job stability is all but gone and** **all careers are now like startups, or brand new companies built from the ground up.** We’ll discuss this idea later in this section and will first provide some background on how the working world has changed.

(Shortform note: In _Thank You For Being Late_ , Thomas Friedman explains why not only the work world but the _entire_ world feels more unstable in the 21st century than in the 20th century: Change is happening at a faster rate than ever before. He explains that humans generally need about 10 to 15 years to adapt to societal and technological change. During the 1900s, it took over 20 years for inventions and technological progress to make the world look different. Since 2016, however, the world feels noticeably different after only five to seven years—a faster rate than we can keep up with.)

#### Technology, Globalization, and the End of Traditional Career Development

How did these changes to the professional landscape come about? According to the authors, **technology and globalization have turned the work world from one defined by stability and streamlined careers to one defined by constant flux and competition**.

First, technology has led to the automation of more and more industries, which has rendered entire career paths obsolete. Hoffman and Casnocha argue that while technology also leads to new jobs, it displaces more jobs than it creates. Additionally, these new jobs often require people to invest more time and education to learn different and more advanced skills.

Second, technology has led to globalization—people can hire and collaborate professionally with others all across the world. We now have far more competitors than ever before, competitors who often already possess the qualifications to do the jobs we want and are willing to do them for less pay. As a result, employers no longer invest money and time into your career development but expect you to train yourself or to learn quickly.

In short, the ready access to a global pool of candidates has eroded the traditional loyalty between an employer and their employees. In this new era of work, instead of staying at one company for the greater part of their careers, people are now changing jobs more frequently or working multiple jobs.

> **The Power of the Individual in a Globalized World**
> 
> While Hoffman and Casnocha argue that technology and globalization have led to greater instability and competition in the work world,__ other experts contend they’re _equalizing_ forces, giving power to more individuals than ever before. In _The World Is Flat_ , Thomas Friedman argues that technology (personal computers and the internet, in particular) has contributed to the _flattening—in other words, the elimination of hierarchies of power—of the world_ : Billions of people now possess the same __ access to information and opportunities to advance their personal and professional goals.
> 
> In his other book, _Thank You For Being Late_ , Friedman goes into greater detail about what we might expect from the rise of automation and globalization:
> 
> **Automation:** Hoffman and Casnocha don’t go into detail about what new jobs are emerging as a result of automation, but Friedman says that “stempathy” jobs, or those requiring _both_ technical and people skills (“stempathy” is a portmanteau of “STEM” (science, technology, engineering, math) and “empathy”), have seen salaries increase since 2000. This is because jobs requiring only technical knowledge can be automated, and those requiring only people skills have low pay and high competition as they can often be performed by many people.
> 
> **Global Competition:** Like Hoffman and Casnocha, Friedman notes that competition for jobs has become fiercer, adding that motivation is now the key factor for success. He explains that you must not only compete with more candidates but also work harder because everyone has the same access to the same information.
> 
> **Job Instability:** Friedman argues that the world is changing so quickly that your existing knowledge and education don’t hold up as long as they used to. Hoffman and Casnocha argue that to keep up, you must continually work to adapt your career. To do this, Friedman says we must embrace lifelong learning and create platforms that support people’s abilities to learn new skills quickly to keep up with the fast pace of change.

#### The Shift Toward Careers as Startups and the Startup Mindset

The authors argue that because of these changes in modern work, **you deal with many of the same conditions and challenges that startup founders face** : limited time and resources, fierce competition over opportunities, and constant risk and uncertainty. Startup lifespans are often short, and similarly, people are staying at companies for shorter periods. Successful startups are aggressive and adaptive no matter how much they expand.

(Shortform note: Because startups must contend with highly uncertain conditions, they can't rely on traditional business strategies to succeed. In _The Lean Startup_ , Eric Ries argues that startups must instead be flexible and continually _build, measure, and learn_ : create something of value, collect feedback, and adjust their strategies based on that information. Ries advises you to run through this experimentative cycle as quickly as possible so you have more opportunities to pivot.)

To thrive in the job market, therefore, you must treat your career like a startup by adopting a startup mindset. The authors write that **a startup mindset is founded on the idea of _constant growth_. **Because career paths are no longer straightforward, you must always treat yours as “in development.” To do this, make improvement a permanent goal by always seeking to expand your skills and finding new ways to use your knowledge. When you prioritize skill-building and improvement, you’ll be able to pivot to different career paths with ease and success if better opportunities come along.

(Shortform note: While the authors recommend you pursue constant growth, they don’t specify how _quickly_ you should aim to grow and improve. For James Clear, slow growth is better than rapid improvement. He explains that pursuing fast, dramatic improvements is hard and can lead to burnout and frustration. Instead, Clear recommends you focus on making small changes—aim to be 1% better every day. These small improvements make a big impact on your overall skill level, he explains: After a year, you’ll be 37 times better at performing a skill than you were when you started.)

A startup mindset is crucial to succeeding in the uncertain and ever-changing conditions of the job market and economy. It allows you to keep pace with the fast-changing professional landscape and to act swiftly on new opportunities so that you can excel in the global economy.

(Shortform note: In _Mindset_ , Carol Dweck, who coined the term “growth mindset,” a concept similar to the startup mindset, elaborates on why it can be hard to focus on growth. She explains that everyone is born with a desire to learn. However, as we get older, some of us develop _fixed_ mindsets that cause us to value the outcomes of our efforts—whether it was a success or failure—over growth. To develop a growth mindset, Dweck suggests creating a persona for your fixed-mindset beliefs, pretending to have a conversation with it, and identifying what triggers your fixed-mindset thinking.)

### Your Career as a Startup: Three Entrepreneurship Principles

Now that we’ve discussed the importance of a startup mindset, let’s look at how you can treat your career like a startup: by developing your competitive edge, becoming adaptive to changing circumstances, and cultivating a network of supporters. By applying these skills to your career, you can stand out from your competitors, make bold career decisions, and navigate unexpected obstacles.

#### Principle 1: Develop Your Competitive Edge

To stand out in any career field, the authors suggest you **develop a unique competitive edge—something that makes you different and better than other people.** In a global work economy, you’re competing with many people with similar capabilities. Success relies on making yourself seem more valuable and desirable than others. According to the authors, your competitive edge is made up of a foundation of valuable assets, a guiding set of personal values and ambitions, and an understanding of your market’s needs.

(Shortform: Hoffman and Casnocha’s strategy for developing your competitive edge involves asking yourself what you _have_ , but it’s equally important to assess what you _lack_ when trying to stay on top of the competition. Consider doing a personal SWOT analysis, a technique often used by businesses when planning out their strategies. Using this framework, you identify not only your strengths but also your weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. When thinking about opportunities, for example, you might notice that your current company offers free training for a new technology that you can take advantage of to build your competitive edge.)

##### Identify and Strengthen Your Assets

Like founders of successful startups, you must **identify and strengthen your unique assets to gain an edge over competitors**. Your assets are the resources you have, whether they be your skills, knowledge, and connections (what the authors refer to as “soft assets”) or your money and possessions (“hard assets”).

Hoffman and Casnocha note that it’s easier to identify your hard assets since they’re physical or quantifiable, while soft assets might be more difficult to recognize. To identify your soft assets, reflect on things that you consider easy but _other_ people find challenging. For example, your research skills might be a soft asset—when investigating an obscure problem as part of a project, you might find that your colleagues struggle to search for solutions and that you’re able to locate helpful leads easily.

(Shortform note: Seeking out activities that other people find challenging but you find easy can also help you understand what Tom Rath describes in _StrengthsFinder 2.0_ as your innate abilities. While many self-improvement thinkers suggest you work to negate your weaknesses, Rath advises you to build upon your existing _strengths_ because it will take longer and be more difficult to overcome weaknesses than to advance your innate talents.)

Hoffman and Casnocha recommend you focus on building skills and knowledge over earning money. They note that, while you need money to support your lifestyle and take career risks, skills and knowledge are far more valuable because they allow you to capitalize on new and more lucrative opportunities. When developing your soft assets, prioritize building _specialized_ skills first—those that fit a specific niche and preferably have less competition. When you know one aspect of your field well, you can stand out and build a professional network more easily.

(Shortform note: Another reason not to prioritize money over learning new skills is that having too much of it can make you complacent and feel less motivated to work hard. In _The Unfair Advantage_ , Ash Ali and Hasan Kubba argue that money doesn’t equate to success, adding that many failed startups have been started by wealthy founders. Like Hoffman and Casnocha, they recommend you develop soft assets such as your social skills and connections, which don’t have the drawbacks of hard assets.)

##### Define Your Values and Ambitions

Another important part of creating your competitive edge is **defining your unique personal values and ambitions**. These help guide you throughout your career and differentiate your work from your competitors’. Hoffman and Casnocha explain that when you figure out what matters to you, whether it’s becoming influential, making others happy, or a more specific cause like promoting sustainable living, you’ll be internally motivated to pursue your career goals. When you’re internally motivated, you work harder and create higher quality work.

(Shortform note: The authors of _The Unfair Advantage_ echo Hoffman and Casnocha’s suggestion of identifying your personal values and ambitions, stating that entrepreneurs need a clear “why” to stay focused and motivated. They suggest you set both externally motivated goals that serve you, such as becoming wealthy, and internally motivated goals that serve others, such as promoting opportunities for young creatives. This provides you a sense of fulfillment regardless of whether or not you achieve your external goal.)

To define your values, the authors recommend you periodically reflect on your values and ambitions to see if they’ve changed or consider talking about them with people who know you well. They argue that your aspirations will change and evolve as you progress through life, so you should accept occasional uncertainty and be comfortable with experimentation.

(Shortform note: Tony Robbins advises a more proactive approach to setting values than what the authors describe. In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Robbins writes that values are formed subconsciously based on your life experiences and interactions with other people. However, he adds that you can actively _change_ your values by ranking your current values in order of importance to you and then shifting them around to reflect the ranking you _want to_ have. You’ll then need to internalize these values, which is easier to do if you put the list somewhere you’ll see it often.)

##### Cater to Your Market’s Needs

While it’s important to be passionate about your work, the authors argue that the best entrepreneurs are both realistic and visionary. To turn your assets and passions into a successful career, **you must create work that appeals to your market** —**the people who will buy what you’re offering.** Whether you’re a leadership coach or a game designer, you have an audience you’re catering to. Hoffman and Casnocha stress that success in the real world is determined by how other people value our work—whether they find your coaching relevant or your games entertaining.

> **Identify Your Market’s Needs Through Validated Learning**
> 
> How do you know what appeals to your market? In _The Lean Startup_ , Eric Ries provides a method for startups to effectively learn their market’s needs: “validated learning,” which involves experimenting and gathering data. Ries argues that in uncertain conditions, you can’t just rely on your assumptions about what people want—you must gather real data by forming and testing a hypothesis.
> 
> For your own work (whether you’re a leadership coach or a food truck owner), form a hypothesis about what customers want and create a minimum viable product—something with only the basic features needed to be used and tested by customers—to gauge how successful it might be. For example, as a coach, you might create a quick webinar about a topic you want to discuss and gauge how people react to it.

In other words, you can enhance your competitive edge by keeping the market’s needs in mind. The authors advise you to research what people value to identify fast-growing industries or a popular market that relates to your skills and values. Then, try to locate a niche with little competition so that your skills can stand out. For example, as a game designer, you might notice a growing interest in health and wellness and consider creating games about self-care.

(Shortform note: In _Designing Your Life_ , Bill Burnett and Dave Evans argue that experimentation can help you locate hidden and potentially hot job markets. They suggest you interview people in your field of interest and test out the jobs by volunteering or interning. The authors explain that most jobs aren’t advertised and argue that these methods give you direct access to and knowledge about job markets under most people’s radar.)

#### Principle 2: Be Adaptive

In addition to developing competitive advantages, like successful startups, you must also **become adaptive in your career**. When you prioritize adaptability, you can not only survive unpredictable challenges but also seize unexpected opportunities. To fashion a flexible career path, the authors suggest you create backup plans, open yourself up to more opportunities, and take calculated risks.

(Shortform note: Research supports Hoffman and Casnocha's suggestion to be adaptive, with one study finding that adaptability leads to higher career satisfaction and performance. Psychologists determined four traits that can be used to measure career adaptability: concern (how much you prepare for future challenges), control (how much effort and discipline you put into your work), curiosity (how open you are to exploring new and different opportunities), and confidence (how well you believe you can overcome challenges). These traits—concern and confidence, in particular—predicted more career satisfaction and success over other measurements like demographics or personality traits.)

##### Create Multiple Career Plans

To navigate the ever-changing job landscape, **plan out three possible career paths instead of a single one**. The authors explain that many startup companies became successful not because they had a brilliant idea from the start but because they could pivot quickly when their idea failed or when a better direction opened up. Like these successful startups, make plans so that you’re prepared to switch paths easily, take risks, and be resilient to setbacks. Here are the three plans you should have in place:

**Your Current Path (“Plan A”):** This is the path that you’re currently on or the field that you’re working in. For example, you might be working full-time as a software engineer.

**Your Alternative (“Plan B”):** Your alternative plan should be in a field related to Plan A, one that you can turn to if you run into problems with your current path or if a promising opportunity suddenly appears. For example, if you’re a software engineer, your Plan B might be related to game development. If you suddenly notice an exciting opportunity, such as promising advances in virtual reality, you can pivot quickly to seize it. The authors advise you to shift to Plan B before you think you should or consider starting it up on the side.

**Your Last Resort (“Plan Z”):** Your last resort plan is where you go to regroup if opportunities fall through or if the risks you take don’t work out. This could mean moving back in with your parents or working temporary gigs like driving for rideshare services. When you have a Plan Z, you feel more comfortable taking risks and acting quickly on potential life-changing opportunities.

> **How to Create Multiple Career Plans: Other Perspectives and Suggestions**
> 
> Hoffman and Casnocha explain the different career plans you should have, but they don’t go into much detail on how you can develop them. Other experts provide insights on career planning that you can consider when creating your three plans:
> 
> **Plan A:** Hoffman and Casnocha write that your Plan A is the current path you're on. However, to improve the chances that Plan A goes well, you should still think about the future and plan how you should best continue down your current career path. Experts say you should reflect on your career path every six months to determine if you’re still headed in the direction. And if you see obstacles ahead, stay committed and don’t immediately switch plans.
> 
> **Plan B:** Other experts point out what signs you can look for to know when it might be time to pivot to Plan B. First, if you’re losing excitement or engagement for your current work, consider seeking new opportunities. Similarly, if you haven’t received a promotion or gotten new or different responsibilities in over three years, you should consider pivoting because you’re not able to build your skills in your current environment. Lastly, consider whether your current role enables the lifestyle you want—if not, consider pivoting.
> 
> **Plan Z:** Experts suggest several preparations you can make in case of major career setbacks: Always perform quality work so that you’ll have strong references who can vouch for you, create an emergency fund that can cover all of your expenses for at least three months, and proactively build a network. While Hoffman and Casnocha recommend having a side hobby to test out a Plan B, working on a side hobby you can profit from can also help sustain you if you must fall back and regroup with your Plan Z.

##### Attract Opportunities

Plans can help you maneuver through the unpredictable work world, but success often comes in the form of unexpected opportunities that you must quickly adapt to. While you might not be able to predict which opportunities will be truly transformative, you can increase the odds by learning to attract _more_ of them.

(Shortform note: Being able to seize unexpected opportunities is a factor that makes you “lucky,” according to one study. The study found that it’s not so much that some people are lucky and others are unlucky when it comes to chance opportunities—it’s that “lucky people” are better at _noticing_ opportunities than “unlucky people.” This is because they have a broader and more open focus—rather than looking for what they want, they remain open to what’s possible. Similarly, they actively vary their routines, which increases the chances of encountering opportunities.)

Hoffman and Casnocha write that **to expose yourself to more opportunities, you must develop your curiosity and get involved with different groups of people**. The more information and people you encounter, the more you increase the chances that you’ll encounter a breakthrough idea, a favorable opportunity, or a new passion. Specifically, the authors recommend you find small, informal groups of people who share similar interests or goals. Whether it’s a club or an alumni association, tight-knit and niche networks often circulate the richest ideas—each individual has their own ideas and connections that can benefit you.

(Shortform note: Joining groups isn't always easy, especially if you're introverted. To become a better “joiner,” experts recommend you practice by talking more with your coworkers or reconnecting with an old friend. Then, join a casual networking event with people that have shared interests or hobbies since it’s easier to find topics to discuss. If you don't know anyone, approach others who are alone or groups of people standing in an open formation rather than a closed circle as they tend to be more open to others joining the conversation.)

##### Take Calculated Risks

Once you’re attracting more opportunities into your life, how do you know which ones to pursue? To be adaptive in your career, you must**take smart risks—those with benefits that outweigh any possible negative outcomes**. To assess whether a risk is worth taking, ask yourself if you can handle the worst-case scenario.

For example, you might be working on a project that requires you to invest some personal funds to launch it on a new platform. If some extra money could make your project more successful, and losing that money wouldn’t hurt you, the risk might be a smart one to take.

> **An Exercise for Assessing Risk**
> 
> In _Tools of Titans_ , Tim Ferriss says that people often let opportunities pass them by because of fear, and he provides an exercise you can do to overcome fear and determine whether a risk is worth taking. Like Hoffman and Casnocha, he recommends you consider the worst case scenario but suggests you additionally ask yourself how likely it is to occur and how you could bounce back from it. Then, Ferriss suggests you consider what the _best_ case scenario would be and reflect on how it would improve your life. You can further imagine how your life would be if you _don’t_ take the risk and consider whether you’d have any regrets.
> 
> Once you've run through these imaginary scenarios, you'll get a clearer picture of how each outcome will affect your life, and you might realize that the risk isn't as dangerous as you first considered it to be.

According to Hoffman and Casnocha, people tend to _overestimate_ risk, which holds them back from pursuing opportunities that could lead to rapid career growth. There’s an evolutionary reason behind this aversion to risk: Our ancestors were more likely to survive by playing it safe. Today, we no longer face life-threatening dangers, but our heightened sensitivity to risky situations remains.

(Shortform note: Other experts note that, in certain situations, people also have a tendency to _underestimate_ risk because of the optimism bias—the belief that we’re more likely to experience positive events and less likely to experience negative events. For example, you might neglect to wear a helmet while riding a bike because you assume that you will never crash. Psychologists explain that our optimism bias, like risk aversion, is an evolutionary adaptation—one that improves your happiness and well-being since you worry less and feel more hopeful about the future.)

Taking the occasional risk, the authors argue, actually prepares you for more long-term success than pure stability. That’s because when things go wrong in your career, you’ve had practice overcoming uncertainties and setbacks.

(Shortform note: Taking the occasional risk not only helps you with career success but allows you to live a life with fewer regrets. In _Who Will Cry When You Die_ , Robin Sharma says that taking risks allows you to experience more than someone who avoids adventurous experiences out of caution.)

#### Principle 3: Build a Strong Network

Now that you’ve learned to be competitive and flexible with your career, let’s look at another key tool successful startups use: a strong network. Without supporters and advisors, you can only make decisions based on your limited perspective and knowledge. A network, however, exposes you to many different perspectives that can help you make professional decisions and provide you with a wealth of opportunities, insights, and support.**** Even further, Hoffman and Casnocha point out that the people around you affect the kind of person you _become_ , so you should network with people you want to be like.

(Shortform note: Groups are even more intelligent when they’re diverse, argues Matthew Syed in _Rebel Ideas_. This is because groups whose members come from different backgrounds and have different perspectives have greater overall knowledge to draw on than groups whose members all think alike. As a result, diverse groups enjoy enhanced intelligence and innovation as long as each individual is competent. When building a network as Hoffman and Casnocha recommend, consider how diverse your connections are.)

##### Build Networks by Giving Value

According to Hoffman and Casnocha, a strong network is made up of diverse connections and close relationships, which you can cultivate by **viewing networking as forming genuine and mutually-beneficial relationships.** Instead of focusing on getting something out of your contacts, take interest in their concerns, too. When building your network, the authors suggest you focus on having _strong_ relationships rather than making many surface-level connections. This generates the most reliable support, opportunities, and ideas to aid you in your professional growth.

The authors offer a few suggestions for building and strengthening your network:

**Give value to others first.** To nurture your connections, take time to figure out what they value and offer them something first. It doesn’t have to be anything costly, the authors argue. You could provide insider information, help them practice for a job interview, or put your existing skills to use, like by giving them a painting to hang up in the bakery they just opened.

**Accept their help.** According to the authors, people enjoy helping others as it makes them feel good about themselves and strengthens their relationship with you. When people offer to help you, accept with gratitude.

**Stay in touch.** Many people are afraid that they’ll annoy others by trying to keep in touch, but the authors argue that this is rarely the case and encourage you not to assume so unless they give you a definitive “no.” Often, if you don’t receive a response, it might be because people are busy and want to be sure that you actually care about connecting with them and are willing to follow up. To show that you care, the authors advise you to reach out with a personalized message focused on _them_ rather than an update about yourself or a generic greeting.

> **Additional Suggestions For Building Your Network**
> 
> In _Never Eat Alone_ , Keith Ferrazzi argues that you must develop your connections _before_ you need them and provides more detailed suggestions you can consider when building your network as Hoffman and Casnocha advise. He agrees with the two authors that networking is a two-way street and adds that taking without giving can give you a bad reputation because you’ll be viewed as selfish or exploitative.
> 
> **Give value to others first:** When thinking of what you can offer the other person, Ferrazzi points out that you’ll need to take the initiative in identifying what they need because many people are reluctant to ask for help. To do this, he recommends you look for any hints during your conversations with them, browse their social media, and reflect on what their motivations are. If you can’t identify any specific needs, Ferazzi states that everyone values health, wealth, and their children, which you can support.
> 
> **Accept their help:** Ferrazzi agrees with Hoffman and Casnocha that you should accept help from your connections, adding that, contrary to what many believe, there’s no limit to how many times someone is willing to help you. In fact, asking repeatedly for someone’s help communicates to them that you consider them valuable and capable, strengthening your relationship and making them like you more.
> 
> **Stay in touch:** Like Hoffman and Casnocha, Ferrazzi advises you to stay in touch with your contacts. He adds that following up is important for both existing contacts and new contacts. For existing contacts, reaching out frequently shows that you care and value them, which makes them more likely to continue their relationship with you. For new contacts, Ferrazzi writes that they’ll forget about you if you don’t follow up since they likely meet new people regularly. He recommends you follow up with new contacts within 24 hours and a second time within the month so that you can continue to deepen the relationship.

##### Cultivate Three Types of Relationships

The authors identify three types of relationships that you should cultivate in your network:

**Close Allies:** People you regularly consult, support, and collaborate with. You share a mutual feeling of trust and friendship as well as publicly promote and defend each other’s work and reputation.

(Shortform note: In _The Compound Effect_ , Darren Hardy advises that you carefully choose the people you regularly collaborate with. He explains that the five people you associate most closely with affect the kind of person you become. You become like the people you associate with because you regularly talk about the same things, do the same activities, and consume the same information. Hardy recommends you think about the people you spend the most time with and sort them into three categories: negative influences you should detach from, limiting influences you should spend less time with, and positive influences you should spend more time with.)

**Acquaintances:** People with whom you’re friendly yet share less of a personal relationship, such as your coworkers or old classmates. The unique advantage of having acquaintances, the authors explain, is that they often frequent different social circles than you and your closest allies, so they can offer valuable perspectives, expertise, and opportunities that can be helpful for your career.

(Shortform note: In _The Defining Decade_ , Meg Jay echoes Hoffman and Casnocha’s claim that weaker acquaintance relationships can offer more promising opportunities because new opportunities almost always come from outside of your close contacts. She suggests you reach out to weaker connections by asking for a specific and easy favor. When you ask for a favor, research the other person and make sure your request matches their interests and expertise.)

**Followers:** People you might not directly interact with but who follow you on social media. When you have many followers, you can get in touch with influential people, get your work noticed, and stay up to date with your field. The advantage of cultivating followers is that it creates a self-perpetuating cycle—the more followers you gain, the more attention you get, leading to even more followers.

(Shortform note: Having many followers on social media can improve your reputation and help you attract opportunities because of social proof—evidence of how valuable you are based on how others view you. According to a survey, 60% of employers look at candidates’ social media activity when making hiring decisions. When you have many followers saying good things about you, you develop trust with employers even before they meet you. Conversely, when you lack visible supporters, there’s little proof of your successes or authenticity.)

##### Seek Information From Your Network

When you’ve built a strong network, it can offer personalized advice and insights about your career that you won’t be able to find in books or on the internet. Like successful entrepreneurs, you must **learn to extract insights from your network to navigate uncertainties, stay on top of new developments in your field, and make important career decisions.** Hoffman and Casnocha advise you to practice communicating with your network regularly to best benefit from their information and expertise.

(Shortform note: While Hoffman and Casnocha suggest you communicate frequently with your network, experts suggest you be careful when consulting multiple advisors because people’s perception of you changes based on whether or not you take or ignore their advice. Studies have shown that, when advisors know that they’re one of several experts that the advice-seeker has consulted, they’re more likely to believe that their advice will be disregarded and distance themselves from the relationship. Consequently, they tend to view the advice-seeker more negatively.)

To get the best advice, Hoffman and Casnocha recommend you:

**Figure out who to consult.** First, consult with the most relevant experts to your situation—those most knowledgeable or experienced with what you’re dealing with. For example, if you’re considering going back to school to get another degree, reach out to someone in your network who has that degree or works in a related field. After you’ve talked with them, reach out to close allies who know you well and can help you assess the relevance of the information based on your _personal_ situation. Additionally, consider asking people whose judgment you trust in general, as they can often provide valuable outside perspectives on your situation.

**Ask good questions.** When asking for advice or information, avoid making it seem like an interrogation, which might make the other person uncomfortable and prevent them from sharing rich insights. Instead, encourage a real conversation by preparing a handful of good questions such as, “What’s the most exciting development in your field these days?” Ask both broad and specific questions to get the best information. If you’re interested in discussing a topic deeply, try framing the question in a new way.

(Shortform note: In addition to asking good questions to help your contact feel comfortable, you can also try displaying open body language and mirroring how they speak (such as softly or enthusiastically). Repeat back some of their words, but don’t interrupt them mid-sentence.)

**Synthesize the information.** Once you’ve spoken with different people, take time to synthesize the information you received and assess what’s helpful and what’s less relevant. Since everyone has their own biases and experiences, you can get the most out of your network’s knowledge by carefully comparing different pieces of information and making sense of contradictions.

**Listen to your instincts**. Hoffman and Casnocha advise you to check in with your instincts before and after you consult your network. Often, you’ll have a gut feeling about a career decision. If there’s no time to discuss an opportunity with your network, the authors say you should practice feeling comfortable with making decisions based on your gut feeling.

> **Assess the Relevance of Your Network’s Advice**
> 
> While Hoffman and Casnocha point out the different types of experts you can consult, others stress that taking in more information isn’t always better if it only confuses you or wastes your time. Therefore, it might behoove you to _vet_ the information you receive to gauge its relevance and helpfulness to you before implementing it.
> 
> You can do this by considering what _type_ of advice your contact is giving you. They can provide you with data, information, or knowledge, whose value and relevance to you ascend in that order. Alternatively, you can simply heed your instincts when talking to a contact. Let’s look at how to best analyze each type of advice.
> 
> **Using just your instincts:** When you receive information (like an email about enrolling in an online degree program), first try to make sense of it according to your instincts. Decisions made by instincts can be done quickly, but are more risky. Like Hoffman and Casnocha point out, sometimes you have little information to go on and must make decisions based on your gut instincts. Consider how you’d feel if your decision was publicized, which might add another level of clarity as to what option is best for you. For example, if you’re considering going back to school, first assess the reasons based on your instincts.
> 
> **Data:** When consulting your network, your connections might provide you with raw facts and statistics. Data can help inform your decisions, but you should avoid basing your decisions entirely on data because they can be incomplete or inaccurate depending on the context. For example, your contacts might provide you with facts about the degree you’re interested in, such as the credit requirements or the salary of potential careers.
> 
> **Information:** Information is data that others have added context and meaning to.**** When you ask people in your network questions, as Hoffman and Casnocha suggest, they can help you make sense of data and turn it into more valuable pieces of information that you can give more weight to when making decisions. For example, your contacts can provide added context and personal opinions about the data you’ve gathered, such as whether the credit requirements are too demanding for your existing lifestyle.
> 
> **Knowledge:** Experts argue that you should give the most weight to knowledge—information that has been analyzed or validated that you can act upon. Knowledge might be the culmination of your conversations with your contacts—once you’ve received data and information, analyze and synthesize the information you’ve received in a way that makes sense to your life.
> 
> When assessing for biases, as Hoffman and Casnocha recommend, consider whether the person you’re talking to is credible and whether they’re giving you data, information, or knowledge. Then, determine if they might have any hidden agendas that could be affecting what they’re communicating to you.
