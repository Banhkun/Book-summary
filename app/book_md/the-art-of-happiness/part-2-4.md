## Part 2.4: Cultivating a Happiness Mindset | Step 3: Exert Yourself to Change

Now that you’ve developed the motivation to change your mindset, the final step of cultivating a happiness mindset is to **make the _effort_ to change**, says the Dalai Lama. We’ll discuss five strategies to make that effort, including, again, specific strategies for the negative emotions of anger and anxiety.

(Shortform note: This chapter falls within the Right Effort step of the Noble Eightfold Path because the following strategies concern altering your thinking—not, as you might think, your _actions_. In the book, Cutler and the Dalai Lama spend the most time on the Meditation and Wisdom parts of The Threefold Way, and little time on the Ethics part, which, again, concerns behavior, speech, and livelihood.)

### Strategy #1: Develop Your Self-Worth

According to the Dalai Lama, to actively cultivate your happiness mindset, **develop your sense of self-worth, regardless of external circumstances**. You don’t need possessions, beauty, or titles to validate you as a human. It’s important to not attach your self-worth to such things, he adds, as they can diminish over time, meaning your self-worth does the same.

(Shortform note: The Dalai Lama advises you to develop your self-worth to cultivate a happiness mindset. Doing this is important for practical reasons, too: When you lack self-worth, you might engage in destructive behaviors in your quest to “earn” your right to exist. In _Dare to Lead,_ Brené Brown writes about employees who overwork themselves to prove their worth. This has negative consequences for the individual and the company.)

### Strategy #2: Combat Negative Emotions With Positive Ones

**When they arise, counter negative emotions with positive ones** , says the Dalai Lama. For instance, when you find yourself consumed with self-reproach over a bad test grade, tell yourself that your worth isn’t dependent on grades and practice kindness toward yourself.

(Shortform note: For Brené Brown, self-compassion is a key tool for combating negative feelings, particularly harmful perfectionism. Brown breaks self-compassion into three parts: 1) Self-forgiveness, 2) self-awareness, and 3) recognition that you’re not the only person struggling with negative feelings.)

Cutler adds that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is a close therapeutic equivalent to the Dalai Lama’s process of combating negative emotions with positive ones. In CBT, you counter distorted thoughts—like the belief that your work must be perfect—with rational ones—like the understanding that you’re human and can’t do everything perfectly.

(Shortform note: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy has a lot in common with this book’s approach to seeking happiness beyond this strategy of countering negative feelings with positive ones. In _The Art of Happiness_ , you learn how to change your mind to be more conducive to happiness. In CBT, you similarly change or shift destructive thought patterns, like black-and-white thinking or catastrophizing. Both approaches aim to alter your mental framework.)

### Strategy #3: Compare Yourself Favorably

Cutler chimes in to advise that you **think about how much better off you are than others** rather than about how much better off others are than you to change your mindset. Your happiness is largely dependent on how well you perceive yourself compared to others. You therefore can decide if you’ll be happy or disgruntled by comparing yourself to either those who are worse off or those who are better off.

(Shortform note: Cutler argues that happiness is relative and that you can make yourself happier by refraining from comparing yourself to those who are better off. But there’s also evidence that certain circumstances can unconditionally increase or decrease happiness. Living amidst war, poverty, or in isolation, for instance, can make you unhappy, no matter how much worse off someone else may be.)

### Strategy #4: Appreciate What You Have

Change your mindset by **being _grateful_ for the things and qualities you do possess, rather than _yearning_ for those you don’t**, says the Dalai Lama. The reason for this is practical: If you try to constantly acquire better things, you’ll eventually run out of things to acquire. When that happens, you’ll become unhappy.

(Shortform note: The Dalai Lama brings up a practical reason to cultivate an appreciation for what you have. But in Buddhism, yearning or “craving,” as it’s commonly referred to, is the actual source of suffering, as described in the Second Noble Truth. This is because satisfying cravings creates only temporary pleasure—like eating sweets. Once that pleasure fades, you’re struck with a new craving and must satisfy that. This craving-and-satisfying keeps you locked in Samsara, the endless cycle of birth, suffering, and death.)

### Strategy #5: Prioritize Happiness Over Pleasure

Learn the distinction between happiness and pleasure, and **prioritize the pursuit of happiness** to strengthen your happiness mindset, advises the Dalai Lama. Happiness is a lasting state of non-suffering while pleasure is ephemeral, contingent on factors outside of your control. A good meal is an example of pleasure: It eventually ends. Happiness, on the other hand, lets you be content even when the meal is over, or even if you don’t get to enjoy a meal.

(Shortform note: The Dalai Lama recommends prioritizing happiness over pleasure, but you could argue that sometimes, it’s better to prioritize fleeting pleasures over long-term happiness. Research indicates that pursuing pleasure can lead to better emotional health while perpetually denying oneself pleasures—food, entertainment, sex, and so on—can lead to distress and anxiety. Perhaps the key is to carefully balance pleasure with happiness and ensure pleasures have a more lasting effect on your life by reflecting on or journaling about them.)

### Anger: Exert Yourself to Be Less Angry

This step of reducing anger is difficult, claims the Dalai Lama, because it’s hard to combat anger in the moment. Both he and Cutler advise against releasing your anger, as that just compounds it. Instead, the Dalai Lama recommends first relying on the work you do _before_ an anger-provoking situation arises: the steps of educating yourself and developing the motivation to not become angry, as discussed previously.

(Shortform note: It’s been scientifically proven that venting about a negative situation only makes you feel worse. The more you complain in a day, the worse you feel your day has been. Not only that, but venting also spreads negative feelings to those you’re complaining to.)

In a heated moment, the Dalai Lama recommends combating anger by first, as much as possible, educating yourself about it. Understand where it came from and if it’s justified. Then, use patience and tolerance to neutralize it. You may not be able to completely eradicate it, but you can at least reduce your anger’s potency.

(Shortform note: You may notice that even _in_ a moment of anger, the Dalai Lama recommends the steps of 1) educating yourself on your anger, 2) motivating yourself to be less angry, and 3) exerting yourself to combat anger. Therefore, even on a micro-level—the exertion step of lessening your anger—the Dalai Lama leans on this threefold process.)

The Dalai Lama also offers two anger meditations that help you deal with anger when it arises:

#### Meditate to Be Less Angry

Visualize someone you know becoming extremely angry. Imagine what they look like and how their anger manifests: Perhaps they look scary and raise their voice. Now, recall a time you’ve been this angry. What did you do and how did you look? Decide that you’ll never again become that angry because of the negative effects on your behavior, appearance, and so on.

(Shortform note: What the Dalai Lama describes here is akin to visualization. This is a technique most often used to help you achieve goals, but the Dalai Lama recommends it to help you _avoid_ bad outcomes. Visualization has benefits beyond reinforcing your determination to do better, as the Dalai Lama indicates: It also primes your subconscious to come up with ideas for _how_ to do better. With anger, therefore, visualization might help you _consciously_ decide to become less angry, but _subconsciously_ , might also prompt you to devise ways to be less angry in the future.)

Here’s another anger meditation: Visualize someone you dislike and allow your natural aversive response to them to manifest in your body. Note how you feel—perhaps your fists clench, your heart rate rises, and your mind clouds with negative thoughts. Now, decide you’ll never allow yourself to become angry in this way again because of the painful effect it has in your body.

(Shortform note: This anger meditation is similar to the more scientific advice to simply pay closer attention to your body when angry. Rather than reacting automatically to an anger trigger, delay your response by considering how the anger _feels_. Being mindful in this way gives your brain time to shift from a reactive and aggressive state to a state of threat response, thus avoiding angry outbursts you’ll later regret.)

### Anxiety: Exert Yourself to Be Less Anxious

The Dalai Lama recommends a two-pronged approach to combating anxiety in the moment: If there’s an actionable solution to the problem that’s giving you anxiety, work toward that solution. For instance, if you’re anxious over whether a fellow party guest will bring the same bottle of wine as you, the solution is to call them and ask, not to fret. If there’s no actionable solution to the problem that’s giving you anxiety, stop worrying. If you can’t get in touch with the other guest, drop the worry. You can’t change anything about the situation, and worrying won’t help.

(Shortform note: If after exerting yourself to be less anxious in the way the Dalai Lama recommends, you still feel anxious, engaging in physical activity can help alleviate remaining anxiety. This is because movement lessens muscle tension, meaning your tense body doesn’t add to your feelings of anxiety. Further, your brain releases neurochemicals like serotonin and GABA, both of which combat anxiety, when you exercise. Finally, the frontal region of your brain is activated, and this keeps activity in the amygdala—the center of reactivity and threat-responses—in check.)

### Cultivating a Happiness Mindset Is a Difficult, Long-Term Process

As you cultivate a happiness mindset, **set realistic expectations for yourself** , advises the Dalai Lama. Change comes about incrementally and requires effort. Being realistic doesn’t mean losing sight of your ultimate goal—happiness—but don’t expect to achieve it right away. The Dalai Lama believes that even if you can make only sporadic progress towards a happiness mindset, you’re succeeding.

(Shortform note: The Dalai Lama here advises you not to expect too much too soon on your path toward achieving a happiness mindset. If you still feel the need to keep track of your progress, though, set small happiness-related goals for yourself. In _The Magic of Thinking Big,_ David J. Schwartz argues that large goals are reached through a series of smaller goals. Achieving a series of small goals gives you a sense of accomplishment and motivates you to stay on the path toward your ultimate goal—in this case, happiness.)

If you still feel that you aren’t making enough progress, zoom out and take a longer-term view, suggests the Dalai Lama. This may help you see that you’ve made strides: You may realize that you’ve become significantly less anxious than you were a year ago, for instance.

(Shortform note: You can maintain the longer-term view the Dalai Lama recommends by writing down your goals and progress toward them and keeping this documentation in an easy-to-see place. This gives you a constant, visual reminder of your long-term progress.)
