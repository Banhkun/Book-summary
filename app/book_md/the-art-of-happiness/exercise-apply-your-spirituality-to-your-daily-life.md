## Exercise: Apply Your Spirituality to Your Daily Life

Determine how to implement a facet of your spirituality in your everyday life.

* * *

Whatever form of spirituality you practice, list one key idea or belief that you’d like to act on in your life more. (If you subscribe to the Buddhist beliefs in this book, you might try to be more compassionate.)

Think about what’s stopping you from implementing that spiritual idea or belief in your life now. How can you adjust your behavior or thoughts so you can act on the belief more easily? (For instance, anger might make compassion difficult for you. You might reduce your anger through meditation or reflection on the benefits of positive emotions, like kindness and compassion.)

Finally, envision a future situation in which you effectively apply the spiritual belief. What does that look and feel like? Be as descriptive as possible. (For instance, you might envision a situation in which you act compassionately, rather than angrily, toward a troublesome neighbor.)
