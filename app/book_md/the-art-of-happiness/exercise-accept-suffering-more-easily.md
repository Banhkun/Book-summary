## Exercise: Accept Suffering More Easily

Train yourself to accept suffering more quickly, so you can move on to eliminating it.

* * *

Think of a recent time when you suffered. This doesn’t have to be a massive bout of suffering—something mundane is fine. Describe the circumstances of the suffering in as much detail as possible. (For instance, you were late to pick up your kids from daycare, and they cried all the way home.)

Now, consider how your thoughts might have exacerbated your suffering. What was going through your head? Did you reproach yourself? Did you blame others? Note as many such negative thoughts as you can. (If you were late to get your kids from daycare, maybe you felt guilty, and this made the experience worse.)

Think about how, instead of letting your thoughts make you feel worse, you could have accepted this moment of suffering as part of life. What kind phrases could you have told yourself to keep negative thoughts at bay? Note as many resonant phrases as possible. (As a late parent, you might have told yourself that everyone is late sometimes; it doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent.)

Finally, think about how you can more quickly move to acceptance of suffering the next time this situation occurs. This might involve telling yourself the kind phrases you noted in the last step, or doing a short breathing exercise to pause the negative thoughts. Write down as many tactics as you can. (If you’re late to pick up your kids again in the future, remind yourself that being a parent is difficult and that you’re doing well in many other ways.)
