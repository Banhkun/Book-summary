## Exercise: Strengthen Your Ability to Choose Happiness Over Pleasure

Understand when you choose pleasure over happiness and how you can avoid doing so in the future.

* * *

Write down a recent instance when you opted for pleasure over happiness. Note what the pleasurable thing or activity was, and what the happiness-increasing thing or activity was. (For instance, you might have chosen to stay home and watch TV rather than go to your parents’ for dinner.) Justify why you chose the pleasurable activity.

Describe how the option you didn’t choose would have made you happier. (For example, seeing your parents would have made you feel connected and loved and minimized regrets you might experience at the end of their lives.)

Note some ways you can help yourself more easily choose happiness over pleasure in future situations. (You might come up with a phrase to say to yourself, or call to mind the experience you’ve noted in this exercise. You might also give yourself more time to think about the decision, so you can motivate yourself to choose the happiness-maximizing option.)
