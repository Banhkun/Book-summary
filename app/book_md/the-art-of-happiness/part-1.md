## Part 1: Your Purpose | Moving Toward Happiness

In _The Art of Happiness,_ the Dalai Lama and psychiatrist Howard C. Cutler outline the Dalai Lama’s beliefs on how to achieve greater happiness in life—by _training_ yourself to be happier. His Holiness the Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibet and a Bodhisattva—someone who’s achieved enlightenment and lives to help others do the same.

The Dalai Lama’s advice for achieving happiness is unique in its simplicity and flexibility. You won’t find elaborate rules or 3-month happiness plans here, because he suggests ways to build happiness that are obvious and even self-explanatory: be empathetic, accept your suffering, learn about your mind. This isn’t to say that implementing those concepts will be easy—it’ll take time and effort—but you have the power now to do so.

The Dalai Lama believes that humans’ purpose is to seek happiness and that all humans possess the innate capacity to be happy. But happiness doesn’t come naturally, and you must _train_ yourself to realize your fullest potential for happiness. We’ll describe four forms of happiness training:

  1. Cultivating a Happiness Mindset
  2. Building Strong Interpersonal Relationships
  3. Working to Eliminate Suffering
  4. Weaving Spirituality Into Daily Life



In this chapter, we’ll first discuss the Dalai Lama’s proposal that your aim in life is to seek happiness. We’ll then describe your innate capacity for happiness and why you must train yourself to be happy.

### Your Purpose Is to Seek Happiness

The Dalai Lama believes that **your purpose as a human is to seek happiness**. He defines happiness as not merely an emotional state, but a mental and intellectual one. It’s about being content with your life on all levels.

(Shortform note: Aristotle also believed that your purpose in life is to achieve happiness. According to him, every goal you set in life, however distant it may _seem_ from happiness, actually is in service of attaining happiness. Let’s say you join a high-intensity fitness program, which, with its grueling exercises, may not seem in service of your happiness. However, when you look at the micro-goals of joining this program, you see they serve the macro-goal of happiness: You join the program to get fit. You get fit to be healthy. You become healthy to be happier.)

Cutler adds that some westerners see striving for personal happiness as a selfish act. But the Dalai Lama argues the opposite is the case: Unhappy people are more self-absorbed than happy people, who are compassionate, helpful, and generous. Therefore, **seeking happiness brings more good into the world**.

(Shortform note: Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs echoes the idea that we’re able to do our best for others when we’re happy and explains why this might be the case. Abraham Maslow posited that human motivation is tiered: We’re first motivated to satisfy simple needs—for shelter, food, and so on—and only motivated to tend to higher-tier needs—friendship, love, and the like—once the simple needs are met. Therefore, until we reach the highest tier, self-actualization—comparable to the attainment of happiness as described by the Dalai Lama—we can’t practice generosity toward others because we’re too busy meeting essential needs.)

### You Can Achieve Happiness Because You’re Innately Compassionate

Not only is your purpose in life to seek happiness, says the Dalai Lama, but you’re also predisposed toward happiness because **you’re innately compassionate and loving**. This belief stems from the Buddhist doctrine of Buddha Nature, the belief in humans’ intrinsic state of purity and positivity.

(Shortform note: Buddhists of different schools perceive Buddha Nature differently. Some believe that you’re born with the seed of Buddha Nature but must _nurture_ it into bloom yourself. Others believe that your Buddha Nature is already fully developed but _hidden_ by your misconceptions of the world. Your goal, then, is to rid yourself of those misconceptions.)

If you don’t believe in Buddha Nature, you’ll find proof of humans’ innate compassion by observing our behavior, claims the Dalai Lama: Children need the compassion, care, and love of their families to survive. **Because they’re necessary to survival, these emotions must be fundamental to human nature**. We’ll call such innate, life-sustaining emotions _positive_ emotions. Cutler adds that there’s scientific research proving humans are inherently kind and altruistic.

(Shortform note: While there is, as the Dalai Lama and Cutler say, evidence of humans’ innate altruism, kindness, and caring, we can’t deny the existence of war, poverty, and hatred. Researchers have tried to account for this by proposing that in the hunter-gatherer societies of 15,000 years ago (and in modern-day ones), altruism was an important survival mechanism. However, when humans developed an agricultural lifestyle, altruism was by necessity replaced with self-serving behavior and hierarchies, which led to conflict. We’ll discuss why later in the chapter.)

#### Negative Emotions Are Rooted in Ignorance, Not Human Nature

According to the Dalai Lama, while positive emotions are part of human nature, other emotions, like hatred, envy, and anger, are not. We’ll call such emotions _negative._ **Negative emotions grow from a fundamental _misunderstanding_ of how the world works**—what Buddhists call “ignorance.” For instance, you may feel the negative emotion of envy toward your wealthy colleague; however, that envy is based on a misunderstanding: You believe that you’re a separate entity from your neighbor, but in reality, there’s no firm boundary between you two.

> **What Is Ignorance in Buddhism?**
> 
> Cutler and the Dalai Lama don’t elaborate on how Buddhism defines “ignorance.” Let’s take a look at the incorrect beliefs that the term “ignorance” in Buddhism encompasses:
> 
>   * The belief in permanence: We cling to states and objects and want them to last forever, not understanding that all things must change.
> 
>   * The belief in independent existence: All existence is conditional. Something creates a noise, for instance—noise doesn’t exist independent of its source. Similarly, outside factors shape humans and their thoughts and behaviors.
> 
>   * The belief in the self: We believe we have a permanent identity when in reality, we’re a composite of five ever-changing factors: physical form, emotions, sensory perception, thoughts, and consciousness.
> 
>   * The failure to understand the Four Noble Truths: The Four Noble Truths truth are the truth of suffering (suffering is inherent to human existence), the origin of suffering (suffering is caused by hatred, craving, and ignorance), the ending of suffering (by achieving Nirvana, a state of enlightenment), and the path toward ending suffering (the Noble Eightfold Path, which includes eight areas of life in which to better yourself).
>

Beyond being misguided, **negative emotions make life harder** , claims the Dalai Lama. If you feel envious of your neighbor, you may behave badly toward them and ruin your relationship.

(Shortform note: The Dalai Lama proposes that negative emotions always make life harder. But can they ever make life easier by steering you clear of bad decisions? Often, in dating, you’re told to heed your instincts—aversion, for instance—as they’re an accurate indication of whether you’ll get along with someone in the long term. Therefore, heeding negative instincts could help preserve your wellbeing.)

##### Conflict Is Rooted in Intellect, Not Human Nature

The Dalai Lama also specifically addresses conflict and war, claiming **these are the products of our _intellect_** , not human nature. Human intellect grew _after_ human compassion to help us navigate increasingly complex societies, says the Dalai Lama. When not coupled with compassion, intellect can be harmful. For instance, we’ve used intellect to harvest energy from natural resources. But, unbalanced by compassion for nature, this intellect has led us to wreak havoc on the planet.

(Shortform note: Anthropologists have made findings that confirm the Dalai Lama’s idea that humans are compassionate first and intelligent—or intelligently self-serving—second. As discussed, altruism was key to survival in hunter-gatherer societies, but not in agricultural societies, which emerged around 12,000 years ago. With farming came the need for specialized positions and hierarchical structures within communities. More complex communities then began dominating simpler communities and taking their resources.)

### Achieving Happiness Requires Training

We’ve just described how humans are primed to be happy and compassionate. But while the Dalai Lama believes that we’re naturally _inclined_ to be happy, he doesn’t believe that humans naturally _know_ _how_ to be happy. However, he says, you can **realize happiness through training**. In the rest of this guide, we’ll present four types of happiness training:

  1. Cultivating a Happiness Mindset
  2. Building Strong Interpersonal Relationships
  3. Working to Eliminate Suffering
  4. Weaving Spirituality Into Daily Life



(Shortform note: To help distinguish between a _capacity_ for happiness and the _actualization_ of happiness, think of a special talent, like playing the piano. Just because you have a gift for the piano doesn’t mean you can play a sonata right away. You need to hone your talent through practice and education. Similarly, just because you have an innate capacity for happiness doesn’t mean you know the steps to be happy. You must learn and practice.)
