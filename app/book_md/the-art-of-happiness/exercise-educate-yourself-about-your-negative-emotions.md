## Exercise: Educate Yourself About Your Negative Emotions

Analyze a negative emotion to understand how it’s based on a misunderstanding of the world.

* * *

Describe a time over the past two weeks when you felt a painful negative emotion. Try to give that emotion a name—like anger, hatred, anxiety, and so on—and note the circumstances that brought it up.

Write down how that negative feeling influenced your subsequent thoughts or actions. (For instance, did it cause you to say something you wouldn’t have otherwise said? Did it lead to a bout of self-reproach?)

Now, trace the negative feeling back to the belief that created it. What worldview, belief about yourself, or belief about how things should work, gave rise to the negative emotion? Describe it in as much detail as possible. (For instance, if you became upset about not being able to exercise as intensely as you once could, perhaps you believe your physical fitness should never change—even though as you age, your body inevitably must change.)
