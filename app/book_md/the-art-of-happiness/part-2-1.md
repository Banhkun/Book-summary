## Part 2.1: Cultivating a Happiness Mindset

In the last chapter, we presented the Buddhist proposal that all humans should seek out happiness by training themselves to be happy in four different ways. We’ll now describe the first of those four ways to be happy: **changing your thoughts and state of mind to be more conducive to happiness**.

(Shortform note: Some might argue that the idea of changing your mind to be more conducive to happiness isn’t realistic. Especially those suffering from PTSD might experience such significant psychological hurdles in daily life—anxiety, difficulty concentrating, flashbacks, and so on—that the prospect of overcoming them by changing their patterns of thought is impossibly difficult.)

Happiness is a mindset you build and isn’t contingent upon external characteristics, like wealth or status, says the Dalai Lama. Such factors can’t confer lasting happiness. You see this in daily life, adds Cutler: When something great happens, like a promotion, you’re temporarily elated but soon return to your normal level of contentment. Similarly, if you suffer a setback, like a breakup, the negative feelings wear off.

(Shortform note: In science, the phenomenon the Dalai Lama and Cutler refer to—the “wearing-off” of positive or negative emotions—is called hedonic adaptation. What’s more, when positive or negative events are repeated, they have a less pronounced effect on mood, and mood returns more quickly to the baseline. If you keep getting promoted, for instance, the promotions will leave you less happy for less time.)

The Dalai Lama warns that **cultivating a happiness mindset takes time and experimentation**. But, adds Cutler, it’s not impossible: Your brain is malleable, and you can rewire it to elevate your general level of happiness.

(Shortform note: Beyond having malleable—what’s referred to in neuroscience as “plastic”—brains, you can _enhance_ the plasticity of your brain by learning new skills, getting plenty of high-quality sleep, and exercising regularly.)

### Cultivate a Happiness Mindset in Three Steps

The Dalai Lama believes there are three steps to cultivating a happiness mindset: **education, development of motivation, and exertion**. We’ll look at each step in the next three chapters.

(Shortform note: Other parts of Buddhist teachings are separated into three steps comparable to the ones outlined by the Dalai Lama here. The Threefold Way, for instance, consists of first establishing self-discipline (or ethics), then concentration (or meditation), and finally, wisdom.)
