## Exercise: Reflect on Your Attitude Toward Happiness

Understand where your own beliefs about happiness overlap and diverge from those of the Dalai Lama.

* * *

The Dalai Lama believes our purpose in life is to seek out happiness. Do you agree with this? Why or why not? Describe any other goals you feel we should pursue in addition to, or instead of, happiness.

The Dalai Lama further believes that you have the ability to bring more happiness into your life by training yourself to be happy. Do you agree? Why or why not? What events from your own life have reinforced this belief?

Regardless of whether or not you believe itâ€™s possible, make a list of specific ways in which the ability to train yourself to be happier _could_ improve your life. (For instance, if you could train yourself to be happier, you might enjoy better mental health.)
