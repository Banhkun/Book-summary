## 1-Page Summary

In _Conversational Intelligence,_ Judith Glaser argues that your success in life and at work depends on your ability to hold a high-quality, trusting conversation—in other words, on your _conversational intelligence._ Being conversationally intelligent means you understand how important conversations are to human development and connection, why _trust_ is a critical piece of a good conversation, and how you can foster trust with your conversation partner. Glaser contends that conversational intelligence is especially important in the workplace, as it can eliminate distrust between leaders and employees that stymies growth and understanding, thus allowing both companies and employees to thrive.

In this guide, we’ll first discuss the importance of conversations in general and the qualities that make a conversation “good.” Then, we’ll explore some tactics you can use to become more conversationally intelligent. We’ll also bring in outside perspectives on effective workplace communication and provide actionables for some of Glaser’s suggestions.

Judith Glaser was an organizational anthropologist who founded and chaired The CreatingWE Institute, which aims to help leaders harness the power of conversation to improve their businesses. Her research spans many fields, including linguistics, neuroscience, and human behavior and development, and she has worked with many high-profile companies. She wrote seven books, including _Creating WE _and _The DNA of Leadership_ , and __ she writes for and coaches business leaders who seek to optimize their understanding of their organizations and improve their overall effectiveness.

### The Importance of Good Conversations to Human Connection

Before we can explain what conversational intelligence is, we need to discuss the importance of conversations and the qualities that define a good conversation according to Glaser.

Glaser claims that good conversations aren’t just about sharing information: **They’re a complex form of social interaction that influences how we see the world, how we act in it, and how we come across to others.** They have the potential to change how we relate to others and give us the opportunity to practice empathy toward them.

(Shortform note: Archaeological research seems to confirm the evolutionary importance of language to human development. Some researchers believe that humans first started speaking with each other (somewhere between 50,000 and two million years ago—the estimated time frame is very wide) to help each other create the stone tools that were critical for their survival. It thus seems that from the beginning, we’ve been using language to help and learn from each other.)

Glaser feels that **all success in life and work depends upon your ability to hold a good conversation**. However, most leaders don’t understand how critical strong conversations are to building healthy, productive relationships at work and how detrimental poor conversations are to those relationships. Often, leaders only initiate poor conversations, which stymies the company’s growth.

(Shortform note: The authors of _Crucial Conversations_ agree with Glaser on the importance of holding good conversations at work, listing more specific competencies that good conversationalists bring to the workplace: Employees who are good at holding conversations are more productive and react faster to financial downturns. They add that many leaders who don’t understand the importance of conversations mistakenly think that policies and organizational systems are what make employees productive and effective—but it’s conversation skills that matter more.)

### Defining Conversational Intelligence

**Conversational intelligence is essentially the ability to _orchestrate_ a good, effective conversation that fosters trust and respect based on your understanding of how the human mind works**.

So what is a good conversation? According to Glaser, a high-quality conversation is one in which you build a dialogue with others, innovate together, let ideas change and evolve, and focus on your community, rather than on yourself. In short, in a good conversation, you don’t cling to your own ideas or try to be right, but instead open yourself to changing from the input of others so that you can come to a solution together.

As a leader, you want most conversations in your workplace to be such high-quality conversations because they’re the most productive and lead to the best outcomes and higher employee happiness.

(Shortform note: Glaser writes that you should focus on your community or team rather than on advancing your own ideas to hold a good conversation. In _The Ego Is the Enemy, _Ryan Holiday offers another reason why you shouldn’t focus so much on yourself, but he frames this argument in the context of personal development rather than workplace productivity. According to him, you achieve more personally when you don’t talk and think about yourself all the time. This is because talking about yourself and your goals eats up time you could spend trying to achieve them. Further, thinking about yourself makes you more concerned with your superiority than the tasks that lead to success.)

For instance, as a conversationally intelligent leader, you might facilitate a successful mediation between two employees because you understand what each person needs from the interaction to be able to rebuild trust in the other. Conversely, if you’re not a conversationally intelligent leader, you might resort to unsuccessful mediation tactics like forcing employees to apologize to each other or list their complaints about the other.

Glaser contrasts good conversations with other types of conversations in which you simply seek to exchange factual information (to set up the time and date of a meeting, for instance) or present a position and try to move the other person to take that position (for instance, if you want your colleague to agree with you on the format of your presentation). These styles aren’t inherently bad and are often necessary. They simply aren’t suited to important, high-level workplace conversations.

(Shortform note: It’s likely that _emotional_ intelligence goes hand-in-hand with conversational intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the capacity to understand and regulate your emotions and to understand the emotions of others. You need emotional intelligence to grasp how others are feeling during a conversation and to steer the conversation to foster trust.)

### Trust is the Foundation of a Good Conversation

Glaser writes that **high-quality conversations** **are built upon a foundation of _trust_**. Trust is the sense that you can express your true thoughts and feelings to the other person and that they will understand and respect these. If other people don’t trust you as a leader, your conversations will never be productive and you’ll never be able to create a collaborative, functional working environment.

(Shortform note: You might also conceive of trust in your workplace interactions as feeling _safe_ in the workplace—this is how Daniel Coyle refers to this concept in _The Culture Code. _He elaborates that a safe workplace facilitates strong chemistry among employees and a willingness to go above and beyond normal responsibilities—two outcomes that Glaser would likely consider part of a collaborative, functional working environment.)

#### The Neurological Underpinnings of Trust

Glaser explains that **feelings of trust and distrust have neurological roots and evolved as a survival mechanism** , which demonstrates how important trust is to our interactions. Let’s look at what happens in the brain when you engage in conversation with someone you distrust versus someone you trust:

Every time you meet someone new, your brain must decide if they’re an ally or an enemy. This is because, from an evolutionary perspective, you need to know if the person wants to harm you, and you therefore need to flee or defend yourself. If your brain decides the other person is an enemy, it goes on the defensive: The amygdala (where fear is processed) is activated, cortisol (the stress hormone) is released, and you’re not able to trust the other person.

**The result of this absence of trust is that you can’t have a productive conversation with the other person** and may resort to using conversations merely to get information across to the other person without soliciting their input.

> **Complicating Glaser’s Neurological Explanation of Trust**
> 
> In _The Body Keeps the Score, _Bessel van der Kolk adds a layer of complexity to Glaser’s explanation of the neurology of trust. Van der Kolk explains that stimuli—for instance, the words and body language of the person you’re talking to—are filtered through two parts of your brain: First through the amygdala, which decides if the stimuli constitute a threat to your well-being. In Glaser’s description, this is when you subconsciously decide if the person you’re talking to is an ally or an enemy.
> 
> But second, that information is also filtered through the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), which is where you logically evaluate the threat level of the stimulus. This is where your brain would decide if _rationally_ , the other person indeed poses a threat to you. Glaser doesn’t mention that information is filtered through this second part of the brain, and its existence seems to undercut her argument that once your amygdala decides the other person is an enemy, you can’t change your mind to be more trusting of them. Conceivably, you might be able to rationalize that though the other person made a bad impression and seems to be adversarial, you should spend more time with them before leaping to conclusions.
> 
> Thus, it’s possible that you can override your initial negative reaction to another person and still have a productive or meaningful conversation.

On the other hand, if you decide the other person is an ally, your brain releases oxytocin, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel connected to others. Your brain also releases happiness hormones like dopamine and serotonin. These hormones help you feel that you can trust the other person. Trust makes you open to their input and to being collaborative—in other words, **it’s only in a trust state that people can hold high-quality conversations**.

(Shortform note: Other researchers agree with Glaser that oxytocin makes you more trusting and connected to others. But they add that this is only toward people you already know and trust—existing allies. Oxytocin paradoxically makes you _less_ trusting of people you don’t already know because it accentuates your instinct to bond with an _in-group_ , which in turn increases your suspicions of _out-groups_. Perhaps, therefore, to reap the connective benefits of oxytocin, you must have repeated positive interactions with someone until you perceive them as an ally, and oxytocin makes you feel more trusting of them and thus able to have a high-quality conversation.)

#### The Compounding Negative Effects of Distrust

**When we feel distrustful of others, we create mental narratives through which we blame others for bad events while ignoring our own contributions to those events**. This can make us feel better about ourselves, but it can interfere with our ability to see a situation clearly, contends Glaser.

For instance, if you’re working with a colleague you don’t trust to do a good job, you might create a mental narrative in which your colleague _always_ overlooks important details. You then exclusively __ blame them when you get negative feedback from your supervisor on a project, telling yourself they messed up yet again.

Then, you may begin paying attention only to inputs that reinforce those mental narratives while ignoring reality. For example, on your project, you might have made mistakes yourself, but you tell yourself those were only due to your colleague’s sloppy work.

In this way, when we are distrusting, we become different people, behaving defensively and often out of character, which continues to alienate others.

> **You Fabricate More Than Narratives About Others**
> 
> It’s human nature to create mental narratives that reflect well on ourselves—not only about people you distrust, but also about much of reality in general. Daniel Gilbert writes in _Stumbling on Happiness _that you do this by interpreting things that happen in your life in a way that reflects well upon you. For instance, if someone says the flowers in your yard are interesting, that word doesn’t inherently have a good or bad connotation, but you’ll likely interpret it as a compliment of your gardening skills because it reflects better on you.
> 
> You also pay far more attention to information that reinforces beliefs you already have than to information that undermines it. If you hear two people debating which flowers are better for your climate, you’ll give more credence to the debater who champions the flowers you like and have in your garden.
> 
> This all simply indicates that it may be difficult to stop creating negative mental narratives about others because you’re naturally inclined to create your own version of reality in general.

### How to Become Conversationally Intelligent

Let’s now discuss how to become more conversationally intelligent and foster more trusting dialogue in the workplace. We’ll cover seven techniques that Glaser recommends can help you do this.

#### 1: Help Employees Answer Five Questions in Every Conversation

To establish trust right away in the conversation, you must be aware that **everyone unconsciously asks themselves five questions about the person they’re talking to at the beginning of every conversation.** These questions are related to whether or not they can trust the other person. As a leader, whenever you talk to an employee, be sure that their answers to these five questions indicate a positive attitude toward your organization.

  1. Do I need to protect myself emotionally and how?
  2. Does this person like me, and can I trust them?
  3. How am I a part of this group?
  4. What do I need to learn or acquire to be successful in this moment?
  5. How can I work with others to create and build something?



> **How to Help Employees Positively Answer the Five Questions**
> 
> Glaser says you must ensure employees can answer the above five questions positively, but she doesn’t indicate how to do so. Let’s go over each question and propose how you might help the employee answer it in a positive way.
> 
>   * **Do I need to protect myself emotionally and how?** Ensure that employees never feel they must protect themselves in a conversation by devoting your full attention to them when they speak and expressing your appreciation for the work they do.
> 
>   * **Does this person like me, and can I trust them?**Simple actions like making eye contact and mirroring body language communicate that you like your employee on a personal level, which lets them trust you.
> 
>   * **How am I part of this group?** This might be as simple as bringing together your team in a casual setting so employees can get to know each other and understand where they fit in.
> 
>   * **What do I need to learn or acquire to be successful in this moment?** This might be a matter of framing conversations for the employee. Doing this lets the employee know what’s about to be discussed and why, and they can decide how they can successfully participate in the conversation.
> 
>   * **How can I work with others to create and build something?** You might clearly communicate the purpose of your organization to help employees understand how they can pursue that purpose alongside colleagues.
> 
> 


#### 2: Identify Your Blind Spots

As a leader, you must **be aware of and work to resolve your conversational blind spots that prevent the other person from trusting you** , writes Glaser. Conversational blind spots are cognitive blocks in the way we see the world and perceive others, which can negatively affect how we interact with them.

(Shortform note: While you’re working on conversational blind spots, it might be helpful to also examine if you have other, general blind spots that affect your ability to lead. Such blind spots can be fear of asking others for help and not respecting the time and needs of employees, among other things. You can combat these by soliciting honest feedback from peers.)

Here are four conversational blind spots:

**Blind Spot 1: We tend to believe others feel and think the same way we do.** If we aren’t open to the possibility that others think differently, then when others disagree with us about an issue, we’ll try to convince them we’re right. This leads to the other person feeling bullied or strong-armed and prevents them from trusting us.

(Shortform note: Glaser mentions these four conversational blind spots but doesn’t always indicate how to avoid them. To combat Blind Spot 1, you might develop empathy, which Brené Brown defines as the capacity to understand what someone else is feeling and to feel that, too. Empathy will allow you to appreciate that others have different opinions and feelings than yours.)

**Blind Spot 2: We aren’t aware that fear and distrust affect how we react to situations.** As we mentioned above, distrust makes you create and reinforce incorrect mental narratives about others. You might thus react to them based on your mental narrative and not based on what they’re actually saying and doing. What’s more, distrust and fear keep you from taking others’ perspectives because you’re on the defensive. You become unable to put yourself into another’s shoes, which makes it hard for them to trust you.

(Shortform note: To know when you’re afraid or distrustful and when those feelings might be impacting your actions, tune in to your body to detect the physical symptoms of fear. These might be an increased heart rate, fast or shallow breathing, sweating, or trembling. If you’re feeling any of these, it may be a sign that you’re afraid and that you’re seeing your conversation partner in a negative light. Consider taking a break from the conversation to allow your fear response to cool.)

**Blind Spot 3: We’re not aware that our memories of a conversation are subjective.** The way we recall a conversation might not be what truly happened, and if we act only based on this subjective reading of a situation, the other person feels they can’t trust us to be open-minded and accepting.

(Shortform note: It’s true that memories are subjective and don’t necessarily reflect what _really_ happened. This is because, when your brain creates a memory, it fills in gaps in that memory—moments or bits of conversation you didn’t store in your mind—with fabricated, assumed information. For instance, if you didn’t store how your co-worker greeted you this morning, you may fabricate a memory in which they greeted you in a rude way. If you assume that’s an objective truth and not a fabrication of your brain, you’ll likely be rude to them in return, reinforcing a cycle of distrust.)

**Blind Spot 4: The listener may misinterpret what the speaker said.** Meaning can be lost or misinterpreted between speaker and listener, so both parties must check in at the conclusion of an interaction to ensure they’re on the same page.

(Shortform note: One way to check in at the conclusion of an interaction—or to fix a misinterpretation—is to use what the authors of _Crucial Conversations _term _contrasting._This is expressing your intention in an “I do/I don’t” statement, as in: “I do need the document by the end of the week. I don’t need it to be perfect.”)

#### 3: Control the Context of a Conversation to Maximize Trust

**To encourage trust from the start of a conversation, control the context in which you hold it** , says Glaser. She refers to this as _priming_ the other person—and yourself—to be trusting and open. You can prime both individuals and groups for more trusting conversations.

##### One-on-One Meetings

For individuals, Glaser suggests you create a context in which you can be warm and receptive to the other person by holding a warm beverage or sitting in a comfortable chair in advance of a meeting. Warmth and comfort signals your brain to be more receptive and open.

(Shortform note: You can even mimic the feeling of warmth by painting the walls of your office a warm color. This simply makes it _seem_ as though __ the room was warm, which has the same effect on your personal warmth and receptivity as being physically warm.)

You can also control the context of the conversation by changing the physical setup of the space so that it doesn’t signal that you’re at the top of a hierarchy. For instance, you might sit side-by-side on a couch with your employee, rather than across from them at a desk, which gives the physical impression of authority over the other person.

(Shortform note: If you’re serious about avoiding hierarchical relationships and improving communication at work, consider doing away with executive offices entirely and implementing an egalitarian organizational structure. All employees and leaders could have identical workspaces that prime employees to see leaders as equals and thus to trust them more.)

Glaser’s final recommendation for a one-on-one meeting is to always first shake hands with the other person. This makes your brain release oxytocin, which lets you feel connected to the other person.

(Shortform note: Historically, the handshake was a way for two people to show they weren’t concealing weapons and meant each other no harm. The peace-making symbolism of this gesture coincides with its neurological impact of making you feel connected to the other person.)

##### Group Meetings

To encourage trust among groups, begin meetings with a trust-building exercise, writes Glaser. She proposes an exercise in which you ask everyone to suggest rules that will lead to the best conversation and write those down on a whiteboard. When you do such exercises, you signal to the amygdala (the fear center of the brain) that there’s no danger.

You can also foster trust at a meeting by sending out the agenda ahead of time so participants can propose amendments. Once you’ve received the amendments, send a revised agenda. This helps people to feel that their opinions and needs are valued, which makes them more trusting.

(Shortform note: Building trust is particularly important and challenging in _virtual_ meetings, in which members may have never met in person and so have not had the chance to establish trust and connection. You can foster trust by clearly framing the purpose of the meeting so everyone knows what type of participation is expected of them. Sending out an agenda or questions ahead of time, as Glaser proposes, is also a good strategy to encourage people to open up in a virtual meeting. Finally, ask your opening questions in the chat, which lets people participate in the conversation with little pressure.)

#### 4: Ask Open-Ended Questions

Another way to establish trust is to **ask open-ended questions which make the responder feel valued and willing to speak openly** , writes Glaser. Closed questions are ones that can be answered with just a “yes” or “no,” or that are really statements disguised as questions, to which the asker is expecting a specific response (“The company should move in this direction, don’t you agree?”). Open-ended questions, in contrast, don’t beg a specific response and can lead to discovery and learning (rather than confirmation of what you already think). They also help you understand the perspectives of others, allowing you to lead more effectively.

For instance, open-ended questions might be: “How do you feel about this direction for the company? What fears and hope do you have around it? Do you see yourself thriving here in the future?” Such questions encourage the other person to think about their response and to feel they can freely share their thoughts—which increases their trust in you.

(Shortform note: Asking open-ended questions is an essential part of _coaching_ employees, a process Michael Bungay Stanier describes in _The Coaching Habit. _This suggests that by learning conversational intelligence, you’ll also become a better coach. Stanier describes seven specific open-ended questions you can ask in general meetings with employees to become a better coach. For example, “What do you want?” or, “How can I support you?” These questions encourage trust and understanding in a conversation, no matter what the context.)

#### 5: Explore the Other Person’s Experience to Better Empathize With and Trust Them

In any conversation, **you can bolster trust by engaging with and understanding the other person’s thoughts and feelings more fully**. Glaser refers to this as “double-clicking,” because, like double-clicking on your computer to open nested files, you dig into a person’s lived experience. For example, you could double-click by asking about the other person’s work background and continuing to ask increasingly specific questions about jobs, companies, and roles they performed.

When you take the time to understand each other through double-clicking, you become bonded because you begin discussing _shared_ perspectives rather than _individual_ perspectives. This, in turn, fosters trust and lets you work together more effectively.

(Shortform note: In _Managing Oneself_ , Peter Drucker proposes a different approach to understanding the thoughts and feelings of colleagues, or “double-clicking”: First, reflect on your strengths, values, and learning style. Once you’ve done this, share these reflections with your colleagues and ask them to share their reflections in turn. Be aware that they’ll all have different strengths and values. Drucker asserts that knowing these will allow you to work more effectively with your colleagues, even if he doesn’t specifically indicate this will give you a shared perspective. In this way, you’re not just “double-clicking” into someone else’s experience, but also your own.)

#### 6: How to Use Conversational Intelligence to Reestablish Trust

To become an intelligent communicator, you should also learn how to reestablish trust when it’s been lost. Glaser says that **if you find yourself or the other person becoming distrustful _during_ a conversation, prevent further alienation by pausing the discussion**. This puts a break on your amygdala’s fear reaction and the production of cortisol, so you don’t continue to take actions and draw conclusions from a place of fear and distrust.

(Shortform note: In conversations that are becoming increasingly tense, one action you can take during a pause is to practice deep breathing. This has a physiological effect on you: It changes your blood pressure, thereby alerting your brain that it can relax. You could also view the situation through an optimist’s lens during a pause: See the benefits or humor in the situation, or think about how fun it will be to talk about it with friends later. When you do this, you’ll be more able to continue calmly with the conversation.)

However, if there’s been a more serious, long-term loss of trust, Glaser proposes using the following five steps to reestablish good working relations between people. These steps can be executed directly person-to-person or facilitated by a third party:

**1\. Be honest** : Vocalize your fears to the other person. When you do this, you tell your brain that the person with whom you’re sharing your fears won’t harm you, de-escalating your fear response. It also makes clear to the other person what your fears are so they don’t misunderstand them. (Shortform note: In _No Rules Rules_ , Reed Hastings argues that being transparent in the way Glaser describes also helps companies as a whole function better: When CEOs are transparent with employees, employees have the knowledge they need to make better decisions.)

**2\. Forge a connection** : Build a relationship with the other party by connecting with them meaningfully and letting them know you appreciate their qualities. This lets the other person know they can trust you. (Shortform note: Humans are much more likely to like another person if they feel that other person likes them _._ What’s more, the compliments or kind words the other person pays us don’t even have to seem authentic or based in reality for us to still like them.)__

**3\. Take their perspective** : Seek to understand how the other person sees the world. What is their version of reality? Be open with the other person, and listen to them carefully.

**4\. Define success together** : Define what success looks like for both parties rather than merely pursuing what success looks like to you. This creates a baseline of trust because you know you’re all moving toward a common goal.

(Shortform note: What happens if, in steps 3 and 4, you can’t get on the same page with the other person? In such cases, it might be best to explore switching teams. If that’s not an option, you could actually ask the other person what they think you should do when you disagree. You might say something like: “I’m sensing our approaches might not be compatible. What do you think we should do now and when this happens in the future?” This might soften up the other person and get them thinking more flexibly.)

**5\. Reflect on your assumptions** : Once you’ve performed the above steps, reflect more broadly about the assumptions you and others made that may have led to this loss of trust and how you can close the gap between assumptions and reality. (Shortform note: It might even be helpful to keep a journal in which you describe incorrect assumptions and lessons you learned. This lets you track your personal growth, which has the additional benefit of giving you a confidence boost when you reread entries.)

#### 7: Build Trust to Facilitate Company Change

You can **become more conversationally intelligent specifically in the context of company upheaval by practicing three conversational rituals** , contends Glaser. Change can be difficult for employees, but you can make it positive by involving them in the change.

(Shortform note: Change isn’t just difficult for employees; it’s difficult for _everyone_ because humans are naturally inclined to resist change. You can help yourself adapt to change by implementing rituals similar to the conversational rituals Glaser mentions: Assemble a support group, allow for the possibility of failure, and motivate yourself repeatedly.)

These three conversationally intelligent rituals are:

  1. **Welcome push-back:** Instead of quashing employees’ resistance to change, see resistance as a natural response to change. It’s important that employees be able to question a change before they accept it. 
  2. **Create opportunities for employees to discuss:** When change happens, people need reassurance that they’ll be OK—both personally and professionally. Creates spaces for people to have those conversations.
  3. **Tell the story of the change:** To help people understand change, tell a story about it. People can absorb stories more easily than cold, hard facts. 



> **A Contrasting Approach to Management: Scientific Management**
> 
> These three conversationally intelligent rituals could be summarized as _treating employees like humans._ This means, for instance, letting them have opinions, letting them discuss their feelings with others, and communicating with them in ways that are easy for all humans to absorb.
> 
> This approach to management stands in contrast to Frederick Winslow Taylor’s famed _scientific management_ , which became popular at the turn of the 20th century and led to a tremendous increase in factory productivity at that time. In scientific management, managers tried to find the most efficient way to complete work and then assigned the most suited employee to that task. In short, Taylor viewed employees as tools to be deployed as efficiently as possible in service of the company’s goals. He felt every employee’s work could be optimized using science, not emotional connection.
