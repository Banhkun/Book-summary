## Part 4: Prime Yourself for Success | Principle 25: Surround Yourself With Nurturing, Successful People

In Part 4, you’ll learn to prime yourself for success by finding people who can support your endeavors and developing new ways of thinking about yourself and your efforts.

### Who You Spend Time With Matters

If you spend a lot of time with people who stress you out, aren’t successful, or aren’t supportive, you’re less likely to achieve success. Aim to spend time with people who uplift you, support and nurture your dreams, have a positive attitude, and are successful.

### Identify the Negative People in Your Life

To start surrounding yourself with supportive people, identify those who are negative and holding you back. Here’s how:

  1. **Write down all of the people you spend time with regularly.** Consider family, friends, coworkers, neighbors, people in your church, and so on.
  2. **Write a (+) next to people if they’re positive and support you or a (-) if they’re negative and don’t support you.** Besides not being supportive, negative people like to complain, and they see themselves as perpetual victims. You might notice that most of the negative people belong to one group. For example, maybe your coworkers have toxic attitudes.
  3. **Spend less time with the negative people.** Instead, surround yourself with positive people.



### Find Successful People

You can find supportive, successful people in many places. Try the following:

  * Volunteer for leadership roles in an organization you care about.
  * Join civic groups like Rotary International.
  * Join a country club.
  * Attend conferences in your field.
  * Join professional clubs or societies in your field.



#### Learning at the Sauna: John Assaraf’s Story

John Assaraf is an entrepreneur of many trades, from real estate to virtual tour software. But before he became successful, he learned a lot from spending time in the men’s sauna at the local health club where he worked. There, successful men talked about successes and failures with their companies, as well as with their families and health. Assaraf learned that obstacles are part of life and running a business, but with perseverance, it’s possible to find solutions. He also learned that it was possible to build a successful life whatever your race, ethnicity, or educational history.
