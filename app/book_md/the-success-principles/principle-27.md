## Principle 27: Improve Your Bedtime Routine

How you reflect on your day has an impact on what you learn and how you approach the next day. This section discusses two activities to restructure your bedtime routine for success.

### Why Bedtime?

The last 45 minutes before you go to sleep is an important time to reflect and plan for the next day. **This is because your brain processes what you think about during this time up to six times more than everything else you did during the day.** It’s also why studying before you go to sleep can be an effective test-taking strategy and why you might not sleep as well or might have nightmares if you watch scary television just before bed.

Put the 45 minutes before you go to bed to good use with these two activities:

1\. **Reflect on your day.** Use this activity to quickly develop a new helpful behavior. Each night, close your eyes and ask yourself _one_ of the following questions:

  * How could I have been a better (insert your profession here) today?
  * How could I have shown more appreciation and love today?
  * How could I have been more (this characteristic) today?



Listen to your answers. Avoid criticizing or judging yourself. Visualize the events in your day happening again and acting the way you would have preferred. You’ll be more likely to act this way the next time.

2\. **Visualize tomorrow.** Take a mental walk through your schedule for the next day. Visualize yourself doing your best in every situation, from enjoying your breakfast to leading a team check-in with your coworkers. This activity encourages your brain to devise ways to make it happen. Also, under the Law of Attraction, by broadcasting your positive intentions to the universe, you’re more likely to act positively, elicit positive behavior from others, and attract supportive people into your life.
