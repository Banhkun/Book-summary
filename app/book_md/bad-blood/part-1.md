## Part 1: How Did the Deception Begin?

**It has to start with Elizabeth Holmes, who dreamed big.**

  * She clearly had large ambitions. When asked what she wanted to be at 10 year old, she answered “a billionaire.”
  * When her dad suggested she get a PhD, she declined. Instead, she said, “I want to make money.”
  * It might be reasonable to assume Holmes started with good intentions. After a summer in Asia during the SARS period, she researched the patent literature and proposed a way to test blood with small amounts of blood. Her adviser was impressed and encouraged her to start a company.
  * But this same ambition brought her down a slippery slope of deception.



**Theranos had a vision people _wanted_ to believe in **\- “detect diseases early so no one has to die unnecessarily.” All types of stakeholders saw what they _wanted to see_ in it, allowing large suspension of disbelief.

  * Investors saw a huge financial opportunity. The medical testing market is huge - allowing patients to test at home, and using the resulting data to inform medical decisions, makes it even bigger.
  * Patients and their families saw better decisionmaking and less pain.
  * The public saw a thrilling female founder who could be the next Steve Jobs. They wanted to celebrate a brilliant female innovator in an age of female empowerment.
  * Partners like Walgreens and Safeway saw a way to compete against competitors like CVS, and to rejuvenate their financials. So they partnered with Theranos to roll out blood-testing clinics at their locations.
  * Senior mentors like George Schultz, General Mattis saw a granddaughter-like figure to mentor. So they lent their name to Theranos as advisors.
  * Anyone with equity (employees, investors, and advisory board included) had a huge incentive to believe the company would work.



**Elizabeth Holmes practiced charismatic techniques to win over supporters.**

  * Elizabeth spoke sincerely and enthusiastically about the mission. It gave the impression that there was _no way_ someone with this sincerity could be beguiling.
  * To the Walgreens CFO, Elizabeth gave a gift of an American flag “flown over Afghanistan” with a dedication to Walgreens written on it.
  * Many people repeated: “she had this intense way of looking at you while she spoke that made you believe in her and want to follow her.” Here’s an example of Holmes speaking in a Theranos promotional video.
  * She apparently affected her voice to be a strikingly low baritone, possibly convinced it would lead to better results in a male-dominated world.



**Stakeholders used pattern matching to jump to wrong conclusions.**

  * On paper, the technology fit the pattern of disruption - dramatically lower cost replacing the dinosaur incumbents, leading to massive adoption and market expansion. The story was intoxicating and irresistible.
  * Holmes looked like the stereotypical genius dropout founder. She even deliberately cast a resemblance to Steve Jobs with black turtlenecks.
  * They crafted a cohesive narrative. From childhood, Elizabeth had a phobia of needles that led to the breakthrough technology.
