## Exercise: Identifying a Role Model

Having a model of positivity to emulate can make our work towards a positive mind feel more tangible and attainable. Meyer chooses Jesus as a role model, but we might have someone else who has positive qualities that we would like to cultivate in ourselves.

* * *

Think about someone whose positive qualities have made them a positive presence in your life recently. What qualities makes them a positive influence?

Since we can’t see other people’s thoughts, what are some specific words and actions that this person said or did that had a positive impact on you?

What qualities would you like to cultivate in your own life that would make you a more positive influence on others?

What are some ways you can tweak your thought process to help you embody these qualities?
