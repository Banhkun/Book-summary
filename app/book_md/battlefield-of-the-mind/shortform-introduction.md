## Shortform Introduction

If we hope to live the positive life that God intends for us, we must first win the battle for our minds. Satan tries to trap us in a negative life by convincing us to focus on negative thoughts. In _Battlefield of the Mind,_ best-selling author, speaker, and Bible teacher Joyce Meyer teaches that Satan tries to trap us in a negative life by filling our minds with negative thoughts, but that we can thwart Satan’s attempts by focusing on God and His teachings. She explains that by aligning our minds with the Holy Spirit and using Jesus as our role model, we can learn to focus on and cultivate the positive thoughts that will lead to a happy, fulfilling, and faithful life.

### The Book’s Publication

The book was initially published in 1995 and was re-published by Faith Words in 2011. This guide refers to the 2011 version. In the introduction to this newer version, Meyer explains that she has included new insights, material, and updates to stories and anecdotes included in the initial version.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical & Intellectual Context

Battlefield of the Mind is part of a long tradition of popular self-help books that emphasize the power of positive thinking. For example:

  * In 1902, James Allen wrote _As a Man Thinketh,_ where he proposes that our thoughts shape our reality and that by mastering our thoughts, we can create the life we want. 
  * In 1952, Norman Vincent Peale wrote _The Power of Positive Thinking: A Practical Guide to Mastering the Problems of Everyday Living,_ in which he proposes that we can overcome any obstacle in our lives with a positive mindset and faith in God.
  * In 2008, Rhonda Byrne wrote _The Secret_ , where she argues that a positive mindset shapes a positive life. 
  * Shawn Achor wrote _The Happiness Advantage_ in 2008, where he highlights the link between happiness and success, arguing that happiness is the root rather than the cause of success.



Many of Meyer’s arguments share principles with the “positive psychology” field. This branch of psychology can be traced back to the 1950s, but it was popularized in the 1990s by Martin Seligman, who was president of the American Psychological Association at the time. Positive psychology seeks to empower people to live happy and fulfilling lives by taking ownership of their thoughts and mental habits and cultivating inner strength.

_Battlefield of the Mind_ also follows a religious tradition known as the Prosperity Gospel movement. This movement is an offshoot of Christianity that teaches that God wants his followers to be healthy, wealthy, and successful. It was popularized by televangelists in the 1970s, and it’s very popular among American Christians today. (A poll taken in 2006 found that 17 percent of Christians in the United States ascribe to the movement.) Meyer is considered to be one of the modern leaders of the Prosperity Gospel movement (along with her popular contemporary Joel Osteen).

#### The Book’s Impact

_Battlefield of the Mind_ is the best-selling book of roughly 130 publications written by Joyce Meyer (she has a large collection of published books, devotionals, Biblical studies, and other publications). It has sold over three million copies and has been translated into 47 languages.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Battlefield of the Mind_ , like Joyce Meyer herself, is wildly popular. However, both she and the book have also received criticism. This criticism largely falls into three categories:

  * **Theological validity:** Meyer has been accused of suborning scripture for personal gain. As we will discuss further in our commentary, her interpretation of scripture has been characterized as self-serving and often departs from the Christian tradition. 
  * **Academic validity:** Battlefield of the Mind is in large part a self-help book. Throughout the book, Meyer provides advice on issues such as overcoming depression, addressing difficulties with mental focus, overcoming obstacles in a marriage, and so on. However, she does not cite research nor address expert advice in her coverage of these topics. Rather, she relies on personal experience and opinion. 
  * **Personal criticism:** Meyer has received criticism for her personal wealth and lavish lifestyle over the years. While she has addressed the issue and argues that there is no conflict between her financial success and her preaching of Christian values, many see an ethical conflict between preaching Christianity and profiting so much. 



#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Meyer divides the book into three parts. Part 1 deals with the importance of keeping a positive mind and introduces her imagery of our mind as a battlefield between Satan’s negativity and God’s positivity. In Part 2, she describes common signs that indicate that our mind is under attack from the Devil. These signs, which she calls “conditions,” result from negative thoughts the Devil plants in our minds. In Part 3, Meyer describes “wilderness mentalities,” which are negative mindsets in which our minds can become trapped when Satan’s negative influence goes unchecked.

### Our Approach in This Guide

We have divided Meyer’s ideas into four sections, which largely parallel the sections she outlines in the original text. We added a fourth section to consolidate her ideas about _how_ to cultivate a positive mind to highlight the actionable parts of her argument.

In our commentary, we provide additional context on the Christian principles that inform Meyer’s work and supplement her ideas with a wide range of perspectives, including those of theological scholars, self-help authors like Eckhart Tolle and Mark Manson, and proponents of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
