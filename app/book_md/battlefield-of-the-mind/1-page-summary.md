## 1-Page Summary

_Battlefield of the Mind_ is not a metaphor. In her bestselling book of 130 publications, author, Bible teacher, and speaker Joyce Meyer explains that **whether we know it or not, we are engaged in a constant and literal battle for the well-being of our minds**. On one side of the battle is Satan, who tries to corrupt our minds and lives with his negativity. On the other side are Christians hoping to live the meaningful and fulfilling life God intends for them.

(Shortform note: While any reader can glean the secular components of Meyer’s arguments, the book is written for a Christian audience.)

Meyer’s goal is to convince readers that the quality of our life hinges on recognizing Satan as the source of our negative thoughts and engaging him in battle. She uses a combination of scripture, anecdotes, and personal witness to explain what Satan’s attacks on our minds look like, their effect on our well-being, and how we can address them. She assures us that we can defeat Satan by cultivating our spirituality and relationship with God.

Meyer divides the book into three parts. In Part 1, she explains how a positive mind leads to words and actions that create a positive life. In Part 2, she explores signs that Satan is attacking our minds and that our thinking is compromised. Finally, in Part 3, she describes ways that unchecked negativity can derail our lives. Our guide parallels these three parts, with an added fourth section where we have consolidated much of her insight into using our relationship with God to live a better life.

### Part 1: A Positive Life Requires a Positive Mind

Thinking positive is paramount to living a happy and successful life because our thoughts become self-fulfilling prophecies. Meyer explains that positive thoughts lead to positive words and actions that generate more positivity. Likewise, negative thoughts lead to negative words and actions that create further negativity. Therefore, **Meyer argues that the only way to truly take ownership of our lives is to first take ownership of our thoughts.**

> **The Power of Positive Thinking**
> 
> Meyer’s idea that our thoughts have the power to shape our reality is well established in the field of psychology and our culture. Henry Ford’s famous quote, “whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you’re right,” or versions of it, are commonly cited to remind us that thinking positively is the first step to success.
> 
> Researchers believe that our positive or negative thoughts become self-fulfilling prophecies because a belief that we'll fail at something causes us to approach a new challenge timidly, with dampened enthusiasm and marginal effort. If we experience initial setbacks, we may accept defeat quickly and easily.
> 
> In contrast, when we believe that we’ll succeed, we can experience setbacks and challenges without becoming discouraged and are more likely to approach new endeavors with enthusiasm and sustained effort. Therefore, **first with our thoughts and then with our actions, we create our reality.**

#### A Positive Mind Is Focused on God

**For Meyer, a close relationship with God is the driving force behind a positive mind and life**. To reap the full benefits of our relationship with God, both our rational mind and our spirit must be attuned to and focused on His wisdom, teachings, and love. She explains that God invites Christians to share His love and wisdom through the power of the Holy Spirit, which provides a link between our own spirit and our mind. Since our rational mind is susceptible to becoming confused and discouraged, the Holy Spirit can help us _feel_ the right thing to do.

**With the Holy Spirit as our guide, God’s positivity will inform how we see the world** , and we’ll be able to interpret and contextualize His teachings and messages and apply them to our lives.

Additionally, Meyer explains that by heeding the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we will not only be able to follow God’s unique path for us, but we will find peace and fulfillment along the way.

(Shortform note: Meyer believes that God has a specific plan for each of our lives, although she doesn’t elaborate on how we know what that plan is.)

> **The Holy Trinity**
> 
> While Christians believe in one God; He is conceptualized as three noninterchangeable entities, called the Holy Trinity, for practical and spiritual reasons. The concept of the Holy Trinity explains why Meyer references God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit in different contexts. For example, Meyer specifically discusses how a partnership with the _Holy Spirit_ can guide us to a positive mind.
> 
> For Christians, the nature of God and divinity (and the meaning of life) lies in the relationship between the three parts of the Holy Trinity. God the _Father_ represents the source of all that has been and will be. God the _Son_ (Jesus) is the physical manifestation of God’s love for humanity and His presence in the world. The _Holy Spirit_ is the animating spirit of divine love that flows between beings. Meyer describes a partnership with the Holy Spirit in particular, not because the Holy Spirit and God are two separate entities, but because we can access the divine only in the context of a relationship.

#### Satan Tries to Keep Our Minds Negative

Satan’s goal is to trap our minds in negative thoughts that prevent us from focusing on God and having a positive life. Meyer explains that Satan knows how powerful we will be if we embrace God’s positivity with our mind _and_ spirit, and so **he chooses to attack us where we are most vulnerable—our minds.** He targets our mind rather than our spirit because human nature makes us susceptible to wasting mental energy on negative thoughts.

Satan uses our flaws to get us to sabotage our lives. Meyer explains that **Satan uses his knowledge of each of our minds to target our weaknesses** : our fears, insecurities, vices, desires, and so on. His attacks are subtle and often go unnoticed because he plants negative thoughts in our heads from a young age and encourages us to focus on them more and more over time. **The negative thoughts he plants often turn into negative patterns of thinking** that impact our words, actions, and lives. Recognizing these patterns is an important first step in defeating Satan on the battleground of our minds.

> **Satan as a Biblical Figure**
> 
> Meyer chooses to follow a very literal interpretation of the Bible in her conceptualization of Satan. But not all Christians think of Satan as a literal, singular figure. Theological scholars actually urge against a literal interpretation of the Bible, encouraging readers to treat the text “as a symbol for a deeper reality." Since scripture incorporates elements of several cultures, languages, belief systems, and traditions, astute readers look for the underlying metaphor beneath the word-for-word translation.
> 
> The search for meaning beyond scripture’s literal wording applies to how we interpret the figure of Satan. In the Jewish tradition (from which Christian ideas of Satan evolved), Satan was rarely viewed as a literal entity. His first appearance in scripture is in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, where he is cast in the role of the “accuser” or “tempter.” But, he was used symbolically. Instead of being an outside force imposing his evil will against us, Satan served as a manifestation of the duality of human nature and a reminder that we're all capable of thinking and doing evil things.

### Part 2: Signs That Our Mind Is Under Attack

Since Satan’s attacks on our minds are subtle and prolonged, **we need to be on the lookout for evidence that he has infiltrated our thought processes**. Meyer identifies six “conditions” (we call them signs) that indicate an attack on our thoughts by Satan, and she explains why each is problematic. According to Meyer, our mind is under attack if it is:

  * **Unfocused**(An unfocused mind causes us to miss the opportunity for a positive life _right_ _now_.)
  * **Overly Rational**(A mind that cannot accept uncertainty will be made miserable by life’s unanswered questions, which are part of God’s plan.)
  * **Doubtful**(Doubt can erode our faith in God, ourselves, and our purpose in life.)
  * **Anxious** (Anxiety causes us to waste our time and energy worrying about things we can’t control.)
  * **Judgmental**(Judging rather than appreciating others hurts our relationships and our happiness by alienating people.) 
  * **Complacent**(A complacent mind is too passive to cultivate a positive life and too open to Satan’s negative influence.)



As we can see from this list,**Satan’s attacks manifest in common thoughts and behaviors that most of us either have experienced or experience regularly**. If left unexamined, it is unlikely that we would even recognize them as an attack, which makes them dangerous. For this reason, Meyer encourages us to be “active” and “alert” about the thoughts shaping our behavior. If we realize that our words and actions are being informed by negative thoughts like these, it is time to take action.

> **Blaming the Devil**
> 
> Critics have pointed out that blaming the Devil for such common thoughts and behaviors as are outlined in this list might be counterproductive for Meyer’s followers while proving financially lucrative for Meyer herself.
> 
> By placing us all in the middle of a cosmic battle between good and evil, Meyer’s message can diminish our feelings of agency in dealing with our negative emotions. While she argues that we can reject Satan, her imagery of demons constantly “lurking around” ready to wage war against our minds creates nagging anxiety that causes people to return to Meyer’s ministry (and the books and CDs off of which she profits) for “rearmament and reassurance.” Additionally, experts suggest that encouraging people to imagine demons and Satan as an actual presence in our lives can cause them to become more engaged with a “psychic experience” than with their reality.
> 
> Further, critics allege that her theories might cause harm to her followers because blaming such common experiences on the Devil ignores the real-world influences that might bring them about. Not only does it discount environmental factors that might cause a person to be unfocused or anxious, for example, but it also discounts the many cognitive and psychological issues that can affect a person's thinking, such as ADHD, dementia, depression, anxiety, OCD, and many others, which can lead to feelings of complacency, doubtfulness, and being judgmental.
> 
> Her theories also discount the often beneficial effects of some of these “afflictions,” such as allowing your mind to be unfocused, which can allow for creativity to flourish, and thinking rationally, which can counter emotional responses to setbacks.

### Part 3: Common Negative Mindsets

When Satan’s negativity goes unchecked, it can derail our lives. Meyer explains that **if negative thinking becomes habitual, we can become so lost in unhealthy patterns that a positive life becomes impossible**. Meyer calls this being stuck in a “wilderness mentality” (we call it a negative mindset) because no matter what our actual circumstances are like, a negative mind can make life feel like an unnavigable wilderness.

> **A Negative Thought or Negative Thinking?**
> 
> There’s a difference between having negative thoughts and becoming trapped in a cycle of negative thinking. Instead of viewing every negative thought as an attack from the Devil, as Meyer suggests, experts urge us to remember that negative thoughts are a normal part of the human experience. Some negative thoughts are justified and can help us process our experiences. However, if we realize that most of our thoughts are negative or that being positive is starting to become difficult, we may be entering a _cycle_ of negativity (what Meyer would call a “wilderness mentality”).
> 
> The following strategies can help us break a cycle of negativity:
> 
>   * Accept negative thoughts (don’t tell yourself that having them is wrong) and then let them go. (We can use the analogy of a thought as a balloon that floats away once we’ve acknowledged it).
> 
>   * Practice being grateful
> 
>   * Avoid thinking in absolute terms like “never” and “always.”
> 
>   * Have realistic (and flexible) expectations. If we have unrealistic expectations about something we cannot control, we set ourselves up for disappointment. Keeping a flexible mindset about the future can help us take successes and setbacks as they come.
> 
> 


Meyer outlines 10 common negative mindsets that can trap people and some insights on how to escape them.

### Allowing the Past and Present to Determine the Future

Satan will try to convince us that the positive future God has in store for us is unattainable. To avoid becoming discouraged by his suggestions, we should let our spirit rather than our rational minds inform our view of the future.

(Shortform note: Our brains are evolutionarily predisposed to weigh negative experiences more heavily than positive ones, which helps explain why a negative past/present can make it hard to be optimistic.)

### Avoiding Responsibility

It’s our responsibility to take ownership of a positive future. Responsibility means using our talents, skills, and opportunities to serve God to the best of our ability. Satan will try to convince us to pass up opportunities for self-improvement.

(Shortform note: Research has shown that giving back to others in an area we feel passionately about (what Meyer might call an area where we have taken responsibility) is a powerful way to add happiness and meaning to our lives.)

### A Self-Defeating Attitude

Satan tries to get us to focus on how hard everything is so that we give up. Using positive language when we talk to ourselves can help us stay positive and faithful during hard times.

(Shortform note: Research supports the idea that a self-defeating attitude negatively impacts our health. Multiple studies have shown that a “negative emotional style” can even make us more prone to both getting sick and feeling sicker when we do.)

#### Being Indignant

Satan will try to convince us that we shouldn’t have to suffer at all, and that something is going wrong in our lives if we do. It is important to remember that God expects us to endure some suffering and that we can use it as a crucible to strengthen our faith.

(Shortform note: In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson also suggests that there is utility in suffering. According to Manson, humans are biologically hardwired for suffering and dissatisfaction, and these feelings can actually be useful because they fuel a desire for self-improvement.)

#### Being Impatient

Satan will tell us that we shouldn't have to wait for anything in our lives and tries to make us indignant about not having what we want _right now_. Humility can help remind us that we will be ready for God’s blessings when _He_ says we are.

(Shortform note: Impatience and indignation combined can be a particularly destructive force in our lives. When we experience a setback that feels unfair, we're prone to making rash, self-destructive decisions.)

#### Making Excuses

Satan wants us to believe that other people are the source of our bad behavior so that we blame them rather than focus on self-improvement. While it can be painful, we need to acknowledge that we are responsible for our choices.

(Shortform note: While Meyer argues that blame stems from an attack by the Devil, experts explain that blame comes from our desire to avoid painful feelings such as shame and regret.)

#### Pitying Ourselves

If Satan can convince us that we are victims rather than protagonists, he can stop us from taking control of our lives. Rather than feeling sorry for ourselves, we can remember that our relationship with God makes us powerful.

(Shortform note: One way to tackle self-pity is to frame negative thoughts as a challenge. For example, if we think we could never run a 10-minute mile, then a 10-minute mile would become our goal.)

#### Feeling Unworthy

Satan tries to convince us that we are unworthy, unlikeable, and unloveable. But God loves us unconditionally, as we are.

(Shortform note: Unlike self-esteem, which is based on external factors like our appearance, performance at work, and so on, our self-worth concerns our perception of our existential value. Basically, **our self-worth is a measure of how entitled we feel to “take up space” in the world.** While self-esteem can fluctuate based on external metrics of success, our self-worth is more deeply rooted and thus more constant.)

#### Being Jealous

Jealousy comes from comparing ourselves to others, which is unnecessary. Satan uses our insecurities to fuel our jealousy. While being “better” than someone else may increase our value in _our_ eyes, it does not increase our value in God’s eyes.

(Shortform note: Studies show that technology and social media exacerbate our insecurity and jealousy. This happens because people generally only post the very best moments and details of their lives online so that when we scroll through social media, it looks like everyone else’s lives are better than ours.)

#### Being Disobedient

Satan will try to lure us off the path that God has laid for us. When things in our life are going well, it is tempting to ignore God's messages and keep doing what we want to do. But honoring God and having a positive life means obeying His will.

(Shortform note: Obedience to God in the Christian theological tradition does not mean following a specific, predetermined plan for our lives the way Meyer describes it. In fact, experts explain that believing that God has a specific plan for our lives is “theologically flawed.")

### Part 4: Cultivating a Positive Mind

#### Our Weapons Against Satan

Meyer explains that the only way to rid ourselves of Satan and his negativity is to cultivate a God-centered mind. Once our minds are focused on God rather than on all of the things Satan tries to make us focus on, we can enjoy a happier, more fulfilling life. **God’s word is our most effective weapon in this fight.**

Meyer explains that we use the word of God in three forms:

  * **Scripture** : The written word of God provides us with an arsenal of positive messages that we can use when our mind is under attack from the Devil. When we know scripture well, we can easily recall helpful passages from the Bible to apply to any situation where Satan tries to corrupt our thoughts.



(Shortform note: Simply reading the Bible is often not enough to properly interpret it. Most readers don't have the theological training or expertise to reliably uncover personal meaning from the Bible that is consistent with the text's original meaning, which weakens Meyer’s argument that we can rely on scripture to fight Satan.) 

  * **Praise** : Praise is thanking God for His blessings in our lives, without reservation and coming from a place of peace and contentment. If we're truly thankful and content regardless of our circumstances, there will be no place where the devil can penetrate our minds.



(Shortform note: Our language has a powerful impact on our perception of reality. Therefore, simply changing our language may make us better able to give thanks for the positives we have in life, even if our circumstances haven’t changed. For example, we can substitute the phrase “I _have_ to” with “I _get_ to,” and instead of saying that we're “ _going”_ through something difficult, we can say we’re “ _growing_ ” through something difficult.)

  * **Prayer:** We can grow our relationship with God by communicating with Him through prayer.



(Shortform note: In her discussion of prayer, Meyer does not mention the Our Father (The Lord’s Prayer). A Christian understanding of prayer comes from this prayer in particular. For Christians, it serves as a model for how people “should” speak to God. It is _the_ foundational Christian prayer and is the only prayer that Jesus actually taught His followers to pray.)

#### Thinking Like Jesus

Meyer explains that Jesus is the paragon of maintaining a positive mind in the face of suffering. Therefore, as we try to live a positive life ourselves, we should try to emulate his mindset. To channel Jesus’ positivity, we must:

  * **Be Positive:** To think like Jesus, we should always look for something positive to think, do, or say, even when we face situations that seem hopeless or joyless. 
  * **Keep Our Mind on God:** To think like Jesus, we need to make our relationship with God part of our daily lives. 
  * **Trust in God’s Love:** When we believe in and internalize God’s love for us, we feel worthy—worthy of His blessings, worthy of His love and love from others, and worthy of the positive life that He intends for us. 



> **Cultivating a Positive Mind With Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**
> 
> Many people looking for guidance in cultivating a positive mind have found success with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). CBT is a technique in which psychiatrists help people retrain their brains so that they can break negative thought and behavioral patterns.
> 
> As Judith Beck explains in _Cognitive Behavioral Therapy_ , we may experience persistent negative thoughts if we hold negative “core beliefs” about ourselves. These negative core beliefs fall into one of three types: helplessness, unloveableness, and worthlessness, all of which lead to a distorted self-image and can cause us to make self-defeating choices.
> 
> Practitioners of CBT help people to examine the validity of their negative thoughts by leading them through reasoning and thought experiment exercises. Through these exercises, patients may find no true rationale or evidence behind their negative thoughts. Realizing that negative thoughts come from negative core beliefs as opposed to reality can allow people to feel hopeful, giving them the courage to try things that they may otherwise have talked themselves out of.
> 
> Meyer doesn’t advise seeking out a method such as CBT to conquer your negative thoughts, but her advice tries to effect the same results. By recommending that you focus on positivity, she asks you to retrain your brain away from negativity. By urging you to accept and internalize God’s love, she seeks to counter your feelings of worthlessness. And by advising that you keep God’s relationship in the forefront of your mind, she tries to offer a specific, practical method by which you can achieve these ends.
> 
> Thus, while psychologists encourage their patients to avail themselves of methods derived from scientific study, Meyer focuses on methods derived from spiritual study.
