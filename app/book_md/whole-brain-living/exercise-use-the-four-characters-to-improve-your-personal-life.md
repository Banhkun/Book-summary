## Exercise: Use the Four Characters to Improve Your Personal Life

Taylor explains that the four characters are always present within our brains, but some characters show themselves more prominently than others depending on the context and our individual choices. In this exercise, you’ll examine how your four characters play a role in your relationships and how you might use the four characters to improve an area of your personal life.

Identify and describe a specific aspect of your relationships that you’ve struggled with in the past. For example, you might have difficulty relaxing when you’re spending quality time with loved ones, or you may struggle with conflict resolution in a specific relationship.

Reflect on one of the scenarios from the previous question and write down which character was dominating your emotions or actions during that experience (similar to the Recognize step of BRAIN). Remember that there might even be multiple characters that acted one after the other, depending on how the interaction unfolded. What personality traits of each character do you recognize from that experience? For example, you might remember feeling the Character 1 tendency to judge yourself or others harshly.

Next, describe which character you would _ideally_ like to guide your actions in similar future situations. How do you think that character will encourage you to better interact with others? For example, if you’d like Character 4 to guide your actions when you’re fighting with a loved one, they’ll likely remind you to act more compassionately and reaffirm your connection with the other person.

Taylor recommends using the BRAIN technique regularly to strengthen healthy thought patterns. Make a plan for practicing BRAIN by writing down when it will be most useful in your personal life. For example, this might include any time you get into a disagreement with someone or whenever you’re deciding whether to enter into a new relationship.
