## Exercise: Determine Your Argumentative Goal

Having clear goals in an argument clarifies your thinking and keeps you focused on achieving a productive outcome rather than winning points.

* * *

Describe an argument that youâ€™ll need to have in the near future.

What is your _personal goal_ for this argument? (Do you want them to listen to you? Do you want them to change their mind about an issue? Do you want to motivate them to act?)

Which appeal (_ethos, pathos,_ or _logos_) do you think will be most effective for this argument? Why?

What tactics could you use to make a persuasive appeal? (For example, you might establish a strong _ethos_ by demonstrating your practical wisdom.)
