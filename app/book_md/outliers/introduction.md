## Introduction: Defining an Outlier

**In Part 1, Gladwell explores the importance of opportunity in setting the stage for success.** These opportunities come in many different forms, as we’ll explore below. But before we start breaking down the components of the outlier’s success, let’s look at what an outlier is.

### The Myth of the Outlier

Gladwell defines outliers as people who reach a level of success so extraordinary that it’s statistically improbable.

**We typically assume that outliers must be exceptionally gifted, intelligent, or passionate.** Gladwell notes that this belief promotes the idea of the self-made man (or woman), who relies on their innate intelligence and perseverance to succeed. According to this mythology, the self-made person has earned their success and is in control of their destiny.

However, Gladwell argues that **success depends just as much on factors that lie beyond the individual and their control** , including their culture, community, and family. Upon further inspection, there are hidden advantages, exceptional opportunities, and cultural legacies that contribute to the outlier’s success.

> **Origins of the Self-Made Man Myth**
> 
> In taking on the myth of the self-made man, Gladwell is challenging an idea central to American culture. In fact, the term “self-made man” was coined by a US senator and epitomized by Benjamin Franklin.
> 
> In the 1700s, around the time of America’s founding, Immanuel Kant promoted the idea that a person is “what he makes of himself,” as he and his fellow Enlightenment philosophers ushered in a growing secularism. Scholars suggest that when the nation’s founders wrote in the Declaration of Independence that people are entitled to the “pursuit of happiness,” they shifted from a Christian focus on reaching heaven to a secular emphasis on attaining earthly success through ambition and autonomy. This view was echoed in writings that portrayed America as a utopian, practically classless society that promotes social mobility and individual choice.
> 
> The myth of the self-made man relies on this view of a classless America where exceptionalism is the rule. However, those portrayals are illusions—and, as a result of these myths, many Americans feel little sense of collective responsibility for individual outcomes, and many are blind to the structural roadblocks that prevent equal opportunities for all.

### Case Study: The Roseto Effect

The first outlier that Gladwell examines is the small Pennsylvania town of Roseto, where research suggested that**tight-knit community relations were responsible for residents’ remarkably low levels of disease** , crime, alcoholism, and suicide.

#### The Context

Gladwell explains that in the 1880s and ‘90s, hundreds of immigrants from Roseto, Italy arrived in America and established Roseto, Pennsylvania. They developed their new American home in the style of their Italian hometown: Their houses were close to each other, multiple generations often shared a home, and people visited each other constantly. They respected elders, acted modestly about differences in wealth, and actively participated in church and civic organizations.

#### The Findings

Gladwell writes that by the late 1950s, a local doctor noticed that, as a group, Rosetans had unusually good health. So, in 1961, researchers conducted a 50-year study of Roseto’s residents.

Among the researchers’ findings, they discovered that no one under 55 showed any signs of heart disease, and men over 65 died from heart disease at half the rate of the US population. This was a big deal: At the time, heart disease was the leading cause of death of men under 65.

However, Gladwell says, the most surprising finding was that researchers ruled out diet, exercise, genetics, and geographic region as causes for Rosetans’ stellar health. Instead, they concluded that **Rosetans’ health could be credited to the town’s robust sense of community**. This health phenomenon is known as the Roseto effect.

> **Create Your Own Roseto Effect**
> 
> Subsequent studies have confirmed that social ties are at least as important as diet and exercise for long-term health—and you don’t have to live in a community as unique as Roseto to reap the benefits. While many Rosetans lived with extended family and had community ties that stretched back generations, anyone can develop a social network that helps keep them healthy.
> 
> A 2016 study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences revealed that having strong social connections throughout life improves health and increases longevity. Researchers focused on the link between social ties and health during adolescence, midlife, and later in life. They found:
> 
>   * In adolescence, a large and varied social network benefits cardiovascular health and metabolism, which also reduces “predisease pathways,” or biological responses that become the seeds for diseases that emerge later in life. On the other hand, social isolation is as much a risk factor for inflammation as lack of exercise.
> 
>   * In midlife, the _quality_ of relationships has greater health impacts than the _quantity_ (whereas adolescents and elderly people benefit most from a larger web of relationships). On the flip side, stressful relationships put adults at higher risk of inflammation and abdominal obesity.
> 
>   * In late life, broad social networks appear to decrease the likelihood of hypertension and obesity. By the same token, social isolation creates a greater risk of hypertension than diabetes.
> 
> 


#### The Takeaway

**Gladwell presents the Roseto effect as evidence that an outlier becomes an outlier due to environmental benefits rather than individual choices and attributes.** Rosetans ate fatty foods, drank alcohol, smoked, and didn’t exercise more than the average American—but the benefits of their close-knit community apparently outweighed those individual choices.

> **_Rosetans_ Are Gladwell’s Outliers—Not _Roseto_**
> 
> While the town of Roseto is an outlier because the collective health of its residents stands out compared to other communities, it doesn’t exactly hold up as an example of environment trumping innate attributes. If _Roseto_ were the outlier in Gladwell’s sense, then the town’s surroundings and circumstances would be responsible for its residents’ good health; those external factors might include influence from surrounding cities, state politics that impact the town, and the national economic conditions.
> 
> Instead, the _individual residents_ represent Gladwell’s principle, and the community as a whole is merely part of the environment that makes them outliers.
