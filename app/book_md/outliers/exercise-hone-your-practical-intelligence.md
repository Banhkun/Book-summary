## Exercise: Hone Your Practical Intelligence

Reflect on your upbringing and strategize to fill in any gaps in practical intelligence.

* * *

Describe at least one instance in your childhood in which your parents demonstrated that you should either challenge or comply with authority.

Describe how your parents responded to your interests and talents. For example, did they provide you opportunities to invest more deeply in these interests, or did they let you pursue them on your own?

Describe the nature of parent-child communication in your household growing up. Did your parents solicit your opinions and invite you to debate and negotiate, or did they expect you to comply without questioning them?

Consider the descriptions of concerted cultivation (which produces children who feel entitled to pursue what they want) and accomplishment of natural growth (which rears children who are less likely to challenge authority and self-advocate). Which best describes your upbringing? How has this impacted your trajectory as an adult?
