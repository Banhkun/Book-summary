## Part 1: Opportunity | Chapter 1: Opportunity Is Key to Success

In Part 1, Gladwell argues that **people can’t become successful without the _opportunity_ to become successful. **These opportunities come in many forms, and in this and the next few chapters, he examines different types of opportunities, including:

  * Opportunities to gain more opportunities (Chapter 2)
  * Being raised in a way that fosters practical intelligence (Chapter 4)
  * Unexpected benefits of seemingly unfavorable environments (Chapter 5) 



While a person’s individual attributes—like talent and work ethic—may determine their _potential_ , Gladwell asserts that **external factors determine who has the opportunity to _reach their potential_ , and who faces roadblocks. **In other words, it’s impossible to achieve success if you don’t have the chance to put your skills to work.

Furthermore, Gladwell writes that people who get opportunities early in life have a huge advantage over those whose opportunities come later, because early opportunities:

  1. Create **self-fulfilling prophecies**
  2. Benefit from **accumulative advantage**



> **Seemingly Minor Aspects of Upbringing Can Have Big Impacts**
> 
> In addition to the benefits that Gladwell describes, your childhood experiences and environment have an outsize impact on your life trajectory because they shape your foundation as a person—they can endow you with valuable tools or burden you with additional challenges. Research shows that the ways in which your upbringing impacts your trajectory in life can be physiological or psychological, and often unexpected. For instance,
> 
>   * If you grew up watching your parents work out arguments collaboratively and constructively, you’re more likely to have high self-esteem, strong social skills, emotional security, and a solid academic performance.
> 
>   * Kids of high-income parents have higher SAT scores than their low-income peers.
> 
>   * If you grew up in a low-income household, you’ll have a lower working memory—which lets you hold multiple ideas in your head at once—as an adult.
> 
>   * If you’re the son of a working mother, there’s a greater chance you’ll spend more time taking care of your kids and contributing to housework as an adult.
> 
>   * If you’re the daughter of a working mother, you’re more likely to work in a management position and make more money than daughters of stay-at-home moms.
>

### Advantage #1: Self-Fulfilling Prophecies

Gladwell states that**children who are taught (directly or indirectly) that they’re gifted, talented, or smart tend to live up to that expectation**. They believe that they are talented and therefore act like they are talented, which leads to them developing actual talent. This is a self-fulfilling prophecy, meaning that belief influences reality.

Likewise, **children who are told that they’re unintelligent or unremarkable tend to believe and embody that description.**

> **Nuances of Self-Fulfilling Prophecies**
> 
> In _Mindset_ , psychologist Carol S. Dweck describes how self-fulfilling prophecy has a substantial impact on children—and some of her findings may be surprising. Paradoxically, Dweck’s research revealed that children who are praised for being smart tend to shy away from difficult tasks, rather than rising to the challenge. These children want to uphold their reputation for being smart, so they avoid doing anything that risks failure, for fear of showing shortcomings in their intelligence.
> 
> Dweck concluded that this reaction comes from a fixed mindset, a belief that abilities (like intelligence) are unchangeable; when you view your abilities as unchangeable, you feel you must constantly prove yourself. By contrast, a growth mindset is based on the belief that the abilities you’re born with are a starting point, which prompts you to work hard, seek challenges that stretch you, and welcome mistakes as opportunities to learn. The two different mindsets dictate people’s aspirations and how they approach success, failure, and effort.
> 
> In sum, this type of self-fulfilling prophecy depends on whether parents praise children for their talent (fixed mindset) or their effort (growth mindset).

### Advantage #2: Accumulative Advantage

In addition to self-fulfilling prophecies, Gladwell writes that early opportunities lead to more opportunities, creating a snowball effect. In other words, **the benefits of one small advantage compound over time to create exponentially greater success**. This is called accumulative advantage, or the Matthew effect. By the same token, the Matthew effect also describes how **small disadvantages tend to snowball into larger ones.**

(Shortform note: This principle is also called _cumulative advantage_ , which sociologist Robert Merton coined in 1968 when he described how scientists who are already well-known often receive more credit than their co-authors in group studies. The term “Matthew effect” refers to a Bible verse in the book of Matthew: “For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.”)

For example, consider how one opportunity changes the trajectories of two young girls who want to be professional actors. The first girl gets the lead role in her middle school play, which sets off a series of events:

  * As the show’s star, she gets more coaching from the director than the other student actors, which helps her develop her skills and confidence. Additionally, as the lead, she has to play a broader range of emotions, and that gives her a chance to put her talent on display. 
  * That role puts her in a better position to get the lead in her high school plays.
  * Those roles make her more visible to college recruits, raising her chances of getting an acting scholarship with a reputable program.
  * Her college experience increases her odds of successfully pursuing an acting career. 



The second girl gets a minor role in her middle school play. As a result:

  * Her acting skills and confidence develop more slowly, and her talents are hardly noticeable since she has only a few lines. 
  * She continues to land smaller roles through high school. 
  * She studies acting in college, but she struggles to stand out among her classmates. She starts to have second thoughts about the viability of an acting career, so she shifts some of her focus to studying business as a backup plan. 
  * She doesn’t have the skills to land well-paid gigs right out of college, and she doesn’t have the confidence that she’ll make it before she goes broke, so she falls back on a business career. 



> **Accumulative Advantage Isn’t Absolute**
> 
> Research shows that the concept of accumulative advantage applies to many areas of life, including education, social influence, wealth distribution, and network science. However, the reality is more complex than the model suggests; for example, if the rich got endlessly richer, and the poor endlessly poorer, then there would be more trillionaires and more people in hopelessly desperate conditions.
> 
> In _The Matthew Effect_ , sociologist David Rigney argues that, in reality, there are six ways things play out between the fates of the haves and the have-nots. Three scenarios cause the gap between haves and have-nots to widen:
> 
>   1. The haves rise; the have-nots fall. (This is called the “absolute Matthew effect.”)
> 
>   2. The haves rise; the have-nots rise at a slower pace. (This is called the “relative Matthew effect.”)
> 
>   3. The haves fall; the have-nots fall at a faster pace.
> 
> 

> 
> In the other three scenarios, the gap between them narrows:
> 
>   1. The haves fall; the have-nots fall at a slower pace.
> 
>   2. The haves rise; the have-nots rise at a faster pace.
> 
>   3. The haves fall; the have-nots rise.
> 
> 

> 
> Rigney concedes that, often, one of the first three scenarios plays out and the gap widens between the advantaged and the disadvantaged.

### Case Studies: Relative Age Effect in Hockey and Academic Performance

To illustrate the benefits of early opportunities, **Gladwell examines the relative age effect (RAE), the advantage that comes with being born during the early months of an age grouping.** First, Gladwell discusses how the RAE impacts Canadian hockey players.

Among Canada’s elite hockey players, 40% are born in the first three months of the year. The reason, according to researchers: Competitive youth hockey leagues are divided into age classes, and the cut-off date is January 1. This means that a child born on January 1 could play alongside someone born on December 31, who is a full year younger.

Gladwell explains that, in childhood, a year makes a big difference in physical and mental development. Consider how first-quarter birthdays lead to self-fulfilling prophecy and accumulative advantage:

  * Self-fulfilling prophecy: Because children born during the first few months of the year are larger and stronger than their younger teammates, coaches believe that they’re more talented—even when their skills are relatively average—and invest more time and effort into developing these children’s talents. As a result, the players improve. 
  * Accumulative advantage: Coaches give these players more attention and groom them for higher-level leagues, which puts them in a better position to be scouted for elite teams.



Of course, not _all_ the best hockey players are born in late winter. But enough of a pattern exists that **we can’t attribute the success of some to talent alone.**

Second, Gladwell discusses the RAE in American schoolchildren: Among students in the same grade, older students (those born shortly after the kindergarten-admission cutoff date) tend to perform better academically. Those students are more likely to be singled out for gifted programs and advanced classes and, ultimately, attend college. Gladwell cites a study that found that the youngest students in each class at four-year colleges were underrepresented by 11.6%.

Gladwell suggests that, **by changing these age-based systems, we could create a more equal playing field.**

  * We could group young hockey players into three age groups per year, rather than one. This would allow athletes to play with more evenly-matched peers. 
  * We could set up an education system like that of Denmark’s, where ability-grouping doesn’t start until age 10, when maturity differences have evened out. 



(Shortform note: Besides changing age cut-offs, youth sports coaches and administrators can allow players to play with the age group above or below them, emphasize skill over size and physical ability (especially when assigning playing positions), and encourage younger players to play strategically).

> **Counterpoint: RAE Doesn’t Determine Your Fate**
> 
> While numerous studies confirm that RAE impacts children’s physical ability, academic performance, and even popularity in school, researchers have also concluded that birth month is just one factor in a child’s success.
> 
>   * In terms of physical ability, one study of physical literacy in 8- to 12-year-old Canadians found the impact of RAE to be “negligible.”
> 
>   * In academics, a study of eighth-grade students found that, although the RAE still had a substantial impact on student achievement, its effect decreases the longer children are in school. Researchers also recognized that students’ socioeconomic background and the quality of school they attend are also important factors in their performance.
> 
>   * Flying in the face of RAE research, a study of students at an Italian university found that younger students actually performed better than their older classmates. The researchers attributed this, in part, to the fact that younger students were less active in sports, nightlife, and romantic relationships—presumably, they were studying while their older classmates were partying.
