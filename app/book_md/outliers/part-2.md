## Part 2: The Effects of Cultural Legacies | Chapters 6-9

**The cultures of our ancestors (even the aspects we no longer practice or ascribe to) influence our present-day behaviors.** In Part 2, Gladwell explores how the legacies of our cultures foster or impede our success by examining three distinct cultures:

  1. The culture of honor (Chapter 6)
  2. The culture of deference (Chapter 7)
  3. The culture of diligence (Chapter 8)



Each example shows that **it matters where you’re from—not only geographically but also culturally.** Then, in Chapter 9, we’ll examine a case study of a school who achieved success because it challenged the cultural norms of western education.

### Chapter 6: The Culture of Honor

First, Gladwell describes what sociologists call the **culture of honor, in which your self-worth (and sometimes your livelihood) is based on your reputation.** In this culture, you’re more likely to fight someone who challenges you and, therefore, jeopardizes your reputation. Whether or not you come from a culture of honor may impact how you respond to certain situations, which can affect your life trajectory.

(Shortform note: Gladwell doesn’t make an explicit connection between a culture of honor and success, as he did with the various opportunities in Part 1—rather, he writes that Part 2 is meant to highlight how culture influences individual behavior, and how that might impact success. This suggests that whether a particular culture helps or hinders a person’s success depends on the context of their pursuits.)

Let’s explore how this culture of honor arises.

#### Two Ancient Livelihoods, Two Different Cultures

Gladwell cites a theory that **the culture of honor originated in herding cultures—and that the culture and its norms persist among herders’ descendants today** , regardless of whether or not they also herd livestock. This theory draws a distinction between the cultures that developed among herders versus farmers.

**Livelihood #1: Herding**

Herding fosters a _culture of honor_ because it’s a risky and solitary venture. Animals can be stolen, so herdsmen must demonstrate their aggression and strength to protect themselves and their animals. Gladwell notes that cultures of honor generally develop in rocky or mountainous areas that are unsuitable for farming.

**Livelihood #2: Agriculture**

In contrast, agriculture fosters a _culture of cooperation_ because it requires cooperation and interdependence. Farmers depend on each other and the community to grow and sell a variety of crops. There is also a degree of security in farming: You don’t have to worry about neighbors stealing your livelihood because nobody can swiftly steal a field of crops.

> **The Culture of Honor Protects Status**
> 
> The culture of honor is also prevalent in urban, low-income neighborhoods—but not necessarily because residents descended from herders. Instead, experts say that this culture developed in response to stigmatization based on factors like income, social class, race, and education. Stigma takes a toll on people’s psychological safety, and thus they can develop hyper-vigilant responses (often including violence) to threats to their honor and sense of worth.
> 
> Stigma may also be a factor in the rise of a culture of honor among herders, who generally occupied a lower, poorer class within society. Some experts argue that herders’ aggression was intended not only to protect their livelihoods but also to defend their status.

To illustrate how **cultural habits are passed down from generation to generation** , Gladwell cites evidence that in the American South, murders occur more frequently than in the rest of the country, and they tend to involve two people who know each other and are involved in a personal conflict (presumably involving honor, respect, or reputation). He points out that many southerners are descendants of immigrants from rocky, harsh terrains in Scotland, England, and Ireland, where the culture of honor is fierce.

> **The Cultural Evolution of “Tight” and “Loose” Societies**
> 
> Cultural “tightness” and “looseness” provides another example of how a culture’s history impacts its modern norms. In _tight_ cultures (such as Singapore and Japan), residents are generally more cooperative, more law-abiding, and face harsher consequences for crime and misbehavior. These norms emerged because these cultures historically faced higher threats—such as natural disasters, scarce resources, or foreign invasions—that made social cooperation necessary for survival. By contrast, _loose_ cultures (like Belgium and the United States) have more relaxed cultural norms and lighter enforcement because they historically faced fewer threats.
> 
> Just as Gladwell highlights the higher crime rates in cultures of honor, researchers link cultural tightness and looseness to countries’ success or failure in limiting Covid cases and deaths, since containment required social cooperation and large-scale adherence to health mandates.

#### Experiment: The Culture of Honor

Gladwell describes an experiment that psychologists Dov Cohen and Richard Nisbett conducted in the 1990s to examine the legacy of the culture of honor. **The experiment looked at how college-aged men from the North and the South responded to being called an “asshole.”**

First, Gladwell writes, Cohen and Nisbett created situations in which the men would be called an “asshole” without realizing that it was part of the experiment. Afterward, researchers examined subjects’ faces to rate levels of anger and shook their hands to assess the firmness of their grip. They also took saliva samples before and after the insult to measure levels of cortisol and testosterone (markers of stress and aggression).

Participants from the North and South had noticeably different reactions:

  * Northerners laughed off the insult when they were called an asshole, the force of their handshake grip remained the same, and their cortisol and testosterone levels actually decreased, as if they were unconsciously trying to calm themselves down.
  * **Southerners were angry, the force of their handshake grip increased, and their cortisol and testosterone levels elevated.**



Next, Gladwell explains that Cohen and Nisbett asked the participants to read a story about a man hitting on another man’s fiancé. The story had no ending, so the researchers asked the subjects to finish the story. Few of the northerners responded that the second man would act violently, but the southerners generally replied that the second man would attack the first man in retaliation.

Finally, the subjects had to pass a 250-pound, 6’3” former football player in a narrow hallway, not realizing that this was part of the experiment. Cohen and Nisbett wanted to know how close the participants would get to the man before they got out of the way. The northerners stepped aside about six feet before passing the other man (this was also true of the control group, who had not been insulted). By contrast, the southerners who had been insulted walked up to within two feet of the man, while those in the control group stepped aside about nine feet before passing.

> **Do Black Southerners Adhere to the Culture of Honor?**
> 
> Gladwell’s description of this study leaves out an important detail: All the students who participated were white. This helps support Cohen and Nisbett’s argument that the culture of honor is a more reliable explanation for the high rates of southern violence than other theories that point to the region’s poverty, hot climate, and history of slavery.

> If poverty and heat were to blame, then all southerners would adhere to the same violent norms. However, in a separate study, Cohen and Nisbett found that Black southerners and Black northerners didn’t show the same differences in behavior that was evident between white southerners and white northerners. (The third alternative explanation—the legacy of slavery—could also potentially account for racial differences.) The discrepancy between white and Black southerners may be because Black slaves didn’t have their own livestock to herd, so they wouldn’t have had the same incentives to respond to threats with violence and displays of strength.
> 
> Still, although Black southerners may not adhere to the culture of honor, they can’t avoid it, either—in many ways, it’s the law of the land. The cultural norms have been codified into southern laws and policies, including looser gun restrictions and stand-your-ground laws. Historically, southern courts have even been less likely to convict someone of murder if the victim had insulted the killer and then refused to take back the insult.

### Chapter 7: The Culture of Deference

Next, Gladwell examines the culture of deference, or cultures with a higher Power Distance Index (PDI), which measures how hierarchical a country is and how its citizens value authority.

**In high PDI countries, employees are often afraid to express disagreement with managers, power is not equally distributed, and people in power hold special privileges.** By contrast, in low PDI countries, people downplay their power, there are fewer overt symbols of power, and power is more equally distributed in society and within organizations.

(Shortform note: The Power Distance Index scores countries on a scale of 1 to 120, and it measures not only the distribution of power but also of wealth—high PDI countries have larger gaps between wealthy and poor citizens. The highest PDI countries include Malaysia (104), Guatemala (95), and Panama (95). The lowest PDI countries include Austria (11), Israel (13), and Denmark (18). For reference, the US scores 40, between the Netherlands (38) and Jamaica (45).)

Gladwell expands on this by explaining that people in high PDI cultures use mitigated speech, or indirect statements. **Mitigated speech sounds more respectful and deferential, which is important for maintaining and validating a hierarchical culture.** For example, “Let’s turn right” is mitigated speech because it’s phrased as a suggestion; in contrast, “Turn right” is not mitigated speech because it’s a command. A subordinate from a high PDI country wouldn’t feel comfortable commanding his superior to do something, so he would mitigate his speech.

(Shortform note: Gladwell notes that communication in high PDI cultures is _receiver-oriented_ , meaning that it’s the listener’s responsibility to interpret a message. In _The Culture Map_ , Erin Meyer describes this as a feature of high-context cultures, where people communicate not just through words, but also through shared cultural understanding, etiquette, and norms. By contrast, in low-context (or _transmitter-oriented_) cultures, it’s the speaker’s responsibility to explicitly state all relevant information.)

Gladwell points out that **a high PDI can be problematic—even dangerous—when mitigated speech downplays the importance and urgency of a message in serious situations.**

(Shortform note: As in the last chapter, Gladwell doesn’t make a blanket statement about whether a person from a deferential culture is more or less likely to be successful, but in the following case study, he highlights a situation in which it _hindered_ success. Furthermore, there is evidence that successful business people tend to challenge authority and swim against the current of popular opinion. While researchers attribute this to individual attributes, it stands to reason that cultural norms in a high PDI country could inhibit a person from challenging the status quo.)

To illustrate how a culture of deference can hinder success in certain contexts, Gladwell examines how mitigated speech contributed to Korean Air’s high rates of plane crashes—until the airline acknowledged and changed those cultural norms.

#### Case Study: Korean Air’s Culture of Deference Contributed to Plane Crashes

From 1988 to 1998, Korean Air’s rate of plane crashes far exceeded that of many other airlines; it was an industry outlier. Gladwell points to two factors that help explain this:

  1. Aviation accidents are more often caused by communication errors rather than a lack of technical skill: One pilot sees something and doesn’t speak up. (Shortform note: Research revealed that many aviation communication errors also result from confusion involving homophones, non-standard phrasing, and differences in meaning between languages or dialects.)
  2. **Korea is a high PDI country, and the Korean language has six levels of conversational address of varying degrees of intimacy**. Copilots and crew members used a highly deferential form of mitigated speech when speaking to the captain. (Shortform note: Korea scores 60 on the index, putting it above average.)



Gladwell argues that **if the flight crew notices problems but mitigates the message rather than communicating directly, the pilot may not understand the urgency of the situation.** For example, on one Korean Air flight, the landing system (called a glide scope) wasn’t working so the captain wanted to make a visual approach, despite bad weather and poor visibility. The first officer and flight engineer worried that a visual approach was dangerous, but they used mitigated speech to voice their disagreement. Despite a few attempts, the pilot didn’t get the hint: The plane crashed on a hill about three miles short of the runway, killing 228 of the 254 people aboard.

(Shortform note: The National Transportation Safety Board’s accident report for this flight lists other factors that contributed to the crash, including the flight’s nighttime landing and the captain’s fatigue. Some of the reasons cited may also support Gladwell’s thesis about the roles of hierarchy and mitigated speech: For example, the captain inadequately briefed the flight crew on his intended landing approach, perhaps because he felt he didn’t need to thoroughly explain himself to subordinates, and the captain appeared to believe that the glideslope was working, while the first officer and flight engineer failed to correct him.)

#### Korean Air Improved Safety by Adapting Its Culture

Gladwell writes that **Korean Air turned around its high crash rate by acknowledging the influence of the culture of deference and making English the language of their flight communications.** English removed the obstacle of mitigated speech, allowing copilots to speak to their superiors in a direct way without feeling disrespectful. In essence, this gave flight crew members permission to adopt a new culture—one that flattened a previously strict hierarchy—if only for the time they were in the air. Along with a number of other flight safety improvements, this policy change dramatically reduced flight crashes.

(Shortform note: Even before making the cultural shift in flight communications, Korean Air took another dramatic step and brought in foreigners to advise on flight safety and hold senior staff positions—a decision that ran counter to a cultural tendency toward self-reliance.)

With this example, Gladwell argues that **your culture is not your destiny** , and that being aware of your cultural limitations is the first step to overcoming them.

(Shortform note: Whereas Korean Air had to acknowledge the limitations of its _internal_ culture of deference, international companies have to understand the _differences_ between their internal culture and the cultures of the countries into which they expand. In _No Rules Rules_ , Reed Hastings describes how Netflix accommodated employees from high PDI cultures by adapting its approach to candid feedback, a pillar of the company’s culture. Hastings created opportunities for formal feedback, which was more comfortable than delivering impromptu feedback, and employees from low PDI cultures learned to somewhat mitigate their speech when giving feedback to colleagues from high PDI cultures.)

### Chapter 8: The Culture of Diligence

The third culture Gladwell explores is the culture of diligence and hard work that’s prominent in many Asian countries. Whereas the culture of honor stems from herding ancestors, he asserts that **a culture of diligence is a legacy of rice farming.**

Gladwell explains that rice farming requires higher levels of precision, skill, and diligence than Western farming.

  * **Eastern farming** , on the other hand, is “skill oriented.” Historically, rice farmers possessed neither the money for big plots and fancy equipment nor the space. They depended on their skills and long hours, working an average of 3,000 hours per year.
  * **Western farming** is “mechanically oriented,” meaning that expansion requires larger plots of land and bigger and better equipment. There is little work during winter, so farmers work an average of 1,200 hours per year. 



Furthermore, landlords often incentivized farmers by allowing them to keep or sell whatever they produced above what was required as rent. As a result, like the garment workers we discussed earlier, **rice farmers saw the clear relationship between increased effort and increased wealth.** This also cultivated their diligence.

> **Rice Farming Also Fosters Cooperation**
> 
> Although Gladwell frames the cultural difference as a distinction between Eastern and Western farming, research reveals that a cultural divide also exists between southern China, where rice farming dominates, and northern China, where wheat is the primary crop. Rather than focusing on diligence, this study found that rice farming also fosters a culture of cooperation and interdependence that persists among their non-farming descendants. The study’s author points out that rice farming demands extensive irrigation systems and requires rice farmers to work together to build and maintain canals and other irrigation infrastructure.
> 
> Earlier in the book, Gladwell describes this correlation among farmers more generally, contrasting agriculture’s culture of cooperation with herding’s culture of honor. It’s reasonable to extend that logic and assume that rice farming, which demands even greater levels of interdependence, would create a higher level of cultural cooperation.

#### The Importance of Diligence in Math

Gladwell posits that **this culture of diligence partially explains Asian students’ high performance in math.** Asian students’ aptitude for math is not merely a stereotype: Students from Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan scored highest in math on an international comparison test called TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study).

(Shortform note: Since the book’s publication, these countries have held their spots with the top math scores on TIMSS. In 2019, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan scored highest among fourth- and eighth-graders.)

Gladwell asserts that Asian students excel at math because math requires the diligence to spend a lot of time figuring out how to solve a problem. As further evidence of the correlation, he explains that students who take the TIMSS test must also complete a long, tedious questionnaire, in which many students leave questions blank—and you can predict which countries will score highest on the math portion of the test by looking at their average completion of the questionnaire. **The students who demonstrate the most diligence on the questionnaire are the same one who perform best in math.**

> **Other Explanations for Asian Students’ Math Ability**
> 
> Experts offer several other possible explanations for Asian students’ high performance in math.
> 
>   * Confucian values that are prominent in Asian cultures emphasize effort and practice, which seems to overlap with Gladwell’s culture of diligence.
> 
>   * Teaching methods in many Asian classrooms help students develop number sense, a form of reasoning that helps students work through math problems more flexibly than by memorization alone.
> 
>   * In some parts of Asia, students compete to recite math facts or perform mental calculations faster than their peers. The competition makes math feel more like a sport and motivates students to improve.
> 
>   * In Japan, children learn the multiplication table by memorizing a song called the kuku, and music makes it easier to remember information (just as singing the ABCs helps children remember the alphabet).
> 
>   * Chinese teachers use the traditional “chalk-and-talk” approach, in which they instruct while students listen. While schools in many English-speaking countries have moved toward more collaborative and student-led learning, research shows that students benefit more from teachers’ explicit instruction and problem intervention in chalk-and-talk classrooms.
>

#### The Importance of Language in Math Learning

Unrelated to diligence, Gladwell offers another cultural reason that Asians excel at math: language. For instance, Chinese is more efficient than English for learning math, primarily due to two factors:

**1\. Chinese numbers take less time to pronounce.** Since the human brain stores digits in two-second loops, Chinese speakers can hold more numbers in their mind than English speakers, whose numbers take longer to pronounce. This makes mental math much easier for Chinese speakers than English speakers.

(Shortform note: Contrary to Gladwell’s argument that Chinese speakers can cram more numbers in the same span of time, research reveals that speakers of languages that convey more information per syllable—like Chinese—speak more slowly than in languages that require more syllables to communicate the same information. The result is that speakers in both types of languages take the same amount to deliver the same information. Researchers suggest that this uniform “information rate” (rather than speech rate) must be ideal for listeners to process information.)

**2\. Chinese number systems are more regular and intuitive** than the English system.

  * For example, English speakers say “eleven” instead of “one-teen,” which would be in keeping with the pattern of other “teen” numbers (such as “fourteen”). By contrast, the Chinese “eleven” is said literally as “ten-one.”
  * Additionally, “sixty” and “seventy” include the words “six” and “seven,” whereas “twenty” and “thirty” are further from “two” and “three.” In contrast, the Chinese “sixty” is said as “six ten,” and “twenty” is said as “two ten.” 



(Shortform note: In addition to Chinese, research shows that Japanese and Turkish also make it easier for children to understand numbers’ values. Like Chinese, the Japanese and Turkish words for 19 translate to “ten-nine.” For 29, the Japanese and Chinese words translate to “two-ten-nine,” while the Turkish word is more like the English structure: “twenty-nine.”)

Because of these differences, Gladwell asserts that Asian children learn to count much faster than English-speaking children, and they learn to add and subtract more easily. Instead of memorizing seemingly arbitrary bits of information, the functions operate as part of a logical system. **These seemingly small advantages become a _cumulative advantage_ over time. **

(Shortform note: Cumulative advantage is especially significant in math because concepts build upon each other. For example, research shows that when first-graders struggle to understand place value (the concept that the position of a digit in a number indicates its value, like the 2 in 29 standing for 20), they have a harder time adding two-digit numbers in third grade.)

### Chapter 9: Challenging Cultural Legacies

Gladwell has argued throughout the book that true outliers are _given_ opportunities and are smart enough to seize them. Instead of marveling at outliers and attributing their success solely to talent and drive, he says that **we, as a society, should explore how to build systems that create more opportunities for more individuals.**

In this chapter, Gladwell examines a school system that has taken this approach by giving students the opportunity of time. The Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) Academy began in the South Bronx as an experimental, public middle school intended to create opportunities for success for low-income, underserved communities.

(Shortform note: In 1995, KIPP opened two pilot middle schools—one in the Bronx, and one in Houston. They developed the model into charter schools and eventually opened KIPP schools nationwide for PreK-12. As of the 2020-21 school year, the school network had more than 112,000 primarily Black and Hispanic students enrolled at 255 schools.)

Let’s take a closer look at how KIPP helped students succeed by challenging the cultural norms of the American school system.

#### KIPP’s Approach Increases Students’ Opportunity to Learn

Gladwell explains that traditional American school schedules reflect 19th-century educators’ concerns that “over-study” would lead to insanity. As a result, they shortened the school day, eliminated Saturday classes, and developed the idea of a summer vacation. This placed a value on alternating work and rest, rather than practicing diligence.

By contrast, **KIPP students attend school for longer periods of time both over the course of a day and over the course of the school year.** Students attend school from 7:45 a.m. to 5 p.m., and many students participate in extracurricular activities until 7 p.m. This works out to a school day that contains 50-60% more learning time than a day at a traditional public school. Additionally, the KIPP school year extends into the traditional summer vacation.

Gladwell writes that, by extending students’ time in school, KIPP’s approach compensates for some of the disadvantages low-income students face. He cites a Johns Hopkins study demonstrating that, although poorer students “outlearn” wealthier students during the school year, their math and reading scores drop over the summer, while scores among wealthy students increase. This trend compounds over time, reinforcing Gladwell’s principle of cumulative advantage (and disadvantage).

By continuing school into the summer break, KIPP enables students from poorer families to continue to learn rather than fall behind their wealthier peers. Furthermore, **Gladwell posits that this challenges the cultural legacy that tells us that alternating work and rest is more important for success than diligence.**

Additionally, Gladwell asserts that KIPP’s approach creates a more relaxed atmosphere in which students can question and struggle their way through problems at their own pace. Opportunities like this make school work _meaningful_.

> **How Much Time vs. How You Spend It**
> 
> A five-year study of 43 KIPP middle schools across the country found that, during three years enrolled at KIPP, the extra instruction time added up: They had an additional eight months’ worth of reading, 11 months’ worth of math and social studies, and 14 months’ worth of science compared to peers in other schools.
> 
> However, the study’s authors also point out there is variation among KIPP schools. For example, longer days don’t improve student performance unless those days dedicate more time to core subjects like math, science, and language arts. This appears to support Gladwell’s argument that KIPP’s culture of diligence is more effective than a cultural legacy that emphasizes alternating work and rest.
> 
> On the other hand, one of the arguments in favor of longer school days in general—not at KIPP, specifically—is that it allows for more time on non-core subjects, such as arts and physical education. Proponents say that these types of classes, which are often considered nonessential, teach students social, emotional, and critical-thinking skills that are important for success outside of school.

Gladwell credits KIPP’s unconventional schedule with students’ outlier-level success: While only 16% of middle school students in the South Bronx are performing at or above their grade level, seventh-grade KIPP students are already learning high school algebra. By eighth grade, 84% of KIPP students are performing at or above their grade level.

(Shortform note: On a nationwide scale, KIPP reported that 48% to 76% of third- through eighth-grade KIPP classes outperformed local districts in reading and math during the 2018-19 school year.)
