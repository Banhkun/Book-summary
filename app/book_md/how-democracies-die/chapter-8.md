## Chapter 8: Trump vs. Democratic Norms

After exploring the history of democratic norms in U.S. politics—and what they argue is their erosion at the hands of an increasingly radicalized Republican Party—Ziblatt and Levitsky turn their attention to Donald Trump’s presidency.

According to the authors, **the first year of Trump’s presidency was marked by repeated and serial norm-breaking.** They cite:

  * His nepotistic appointments of family members to important advisory positions in the White House
  * His refusal to divest himself from his personal business interests while in office 
  * His flimsy regard for the truth in his public statements



Under the influence of Trump and the Republicans, warn Levitsky and Ziblatt, democratic guardrails are coming down, with political behavior once believed to be unthinkable now fully normalized.

(Shortform note: _How Democracies Die_ was published early in 2018, barely a year after Trump had taken office. With the benefit of hindsight now that Trump has left office after his defeat in the 2020 presidential election, we’ve incorporated some analysis and insights from the later years of his term in office, as well as his post-presidency. This gives the reader a more nuanced and more balanced perspective than that presented by the authors.)

### Trump’s Authoritarian Moves

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that as president, Trump employed all three authoritarian tactics:

  * Capturing the referees
  * Sidelining opponents
  * Changing the rules of the democratic game



They highlight several major episodes from his first year in office.

> **Anonymous Warnings From Inside the Trump Administration**
> 
> Concerns about Trump’s authoritarian tendencies did not come solely from outside critics like Levitsky and Ziblatt. People _inside_ the Trump administration itself were sounding the alarm bells about his presidency as well.
> 
> In _A Warning_ (2019), an anonymous senior Trump administration official published an insider account detailing the president’s chaotic decision-making process and lack of focus, moral and intellectual unfitness for high office, desire to use the powers of his office to punish and harass those he perceived as his enemies, and general lack of respect for democratic norms and institutions.
> 
> The central thesis of the book is that a committed group of senior aides (including the anonymous author) thought of themselves as a “Steady State” whose mission it was to keep the _institution_ of the presidency on track, while restraining Trump’s more dangerous instincts and impulses. The anonymous author warns, however, that these internal guardrails had largely come loose by the time of the book’s publication in late 2019 (on the eve of the COVID-19 pandemic), with Trump having largely replaced his more principled advisors with loyalists and sycophants.

#### Capturing the Referees: Loyalty Pledges

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that Trump attempted to capture the referees of the American political system—law enforcement officials, judges, and civil servants—in several high-profile incidents. Early in his administration, they cite the example of Trump demanding that FBI Director James Comey—sworn to uphold the Constitution—pledge his _personal_ loyalty to Trump and drop the agency’s ongoing investigation into collusion between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.

After Comey refused, Trump took what the authors characterize as the extraordinary step of firing him. According to Levitsky and Ziblatt, this was a clear signal that Trump did not respect the customary barrier between politics and federal law enforcement.

> **LBJ and the CIA**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt single out Donald Trump as a unique threat to democratic norms, he wasn’t the first president to attempt to capture the referees or subvert the powers of law enforcement and intelligence agencies to serve his own political ends.
> 
> During the 1964 presidential election, Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson directed the CIA to infiltrate the campaign of his Republican rival, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Howard Hunt—a CIA operative who later was to play a major role in the Watergate scandal—spearheaded the operation, collecting advance copies of Goldwater’s position papers, speeches, and press releases that were then passed along to the Johnson campaign.
> 
> Johnson benefited greatly from this espionage, as he was able to anticipate and respond to Goldwater’s statements before the latter even _made_ them. Johnson went on to defeat Goldwater in one of the biggest presidential landslides in U.S. history.

#### Sidelining Opponents: Attacking the Media

**Trump, argue Levitsky and Ziblatt, also attempted to sideline his opponents through his attacks on the mainstream media.** Trump routinely labeled mainstream media, which tended to give unfavorable coverage to his administration, as “fake news.” He argued that the media was inflexibly biased against him and that voters should disregard what outlets like CNN, the _Washington Post_ , and the _New York Times_ reported about his administration.

Levitsky and Ziblatt contend that the president viewed the media as his opponents and saw launching these attacks on them as a way to discredit it—and signal to his supporters that _he_ was the only source of truth. The authors argue that this anti-media campaign helped to condition GOP voters to live in an alternative-facts universe, while raising support for various forms of media repression among them.

> **The 2020 Election, Voter Fraud Claims, and Alternative Reality**
> 
> Although it was impossible for Levitsky and Ziblatt to see into the future after their publication of _How Democracies Die_ in 2018, evidence from later in Trump’s term—and after his defeat in the 2020 election—suggests that his efforts to create an alternative-information universe for Republican voters have been successful.
> 
> We discussed earlier in this guide how Trump refused to accept the legitimacy of the 2020 election results, citing widespread voter fraud against him (despite even his own Justice Department finding zero credible evidence to support his charges). But this refusal to accept the reality of the election results appears to have caught on with the vast majority of the GOP base. After the election was called for Joe Biden, a Politico/Morning Consult poll showed that 70% of Republicans believe that the election was unfair and rife with fraud, compared with 90% of Democrats who accepted that the election was legitimate.

#### Changing the Rules: The “Electoral Integrity” Commission

Levitsky and Ziblatt further charge that**Trump attempted to rewrite the rules of the democratic game through the Presidential Advisory Commission on Electoral Integrity** , run by Kansas GOP operative Kris Kobach. The commission’s ostensible aim was to root out in-person voter fraud and clean up America's election system.

The impetus for this commission, argue the authors, sprang from Trump’s oft-repeated claim that millions of fraudulent votes were cast in the 2016 election and that _he_ was the true winner of the popular vote. Levitsky and Ziblatt counter that there was zero evidence for these claims of widespread voter fraud and that the true purpose of the commission was instead to promote a Republican narrative of widespread voter fraud to encourage the adoption of state voter ID laws and push for state election authorities to purge voter rolls.

The authors argue that state-level voter ID laws, passed almost exclusively by Republican-controlled legislatures, **make it disproportionately harder for poorer and non-white voters—in other words, voters more likely to support Democrats—to exercise the franchise**. Because voters must go to the trouble of acquiring and paying for these forms of identification, Levitsky and Ziblatt contend that these laws are a 21st-century version of Jim Crow.

(Shortform note: Trump disbanded the commission in January 2018, after nearly all states refused to hand their voter data over to it.)

> **The 2021 Georgia Election Law**
> 
> To expand upon the arguments made by Levitsky and Ziblatt, these efforts on the part of Republican state officials to change voting rules seem to have continued even after Trump left office.
> 
> In 2020, Democratic nominee Joe Biden narrowly won the state of Georgia, as did Democratic U.S. Senate challengers Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, delivering the state to the party for the first time in a generation. In the wake of that defeat, the GOP-dominated state government in Georgia passed a sweeping new election law that Democrats and voting-rights advocates argue is designed to suppress ballot access and make voting harder, especially for the state’s large Black and urban population (which was crucial to the Democratic victories in 2020).
> 
> Among other provisions, the law imposes strict new ID requirements for absentee voting, prevents election officials from mailing out absentee ballots on a universal basis, bans mobile voting centers and ballot drop boxes, and makes it illegal to hand out food or water to voters waiting on long lines.
> 
> Voting-rights advocates are most concerned about a provision that enables the state legislature (which is dominated by Republicans) to suspend county-level election commissioners. Critics contend that this will enable the legislature to cite unfounded claims of fraud and use that as a pretext to tamper with election procedures or results in heavily Democratic counties.

### Key Factors in Democratic Survival

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that**American democracy is going to face strong challenges**. They present three key factors that they believe will determine whether or not democratic norms survive in American politics:

  * The behavior of party leaders (particularly Republicans)
  * Public opinion
  * The possibility of crises like war or terrorist attacks



#### The Behavior of Party Leaders

As the authors have argued, political parties are the best gatekeepers of democracy. According to them, party leaders have three options when dealing with an authoritarian in their own ranks:

  * Loyalty
  * Containment
  * Confrontation 



There are a few ways for parties to remain loyal to authoritarian leaders. They can actively enable the autocrat by willingly repeating his lies, amplifying his attacks, and vigorously defending him against opponents. Or they can more passively empower him, either by remaining silent on his most aggressive violations of democratic norms, or issuing only mild criticisms without taking any concrete action.

Alternatively, party leaders might opt for a containment strategy, in which they side with the leader on traditional matters of party orthodoxy, but draw a line against the more egregious democratic norm-breaking. Thus, argue Levitsky and Ziblatt, a Republican Congress pursuing a containment strategy might vote for Trump’s tax cuts, but oppose his efforts to politicize federal law enforcement.

But, they warn, this “have one’s cake and eat it too” strategy is usually difficult to maintain, as **party leaders know that their own political fortunes are tied to the success of the leader’s initiatives** —and this is especially true in a highly polarized political environment like in the present U.S. If they stymie him too much, they will pay a political price. But by giving him victories on legislative matters, they help make him more popular with the public, which only _increases_ his authoritarian power.

Lastly, party leaders can opt for a _confrontation_ strategy. This would entail the party actively mobilizing and crossing party lines to remove the leader through the impeachment process or calling on him to resign.

> **Republicans, Impeachment, and Accountability for Trump**
> 
> In 2019, it was revealed that the Trump administration had threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine in order to pressure the Ukrainian government into launching an investigation into the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of Trump’s Democratic rival (and ultimate successor) Joe Biden. Based on the GOP’s steadfast support for Trump during this affair and their near-unanimous vote against the resulting impeachment charges in both the House and Senate, it could be argued that the party coalesced around a strategy of active collaboration with Trump.
> 
> This trend continued into 2021, when Trump was impeached for a _second_ time—a first in U.S. history—on charges related to the riotous and violent January 6, 2021 insurrection in which a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol complex in an attempt to overturn the election. The impeachment vote held on January 13, 2021 (a week before Trump left office) saw nearly all House Republicans oppose the charges against Trump, with only 10 out of 211 Republicans voting for impeachment. In the Senate vote held a month later on February 13, 2021 (three weeks after Trump had left office), just seven out of 50 Republicans voted to convict the former president.

#### Public Opinion

The second major factor cited by Levitsky and Ziblatt is public opinion. They argue that **the more popular an authoritarian is, the more successful they will be in destroying democracy**. Authoritarians are strengthened—and their opponents demoralized—when public opinion is on their side. When they choose to enable the leader’s norm-breaking behavior, high-ranking party officials can play a significant role in boosting his popularity by signaling to the public that the opposition to him is merely partisan. Of course, approval ratings are also influenced by the state of the economy and external events like wars and terrorist attacks, over which political leaders have less direct control.

> **Trump’s Approval Ratings**
> 
> If we are to accept Levitsky and Ziblatt’s argument that an authoritarian leader’s popularity is a strong predictor of how successful they will be at dismantling democracy, it appears that this particular democratic guardrail—public opinion—held up quite well during the Trump administration.
> 
> With the benefit of hindsight, we can take a deeper look at Trump’s overall standing with the public than the authors could have in 2018. Trump left office with a poor 34% approval rating, largely owing to his perceived mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing economic fallout. Perhaps more notably, he finished with an average approval rating of 41% over the entire course of his administration—the lowest of any president since the advent of polling.

#### External Crises

The third factor that Levitsky and Ziblatt contend will determine the survival of U.S. democracy is external crises like terrorist attacks or wars. **In the aftermath of such events, they argue, a “rally-around-the-flag” effect tends to boost public support for the government.**

The entire political system, including judges, law enforcement, and legislatures, tends to bend to the will of the executive under these circumstances, granting them extraordinary powers and deference. From Abraham Lincoln’s suspension of constitutional rights like _habeas corpus_ during the Civil War to Franklin Roosevelt’s internment of Japanese-Americans during World War Two, presidents have enjoyed greatly expanded powers during times of crisis.

But while these were extraordinary acts from leaders who were otherwise strongly committed to democratic norms, the authors argue that Trump could not be trusted to wield such powers responsibly. A national emergency could provide a dangerous opportunity for him to mount an effective assault on America’s already-weakened democratic norms.

> **Trump and the COVID-19 Crisis**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt couldn't have foreseen it, just such a crisis—the COVID-19 pandemic— _did_ befall the U.S. in the last year of Trump’s term. The first U.S. case was diagnosed in January 2020 and as of April 2021, over 570,000 had died as a result of the pandemic. The spread of the disease wrought major social and economic changes, as workplaces, recreational venues, and other public spaces were ordered closed by state and local governments across the country and 14 million Americans lost their jobs—sending the unemployment rate to 13%, higher than it ever reached during the Great Recession.
> 
> Yet, Trump did not enjoy the surge in public support that Levitsky and Ziblatt’s model would seem to predict. On the eve of the 2020 presidential election, just 37% of Americans approved of his handling of the crisis, compared to 59% who disapproved. Moreover, Trump didn’t seize the moment of the crisis to consolidate his own political power. In fact, he forcefully spoke out against what he saw as restrictions on Americans’ liberties, including mask mandates and bans on public gatherings.
