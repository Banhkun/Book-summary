## Chapter 4: Tactics for Dismantling Democracy

Having examined Levitsky and Ziblatt’s model for how political parties uphold democratic norms by limiting the influence of extremists, it makes sense to examine what happens when this process fails and autocrats succeed in coming to power. In this chapter, the authors detail what such figures do once they have control of the government. As they argue, **authoritarians use three main tactics to dismantle democracy** :

  * Capturing the referees
  * Sidelining their opponents
  * Changing the rules of democratic competition



While these changes may all technically be within the bounds of the _law_ , they all represent major violations of democratic _norms—_ and, potentially, threats to a free democratic system.

(Shortform note: We’ve moved this chapter to immediately follow Chapter 1 and its discussion of how parties play the key role in limiting the rise of authoritarian leaders. This provides the theoretical framework through which we can _then_ analyze Donald Trump’s candidacy and presidency and the threat that the authors argue he posed for American democracy.)

### Capturing the Referees

Levitsky and Ziblatt use the metaphor of a referee to illustrate how authoritarian politicians capture and manipulate the political system. In a team sport, the role of the referee is to act in a neutral manner and never to selectively apply the rules to favor one side over the other. They argue that **politics _also_ has referees—non-political, neutral actors who can sanction the behavior of politicians**. Typically, they are judges, state prosecutors, police, and civil servants. Their role is to enforce laws and regulations in a neutral and disinterested manner.

#### Politicizing the Civil Service

The neutrality of these figures is often established by law, precisely to guard against the kind of political interference pursued by authoritarians. In the United States, for example, the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, passed during the 1880s, stipulates that the overwhelming majority of federal positions be awarded to candidates based on their qualifications—and not their political ties to powerful politicians. It also makes it illegal to fire most government workers for political reasons.

This act, and others like it in other advanced democracies, helps to ensure the smooth functioning of and public confidence in government, especially since many departments perform duties that could have literal life-or-death consequences if done in a negligent or incompetent manner. It is, after all, in the public’s interest to have qualified experts in charge of agencies that are tasked with functions like pandemic responses and nuclear site management.

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that an aspiring authoritarian will naturally see these neutral figures as a threat. Because they are usually career civil servants, and not party loyalists or cronies, they are unlikely to have particular allegiance to him or her and could stand as impediments to their consolidation of power. Therefore, the goal of the authoritarian is to neutralize them.

According to the authors, this can be achieved several ways. **One tactic is to simply fire civil servants from key agencies and pack those agencies with loyalists**. Alternatively, they can wield the intelligence and espionage powers of the state to surveil and harass state officials who refuse to knuckle under. These tactics can be applied against officials in the tax and regulatory agencies, the law enforcement system, and even the courts themselves.

> **Bipartisan Abuse of the Civil Service**
> 
> It’s worth noting that these abuses of power have existed in the United States long before Donald Trump’s presidency.
> 
> In the 1970s during the height of the Watergate scandal, Republican president Richard Nixon pressured officials at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to launch politically motivated audits of his political enemies—hoping to either financially ruin them or intimidate them into silence.
> 
> And during Barack Obama’s administration, over 40 conservative groups alleged that the IRS subjected them to undue scrutiny as they sought tax-exempt status—practices for which the IRS subsequently apologized as part of a legal settlement.

#### Court-Packing, Blackmail, and Bribery

Levitsky and Ziblatt cite several examples of referee-capturing by aspiring autocrats.

In 1946, President Juan Perón of Argentina engaged in court-packing, working with his partisan allies in the legislative branch to impeach and remove conservative members of the supreme court who opposed his populist agenda. Perón then replaced these justices with loyal partisans.

(Shortform note: Although Levitsky and Ziblatt have labeled Perón as an autocrat, Peronist parties—those inspired by his ideas and governing philosophy—have continued to be popular with Argentinian voters, even decades after his death in 1974. Since 1946, they have won 10 of the 12 elections in which they’ve competed, including the most recent 2019 presidential election, won by incumbent Alberto Ángel Fernández.)

In Hungary in 2010, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz Party did their own twist on court-packing. They used their supermajorities in parliament to enlarge the size of the constitutional court and then filled those newly created seats with loyalists.

(Shortform note: In December 2018, after the publication of _How Democracies Die_ , Orbán’s party further consolidated its gains over the nation’s judiciary by creating a separate, parallel judicial system whose authority largely supersedes that of the original judiciary. All appointments and promotions within this new system are controlled by Orbán’s handpicked justice minister.)

### Sidelining Opponents

Levitsky and Ziblatt then argue that once an authoritarian has captured the referees and ensured that there will be no meaningful checks on his power from within the government, he can turn his attention to his opponents—typically politicians from opposition parties, but also business leaders, media outlets, and journalists.

According to the authors, the previous step of capturing the referees plays a crucial role here. By stacking the courts, tax and regulatory authorities, law enforcement apparatus, and intelligence agencies with loyalists, **the authoritarian can use corruption as a weapon—wielding the power of the state to reward and protect his friends and punish and intimidate his enemies**.

The authors outline several tactics that authoritarian governments use to sideline potential opponents. These can include outright bribery, privileged access for pliant media outlets, and the use of the legal and regulatory apparatus of the state to harass and intimidate opponents.

> **The Controversial Relationship Between Corruption and Authoritarianism**
> 
> Other scholars have had a different perspective from Levitsky and Ziblatt on the relationship between autocracy and corruption. In a paper published in 2011 in The Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization, co-authors James R. Hollyer and Leonard Wantchekon show that authoritarian regimes are actually associated with low levels of corruption—citing data showing that states as different as Rwanda and South Korea each experienced a _reduction_ in corruption as they simultaneously grew more authoritarian.
> 
> Hollyer and Wantchekon argue that governments that inspire intense ideological loyalty and commitment—as many authoritarian regimes do—tend to 1) recruit mostly ideologically committed (and thus, less prone to corruption) individuals to work in government and 2) be more effective at rooting out petty corruption where it does occur.

#### Sweetheart Deals in Peru

Levitsky and Ziblatt point to the actions of President Alberto Fujimori In Peru. Fujimori used the power of the purse to pressure television stations into giving him and his regime favorable coverage. He did this by awarding lucrative state broadcasting contracts exclusively to friendly media outlets that promised to present his government in the most favorable light—creating a strong financial incentive for private media to collude with the regime.

(Shortform note: Fujimori’s authoritarian, repressive tactics went far beyond bribery and capture of the media. His government also engaged in serious human rights abuses against Peru’s indigenous and rural population. According to the BBC, more than 200,000 Peruvians were pressured into undergoing sterilization procedures during Fujimori’s presidency from 1990 to 2000—either by being offered material incentives or threatened with financial punishment if they had more children.)

#### Intimidation in Russia

Alternatively, note Levitsky and Ziblatt, the government can abuse its tax and regulatory authority to break up businesses that it fears might provide campaign funding for political opponents. The authors argue that this has been a favorite tactic of Vladimir Putin, President of Russia. Alleging financial impropriety, Putin has ordered politically motivated investigations of large media and oil conglomerates who refuse to align with him. These investigations result in the breakup of such businesses, after which they are sold off to friendly oligarchs at below-market value—thus rewarding Putin’s allies and punishing his opponents.

Putin has even imprisoned wealthy business leaders who have dared to stand in his way, usually on trumped-up charges. This was the fate of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who drew Putin’s ire when he began to handsomely fund the Russian president’s political opponents in the early 2000s. Putin had him jailed for a decade, before pardoning him in 2013.

(Shortform note: Despite these heavy-handed tactics against the oligarchs, Russia’s wealthy have generally done very well under Putin’s rule. According to a 2013 article in The Guardian, Russia is home to the world’s most glaring income inequality, with 35% of the nation’s wealth (much of it related to energy production) in the hands of just 110 individuals. This stands in contrast to the world average, in which billionaires control between 1 and 2% of a nation’s wealth.)

### Changing the Rules

According to Levitsky and Ziblatt, the final step in the authoritarian consolidation of power is to **change the rules of democratic competition to neutralize opponents**. The most effective tactics are gerrymandering (the redrawing of election districts to lock in a political advantage for one party) and restricting who is eligible to vote.

A gerrymandering example they cite is Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz Party in Hungary. After winning power in 2010, Fidesz members of parliament redrew the boundaries of parliamentary constituencies to give massively disproportionate power to the party’s base of rural voters. Because of the gerrymander, Fidesz holds two-thirds of the seats in parliament despite winning only 44 percent of the nationwide vote.

> **The International Response to Democratic Backsliding**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt don’t explore the topic, the example of Hungary illustrates the challenges faced by the international community when a neighboring country begins to slide toward authoritarianism. Hungary is part of the European Union (EU), a body whose basic criteria for membership includes a free and democratic political system. It is widely accepted that Hungary’s democracy has eroded since 2010—the think tank Freedom House even downgraded the country’s status in 2020 to “partly free” in response to Orbán’s anti-democratic moves. Yet the EU has struggled to deal with Hungary’s eroding democracy under Orbán.
> 
> Since Orbán came to power, the EU has attempted to confront the Hungarian leader over several issues—from media suppression to court-packing to gerrymandering—only to see Orbán successfully stop any outside pressure to democratize his regime. Critics argue that he has gotten away with his authoritarian practices while still retaining Hungary’s EU membership by skillfully exploiting divisions within the EU and taking advantage of the body’s overly slow and legalistic grievance processes.

#### Poll Taxes, Literacy Tests, and Ballot Manipulation

Levitsky and Ziblatt also point to **the successful efforts by Southern Democrats to marginalize Black voters in the late 19th century.**

After the U.S. Civil War, emancipation, and the defeat of the Confederacy, Black men were given the right to vote in the South for the first time in history. This right was enshrined in the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Black voters overwhelmingly supported the Republican Party, which was the party of Abraham Lincoln and emancipation. This was an outrage to white voters in these states—almost uniformly Democrats—who saw Black enfranchisement as an unacceptable threat to the region’s racial, social, cultural, political, and economic order. These Southern Democrats thus made it their mission to destroy Black voter rights.

**Under new state constitutions that were eventually drafted in all 11 states of the former Confederacy, Southern Democrats severely curtailed the Black franchise**. They achieved this by requiring voters to pay poll taxes when they showed up to vote, pass literacy tests, and navigate through deliberately complicated ballots before they could cast their votes. These obstacles made it especially difficult for Black voters (who, being formerly enslaved people, were largely poor and illiterate) to exercise the franchise. Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that these new state constitutions effectively killed true democracy in the South for over a century and made the region a one-party authoritarian state.

> **Racial Violence in the Post-Civil War South**
> 
> Although Levitsky and Ziblatt do not directly address it in their analysis of Black disenfranchisement in the Reconstruction-era South, violence played a key role in reestablishing the white supremacist racial order—in addition to legal sanctions like poll taxes and literacy tests.
> 
> According to the NAACP, 3,446 African-Americans were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1968, with the majority of these murders taking place in the South. Scholars estimate the real number, however, to be much higher, since many lynchings went unreported.
> 
> And the period immediately following the Civil War through the early 20th century—called the “nadir of American race relations” by some historians—was also the period when the white supremacist terrorist organization the Ku Klux Klan was at its most powerful. A crucial mission of the Klan was to use violence to prevent Black people from voting, holding office, or attaining economic power. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Klan engaged in a lethal campaign of extrajudicial violence against African-Americans in the South as part of its efforts to suppress and intimidate Black voters during the 1868 election.
