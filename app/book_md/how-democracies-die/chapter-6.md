## Chapter 6: American Political Norms

Having argued that mutual toleration and institutional forbearance are the two main governing norms that uphold democracy, Levitsky and Ziblatt turn their analysis to explore how these democratic norms have played out in the context of American politics. They explore how they evolved, the historical challenges posed to them by anti-democratic politicians, and how those challenges were overcome in the past.

(Shortform note: We’ve moved up Levitsky and Ziblatt’s Chapters 5 and 6 to be the first two chapters of this guide. The analysis of democratic norms is the core argument of the book, and therefore, we’ve put it front and center to immediately establish how these norms operate, how authoritarian actors abuse and violate them—and, in this chapter, how they have historically functioned in American politics.)

### American Democratic Norms: A Brief History

**How have mutual toleration and institutional forbearance operated in the context of American politics?** At first, argue Levitsky and Ziblatt, they hardly operated at all. Immediately after the ratification of the U.S. Constitution, the political system was characterized by intense partisan warfare between America’s two original parties—the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans.

The two parties viewed each other with mutual hostility. Both parties engaged in constitutional hardball, most notably through manipulating the size of the Supreme Court (whose size is not fixed by the Constitution) to maximize partisan advantage and censorship laws that targeted newspaper editors sympathetic to the other party.

Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that this tit-for-tat cycle only subsided when a new generation of politicians rose to prominence in the aftermath of the War of 1812 following the demise of the old Federalist Party. These leaders had come of political age under the Constitution and were not defined by the bitter struggles of the early republic. They accepted the give-and-take of democratic politics.

> **Truly an “Era of Good Feelings”?**
> 
> This age of post-partisan reconciliation has even been given a name by historians: “The Era of Good Feelings.” It typically refers to the period that coincides with the presidency of James Monroe (1817-1825).
> 
> One of Monroe’s chief aspirations as president was to inaugurate an era of political life free from the bitter partisan struggles that had marked the years immediately following independence. In an early precursor to modern political campaigning, he even launched a goodwill tour across the country in the summer of 1817, meeting with as many Americans as he could in an effort to transcend the ideological and regional conflicts that had so divided the young country.
> 
> However, this supposed era of comity was, in reality, far more hostile and contentious than Levitsky and Ziblatt portray it in _How Democracies Die_. Monroe, a Democratic-Republican, partially achieved this era of post-partisan togetherness by using the powers of his office to harshly attack and eliminate the rival Federalists, whom he viewed as traitors for having failed to support the War of 1812. He shut them out of all federal patronage and worked behind the scenes to remove them from public offices they held at both the federal and state levels—actions that would appear to violate Levitsky and Ziblatt’s democratic norms of mutual toleration and institutional forbearance.

#### Slavery and the Repolarization of Politics

**According to Levitsky and Ziblatt, partisan tensions escalated once again in the 1850s during the struggle over the future of slavery in the United States**. The rise of the anti-slavery Republican Party in the northern states during this time prompted a harsh reaction from the more southern-based Democratic Party, which viewed the Republicans as an existential threat to the South’s racial, social, and economic order. Mutual toleration was dead once again, paving the way for the U.S. Civil War.

After the northern victory in the war, Democrat Andrew Johnson acceded to the presidency following Lincoln’s assassination. Congressional Republicans, angered by Johnson’s insufficient commitment to protecting the civil rights of formerly enslaved people, began a new cycle of hyper-partisan brinkmanship. They used their veto-proof majorities to pass acts severely curtailing the president’s authority. This culminated in 1866 with Johnson’s impeachment in the House of Representatives and near-removal by the Senate.

Clearly, the Constitution hadn’t prevented American democracy from spiraling into civil war and dangerous partisanship. What the political system needed was better norms to guide politicians’ behavior.

> **The Impeachment of Andrew Johnson**
> 
> Levitsky and Ziblatt treat the partisan back-and-forth following the Civil War, during the presidency of Andrew Johnson, as a dangerous era of brinksmanship that could have torn apart the country’s clearly fragile democracy.
> 
> If we accept their characterization of Johnson’s impeachment as a particularly alarming episode, then it’s worth noting just how close it came to being even _worse_. As the authors note, Johnson was impeached in the House of Representatives for alleged misdemeanors (stemming from Johnson’s refusal to abide by acts passed by congressional Republicans that he believed unconstitutionally limited his presidential authority). But two-thirds of the U.S. Senate would have been required in order to _convict_ Johnson of the charges and remove him from office.
> 
> As it happened, Johnson was acquitted in the Senate by a single vote. As the roll call was taking place, a Republican senator from Kansas named Edmund Ross decided to switch sides and cast a “Not Guilty” vote for Johnson, stunning his fellow Republicans, saving Johnson’s presidency—and, possibly, stopping institutional forbearance from being further violated.

#### The 20th Century: The Golden Age of American Norms

In Levitsky and Ziblatt’s analysis,**the political system eventually regained the democratic norms it needed to survive** when the Republican Party began abandoning its historical commitment to black civil rights (the Republicans were generally the more progressive of the two parties on these issues at this time).

Following the contested presidential election of 1876, Republicans and Southern Democrats came to an agreement known as the Compromise of 1877. This agreement let the Republicans take the White House, in exchange for the withdrawal of federal troops from the South. After the removal of the troops, white Southern Democrats rewrote state constitutions and systematically disenfranchised black citizens.

**_This_ was the basis for the great mid-20th-century era of cooperation, when mutual toleration and institutional forbearance held strong** and major legislation, Supreme Court appointments, and even constitutional amendments regularly passed with strong bipartisan majorities. Racial apartheid, argue the authors, was the glue of bipartisanship in the 20th century.

> **The Era of Bipartisanship**
> 
> As noted in _The New Yorker_ , the decades running from the New Deal of the 1930s to the Watergate crisis of the 1970s were the high-water mark of bipartisan governance in the United States. It was a time of political dominance for the Democratic Party, which won eight out of 11 presidential elections from 1932 through 1976 and held large majorities in both houses of Congress throughout almost the entire period.
> 
> But it was not necessarily a time of progressive or liberal governance, despite the hammerlock on federal power held by Democrats. Congressional politics at the time were dominated by the “conservative coalition” of Southern segregationist Democrats (usually known as “Dixiecrats”) who headed most of the major congressional committee, and their conservative Republican allies. Together, they were able to keep a range of progressive legislation—from national health insurance to expansion of Social Security to increased federal funding of schools—from passing into law.
> 
> This cross-party cooperation toward generally conservative policy ends was only possible in a relatively non-polarized era for U.S. politics. The Democratic and Republican parties were not yet neatly sorted into distinct ideological camps, as social and economic conservatives still had significant clout within _both_ parties. There was less incentive for either party to violate norms to try to gain advantage over the other because their ideological convergence on many issues made them something more akin to coalitional _partners_ rather than _enemies_.

### U.S. Checks and Balances

After providing this brief overview of the ups and downs of democratic norms throughout American political history, Levitsky and Ziblatt make their case for how the political system is _supposed_ to function. They argue that the U.S. Constitution’s system of checks and balances across the three branches of government**are meant to operate the same, regardless of which party happens to control which branch.**

In their analysis, each branch of government—executive, legislative, and judicial—has a role to play in upholding these norms. By the same token, each branch has the ability to _violate_ them if it so chooses.

#### Executive Norms

**The Constitution does not clearly set the limits of presidential power. This can leave open gaps that can be exploited by a creative and unscrupulous executive**. For example, presidents can issue executive orders on a range of policy matters, which enables them to effectively sidestep Congress and legislate on their own.

Because of this potential for abuse, Levitsky and Ziblatt argue for the importance of norms in the absence of formal limits on presidential power. Presidents must exercise some self-restraint, lest they set a dangerous precedent. And, for much of the modern era, this is indeed what they did. Presidents, according to the authors, have generally resisted the opportunity to use the powers of their office to gain an advantage over the other two branches or override their authority, even when adhering to such norms came at a political cost.

> **Downsides of Executive Restraint**
> 
> Despite Levitsky and Ziblatt’s celebration of presidential restraint, some commentators have made the opposite case, arguing that an overly cautious approach on the part of a president can lead to political impotence and failure to unite the country behind a bold agenda.
> 
> In 2010 in _The Nation_ , liberal journalist William Greider argued that Barack Obama’s hesitancy about fully using the powers of the presidency was to blame for government gridlock during his administration, the failure to adequately deal with the fallout from the Great Recession, and the continuation of unpopular wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that he’d promised to end.

#### Congressional Norms

**Strong norms also govern behavior in the legislative branch** , argue Levitsky and Ziblatt. In the U.S. Senate, the filibuster is a procedural device that can allow the party in the minority to require a ⅗ majority vote (60 votes) to end debate on a bill and proceed to a full vote.

In theory, this rule is in place to ensure that the minority party plays a role in governance and that the other party can’t exercise undiluted power with just a bare majority. But the filibuster can also be abused, giving the minority party extraordinary power to grind the business of government to a halt.****

**The authors cite the norm of institutional forbearance as the reason why parties in the minority historically refrained from abusing the filibuster to obstruct ordinary legislation**. Indeed, for much of the 20th century (especially 1917 through 1959), parties adhered to this norm, allowing most legislation to come to a majority up-or-down vote and only invoking the filibuster rule in exceptional circumstances.

(Shortform note: Levitsky and Ziblatt don’t acknowledge what the filibuster _was_ primarily used for. It was the favorite tool of Southern segregationist Democrats when they wished to block civil rights legislation—like federal anti-lynching bills—from coming up for a vote. During the bipartisan era that Levitsky and Ziblatt celebrate in _How Democracies Die_ , over 200 anti-lynching bills were proposed in Congress, nearly all of which had majority support. But because of the use of the filibuster (which was rarely ever used against any _other_ kind of legislation), none of them succeeded in becoming law.)

### 20th Century Challenges

As Levitsky and Ziblatt argue, **the bipartisan agreement to abandon Black civil rights set the stage for the long era of bipartisan cooperation and upholding of democratic norms** that characterized much of 20th-century American politics.

Despite what they describe as a general adherence to mutual toleration and institutional forbearance during the 20th century, Levitsky and Ziblatt do acknowledge that there were real challenges to these norms during this era.

#### FDR and the Court-Packing Plan

One prominent episode the authors point to is Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1937 court-packing plan. After winning a landslide reelection in 1936, Roosevelt proposed an ambitious plan to fundamentally reshape the constitutional order. Frustrated by the conservative Supreme Court’s practice of routinely striking down New Deal legislation, he proposed legislation that would have given him the power to appoint an additional justice for each sitting justice over the age of 70.

Since, at the time of the legislation, six of the nine justices were _already_ over the age of 70, the plan would have given Roosevelt the authority to appoint six new justices and expand the size of the court to 15.

While it would have been allowed under the rules of the Constitution (which does not set limits on the size of the Court), this plan’s success would have represented **a major breach of forbearance by the executive at the expense of the judiciary.**

But the plan met with fierce bipartisan opposition, even from Roosevelt’s erstwhile allies, and was ultimately defeated. The defeat of the court-packing measure stands as an example of a norm holding firm in the face of challenge.

> **Court-Packing Today**
> 
> Despite the failure of FDR’s efforts to manipulate the size of the Supreme Court, there is a growing chorus of activists—particularly on the left—who argue that the current court _must be reformed or expanded in order to preserve democratic norms_.
> 
> Mark Tushnet, a Harvard Law constitutional scholar who has written extensively about constitutional hardball and democratic norms, believes that the 6-3 conservative majority on the present Court has _itself_ repeatedly breached institutional forbearance by acting as a nakedly partisan body on behalf of the Republican Party. He argues that the Court’s unilateral and unchallengeable ability to nullify laws enacted by popular legislative majorities is inconsistent with how democracies should operate. According to Tushnet, this strong form of judicial activism is increasingly out of step with how courts and legislatures interact in other democratic systems.
> 
> Tushnet proposes reforming the system of lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court and replacing it with fixed 18-year term limits, to bring some measure of democratic accountability.
