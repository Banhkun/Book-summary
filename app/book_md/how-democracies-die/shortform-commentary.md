## Shortform Commentary

Having analyzed and absorbed Levitsky and Ziblatt’s ideas about democratic decline and what they perceive as the threats to U.S. democracy, it’s worth discussing the long-term impact of _How Democracies Die_ —as well as some of the pushback the book has subsequently received, the analytical gaps in the authors’ approach, and how they’ve updated their thinking on these issues since the book’s publication in 2018.

_How Democracies Die_ was a highly influential piece of scholarship upon its initial publication in 2018. One lasting impact of the book was the elevation of the concept of democratic norms to the forefront of the national discourse. This was an era in which President Donald Trump appeared to many to be a serial violator of traditional patterns of conduct for someone in high office—from his famously extemporaneous and undisciplined speaking style to his practice of government-by-tweet to his delight in public name-calling of his enemies to his penchant for conspiracy theories.

These behaviors, while not illegal, nonetheless appeared to many to be serious breaches of proper decorum in a healthy democratic society. _How Democracies Die,_ through its detailed study of democratic norms,__ helped to define _why_ Trump’s presidency seemed so threatening to so many.

### Structural Deficiencies of American Democracy

In the book, Levitsky and Ziblatt place the blame for what they see as America’s faltering democracy and shredding of democratic norms at the feet of the Republican Party—which they characterize as being in thrall to white nationalist identity politics. In their analysis, a GOP that only appeals to the nation’s proportionally diminishing white population will remain a clear and present danger to democracy.

But Levitsky and Ziblatt’s analysis does not account for some of the democratic deficiencies embedded in America’s constitutional structure itself. These existed long before the authors argue that the GOP began its drift toward white identity politics in the 1960s.

For example, the U.S. Constitution, ratified in the 18th century, awards each state two senators, regardless of population. This immediately conferred an advantage on smaller states, giving them disproportional representation in the upper chamber relative to their actual number of voters.

Some political observers have argued that the Senate itself, by virtue of this unrepresentative composition, undermines democratic norms. At the time of the Constitution’s adoption, the largest state, Virginia, had a population roughly nine times greater than that of the smallest state, Georgia. Today, the most populous state, California, has a population approximately 70 times that of the smallest state, Wyoming. Put another way, Wyoming voters have 70 times the voting power of Californians.

Some observers fear that the Senate’s undemocratic character will only grow worse. If current population trends continue and the institution is not reformed, 2040 will see 66% of the country represented by a mere 30% of the Senate.

### The Reaction Against “Normcore”

The book’s success in highlighting the importance of democratic norms also helped spawn a backlash against what critics called “normcore politics”—the belief that Trump represented a unique and unprecedented threat to American democracy and that what was needed was a restoration of the country’s tarnished democratic code of conduct.

These critics argued that a return to pre-Trump democratic norms was not possible or even desirable, since (as Levitsky and Ziblatt do acknowledge) those norms only existed in a context of relatively non-polarized and non-ideological parties and the large-scale political disenfranchisement of the nation’s Black population. Instead, these critics argued that the American political system needed to _tear down_ the vestiges of many of its old norms and create new ones to shift the country more closely toward a true multiracial democracy.

Since the publication of _How Democracies Die_ , Levitsky and Ziblatt appear to have accepted this analysis and recommended their own set of major structural reforms to the American political system. In a joint _New York Times_ op-ed published in October 2020, they called for:

  * The enactment of universal, automatic, and same-day voter registration
  * A federal ban on partisan gerrymanders by state legislatures
  * The full restoration of voting rights for convicted felons
  * The abolition of the Senate filibuster
  * Statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico
  * A constitutional amendment to eliminate the Electoral College and replace it with direct election of the president



They argue that these structural reforms will restore majoritarian rule in the US. They also contend that they will render the Republican Party’s strategy of appealing solely to its white base electorally untenable—forcing it to abandon its norm-breaking behavior and truly compete for the votes of _all_ Americans.
