## Introduction

_The Effective Executive_ focuses on how to _manage yourself_ so you get results and help others in your organization get results.

When it comes to results, Drucker differentiates between efficiency and effectiveness: Efficiency is getting a lot of things done, while effectiveness is choosing and getting the _right_ things done. (Shortform note: Elsewhere, Drucker regularly made the often-quoted comment that there’s “nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.”) He defined **the right things as those that significantly improve personal and organizational performance**.

Further, he writes that effectiveness, unlike innate attributes such as talent and intelligence, entails a set of practices you can learn. In fact, it’s essential to learn effectiveness because without it, talent and intelligence won’t get you anywhere. You need effectiveness to magnify and translate them into results.

Individual effectiveness is necessary for _organizational_ effectiveness as well. Drucker argues that rather than hiring for talent, charisma, or a broad set of skills, organizations would be better off if they prioritized effectiveness: Hiring for and developing individual effectiveness strengthens organizations by increasing their performance and results. In turn, successful organizations—businesses, nonprofits, government, and educational institutions—strengthen the social order and provide services and products valuable to society.

> **Hiring for Charisma Doesn’t Work**
> 
> Companies and their boards are often prone to hiring charismatic, high-profile, attention-getting CEOs. But Drucker wrote in 2005 that in 65 years of interviewing executives, he found no common qualities for success (neither charisma nor anything else). Top-performing executives varied in personality and style. Rather, what they had in common were key _practices_ for effectiveness.
> 
> Similarly, Jim Collins writes in _Good to Great_ that charisma is overrated in hiring CEOs; some of the best CEOs he found were unassuming but disciplined and resolute. In _Quiet_ , Susan Cain quotes a study of 128 executives showing that extroverted or charismatic leaders were no more effective than introverts. In some instances, introverted leaders performed better. Further, psychologist Carol Dweck writes in _Mindset_ that hiring for charisma alone can lead to disaster, with the fall of Enron due to the arrogance of its leaders (who ignored the company’s issues) as a case in point.

> **Defining Personal Effectiveness Today**
> 
> In the years since Drucker defined effectiveness, much more has been written about what it is and how to achieve it. Many self-help authors on individual effectiveness define effectiveness either in terms of productivity (Drucker’s efficiency), or as a collection of personal qualities and leadership ability.
> 
> For example, _Getting Things Done_ focuses on effectiveness as productivity, but Stephen Covey’s _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ focuses more broadly on qualities and behaviors such as developing initiative, collaborating, and communicating. In _The 21 Immutable Laws of Leadership_ , John Maxwell argues that effectiveness is contingent on leadership ability, then explains the behaviors, attitudes, and skills necessary for leadership—for example, planning, prioritizing, and persistence.
> 
> In _The Effective Executive_ , Drucker doesn’t define leadership, but treats it as an assumed outgrowth of effectiveness. His practical definition of effectiveness focuses on _doing_ rather than _being or becoming_ a certain type of leader.
> 
> **Defining Organizational Effectiveness Today**
> 
> Most current definitions of organizational effectiveness incorporate or morph into efficiency—for example, a typical definition of effectiveness is how _efficiently_ an organization meets the outcomes and objectives it has defined for itself. However, efficiency is unsustainable—once you’ve maximized your process, there’s nowhere else to go; further, as your competitors improve, your process is no longer a differentiator. In contrast, Drucker’s definition of effectiveness—focusing on what an organization can do better rather than faster or cheaper—lends itself to innovation and ongoing growth.

### Drucker’s Five Practices for Effectiveness

This section presents an overview of Drucker’s five practices for effectiveness and how they’re viewed today.

The practices are interconnected, and **they revolve around strategic thinking and prioritizing—that is, determining the highest-impact things you can do and making sure you get them done.** Practices 1, 2, and 5—managing your time, doing key tasks, and making good decisions—all involve prioritizing; maximizing strengths (practice 4) requires knowing your unique contribution (practice 3) because it likely will relate to a strength. Here’s a brief look at each practice, then and now.

**1)** **Manage your time:** Know exactly how you’re using your time. Work diligently to manage the limited amount of your time you can control.

  * (Shortform note: We’ve seen an explosion of time management books, methods, courses, and tools such as planners and apps, to the point where some think we’re overscheduled while others advocate scheduling even our leisure time. We’ve also layered in the concept of achieving work-life balance.) 



**2)** **Focus:** Concentrate on a few high-impact tasks—areas where you can produce excellent results—one at a time. Set priorities and stick with them, ignoring distractions.

  * (Shortform note: While time management practices initially addressed getting more done, which led to multitasking, that’s fallen out of favor. Science has shown that we can’t effectively do multiple things at once. Prioritizing is now the focus. Books such as _7 Habits_ , _Eat That Frog_ , _The One Thing_ , and many others address Drucker’s idea of doing less but doing the right things.)



**3)** **Make your unique contribution:** Focus on what you personally can do to significantly impact company performance and results. Ask yourself what _results_ you need to produce rather than what tasks you need to do.

  * (Shortform note: Results-based management began with Drucker’s introduction of MBOs—Management By Objectives—in the 1950s and is an ongoing trend in management and leadership. OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) are later evolutions of MBOs. Further, Drucker’s idea of focusing on your unique contribution to produce results is closely related to the next practice, which ties to yet another management trend noted below.)



**4) Maximize strengths:** Build on your strengths and those of the people around you, including your boss, to enhance their contributions and thus, the organization’s performance.

  * (Shortform note: Strengths-based development of leaders and employees has become a mantra in human resources due to concerns about employee morale and research showing that playing to people’s strengths increases performance and profit.)



**5)** **Make sound decisions:** Focus on making only a few key decisions following a systematic process. Don’t strive for consensus but make a judgment after exploring a full spectrum of opinions, especially dissenting opinions.

  * (Shortform note: While organizations and teams typically shy away from disagreement or conflict, the idea of constructive dissent as an obligation for leaders and employees is gaining currency as an antidote to groupthink.)



In _The Effective Executive_ and subsequent writing, Drucker stressed that **becoming effective is a modest, achievable goal for individuals and organizations.** By building on strengths in particular, average people and organizations can achieve above-average performance. Everyone should be able to become effective by working at it. (Shortform note: The subsequent tools and training programs built on Drucker’s ideas underscore his point that effectiveness is learnable.)

In upcoming sections, we’ll explore in detail each of the five effectiveness practices, how they connect, and how others have interpreted the ideas.

> **How Drucker Refined His Five Practices**
> 
> In the decades following _The Effective Executive_ , Drucker wrote multiple articles on effectiveness, continuing to restate and refine the practices. His core ideas remained the same over many decades, but he divided his ideas into two approaches to effectiveness—individual and organizational. (Note that these approaches continued to overlap.)
> 
> In a 2004 article, Drucker outlined these practices for organizational effectiveness:
> 
>   * **Ask what needs to be done and what’s right for the organization** : The answers require setting priorities, sticking with them, and putting everything else on the back burner; determining and doing what you’re best at and delegating what you’re poor at doing.
> 
>   * **Develop action plans** : This requires thinking about what results you want, possible constraints, check-in points and revisions, and how you’ll spend your time.
> 
>   * **Take responsibility for decisions and implementation** : Determine who’s accountable, the deadlines, and who’s affected or needs to be informed; communicate and then hold people accountable for performance.
> 
>   * **Focus on exploiting opportunities rather than fixing problems.**
> 
>   * **Make your meetings efficient and productive.**
> 
>   * **Use ”we” rather than “I”; listen before speaking.**
> 
> 

> 
> In a second article, Drucker outlined practices for personal development and managing your career:
> 
>   * Determine your strengths and focus on improving them.
> 
>   * Determine _how_ you work best, and then work that way.
> 
>   * Identify your values.
> 
>   * Determine where you belong (where your strengths will produce results).
> 
>   * Ask what your contribution should be.
> 
>   * Take responsibility for relationships (know and play to the strengths and preferences of your boss and coworkers).
> 
>   * Take responsibility for communicating what you’re doing, how, and why.

### The Rise of the Knowledge Worker

In addition to executives, Drucker’s intended audience for his ideas on effectiveness includes knowledge workers.

The first to use the term in 1959, he defined knowledge workers as those who independently use knowledge acquired through formal education to produce results—in other words, people who think for a living. Drucker argues that knowledge workers are, in effect, executives because, whether or not they supervise anyone else, they make the same types of decisions as managers (about planning, organizing, integrating) as opposed to following orders. Therefore, they, too, need to be effective.

(Shortform note: Examples of knowledge workers include professionals, scientists, educators, analysts, system designers, software developers, health care workers, engineers, and other white-collar workers. These workers find and analyze information and apply it to solve problems, generate ideas, or create new products and services.)

Previously, manual or blue-collar work predominated. Manual workers only needed to do things efficiently and as directed. **Productivity meant producing a quantity of something** —effectiveness wasn’t needed. (Shortform note: In 1920, manual workers outnumbered knowledge workers 2-1 but by 1980, the situation had completely reversed; 1956, around the time Drucker began writing about the shift, was the point at which white-collar workers first outnumbered blue-collar workers.)

In contrast to manual workers, Drucker realized that **for the knowledge worker, productivity requires effectiveness**. They must apply and share information effectively. Rather than being told what to do, knowledge workers determine and contribute information and ideas important to the organization’s performance (what Drucker refers to as “the right things”).

Drucker realized the economic shift had implications for the way organizations were structured and managed. Knowledge work requires a decentralized, collaborative environment where employees exercise initiative and, for effectiveness, must think and manage themselves, communicate their information in a useful form to the people who need it, and learn continuously. (Shortform note: Part of creating an environment where knowledge workers can succeed is acknowledging and treating them as experts.)

> **Knowledge Workers Today**
> 
> Knowledge work continues to be the world's fastest-growing employment sector, according to the Reference for Business.
> 
> The _Wall Street Journal_ reported in 2016 that in the U.S., jobs in knowledge work were growing by about 1.9 million a year, more than any other type of job since the 1980s. By another estimate, the world surpassed 1 billion knowledge workers in 2019. _Forbes_ declared 2020, a year in which the Covid-19 pandemic forced a global shift to remote work, the year of the knowledge worker.
> 
> In the future, a combination of factors, including the retirement of the baby boom generation, lack of access to college by blue-collar workers, and the continually expanding knowledge economy, may create a shortage of knowledge workers. To fill positions, businesses will need to offer competitive salaries and benefits, flexibility, autonomy, growth opportunities, and an attractive work environment. To get jobs, employees will need to show motivation, creativity, interpersonal skills, and continuous learning, besides having the right knowledge base.
> 
> However, a _Harvard Business Review_ article argues that businesses should consider all of their employees to be knowledge workers—including those engaged in seemingly routine tasks. As companies move from an efficiency to an effectiveness mindset to innovate and address constant disruption, encouraging everyone to be a problem-solver will be a key to improving company performance.
