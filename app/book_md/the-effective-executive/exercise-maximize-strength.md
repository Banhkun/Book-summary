## Exercise: Maximize Strength

To increase your effectiveness and that of your organization, identify and build the strengths of those around you, as well as your own.

* * *

What’s your main strength? Analyze your performance over the past month. What came more easily to you than to others?

How can you maximize this strength to boost your performance and your organization’s?

Think of a person who works for you—what comes to mind first, strengths or weaknesses? What is a strength of this person that can have a significant impact? To what extent are you helping her maximize this strength?

What’s your boss great at and how can you support and build on this strength?
