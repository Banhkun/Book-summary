## Exercise: Resist the Con Artist’s Tactics

Konnikova explains that con games rely on many manipulation strategies that target people’s natural instincts and biases. These include things like con artists gaining people’s trust by appealing to similarity, familiarity, and appeals to emotion, persuasion techniques, the superiority bias, and people’s instinct to maintain a good reputation and self-image. In this exercise, reflect on how these strategies have impacted you in the past and how you might resist them in the future.

* * *

Think of an instance when you were conned or deceived by someone in the past. Explain what manipulation tactics might have contributed to your trust in the other person.

Which of the con artist strategies or biases that Konnikova discussed do you think you’re most susceptible to and why?

Based on your answer to the previous question and the common manipulation techniques of con artists, how might you avoid falling prey to these strategies in the future? For example, if a stranger or acquaintance tries to persuade you to do something, you might get an outside perspective from a close friend before making a decision or make a mental list of the person’s persuasion strategies to see if they align with Konnikova’s warning signs.
