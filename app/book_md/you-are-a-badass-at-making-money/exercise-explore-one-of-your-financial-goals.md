## Exercise: Explore One of Your Financial Goals

Sincero describes many steps you can take to improve your mindset around money and achieve your financial goals. Explore one of your own financial goals using her techniques.

* * *

What’s one way having more money could make your life better? (For example, you could afford to take care of a pet, which is something that would improve your mental health. Or, more money would allow you to move to a nicer area with more opportunities to be in nature, which is something you’ve always wanted.)

Write down a concrete, specific goal for how much money you’d need to achieve these benefits. (For example, maybe you need to make $150 more a month to feel comfortable adopting a pet. Or, maybe you need $5,000 to comfortably move where you’d want to go.)

What’s one subconscious view about money that could be holding you back from reaching this goal? (For example, you might have a subconscious fear that you’re not good enough with money to support another living creature, and you’ll fail your potential pet. Or, maybe you’re afraid that a financial calamity will happen as soon as you move, and it will have been an irresponsible decision.)

How might you reframe that view to be more neutral or positive? (For example, you might reframe by telling yourself that having a pet would be the perfect motivation to become better with money, and you’re capable of changing for those you care about. Or, you might tell yourself that you can’t predict the future, and if something bad were to happen outside of your control, it wouldn’t be your fault. Further, moving will bring you joy in many ways.)

What’s one action step you can take to reach your goal? (For example, maybe you ask your boss for a promotion to a position that would pay more money. Or, maybe you open a savings account that’s dedicated to your moving fund.)
