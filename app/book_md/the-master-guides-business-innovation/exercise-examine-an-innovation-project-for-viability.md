## Exercise: Examine an Innovation Project for Viability

Statistically speaking, most innovation projects fail, and most experts attribute these failures to either insufficient innovation, problematic market dynamics, or inadequate project management. In this exercise, think through a project and evaluate it against these risks.

* * *

Think of an innovation project you’re currently working on, would like to work on, or would like to see succeed even if you're not directly involved. Briefly describe the project below.

Recall that to create a market for itself, a new innovation usually needs to stand out as innovative in several areas, such as performance, ease of purchasing or distribution, brand credibility, ability to interface with other products, and so forth. What characteristics make your project sufficiently innovative? What areas do you think need improvement?

Do you think this new product or service is at risk of falling into the “chasm” between the early and mainstream markets? If not, why not? If so, list at least one niche in the mainstream market that you could use to establish a foothold, and explain why it would appeal to this niche.

Recall that because innovation projects delve into new territory, they involve a lot of uncertainty, which complicates project management. How are you dealing with this uncertainty as you manage this project? Or how _would_ you deal with it _if_ you were managing the project?
