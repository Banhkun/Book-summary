## Chapter 4: The Social Proof Principle

**The Social Proof Principle states that we decide what’s correct based on what _other_ people think is correct. **If lots of other people are doing something or thinking something, then it must be good and worthy of imitation.

We see this all the time in everyday life. When we see a crowd of people forming on a street, we instinctively want to join.**“If all those people are gawking at something, it must be something interesting that’s worth checking out,”** our brains tell us.

As you can probably guess by now, however, compliance practitioners of all stripes are very good at manipulating social proof to get us to behave in ways that we otherwise wouldn’t.

For example, look at canned laughter on TV sitcoms. Although it’s not as prevalent as it was a generation ago, TV producers still overlay recordings of human laughter following “funny” lines on the show. Experiments show that the audience watching at home finds the show funnier if they hear other people laughing.

The Social Proof Principle is strong enough to override our basic intuition and knowledge. **We laugh along with the laugh track even when the underlying content isn’t funny, and even when we _know_ that it’s a fake recording. **The transparency of the ruse does nothing to diminish its effectiveness.

Like the turkey mothers with the fake “cheep cheep” noise, we’re responding to a stimulus (the noise of laughter) according to the same predictable, fixed-action pattern (laughing along ourselves).

The motive, then, is clear for compliance practitioners. **If they can convince you that lots of other people are doing something, then can make _you_ do it too.**

### Why We Imitate Others

The Social Proof Principle is one that usually serves us well. In general, you’ll make fewer mistakes if you follow social evidence than if you ignore it. **When a lot of people are doing something, it usually _is_ the right thing to do.**

Like the other fixed-action mental shortcuts, social proof saves us a lot of mental effort. We can look to others for how to model our behavior in everyday situations, rather than needing to meticulously analyze everything.

(Shortform note: You can see how social proof would have been a highly useful psychological trait for early humans. By encouraging adherence to group standards of behavior and thought, it probably played an important role in allowing many basics of society like religion, morality, and political hierarchy to develop. It was also a useful aid in achieving important collective goals like agriculture, public works, and military campaigns).

Thus, we are strongly conditioned to do as others are doing. **The problem is when we respond to fraudulent or manufactured social proof or when our social proof instinct leads to harmful consequences.**

### “Highest-Selling” and “Fastest-Growing” Products

Perhaps unsurprisingly, advertisers are among the most prevalent manipulators of the Social Proof Principle. Advertisements often tout products as being the nation’s “fastest-growing” or “highest-selling.”

The subtext is clear:**if so many other people are enjoying this product, why aren’t you?** By using this trick, an advertiser doesn’t even need to convince you that the product is good on the merits: they just need to convince you that lots of _others_ think it is.

You can see this also in the charitable, nonprofit sector. Fundraisers love to promote how many donors they have and how much they’ve raised so far in their campaigns (both of these are staples of fundraising telethons). By demonstrating how many people have already contributed to their cause, fundraisers know that they can compel many non-donors to start giving.

### Uncertainty

The Social Proof Principle will be more potent under certain conditions than others. One such condition is uncertainty.

**In unclear or ambiguous situations, we’re more likely to use the actions of others to model our own behavior.** This can lead to a phenomenon called pluralistic ignorance, in which a _group_ of people behaves contrary to the norms and standards of most of the _individual_ members of that group.

It really comes down to the difference between how _a person_ acts and how _people_ act. **Pluralistic ignorance explains bystanders who fail to help individuals in need.**

#### The Story of Kitty Genovese: A Pluralistic Ignorance Tragedy

In 1963, in the Kew Gardens section of Queens in New York City, a young woman named Kitty Genovese was murdered. While undeniably tragic, what made her murder internationally famous were the circumstances under which it occured.

Genovese was stabbed by her killer over the course of a prolonged 35-minute attack, during which she was audibly in excruciating pain and screaming for someone to help her. **Several neighbors in the crowded urban environment either saw or heard portions of the attack. Yet many of them failed to intervene.**

The media seized on apathy as an explanation for the neighbors’ behavior. According to this theory, we were becoming a “Cold Society” in which people were unwilling to lift a finger to help each other in an hour of need. Given the attack’s setting in New York City, pundits pointed to apathy as a regrettable feature of modern urban life. They warned that episodes like this would only become more common as the country became more urbanized.

But was this really what was going on? Did these witnesses simply shrug their shoulders at Genovese’s plight? Or was something else going on? Psychologists Bibb Latane and John Darley begged to differ.

They argued that some**_individual_ witness struggled to help the victim precisely _because_ they knew there were so many _other_ witnesses. **There was a diffusion of responsibility: everyone assumed that someone else would intervene or call the police, so no one actually did. **The knowledge of fellow witnesses lowered the psychological cost of non-involvement for each individual.**

They also argued that **uncertainty drove the witnesses’ actions (or non-actions).**

As we mentioned above, the Social Proof Principle thrives in conditions of uncertainty and ambiguity. In these scenarios, we strongly model our behavior on what others are doing.

In Latane and Darley’s analysis, this created a feedback loop with deadly consequences for Genovese. In the confusing and chaotic atmosphere of a crowded urban environment, Geneovese’s screams could have been any number of things: drunken exuberance, or a lover’s quarrel maybe, neither of which would warrant intervention from a stranger.

Everyone hearing it could plausibly claim that they didn’t know what was really going on. So **they looked to everyone _else_ to guide their own behavior**. And since everyone else was doing nothing, each person thought that the screams were a non-emergency. “After all, if this were an emergency, at least someone else should be looking alarmed and calling the police.” But if _everyone_ is thinking this, _no one_ is acting, and so everyone believes it’s a non-emergency. So as a whole, the group made the collective decision to let Genovese die.

> Shortform note: Subsequent investigations of the murder have discredited some of the early mythology when first studied in the 1960s. Far fewer people heard parts of the attack than had been previously thought. _None_ of them witnessed it in its entirety. At least two neighbors _did_ call the police. And, in fact, Genovose died in the arms of an elderly neighbor who came down to help her when she heard Genovese’s anguished cries.
> 
> The story is still useful as a demonstration of the principle of pluralistic ignorance, so we’ve opted to keep it in the summary, but we had to point out the facts have changed quite a bit since _Influence_ was published. If you’re interested in learning more, check out this article from the American Psychological Association on pop psychology’s “tall tales.”)

#### Safety in Numbers? Think Again

The Genovese story shows the folly of the idea of “safety in numbers.” With the powerful force of pluralistic ignorance working against you, you’re probably in greater danger in a _large_ group than you are in a small group.

As proof, Darley and Latane staged an experiment in which a college student pretended to have a seizure. The student received help 85 percent of the time when there was only a single witness. But he received help only 31 percent of the time where there were five bystanders.

#### Don’t Ask People for Help, Ask a Person

On an individual level, then, people are not apathetic. Quite the contrary, they’re remarkably eager to help. People quickly leap into action once they realize an emergency is underway.

The lesson is clear. **Single out an _individual_ if you are ever in need of help in a public place. **General, non-directed cries of “Help!” can too easily be sucked into the vortex of pluralistic ignorance. People will either be able to tell themselves that there’s no real emergency or that someone else will handle it. Don’t let diffusion of responsibility and uncertainty take root. Call out, “Hey you, in the red cardigan. I need help, go call 911 now!”

### Similarity

The second working condition where social proof thrives is that of similarity or familiarity. **We model our own behavior after that of people we believe to be similar to us.**

This has real-world ramifications. We’re more likely to offer assistance to people that we perceive as being in our in-group and are susceptible to appeals or calls to action from people that we judge to be fellow members of the same in-group.

> **The Wallet Experiment**
> 
> In one Columbia University experiment, researchers wanted to test whether Americans would be more willing to assist someone they perceived as being a fellow American.
> 
> The researcher placed wallets on the ground in Manhattan for passersby to pick up. All the wallets contained the same amount of money. But there was a crucial difference between some of them. In one group of wallets, the researchers enclosed a letter written in broken English—to convey to the finders that the “owner” was a foreigner.
> 
> In other wallets, the letter was written in standard English—signifying that the “owner” was a native-born American.
> 
> The results were stark. **People only returned 33 percent of the “foreign” wallets, whereas they returned 70 percent of the “native” wallets.** Clearly, people were more willing to do an act of kindness for someone they saw as being similar to themselves than they were for someone who they perceived as being “other” or an outsider.

> **The Person On the Street Commercials**
> 
> A favorite tactic of advertisers is the “person on the street” testimonial in television commercials. We’ve all seen it: average-looking and average-sounding people appear on screen and offer glowing personal testimony about the phenomenal experience they had with a given product.
> 
> The purpose is clear: to convince you that the person on screen is just like you. Once you identify with the person in the commercial, **you’ll want to emulate their behavior: by purchasing the product in question.**
> 
> Advertisers know how to use this tactic to drill down into the specific demographics of their product’s target audience, like having young people appear in ads for youth-oriented products.
> 
> Of course, the problem is that many of these people are not real users of the product: they’re paid actors cast to look like everyday, on-the-street people. The advertisers are hoping to build an affinity between the audience and the actors in the commercial.

#### Suicide Emulation

We emulate those who we see as being like ourselves. This can even extend to life-and-death circumstances. Research has shown that when a suicide is prominently featured in the news, copycat suicides start popping up. **Within two months of a famous suicide, there are about 58 more suicides than there otherwise would be.**

Given what we know about social proof, it should come as no surprise that there is often a similarity between the original suicide victim and the copycats. When a young person takes their own life, the imitative suicides occur among young people. When an older person dies by suicide, the copycats are other older people.

The most startling and grisly example of compliance through social proof was the Jonestown mass suicide event of 1978. Jim Jones, the charismatic leader of the People’s Temple cult, convinced over 900 men, women, and children to poison themselves at the Jonestown temple complex, located in the remote jungles of Guyana. They did this by drinking Kool-Aid laced with cyanide.

(Shortform note: This is where the phrase “drink the Kool-Aid” comes from. To drink the Kool-Aid is to blindly engage in some self-destructive act at the behest of a leader who promises lavish rewards.)

How did Jones manage to get hundreds of people to comply with this ghastly request? He did it through**a potent mixture of the uncertainty and similarity factors of the Social Proof Principle.**

  1. **Uncertainty** : The People’s Temple had originally been located in San Francisco, before Jones relocated the community to Guyana. In this remote and unfamiliar country, the followers of the cult must have felt deeply isolated and uncertain. The normal course of their lives had been totally upended. The power of social proof would have been greatly enhanced under such circumstances.
  2. **Similarity** : In this uncertain environment, the People’s Temple followers would have relied deeply on each other to model their behavior. They were cut off from the communities and networks that they had known their entire lives: fellow People’s Temple devotees were the only similar “others” that anyone could look to.



Under these circumstances, **all it took was a few people to start drinking the poison for social proof to compel the _entire_ group to follow in kind. **Correct behavior was defined not by any individual’s sense of right and wrong, but by what the group was doing.

### Think For Yourself: Pushing Back Against Social Proof

How can you push back against the social proof manipulations of compliance practitioners? How can you overcome the overwhelming instinct to conform to group behavior?

**Social proof acts like an autopilot: usually it steers us right, but it can land us in trouble if it’s being fed the wrong data.** You need to recognize situations where your social proof instinct is being triggered based on manufactured or faulty evidence. Once you recognize that this is happening, you’ll know to think for yourself.

#### See Through the Fakery

We discussed this earlier when we talked about “person-on-the-street” commercials and canned laughter in sitcoms, but it bears repeating: **compliance practitioners want to convince you that lots of people are behaving the way the manipulators want _you_ to behave.**

But ruses like fake “real people” or artificial laugh tracks are often comically transparent in their phoniness. (Shortform note: So are other “tells” like implausibly high statistics (“99 percent of dentists agree”) or, in online shopping, companies buying positive, fake user reviews on sites like Amazon and Yelp.) **Treat any over-the-top praise from a “neutral” observer with skepticism.**

You should immediately pounce once you recognize an effort to deceive you with counterfeit social proof. For example, don’t purchase products that are sold via these unscrupulous “unrehearsed interview” techniques.

You can even go a step further and demand that the company in question fire the advertising agency that produced the ad and vow never to work with them. Blatantly calling out compliance practitioners like this and forcefully demonstrating that these tactics won’t work is the only way to get them to stop.

#### Re-Think Faulty Information

Not all Social Proof Principle errors are the result of deliberate manipulation. Natural, genuine errors of judgement (like those made by the Kitty Genovese witnesses) can snowball into a group making a bad decision.

A lot of traffic accidents, for example, are caused by just a few drivers switching lanes. The drivers behind them start switching lanes too, thinking that those in front must have had a good reason for switching. Through social proof, this leads to a wave of sudden lane departures, which increases the likelihood of a collision.

Look closer at group behavior. **Is there a reason to do something, beyond just the fact that everyone _else_ is doing it? **Don’t be like a pilot who flies by relying solely on her instruments. You also need to actually see the sky in front of you. **Sometimes you _do_ need to look critically at the world around you, take the time to assess situations, and apply your own individual judgement.**
