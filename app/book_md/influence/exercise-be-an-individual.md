## Exercise: Be An Individual

See how you can resist the pull of social proof.

* * *

Have you ever gone along with group behavior, despite your own private reservations about what the group was doing? Describe how you felt and why you decided to do as others were doing.

Now, describe a situation where you did the opposite, and bucked group behavior to make your own choice. What made you act on your own instead of going along with the crowd?

Going forward, how can you distinguish between scenarios where itâ€™s right to follow the group and situations where you need to analyze the facts for yourself?
