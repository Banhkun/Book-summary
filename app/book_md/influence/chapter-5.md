## Chapter 5: The Liking Principle

**The Liking Principle stipulates that we’re more likely to comply with requests from people that we know and like.** Thus, we are more amenable to the compliance efforts of neighbors, friends, and family, or from people who _claim_ to know them. We are also more willing to acquiesce to people who we see as being good-looking, affable, or who profess to like _us_.

As you’ve probably guessed, however, this principle of human behavior creates a wide opening for compliance practitioners who wish to exploit it for personal gain. If they can get us to like _them_ , we’re much more likely to be putty in their hands. **If you like the seller, you’ll like what she’s selling.**

(Shortform note: It makes sense, from an evolutionary and group cohesion perspective, why we would be more willing to comply with the wishes of people we know. Early human communities were extended kinship groups, where the survival of the individual was closely tied to the larger familial group. In this world of localized, tight-knit communities, helping people in your in-group was a valuable survival trait: you relied on them to help with the necessities of life, like food-gathering and child-rearing. The members of your kin group would also have probably been the _only_ people you actually encountered. Thus, there evolved a strong propensity to assist individuals who were personally known to us).

### Familiarity Breeds Compliance

We are far more likely to comply with requests from people we know. **The social costs of saying “no” to a neighbor or acquaintance are much higher than they are for a stranger.**

Compliance professionals harp on this instinct and use our natural empathy for our friends, acquaintances, and neighbors against us. This explains, for example, why charitable organizations recruit volunteers to go door-to-door in the neighborhoods where they live.

People are less willing to slam the door in someone’s face if the canvasser starts their pitch with, “Hello, I live in this neighborhood…”

#### The Endless Chain Technique

The familiarity bias is so strong that the person making the compliance request doesn’t even need to be known to _us_ personally: **they just need to drop the name of someone that we _do_ know. **This is the “endless chain” technique.

Salespeople will ask a customer for a list of names of friends and neighbors who might be interested in the product. Most customers comply, since it seems like an innocent enough request.

They then approach the people on that list, opening their sales pitch with, “Your friend ____ recommended that I call on you.” This puts you, the new customer, in a social bind. **Turning away the sales person feels tantamount to turning away your friend.**

It’s called the “endless chain technique” because the salesperson can always rely on references from their current customers to generate the _next_ round of customers. If someone refuses their sales pitch, they can always do a rejection then retreat by saying, “OK, sorry that you’re not interested. Would you be able to provide me with some names of friends that might be interested in taking advantage of this incredible offer?” And on and on it goes: the salesperson rarely walks away from a visit without _at least_ a reference.

#### Similarity

Going further, we also see that people are more willing to cooperate with requests from people they see as being similar to themselves. We explored some of this when we talked about social proof, but similarity also works on a one-on-one level.

The source of similarity can be anything from religion, ethnic background, personality traits, shared preferences, or physical appearance and style of dress. We are evolved to form a bond with people as soon as we can identify some common ground with them.

In one 1970s experiment, researchers assessed how the style of dress of a petition-carrier at an anti-war rally affected people’s willingness to sign it. **People were more willing to sign the petition of a requester who was dressed like themselves.**

They often did so without bothering to read the petition itself: **similarity alone did all the work for the requester.**

#### School Desegregation: An Exception

Familiarity does not always lead to liking and compliance. In the wrong circumstances, it can lead to contempt and viciousness.

The mixed results of school desegregation in the United States speak further to this point. Unofficial, _de facto_ segregation in schools remained widespread decades after the end of formal, legal segregation following the Supreme Court’s decision in _Brown v. Board of Education_ in 1954 _._ Children of different races rarely interacted on a social level even at schools with a high degree of diversity. Clearly, claims that increased exposure to children of different races would lead to racial harmony and inclusion were wrong.

The issue, however, was not desegregation itself. It was the _circumstances_ under which it was being done. School is a highly competitive environment. Children are jostling with one another for the approval of peers, teachers, and administrators. Desegregation was always going to be in trouble in such an environment. Children saw peers outside their own racial group as potential competitors for these scarce resources. **Just throwing children of all different racial groups together was a recipe for conflict.**

**The solution was to bring the children together in a multi-racial group project, where each individual could only succeed if the group succeeded.** Research done by Elliot Aronson in the 1970s demonstrated the potential of cooperative learning techniques to break down social and racial barriers in the classroom.

The “jigsaw puzzle” classroom is a twist on this. Class activity is centered around answering questions that have multi-part answers. Each child in a group is responsible for giving one part of a multi-part answer. Thus, the children have an incentive to help each other succeed: they _all_ fail if _one_ of them fails.

### Acquiescing to Attractiveness

We also associate “liking” someone with their degree of physical attractiveness. **We are more likely to acquiesce to requests from people we think are attractive.**

Attractive people benefit from what social scientists call a “halo effect.” This means that we extrapolate from one positive characteristic (being attractive) and credit that person with having _other_ positive characteristics, even with no evidence. Thus, we associate physical attractiveness with intelligence, humor, talent, kindness, and honesty.

It is no wonder that persuaders of all stripes know how to exploit this cognitive bias in humans to maximum effect. A study of Canadian elections showed that, controlling for other factors,**attractive candidates on the whole received more than 2.5 times more votes than unattractive candidates.**

Based on the candidates’ attractiveness, voters seem to have been disproportionately persuaded of their other good qualities (policies, ideology, trustworthiness, competence). What makes this bias even more effective is that most people deny that it even exists—73 percent of voters claimed that a candidate’s looks had nothing to do with how they voted. No one wants to be _seen_ as superficial, but it seems most of us behave that way.

The attractiveness bias extends beyond the political arena. In a 1990 study of job applicants, researchers found that **the physical appearance of an interviewee was more positively correlated with being hired than experience and qualifications.** This was despite employers claiming that physical appearance played no role in their hiring decisions.

Similarly, even the supposedly impartial judicial system is vulnerable to the attractiveness bias. A Pennsylvania study found that **handsome male defendants had received significantly lighter sentences than unattractive defendants**. The good-looking defendants were twice as likely to avoid prison than others.

### Love (Or Hate) By Association

We also like or dislike people based on what we associate them with. We like people who bring us good news, and “shoot the messengers” who bring us bad news.

In the ancient Persian Empire, imperial messengers were always in a precarious position. They would be fêted and celebrated by the emperor if they brought tidings of a military victory. But if they came bearing news of a defeat, they would be summarily executed.

In a modern-day analogue, consider the plight of weather forecasters. **Weather forecasters have been shown to be met with hostility, threats, and even violence when they predict bad weather.** The association bias is so strong that people come to believe that adverse weather events are _caused_ by the forecasters themselves—meteorologists have been accused of causing snow, tornadoes, and hurricanes!

#### Endorsements

Compliance practitioners are adept at **associating their products or brands with people or things that the public knows and likes** , in the hopes that we’ll come to like the products more by association.

Presidential candidates seek the support of athletes, performing artists, and other non-political cultural figures during a campaign, even though the approval of these people has nothing to do with government or public policy.

After the 1969 moon landing, all sorts of products incorporated space travel or lunar themes into their marketing and advertising. And every two years, we’ve become used to the spectacle of brands labeling themselves “ the official fast food,” “the official toothpaste,” or “the official soft drink” of the U.S. Olympic team.

Athletes are probably the most sought-after product endorsers, because marketers know that their associative persuasive appeal is deep and widespread, cutting across ethnic, regional, age, and economic demographic groups. Also, athletes are linked to many positive attributes that brands are eager to associate themselves with: youth, strength, winning, prowess, and physical attractiveness.

(Shortform note: A quick look at some of the biggest endorsement deals in sports will show just how high a premium brands place on the association principle. NBA Star Steph Curry’s contract with Under Armour is reportedly worth $285 million. Global soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo’s deal with Nike is estimated at around $1 billion. And NBA megastar LeBron James has a _lifetime_ endorsement deal with Nike that goes into ten figures.)

#### Sports Fandom

Not only do marketers wish to associate their products with well-known symbols of public admiration—**people try to associate _themselves_ with the achievements and victories of others.**

The psychology of sports fandom illustrates this quite well. Sports are a deadly serious business for the fan. Their very sense of self hangs in the balance depending on the outcome of the game.

This is compounded because most sports teams are rooted in a specific geographic location. Thus, the fan wraps up the team’s performance with their own sense of pride in their culture, their home, their family, and their being: **when the team loses, the fan _personally_ feels like a loser. **Thus, fans cheer the players who spur the team on to victory and mercilessly hound those whom they judge responsible for its failures.

(Shortform note: One famous example is the story of Boston Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner. His error in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series caused the team to lose the game, and ultimately the series, when they were on the verge of clinching the championship. The reaction from fans and the media in Boston was brutal: Buckner received death threats and was forced to leave the city for his own safety.)

Association shows itself most strongly in the language fans use to describe a team’s performance. Studies have shown that when the team wins, fans use more first-person pronouns to describe the outcome: “ _We_ won,” “ _Our_ offense dominated theirs today” “ _My_ team wiped the floor with you.” **Because of the victory, fans are looking to _deepen_ their connection to the team.**

The opposite phenomenon happens in the wake of a loss, with fans using more indirect, third-person language: “ _They_ totally blew it out there,” “ _Those_ guys were sleepwalking through that game,” “ _That_ performance was horrible.” **Because of the loss, fans are looking to _disassociate_ themselves from the team.**

### You Like Me, I Like You

Not only do we like other people, but **we’re especially predisposed to like people who claim to like _us_**. This might seem obvious, but it’s surprising how effective it is.

Indeed, the bias is so strong that compliance practitioners can be shockingly transparent and vague in their efforts and _still_ be successful using this tactic.

Joe Girard was acknowledged by the _Guinness Book of World Records_ as the world’s greatest salesperson, having personally sold over 13,000 Chevrolets during the 1960s and 70s. Clearly, he was a compliance practitioner _par excellence_. But what was his secret?

**Every month, he would send his customers (numbering well into the thousands) a greeting card with the same message: “I like you.”** That’s it. No variation on the message, no further detail than that. And with Joe’s track record of success and humans’ known susceptibility to flattery, he was very likely on to something.

In one study, men were given comments by someone who they were told needed a favor from them. The comments given were either positive, negative, or neutral.

The evaluators who gave the men pure praise were rated as the most-liked, even though the men _knew_ that the praiser had an ulterior motive. Going even further, the subjects still gave these evaluators high marks for likeability even when the compliments they received were completely divorced from reality. Apparently,**praise doesn’t have to be genuine or even accurate for us to be susceptible to it.**

### Looking Past Likeability

So, how do you resist the charms of seemingly likeable and personable compliance practitioners? It’s hard to come up with a single rule or a one-size-fits-all defense tactic for a simple reason: **there is enormous variability in what each of us considers to be likeable.**

As with the defenses against the other fixed-action manipulations, it all comes back to recognition. You can’t simply commit yourselves to not liking _anyone_. That path leads only to isolation and unhappiness. Instead, you should let yourself like people you find to be charming, but **be aware when you feel that you like someone more than you should given the circumstances.**

If you like someone or something more quickly or more intensely than it would be reasonable to, hit the pause button and rethink. For example, if you find yourself liking a salesperson after less than an hour of interacting with her, you might want to ask yourself some questions to see if she did anything that might have tipped unduly influenced your judgement:

  1. Did she give you any personal compliments?
  2. Did she make you laugh?
  3. Did she give you any gifts?



If you can answer “yes,” then you should **mentally separate your liking for the _person_ from the _thing_ they’re trying to get you to comply with.**

Make decisions based solely on the pros and cons or on the intrinsic merits of that decision. Don’t fall into the Liking Principle and say “yes” to people simply because you like them personally.
