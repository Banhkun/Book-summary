## Chapter 6: The Authority Principle

The Authority Principle states that**people are hard-wired to comply with requests that come from an acknowledged and accepted source of authority.** Thus, we are strongly inclined to be deferential to people who we consider to be in a position of power or expertise. Examples would include teachers, members of the armed forces, police officers, doctors, and judges, to name just a few.

The instinct is so powerful that humans are responsive even to the mere vestiges or symbols of authority—titles, uniforms, and insignia can exert a strong influence. Given this strong fixed-action pattern of compliance, it is no wonder that compliance professionals know how to use the appearance or suggestion of authority to force us to accede to their requests.

### Origins of Authority

Like the other fixed-action instincts, there are good and legitimate reasons why we’re strongly conditioned to obey authority. Leadership, hierarchy, and authority are obviously necessary ingredients in any functioning society.

**Unless we want a state of complete anarchy and lawlessness, there’s always going to be _somebody_ making decisions and giving orders. **Authority of some people over others was a great advantage to early humans as they were building the first organized societies—and eventually, the first civilizations. It allowed for resource allocation, trade, military organization, economic development, and the rule of law.

**Early civilizations _were_ civilizations precisely because they _had_ some centralized authority** that was able to make decisions for the collective good and marshall the necessary resources to implement them. In the absence of authority, there is anarchy, the state of nature that English philosopher Thomas Hobbes famously described as being “nasty, brutish, and short.”

This is why we’re so strongly oriented toward obedience and deference to authority. We learn this in the very beginning of life when we are taught to obey and respect our parents, and the message only gets reinforced in the educational, legal, religious, military, and political systems we navigate throughout the course of our lives.

> **Authority and Obedience in the Old Testament**
> 
> For many people in what we would call “the West,” the Bible is the touchstone text that forms the foundation of our moral values. **It also happens to be shot through with the theme of deference to authority.**
> 
> In the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament, Adam and Eve’s fall from grace is the result of a failure to obey God’s command to not eat fruit from the Tree of Knowledge—the origin of the concept of original sin.
> 
> Later in the Old Testament, God commands Abraham to kill Isaac, his eldest son. Abraham is perfectly willing to go through with this until God stops him: the episode was merely a test of Abraham’s willingness to obey a higher authority.

### The Milgram Experiment: A “Shocking” Deference to Authority

Just how deep does our obedience to authority run? What can normal human beings be compelled to do at the behest of an authority figure? The results of the (in)famous experiment conducted by Stanley Milgram at Yale in 1961 demonstrated just how far authority can be used—and abused.

The test subjects were told that they were participating in an experiment to measure the effects of punishment on learning and memory. One set of participants (the Learners) was tasked with memorizing lists of words. The other set of participants (the Teachers) had to measure the Learners’ progress and administer electric shocks to the Learners whenever the latter made a mistake.**The lab-coated researcher was always present to ensure that both the Teacher and the Learner carried out their assigned responsibilities.**

#### Inflicting Pain

The Learners, however, _weren’t_ really test subjects, but were instead hired actors. And there was no _real_ electric shock being delivered. But the Teachers didn’t know this: they believed they were delivering real shocks to real people.

**The experiment was really measuring people’s willingness to inflict pain on others if it was part of their “job.”** At first, the Teachers were told they were administering mild shocks to the Learners, akin perhaps to the static electricity you might feel when you open a doorknob after walking on a carpet.

But for every wrong answer, the Teachers were told to increase the intensity of the shocks by 15 volts. By the fourth or fifth administration, the shocks were clearly painful.

#### Refusing to Quit

Yet, the Teachers continued to administer them, even when they themselves were clearly distraught at the idea of having to inflict severe pain on someone else.

They might glance over nervously at the researcher leading the experiment. But the researcher would only order the shocks to continue, in a series of increasingly harsh commands:

  1. “Please continue.”
  2. “The experiment _requires_ that you continue.”
  3. “It is absolutely _essential_ that you continue.”
  4. “You have no other choice, you _must_ go on.”



As a result, the Teacher would dutifully, if reluctantly, carry on with the task. Of the 40 Teachers, **not a single one refused to continue the shocks when the victim begged to be released.** Only when the victims began to scream in agony and/or show signs of unconsciousness or heart failure did any of the Teachers quit—and even _then_ it was a distinct minority.

#### Sense of Duty

Milgram was shocked at how willing his subjects were to carry on with their task as long as there was an authority figure (the stern-faced researcher in the lab coat) urging them on.

There was nothing particularly special about the group of people selected to be Teachers: they were chosen randomly and represented a broad cross-section of ages, occupations, and educational levels. In repeated trials, Milgram found that **people of all backgrounds, and of both sexes, were equally willing to administer the shocks: it was a universal characteristic.**

Variations on the experiment honed in on the authority of the researcher being the decisive factor. In one twist, the researcher and the Learner switched scripts: the lab-coated researcher ordered the Teacher to stop administering the shocks, while the _Learner_ insisted on carrying through with the experiment. **100 percent of the Teachers stopped administering the shocks when the person asking them to continue was merely an _equal_ instead of a _superior_.**

Similarly, when the researcher was _receiving_ the shocks and begged to be released, all of the Teachers refused to administer any more.Milgram concluded that the **sense of duty to an acknow ledged authority figure was compelling enough to drive the test subjects to inflict excruciating pain on others.**

### Symbols of Authority

The Milgram experiment presents an illuminating and disturbing picture of just how far our fixed-action pattern of compliance with authority will take us. But authority can also be faked or manufactured.

Titles, uniforms, and other outward _symbols_ of dominance or expertise can create the patina of authority. Naturally, compliance practitioners know how to present themselves in a way that conveys authority and expertise to their victims.

Beyond the usual mix of salespeople and politicians we’ve talked about so far, a whole variety of con men, grifters, and charlatans are quite savvy at projecting artificial authority to force compliance.

#### It’s All In The Name: The Power of Titles

**Titles often have more power to direct our behavior and perceptions than the actual person claiming the title.**

In one Australian study, different groups of subjects rated the same person as being taller depending on the title they were told that he held. With each increase in title (student, lecturer, professor), the subjects’ perception of his height grew by half an inch! This perhaps explains why door-to-door scammers frequently wear lifts in their shoes. Psychologically, it conveys a certain air of authority and _gravitas._

This deference to title can have frightening effects in the medical community. One study from the Midwest demonstrated that 95 percent of nurses were willing to unquestioningly comply with orders to give dangerously high doses of medication to patients, as long as the order came from someone who claimed to be a “doctor.”

#### Dress The Part: Compliance Through Clothing

Con artists know that most people will obey the orders or recommendations of someone in a uniform. Whether it’s a police uniform, military camouflage, a doctor’s lab coat, or even a snappy business suit, uniforms and modes of dress send a powerful message of authority.

In one experiment in Texas, researchers had a young man cross a busy intersection into oncoming traffic, to test how willing other pedestrians would be to follow him. When the young man was dressed in a freshly pressed business suit, people were 3.5 times more likely to follow him as they were when he was dressed in regular street clothes.

The “bank examiner” scam is beloved by con artists because it uses the simple power of dress to bamboozle people out of their savings. The con artist, dressed in conservative business attire, knocks on the door of the victim’s home, claiming to be a bank examiner from the victim’s financial institution. The con artist will claim that there has been some irregularity with the victim’s bank account, and inform the victim that a bank officer might be doing phony transactions with the victim’s money.

The victim is then asked to withdraw all their money from their account, so that the “bank examiner” can trace the record of the transaction to see if they can catch the embezzling bank officer in the act.

After the victim has withdrawn all their money, another bank official turns up at their door. This time, it’s a uniformed bank officer who reassures the victim that there was no malfeasance with their account after all. This person then offers to re-deposit the victim’s money to save them the trouble of another trip to the bank—which, of course, they never do. The scam works because **the counterfeited uniforms lull the victim into compliance.**

### Disobeying Authority

Refusing to comply with authority can be extremely difficult given how strongly conditioned most of us are to obeying orders. And, of course, **we _shouldn’t_ seek to rebel against _all_ authority figures in _all_ situations**.

For example, it would be a bad idea to refuse to pull over your vehicle when police officers signal for you to do so. Most authority figures like police officers, judges, lawyers, and doctors are in their positions for good reasons. They have special training, expertise, or legal sanction to be in charge in certain situations.

The trick, as always, comes in recognition. When should authoritative promptings be followed and when should they be ignored? There are two tests to apply to help you answer this question.

#### The Expertise Test

Ask yourself, “Is this person truly an expert?” This will prompt you to assess the person’s credentials.

It will also prompt you to **evaluate the _relevance_ of the authority figure’s credentials** to whatever it is that they’re trying to get you to do. This test will steer you in the right direction both ways: its logic will compel you to obey legitimate authority figures and be highly skeptical of fraudulent authority figures or those with ulterior motives.

For example, a doctor in a hospital giving you medical advice about your upcoming surgery has a) legitimate credentials and b) highly relevant subject-matter expertise in the topic at hand.

Conversely, an actor who _plays_ a doctor on TV and is endorsing some pharmaceutical or health product in a commercial has a) no credentials or training as a real physician and b) irrelevant credentials in another field: she’s an expert in acting and performance, not medicine.

#### The Truthfulness Test

In addition to examining an authority’s expertise, you need to look at how truthful they’re being. **Do they have an ulterior motive? Do they have a reason to lie or mislead?** Often, experts stand to gain personally from our compliance with their recommendations.

Compliance practitioners know that we might be looking closely at their true motivations, however. In a further attempt to deceive us, they’ll often go out of their way to _appear_ to argue against their _own_ interests.

For example, a waiter might dissuade you from ordering an expensive entree by telling you that it’s actually not that good, and instead recommend a slightly cheaper main course. In doing so, the waiter establishes trust and credibility: he must have your best interests at heart, because he’s talking _himself_ out of money! With your newfound trust and credibility in him, the waiter can then persuasively recommend expensive side dishes, wines, and desserts: after all, he’s proven that he’s a subject-matter expert and a guardian of your best interests. Of course you should trust his subsequent recommendations!

Influence truly is a cat-and-mouse game.
