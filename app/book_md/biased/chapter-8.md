## Chapter 8: Bias in Schools

In Chapter 7, we saw how racial bias impacts where people live and how they interact with the community around them. That bias also extends into the classroom. Schools are no longer legally segregated, but **black and white students still don’t have truly equal educational experiences**. In this chapter, we’ll discuss the ways racial bias impacts black students, why “not seeing color” doesn’t help students, and the innovative ways that educators can reduce racial bias in their classrooms.

### School Integration

In the United States today, many people assume that school segregation is a thing of the past because there are no longer laws explicitly barring black students from certain schools. However, in reality, school segregation has _increased_ in the last few decades. The number of schools where white students make up less than 10% of the population has more than tripled. Meanwhile, the proportion of black students who attend segregated schools has increased by 11%. This is a problem because **research shows that students of all races learn best in integrated schools**.

Beyond academics, integration has social benefits: Adults who attended integrated schools are much more likely to have racially diverse friends, live in more diverse neighborhoods, and be more civically engaged than people who attended segregated schools. (Shortform note: One benefit of integrated schools that Eberhardt doesn’t mention is that they prepare students to enter an increasingly diverse workforce. In fact, when the Supreme Court heard an affirmative action case in 2015, nearly half of the Fortune 100 companies collectively filed an amicus brief arguing that “a workforce trained in a diverse environment is critical to their business success.”)

However, integration alone isn’t always the answer. For integration to actually break through racial bias and allow people to form genuine interracial bonds, it must happen under very specific conditions that were first proposed by researcher Gordon Allport in the 1950s. For example, the people involved must have equal status in the official hierarchy (for instance, in a school setting, a successful interracial interaction could be between two students or two teachers, but not between a student and a teacher). The interaction must also have the support of authorities (like teachers or upper management) and the contact must be genuine and personal.

> **Contact Theory and the Possible Risks of Integration**
> 
> Allport’s research on the specific conditions that promote interracial bonds gave rise to “contact theory,” or the idea that contact between people of different races can reduce racial prejudice. Many studies have found that this effect is especially strong in interracial friendships (as opposed to colleague or neighbor relationships). However, these studies haven’t fully addressed the problem of causation—in other words, do interracial friendships make people less biased, or are people who are already less biased more likely to seek out interracial friendships?
> 
> Contact theory comes with two other major caveats. First, research shows that when people from socially disadvantaged groups have more positive contact with people from privileged groups, they’re less likely to support social policies that would level the playing field. Second, negative interracial contact increases prejudice more than positive contact reduces it. In simplified terms, each positive interracial experience a person has will make them a little less prejudiced; but a single negative interracial interaction can erase all that progress. That’s probably because we notice racial differences more when the contact is negative.

### The Threat of Racial Bias Impedes Learning

Eberhardt argues that even when black and white students attend the same schools, their educational experiences aren’t equal. **White students take it for granted that they’re seen and valued as individuals at school; black students often don’t have the same guarantee.** Even at a young age, they’re well aware of the stereotypes that might be lurking in their teachers’ minds, and many black students learn to defend themselves from possible racist treatment by never fully letting their guard down. That makes learning difficult because learning is a vulnerable process—it requires being honest about what you don’t know or don’t understand. And when kids don’t feel safe enough to be vulnerable, it’s much harder to learn, regardless of how smart they are.

However, black students don’t just face the threat of biased treatment from their teachers—**their _own_ implicit biases can undermine their school performance.** When black students struggle in school, it can feel like evidence that the negative stereotypes about their intelligence may actually be true. That thought can be a devastating blow to their self-esteem, which in turn makes it harder to do well in school and sets off a vicious cycle of self-sabotage. (Shortform note: This process is similar to “stereotype threat,” a psychological phenomenon in which the fear of confirming a negative stereotype about your group can negatively affect your performance. In _Lean In_ , author Sheryl Sandberg describes how stereotype threat can keep girls from pursuing math or science: Being constantly reminded of the stereotype that “boys are better at math” affects girls’ performance in those areas.)

#### Antiblack Bias in Schools Is Very Real

Unfortunately, black students have good reason to be wary of bias in their schools. **Research shows that black students face unequal treatment, especially when it comes to punishment.** In one study, Eberhardt and her colleagues found that teachers are typically fair when punishing a student for the first time—but for a second infraction, they administer much harsher punishments for black students than white students. This builds on implicit racial stereotypes: If a black student repeatedly gets in trouble, teachers are more likely to see that as evidence that they’re headed for a life of crime—but when a white student repeatedly gets in trouble, teachers are more likely to see that as pure childhood antics.

> **Suspension: The First Step in the School-to-Prison Pipeline**
> 
> The racial disparities in school discipline are linked to the racial disparities in the criminal justice system. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, school suspensions contribute to the school-to-prison pipeline because students who are suspended or expelled are more likely to get into trouble with the law.

### How to Reduce Bias in Schools

Thankfully, there _are_ ways for schools to create a more equitable learning experience for their students. Here are four powerful tools for reducing bias in the classroom:

**1) Utilize empathy-focused teacher training sessions.** In these sessions, teachers listen to students’ stories about facing discrimination in school and how worrying about racial bias impacts their ability to learn. Teachers can then share strategies with one another for prioritizing a healthy and supportive relationship with their students while still administering discipline when they need to. This type of training _works_ : Compared to the control group, students of teachers who went through empathy training were half as likely to be suspended and felt more respected in the classroom. (Shortform note: A more recent study found that empathy interventions can reduce teachers’ anti-black racial bias before they even begin their teaching careers.)

**2) Teach accurate history.** An accurate understanding of history gives kids the context to understand social issues (such as police brutality) in the present. However, teachers and school curricula often gloss over the brutal realities of slavery and other hard topics because they’re uncomfortable to talk about. As a result, young Americans as a whole are alarmingly ignorant about these important historical issues—one study found that 22% of young people have never heard of the Holocaust. Eberhardt notes that most teachers _want_ to give their students an accurate understanding of history but are afraid of stepping on toes or saying something wrong. (Shortform note: If you’re looking for concrete tools to facilitate conversations about race and slavery with children, the organization Learning for Justice (formerly known as Teaching Tolerance) has resources for teaching “hard history” to elementary, middle, and high school students.)

**3) Build trust and mutual respect between teachers and students with values affirmations.** One study found that black seventh graders who wrote daily journal entries in class about things they value (like relationships with friends and family) earned higher grades than those who wrote about neutral subjects (like their daily routine). Students who completed values affirmations were still outperforming students in the control group two years later. Eberhardt believes that this worked for three reasons. First, it reminded students that they have an identity outside of how people at school might see them. Second, it reframed school as a place where students’ feelings matter, creating a sense of psychological safety. And third, reading the journal entries helped teachers to see their students as individuals, not stereotypes. (Shortform note: Values affirmations have a strong, lasting effect on African American and Latino students, but they don’t make much difference for white students. This might be because most white students automatically feel safe and respected at school, so they don’t need as many reminders of their intrinsic worth as students of color do.)

**4) Use “wise feedback” to give criticism.** According to Eberhardt, black students are so accustomed to racial bias in the classroom that they often mistake criticism of their academic work for a personal attack. Before they can accept academic feedback, they need to feel psychologically safe, which involves trusting that their teachers aren’t using academic criticism as a weapon to express racial bias. “Wise feedback” is a tool designed to build that trust by framing criticism as a teacher’s way of saying, “I know how talented you are, so I know that you can do better than this” rather than, “You’re not good enough.” Studies show that wise feedback puts black students at ease and motivates them to try to improve.

(Shortform note: Wise feedback has three essential components. First, teachers need to convey that they’re critiquing a student’s work because they have high expectations for their students. Second, teachers need to reassure students that they know they can meet those high standards. Third, teachers need to provide students with the resources to improve their work, like constructive feedback or additional help.)

> **More Resources to Reduce Bias in Schools**
> 
> A 2020 study found two additional tools for reducing the impact of racial bias in schools. The first is a change in school policy that creates opportunities for teachers to hear students’ perspectives. Schools can do this by implementing restorative practices like community circles that give each student a chance to feel fully heard.
> 
> The second way to mitigate bias in schools is to emphasize a “growth mindset,” a term created by psychologist Carol S. Dweck, author of _Mindset,_ to describe the belief that people can improve their abilities through hard work and perseverance. Dweck contrasts this with a “fixed mindset,” or the belief that abilities like intelligence are unchangeable—you’re either born with them, or you’re not. This study found that when teachers were reminded that students can improve their bad behavior (and that the teacher-student relationship can improve), they were less likely to label black students as “troublemakers.” When these tools were combined in the same school, racial disparities in student discipline dropped dramatically.

### How _Not_ to Reduce Bias in Schools

Instead of the successful interventions above, many educators claim they “don’t see color” as a way to avoid acknowledging race at all in the classroom. But colorblindness isn’t a viable strategy—as humans, our brains naturally rely on color to help us distinguish items in our environment, so it isn’t really possible to “not see” it. Beyond that, Eberhardt argues that **colorblindness can actually _increase_ racial disparities, **because ignoring skin color naturally means ignoring the racial discrimination people face because of it. To reduce bias, educators need to acknowledge the specific struggles that their black students face due to racial bias.

According to Eberhardt, the idea that noticing or mentioning skin color is impolite stems from our cultural discomfort with talking about race. **In our desperation to avoid those difficult conversations, we end up completely erasing a very important part of a person’s identity.** This is especially dangerous in schools because children pick up on that discomfort easily—by age 10, most kids hesitate to talk about race or to mention someone’s skin color. In fact, one study found that kids who are exposed to messages that downplay the importance of race (like “we’re all the same”) were significantly less likely to notice blatant racial discrimination than kids who heard messages celebrating diversity (like “we need to recognize how we’re different and appreciate those differences”).

> **The Many Dangers of Racial Colorblindness**
> 
> Eberhardt examines the “colorblind” approach to racial bias in the context of education, but colorblindness is a common problem in all types of conversations about race. For example, in _How to Be an Antiracist_ , Ibram X. Kendi argues that ignoring race won’t eradicate racism because racist ideas stem from racist policies, not the other way around. Therefore, to fight racism, we have to start by attacking racist policies—and it’s impossible to identify racist policies if we can’t see race.
> 
> Similarly, in _The New Jim Crow_ , Michelle Alexander argues that colorblindness is dangerous because it keeps us from seeing just how deeply entrenched racism is in public institutions like the criminal justice system. As a result, it’s easy to make the mistake of over-emphasizing personal responsibility and ultimately blame individuals for what is really a systemic problem.
> 
> The refusal to acknowledge systemic racism is also part of what causes colorblindness rhetoric in the first place, as Robin DiAngelo argues in _White Fragility_. For many white people, the word “racism” calls up mental images of police dogs and firehoses being turned on black protestors during the 1950s and ‘60s. As a result, white people claim they don’t notice race in an effort to distance themselves from those violent examples.
> 
> It’s clear that colorblindness isn’t the answer, but talking plainly about race is easier said than done. In _So You Want to Talk About Race_ , Ijeoma Oluo lays out a formula for having those hard conversations. Start off on the right foot by doing your homework and reading up on other people’s perspectives. During the conversation, listen more than you speak. If you notice yourself getting defensive, take a step back to examine the feeling. The more you’re willing to sit with those uncomfortable feelings, the more productive the conversation will be.
