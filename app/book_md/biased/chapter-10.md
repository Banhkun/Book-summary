## Chapter 10: Bias in the Workforce

As we’ve seen, racial bias affects people at home and in school. **That same bias shapes the world of work in nearly every way, from crafting a resume to getting an interview to navigating a diverse workplace.**

In this chapter, we’ll discuss the hurdles people of color face in applying to jobs and the strategies they use to overcome them. Then, we’ll examine how companies like Starbucks respond to instances of blatant racial bias in their businesses. Finally, we’ll explore the innovative ways businesses are attempting to sidestep that bias, like implementing company-wide bias training sessions.

### Bias in the Job Application Process

Racial bias in the workforce is a massive, widespread problem. In fact, **the unemployment rate for young black people is twice as high as it is for young white people.** That’s partly because of the housing discrimination we discussed in Chapter 7, meaning black teens and young adults are more likely to live in low-income neighborhoods with fewer job options. (Shortform note: Eberhardt doesn’t mention it, but the racially biased criminal justice system is also a major driver of black unemployment. In _The New Jim Crow_ , Michelle Alexander describes how people with criminal records have a harder time getting hired. In Chapters 4-5 of this guide, we’ll see how black Americans are more likely to be arrested and face harsher sentences than white Americans, which means black jobseekers are more likely to have a criminal record.)

However, Eberhardt argues that the main driver of this disparity is racial bias in the hiring process—an alarmingly common phenomenon that is well-documented in scientific research. For example, in one study, researchers created a set of resumes for fictional applicants that would be perfect candidates for actual job listings. The fictional applicants behind these resumes were equally well-qualified for each job, with just one difference: Some had stereotypically black names (like Jamal and Tamika) while others had stereotypically white names (like Geoffrey and Emily). **Applicants with black-sounding names were half as likely to be contacted about the job than applicants with white-sounding names.**

> **Big-Name Companies Are Guilty of Hiring Discrimination**
> 
> Many of the world’s most prominent companies have been accused of hiring discrimination. In 2021, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) launched a systemic inquiry into Facebook’s hiring practices based on several complaints of racial discrimination (the company reports that just 3.9% of its U.S. employees are black). That same month, Starbucks agreed to revamp its store-level promotion policies after the EEOC found evidence of racial discrimination. The banking industry faces a similar problem—A 2021 study found evidence of racial disparities in promotions in 13 of the largest banks in North America.

#### Whitening the Resume

**In many ways, these studies confirm what people of color already know about bias in the workforce.** For example, when researchers interviewed black and Asian college students about their job search process, many of them were painfully aware of racial bias and actively tried to avoid it by “whitening” their resumes: using white-sounding nicknames or initials instead of their given names, removing references to cultural or ethnic groups (like Black Student Associations), and adding references to stereotypically white interests like hiking. (Shortform note: This study was originally published in 2016, but the pattern still persists today. In 2021, a black human resources professional went viral on Twitter for advising black jobseekers not to use “hood names'' on their resumes and to go by their initials or middle names instead.)

To make matters worse, research shows that “whitening” actually works: The more changes an applicant makes to whiten their resume, the higher their chances of getting a callback. Worst of all, employers who included formal diversity commitments in their job descriptions were no less likely to discriminate against unwhitened resumes than other employers.

(Shortform note: What’s a person of color to do if they don’t want to “whiten'' their resume? A resource guide for black students at the University of California Davis advises these students to embrace their names and experience. The guide cites the example of Barack Obama, who went by “Barry” until college, when he embraced his full first name.)

#### Stereotypes Make It Harder to Recognize Success

Despite all this research showing that white people are significantly more likely to be considered for a job simply because of their skin color,**many white Americans actually believe the _opposite_ is true.** In 2017, a Harvard study found that 55% of white Americans think there is racial discrimination against white people in the United States. Many of these people cite affirmative action policies as proof that racial minorities have an unfair advantage. If they’re competing for a job and lose out to a black person, they immediately blame affirmative action rather than consider the possibility that a black person could be genuinely more qualified for the job.

> **Does “Reverse Racism” Exist? It Depends Who You Ask**
> 
> The idea that white people face discrimination for being white is also called “reverse racism” or “anti-white racism.” In _So You Want to Talk About Race, _Ijeoma Oluo argues that claims of “reverse racism” stem from the fact that there are two separate definitions of “racism” in popular use. The first definition is purely interpersonal: “Racism is bias against a person based on their race.” The second is societal: “Racism is bias against a person based on their race, **in the context of power structures that support that bias.** ”
> 
> If you’re using the first definition, the idea of “reverse racism” makes sense, because racism is purely about individual biases. However, under the second definition, “reverse racism” is a contradiction in terms because the major power structures in the United States fundamentally privilege white people. Many race scholars use the second definition. For example, in _White Fragility_ , Robin DiAngelo explains it this way: While people of color can be _prejudiced_ against white people and can _discriminate_ against individual white people, they don’t have the social power to be truly racist.
> 
> However, not everyone agrees with this view—in fact, author Ibram X. Kendi argues in _How to Be an Antiracist _that black people can be racist, and that claiming otherwise is actually a form of racism in itself because it assumes that black people have no power. Kendi uses _both_ of Oluo’s definitions to support his argument by dividing the concept of “racism” into racist ideas and racist policies. Therefore, people of color can be racists because they can hold racist _ideas_ about white inferiority, even though they lack the power to enact racist _policies_ that target white people.

### Bias Training

Bias in the workplace can be a difficult topic for employers to grapple with—and as a result, many companies are now holding formal bias training for their employees. **However, professional bias training isn’t a foolproof solution (and can be expensive), so companies need to consider their options carefully.** Many are following the example Starbucks set in 2018 that revolutionized the corporate approach to engaging with bias.

#### The Starbucks Incident

In May of 2018, police arrested two black men in a Philadelphia Starbucks for the simple crime of asking to use the restroom before purchasing anything. The men planned to meet their business partner there and were waiting to order until he arrived; the barista interpreted this as trespassing and called the police. Within ten minutes of that phone call, police had arrested the two men and physically removed them from the store. A white woman filmed the incident on her phone and posted it online, where it quickly went viral. In the video, the two black men are quiet and polite throughout the entire ordeal while other customers—including their white business partner, who arrived in the middle of the chaos—demand an explanation for the arrest.

Starbucks’s corporate response to this incident is a model for addressing racial bias in the workplace on a large scale. First, they addressed the incident itself by changing company policy to allow anyone to use the restroom—regardless of whether they’ve purchased something—and the Starbucks CEO traveled to Philadelphia to apologize to the two men in person. Then, Starbucks took their response a step further: **Instead of just addressing the incident itself, they committed to confronting racial bias head-on by holding a four-hour implicit bias training for all 175,000 Starbucks employees.** This training required closing down 8,000 Starbucks locations for the day, costing the company roughly $12 million.

> **“From Privilege to Progress”**
> 
> The Starbucks incident also sparked change in another way. Melissa DePino (the white woman who filmed and tweeted the whole encounter) and Michelle Saahene (a Black woman who was the first to speak up during the incident) connected over their shared horror and frustration at the injustice they witnessed that day in Starbucks. Together, they launched "From Privilege to Progress," an organization devoted to bringing white and Black people together to fight systemic and interpersonal racism. Through speaking engagements and online activism, they empower people to push past awkwardness and have hard, necessary conversations about racism.

#### Bias Training Is an Imperfect Solution

Bias training like the program Starbucks utilized is becoming increasingly popular in government, nonprofit, and for-profit organizations. The demand for this training has led to the sudden rise of private companies focused on creating bias training programs to pitch to other businesses. In many cases, these training sessions lead employees to profound personal realizations about the ways implicit bias impacts their own behavior; however, on a larger scale, we don’t yet know whether bias training actually reduces implicit bias.

According to Eberhardt, part of the problem is that **social scientists are reluctant to tackle the issue** in the real world. They feel that scientists should focus on building and testing the perfect bias training program in the lab before exposing others to it. Eberhardt disagrees—she argues that waiting to act until we can test every step of a process with pure science often results in never acting at all. Instead, she argues that social scientists should embrace the uncertainty and develop theories based on their practical experience, rather than the other way around.

> **Social Scientists: Don’t Be Afraid to Get Involved**
> 
> Eberhardt’s ideas on social scientists’ responsibility to get involved in practical applications of their research are backed up by Gordon Allport, the scientist who pioneered contact theory. In a 1941 article calling for psychologists to use their expertise to boost “civilian morale,” Allport wrote, “If the psychologist is tempted to say that he knows too little about the subject he may gain confidence by watching the inept way in which politicians, journalists, and men in public life fence with the problems of propaganda, public opinion, and morale.”

##### Bias Training Prompts Moral Credentialing

Without empirical studies on the results of different training styles, it’s hard for bias educators to know the best ways to talk about bias. According to Eberhardt, this is especially complicated because **people tend to rely on moral credentialing** : the idea that if they’ve established a past reputation as an unbiased person when it comes to race, they’re entitled to express racial prejudice in the present without consequences. This is the proverbial “but I have black friends” defense, where people act as though befriending a black person means nothing they say from then on could possibly be racist. Moral credentialing doesn’t just affect individuals—companies are equally guilty of using their reputations as socially conscious organizations as an excuse for discrimination. The challenge for bias educators, then, is to deliver useful training while ensuring that training doesn’t become a “get out of racism free” card.

> **To Resist Moral Credentialing, Slow Down and Refocus**
> 
> Moral credentialing doesn’t just apply to people who have undergone formal bias training. For example, people who read _Biased_ might rely on moral credentialing, too, by using their newfound knowledge of racial bias as an excuse not to question their own biases. To overcome that temptation, try these three strategies:
> 
>   * Practice mindfulness. To prevent yourself from engaging in moral credentialing, you first need to notice when you’re in a situation that might trigger that response. Practicing mindfulness will help you focus on the present moment, so you’ll have a better chance of catching yourself before slipping into moral credentialing.
> 
>   * Use the “two second rule.” In other words, before you let yourself off the antiracist hook, take two seconds to pause and think through your response. By slowing your thought process down, you switch from System 1 to System 2 thinking, as we learned in Chapters 1-2.
> 
>   * Focus on your goals and values, not on being a “good person.” If your goal is to practice antiracism, you’ll remember that you need to consistently resist racist ideas and policies. Similarly, if justice is an important value for you, you’ll be more motivated to question your biases to make sure you’re contributing to a just world.

#### Other Ways to Combat Bias at Work

Beyond structured training, there are several ways for individuals and organizations to combat racial bias in the workplace:

##### 1) Understanding the Conditions That Trigger Bias

Bias is difficult to control partly because it’s a conditional state. Most people don’t act in biased ways all the time or in all situations, but the right combination of factors can activate dormant biases in even the most open-minded person.

According to Eberhardt, **the two biggest factors that trigger bias are speed and ambiguity.** In this case, “speed” refers to how quickly we make decisions in a certain situation—for example, when hiring managers review resumes, the sheer volume of applications often forces them to decide a candidate’s fate after looking at their resume for just six seconds. “Ambiguity” comes into play when those decisions are based on subjective impressions rather than concrete criteria. In the resume review example, deciding which candidates to interview based on the hiring manager’s gut feeling invites ambiguity; to avoid bias, she should instead commit to interview everyone who meets a predetermined set of criteria (such as having a degree in a relevant field and having three years of experience).

As we saw in the case of Nextdoor’s anti-bias checklist in Chapter 7, **slowing down the decision process can significantly reduce instances of bias.** When police officers interact with citizens, slowing things down has a powerful and potentially life-saving effect. For example, the Oakland Police Department has a foot pursuit policy that prohibits officers from following suspects into backyards or blind alleys during foot chases—instead, they should stop and call for backup.

That small pause deescalates the situation and prevents officers from having to make life-or-death decisions in the heat of the moment. This policy change keeps officers _and_ citizens safer: In Oakland, officer injuries fell by 70%, and police shootings dropped from about eight per year to one or two per year.

(Shortform note: The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department enacted a similar rule in 2011, with a small difference: Officers are allowed to chase suspects on foot, but the pursuing officer should not be the first person to put their hands on the suspect. This allows officers to keep the suspect in sight but reduces the risk of making adrenaline-fueled, racially-biased decisions with disastrous consequences. The change helped: The department saw a 23% decrease in total use of force.)

##### 2) Using Monitoring Technology

When structural conditions contribute to bias, changing those structures can eliminate bias. An example of such a change is implementing monitoring technology like police body cameras. Studies show that wearing body cameras has a powerful effect on police officer behavior: **When officers know they’re being recorded, they’re more motivated to consciously control their racial biases and treat people fairly.** For instance, after the Oakland Police Department implemented body cameras, instances of officers using force dropped sharply as the cameras held officers accountable. Citizen complaints declined, too, both as a result of the decreased use of force and because Oakland residents know they now have objective records of their encounters with police officers.

> **Body Cameras Aren’t a Magic Cure**
> 
> In the wake of high-profile instances of police brutality, activists called for more police departments to adopt body cameras as a way to prevent officers from breaking the rules. Like in Oakland, many departments saw some initial positive effect of the cameras—however, more and more evidence shows that body cameras alone have very little effect on police use of force.
> 
> However, that doesn’t mean body cameras aren’t important. According to two criminal justice scholars writing for the National Police Foundation, body cameras _do_ work—not as a “disinfectant” that prevents use of force in the first place, but as a “flashlight” that illuminates the situation after the fact. These writers argue that body cameras can’t actually prevent police brutality in the long term because officers respond to charged situations with instinct, not conscious thought, so they don’t have time to think about how they’re being recorded and change their behavior in response. However, body cameras are still an important piece of the police reform puzzle because they provide an objective witness to incidents of police brutality, which can bolster the victim’s account of what happened.

##### 3) Building Personal Relationships That Override Biases

As we saw in Chapter 8, **strong interracial relationships that develop under the right conditions can be powerful bias-busters.** Therefore, employers should provide opportunities for their employees to develop genuine, mutually-respectful relationships with coworkers of other races. (Shortform note: One study found that having a black coworker significantly reduced racial bias for white employees. Importantly, the researchers in this study bypassed the causation question of earlier studies on contact theory by assigning a “propensity score” to each white worker in a large national sample. Workers with high propensity scores are more likely to want to work with people of color, regardless of whether they already do. Then, the researchers matched each white person in the sample who had black colleagues to a white person with the same propensity score who did _not_ have black colleagues and compared their levels of racial bias.)

##### 4) Creating a New Normal (Despite the Growing Pains)

Businesses today are working hard to catch up to new, more inclusive social norms; **however,** **bias is a complicated topic, and there is a steep learning curve for companies hoping to address it.** For example, three years before the bogus arrests in Philadelphia, Starbucks attempted to spark a national conversation about race by having baristas write “Race Together” on customers’ drink cups. The “Race Together” campaign lasted barely a week before the company called it due to backlash from customers who felt it was a superficial gesture. (Shortform note: Criticism of the campaign was so widespread that it inspired a Saturday Night Live parody.)

While the campaign was short-lived, the lessons of that early failure informed the company’s bold response to “the Starbucks incident” years later. In other words, **Starbucks’s willingness to engage with a difficult topic—even clumsily—played a huge role in creating a new norm for addressing racial bias in business.**

> **Is CEO Activism Part of the “New Normal”?**
> 
> Beyond bias training and firing employees who make racist comments, how can employers commit to antiracism? “CEO activism” is one method, in which prominent CEOs publicly take a stand on social and environmental issues like racism, gender equality, or climate change. Starbucks’s “Race Together” was an example of CEO activism—the initiative was the brainchild of CEO Howard Schultz, who rolled out the campaign against the warnings of his executive team and without doing any market research. The “Race Together” pushback illustrates why many people feel that corporate executives should keep their personal beliefs out of business, especially since taking a stand on controversial topics risks alienating customers or employees and ultimately losing money.
> 
> Regardless of the risks, CEO activism is a growing trend that’s unlikely to fade, especially as the socially-conscious Millennial generation takes over. And CEOs are even more powerful when they band together, which is why PwC Chairman Tim Ryan founded “CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion,” an antiracist business commitment with nearly 2,000 signatories, all of whom are presidents or CEOs.
