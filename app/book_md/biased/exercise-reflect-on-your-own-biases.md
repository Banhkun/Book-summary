## Exercise: Reflect on Your Own Biases

Implicit racial bias can creep into your thoughts or actions even when you’re actively trying to avoid it. Take a moment to explore your own relationship to racial bias.

* * *

As you read this guide, which examples of racial bias did you recognize from your own past thoughts or behaviors? For example, maybe you’ve noticed yourself locking your car door without thinking when a black person walks by. (Remember, biases are the automatic result of living in a culture that values one group over another. Everyone holds some form of racial bias.)

When you think about your own biases, what emotions come up for you? Why?

After reading this guide, what can you do to actively combat the effects of bias in your own life? For example, if you’re an educator, maybe you plan to implement the “values journal” idea from Chapter 8 to help black students feel safer to learn.
