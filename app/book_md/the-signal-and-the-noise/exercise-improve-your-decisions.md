## Exercise: Improve Your Decisions

According to Silver, we can improve our predictions by analyzing why they go wrong and adopting better forecasting techniques. In this exercise, consider how you could use Silver’s ideas to improve your own prediction skills.

* * *

Describe a time when you got an important prediction wrong. (Remember that according to Silver, many of our major life decisions—such as the ones we make around our careers, relationships, and finances—are predictions even if that’s not how we think of them. For example, maybe you chose to move to a new location that you predicted you’d like but ended up hating.)

Which of the thinking errors Silver discusses may have led your decision astray? (Those thinking errors include faulty assumptions, overconfidence, excessive trust in computers and data, biased perspective, and poor incentives. For example, maybe you moved from the city to the country on the assumption that you’d spend lots of time outdoors only to discover that you don’t like doing so.)

Why and to what extent was the situation you were trying to predict simply unpredictable? (Recall that Silver says predictions are especially hard when there’s not enough information, when systems are too complex to understand, and when our calculation errors compound over time. For example, maybe shortly after you moved, the economy dipped and a lot of the small businesses that attracted you to the area closed.)

How might Bayesian principles have improved your prediction? How would you implement these principles the next time you’re in a similar situation? For example, perhaps you could have tested your assumption that you’d spend a lot of time outdoors by considering the prior probability of doing so, only to realize that you’ve _never_ really spent time outdoors.
