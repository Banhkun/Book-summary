## Exercise: Distinguish Between Your Significant and Insignificant Tasks

Productivity isn't about doing a lot, but about doing what matters, so being able to distinguish between your significant and insignificant tasks is a key part of becoming more productive.

* * *

First, identify your significant tasks. Write down three things you do that have the biggest impact on your work or personal life.

Next, identify your insignificant tasks. Write down three tasks (or types of tasks) that take time but have little or no impact on your work or personal life.

What is one strategy you can use to increase the amount of time, energy, and focus you spend on your significant tasks and decrease the amount of time, energy and focus you spend on your insignificant tasks (for example, say no to insignificant tasks, schedule significant tasks, limit how often you check your email, etc.)?
