## Exercise: Confront Your Assumptions and Judgments

Reynolds says that the reflective inquiry process can be uncomfortable because it requires clients and coaches to challenge deep-seated assumptions and emotions. As a result, coaches should create nonjudgmental spaces to encourage clients to open up to themâ€”which begins with acknowledging your own assumptions and judgments.

* * *

Think of a time when you made an assumption about, or judged, someone else. What assumption did you have or what judgment did you make?

How do you think your assumption or judgment influenced your relationship with this person?

How would you handle or avoid this kind of judgment in a future situation?
