## Exercise: Identify Your Self-Sabotaging Behaviors

Wiest says that the first step to becoming your ideal self and achieving your life purpose is to overcome your self-sabotage. Before you can do this, though, you first need to identify how you’re self-sabotaging and why.

* * *

List some things in your life that you’re unhappy about or want to change. (For example, you might be unhappy at your job because you don’t like your coworkers, or you might want your relationship with your partner to be less hostile.)

Next, consider what you might be doing to prevent yourself from making the changes you recorded in the previous step. (For example, do you not like your coworkers because you’ve never tried talking to them? Is your relationship not improving because you’ve never brought the issue up with your partner?) Record your answers below—this list comprises your self-sabotaging behaviors.

Now, list the fears and mental or emotional (ME) deficiencies that underlie the self-sabotaging behaviors you previously identified. (For example, maybe you’ve never tried talking to your coworkers because you’re afraid they won’t like you—a fear that likely stems from a lack of self-confidence or self-love. Maybe you have trouble discussing conflicts in your relationship because you’re afraid your partner will leave you—this fear likely stems from a lack of independence and an inability to manage your emotions on your own.)

Based on the emotional deficiencies you identified in the previous questions, which of Wiest’s recommendations (learning to follow your intuition, learning to understand and respond effectively to your emotions, or identifying your life purpose and ideal self) do you think will be the _most_ helpful to overcoming them? Why?
