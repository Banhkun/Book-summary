## Exercise: Hit Refresh on Your Corporate Culture

With Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft’s culture changed from one of in-fighting and bureaucracy to one of collaboration and innovation.

* * *

Consider the current culture at your company (or within your team). List two to three areas that need improvement—for example, there might be a lack of alignment between departments.

Which of Nadella’s leadership principles (having empathy, putting your team first, having conviction, thinking long-term and short-term, and not being complacent) can you use to address each area for improvement?

Describe a specific, immediate action you can take that can help you hit refresh on each area for improvement. For example, to create alignment between departments, you can implement weekly check-in meetings with department heads.
