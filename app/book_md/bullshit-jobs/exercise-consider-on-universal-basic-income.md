## Exercise: Consider Universal Basic Income

This exercise will give you a chance to explore Graeber's proposed solution to pointless jobs: universal basic income. This policy would pay every citizen in the country a flat wage funded through taxation.

* * *

Graeber argues that universal basic income might provide a solution to the problem of pointless jobs. Do you agree with him? Why or why not?

What would you do differently if you received a universal basic income? Would you keep working your current job or pursue something else? Why or not?
