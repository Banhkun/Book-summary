## Exercise: Strategize for Your Next Sale

Now that you’ve learned Jones’s persuasive key phrases, think about how you can use them in your next sales pitch.

* * *

Based on your past experience, what challenges do you anticipate for your next sale? Are there common objections that customers generally raise, such as the price of your product? Are your customers busy people with limited time and lots of important decisions to make in their daily work?

Considering your anticipated challenges, which part of your sales pitch do you need to prioritize improving right now? Is it your opening statements, overcoming customers’ indecision, responding to objections, or capitalizing on the customer’s final response?

For the part of the sales pitch you identified above, write down a statement or question with one of Jones’s key phrases that could help you achieve a favorable outcome.
