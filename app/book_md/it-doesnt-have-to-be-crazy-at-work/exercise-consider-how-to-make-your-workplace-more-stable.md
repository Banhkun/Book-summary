## Exercise: Consider How to Make Your Workplace More Stable

After reading Fried and Hansson’s advice, consider how you can make the workplace you’re managing more relaxed and productive.

* * *

What growth targets, if any, is your organization currently aiming for? (For example, perhaps you work at a design firm that’s trying to increase its client base by 15% every quarter.)

What stable goal (or goals) could you set instead to consistently achieve without significantly expanding? Briefly explain how adopting these stable goals might improve your organizational culture. (For example, your design firm might decide to pursue the new goal of “Earn enough revenue to keep the company profitable.” This could help your employees feel proud of the successful service they’re providing rather than feeling anxious about doing better.)

Approximately how much time do employees at your organization have every day to work alone without interruptions or distractions? Brainstorm a couple of changes you could make to increase your team’s private work time. (For example, if you realize that 80% of your employees’ days are filled with various meetings, you could replace a daily brainstorming meeting with individual work time.)

What benefits does your company currently offer to its employees? How might you adjust these benefits to better support your employees’ work-life balance? (For example, if your company offers employees access to a late-night dining hall, it could instead support employees’ time away from work by offering these meals to go.)
