## 1-Page Summary

In today’s “hustle culture,” we imagine the most successful worker as someone who lives at the office, works nights and weekends, and attacks their job with a frantic intensity. In their attempts to embody this ideal, employees, managers, and entrepreneurs end up ruining their lives, trying to get ahead in their careers by sacrificing the time and energy they should be spending on their lives outside of work.

Authors Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson argue that this mindset is not only a recipe for an unsatisfying life, but it’s also _ineffective_. Most people spending their entire lives in a frenzy at work aren’t getting more work done—they’re burning themselves out with inefficient business practices.

In _It Doesn’t Have to Be Crazy at Work_ , Fried and Hansson contend that companies should establish more reasonable, sustainable goals and business practices that put employees first. In doing so, **companies can make their employees’ work lives relaxing and satisfying—while still consistently making money for the business.**

According to Fried and Hansson, they know this is possible because they’ve done it themselves. The authors are co-owners of 37signals, the company that created Basecamp—a software tool teams can use at work to organize and complete various projects. They’ve been managing the company together since 2003 and have been publishing books since 2004, sharing management advice they’ve learned through trial and error over the years. Fried and Hansson’s best-selling book is 2010’s _Rework_ , in which they challenge aspects of conventional business wisdom and explore the ways that the internet has revolutionized business practices.

We’ll begin this guide by examining Fried and Hansson’s big-picture business philosophy: Companies should pursue employee-friendly, stable success rather than nonstop growth. Then, we’ll discuss their number one productivity tip—giving your employees the private time they need to get substantial work done. Finally, we’ll detail the authors’ advice on improving your workplace by investing in an effective team.

In our commentary, we’ll provide counterpoints from books on management such as _No Rules Rules_ and _The Cold Start Problem_. Additionally, we’ll supplement Fried and Hansson’s productivity-related advice with ideas from books on personal productivity like _Deep Work _and _Indistractable_.

### Pursue Stable Success, Not Growth

Fried and Hansson contend that many organizations perpetuate the unhealthy ideals of “hustle culture” through specific management strategies: Namely, they set aggressive quarterly growth targets to push their employees to do their best work. However, **such uncompromising, growth-oriented goals needlessly create an unhealthy work environment that degrades employees’ quality of life.**

To explain why, we’ll outline some of the downsides of aggressive organizational growth. Then, we’ll cover some of the benefits of the alternative strategy: aiming for stable, consistent success.

#### The Downsides of Incessant Growth

##### Downside #1: Growth Targets Are Demoralizing

First, Fried and Hansson say that **growth targets demoralize employees by constantly moving the goalposts of what constitutes well-done work.** As soon as the company achieves one arbitrary goal, it starts working toward the next one. This means that no matter how hard they work, employees can never feel relaxed or satisfied because there are always new targets requiring them to do better.

(Shortform note: Arguably, the problem with constantly rising goals for your employees isn’t unreachable expectations, but the threat of punishment from upper management if those expectations aren’t met—for instance, demotion or termination. In a TED talk, Simon Sinek states that the trust and cooperation team members need to be productive disappears when employees fear their leaders. Through this lens, a system of constantly rising growth targets could be motivating as long as employees believe that their leaders will support them if they fail to reach those targets.)

##### Downside #2: Growth Targets Create Financial Stress

Second, Fried and Hansson assert that aggressive growth targets put the whole company under financial stress, which puts every employee under emotional stress. Many startups spend far more money than they earn on expanding business as quickly as possible—intending to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term revenue growth. **However, this strategy pressures the team to execute perfect work** ; if the company doesn’t hit its growth targets, it goes bankrupt. This pressure will cause your employees to quickly burn out.

> **Network-Based Products Profit From Aggressive Growth**
> 
> Although Fried and Hansson argue that pursuing hyperaggressive growth creates unnecessary stress, you may want to consider temporarily using this strategy if your product or service gets its value from the _network effect_. This is when products or services require a certain number of users to function properly and become more valuable as more users join, like a social media platform or online marketplace. If you create a network-based product or service, every dollar you spend on growth also makes your product or service more valuable, arguably making hyperaggressive growth strategies worthwhile.
> 
> Andrew Chen asserts in _The Cold Start Problem_ that once you attain a certain number of users, a network-based product or service will hit a tipping point. This is when your product or service has become valuable enough that it can attract users and grow into a market leader on its own, allowing you to scale back your spending on growth. After you hit this point, the outsized profits you’ll earn will hopefully ease the pressure on your team, preventing stress and burnout.

##### Downside #3: Growth Targets Encourage Unethical Behavior

Finally, when companies make it their primary goal to hit growth targets, everyone on the team is more likely to break their promises to the customer and compromise their moral integrity to succeed. For example, in 2016, employees of the bank Wells Fargo who were under pressure to hit certain sales goals opened millions of fraudulent accounts under their customers’ names.

(Shortform note: Large organizations may be particularly susceptible to moral failings because layers of bureaucracy often separate decision-makers from the consequences of their decisions. As Nassim Nicholas Taleb contends in _Skin in the Game_ , the more a decision-maker is distanced from the consequences of their actions (in both time and space), the less likely it is that their unethical actions will be noticed or punished—and the more they’ll be tempted to act unethically.)

#### The Alternative: Stable Success

Instead of constantly setting bigger and more ambitious goals for your company, Fried and Hansson recommend **defining success for your organization as the ongoing completion of the same stable goals.** For instance, you may aim to deliver a product you’re proud of and provide great customer service. Settle into a work routine that makes your team happy and be satisfied with that—as long as the business is profitable, there’s no need to expand it to a scale that’s more stressful to manage. For example, if you run a landscaping business, make it your goal to serve a single city well season after season instead of expanding to manage teams across the country.

This doesn’t mean your organization can’t grow and progress—**Fried and Hansson advocate refining and improving your workplace over time.** Constantly stay on the lookout for ways to better accomplish your stable goals, as well as ways to make life for you and your employees as enjoyable as possible.

> **A Middle Ground: Profit First**
> 
> If you’d like to strike a middle ground between traditional growth-centered business strategy and Fried and Hansson’s radical perspective of sticking to the same stable goals, consider using the “Profit First” method, as described by Mike Michalowicz in _Profit First_. Determine what percentage of revenue you want to save as profit _before_ deciding how much revenue you want to reinvest in growth. Then, allow your company to grow as fast as it can without reinvesting more than you’ve allocated.
> 
> This strategy allows you to tackle ambitious goals while maintaining a cushion of profit to support the company and avoid painful cutbacks if business slows down. The more revenue you earn, the faster your company will grow—but the profits you set aside ensure you’re not spending more than you can afford.
> 
> You can also use these savings to support your company’s comfortable work routine, even as you grow—as Fried and Hansson would recommend. For example, if you want to offer your employees a four-day workweek, you can factor this into your expenses and only expand as you earn more than enough to support this perk.
> 
> Once you’ve set this system up, Michalowicz also recommends refining your workplace procedures over time. He expands on Fried and Hansson’s advice, suggesting that managers focus particularly on major sweeping changes rather than marginal refinements. For example, consider Netflix in 2007: Instead of looking for ways to make their DVD-by-mail service slightly more cost-effective (like developing more lightweight packaging), they developed an on-demand streaming platform that would make their company more valuable to consumers for years to come.

### Give Your Employees Private Time

We’ve discussed Fried and Hansson’s belief that companies can create relaxed, healthy work environments by aiming for stable success rather than unlimited growth. However, this doesn’t mean compromising on the quality of their work. A more relaxed workplace can actually be _more_ productive than a frenzied one, as long as you **give employees private time to work without being distracted.**

The more time someone has to work on a single task without being interrupted, the more they can get done within that time. Even a single brief interruption can fragment someone’s attention and drastically reduce their productivity. For this reason, Fried and Hansson structure their organization to give their employees as much uninterrupted private work time as possible.

(Shortform note: In _Deep Work_ , Cal Newport agrees that people are most productive during uninterrupted private time—what he calls “deep work.” Even if you don’t have an organization to manage, awareness of the value of deep work can help you maximize your productivity. To carve out deep work time, Newport recommends adopting one of four work schedules: a _secluded schedule_ in which you go “off the grid” to spend all your time in deep work, a _periodic schedule_ in which regularly you set aside days or weeks to focus on deep work, a _daily schedule_ in which you reserve a few hours every day for deep work, or an _ad hoc schedule_ in which you use any free time that appears in your schedule for deep work.)

To build an organization in which employees have enough private time to get things done, Fried and Hansson offer three tips.

#### Tip #1: Maintain a Distraction-Free Workspace

Although employees need time by themselves without any distractions to get work done, Fried and Hansson explain that most modern offices give them the opposite: open floor plans in which people take phone calls or make loud conversation where everyone can hear them. Consequently, many employees feel pressured to work during evenings at home, or to come into the office hours early just to have time to get tasks done without distractions. They end up working far more than 40 hours a week and still get less done than they should.

To remedy this, **Fried and Hansson recommend running your office like a library** —everyone in the public space must be quiet and avoid distracting others. People already know how to behave at the library, so this kind of cultural shift is relatively easy to implement.

> **Balancing Distraction-Free Time With Collaboration**
> 
> Although open floor plans are full of distractions, some research backs up the idea that they help foster creativity and collaboration. As Annie Murphy Paul explains in _The Extended Mind_ , the farther away two people work from one another, the less frequently they’ll communicate with one another about their work—a statistical relationship known as the “Allen curve.” In turn, frequent interaction between co-workers leads to more insights and innovative breakthroughs—especially if they have different fields of expertise, yielding unique interdisciplinary insights. Open floor plans in which workers spend all their time right next to each other should (in theory) yield more of these insights.
> 
> Furthermore, running your office like a quiet library (as Fried and Hansson suggest) might not be enough to reduce all distractions. Paul argues that a worker _seeing people move around them is enough to distract them from their work_ , even if no one is talking aloud or trying to get their attention.
> 
> To ensure that your employees can be productive at work without feeling pressured to put in extra hours, Paul recommends an office plan that gives workers the privacy they need to be productive while fostering collaboration. Give each employee a private workspace, but build the office in such a way that people naturally interact while they’re not working. For instance, have workers enter the building through communal spaces and eat together in shared cafeterias. This can naturally trigger conversations that result in valuable collaboration.

#### Tip #2: Let Workers Keep Their Schedules Private

Fried and Hansson**** also suggest **protecting your team members’ time by allowing them to keep their schedules private.** When a worker’s day-to-day schedule is publicly available, it encourages coworkers to claim that person’s time. For instance, if Miranda sees that Amir’s schedule is empty for the next two hours, she might pop into his office to quickly get his opinion on her ideas for improving the company’s training program. This interruption wrecks Amir’s productivity for the whole afternoon, and Miranda’s training program is only slightly improved by his input.

(Shortform note: By contrast, some experts prefer to post their schedule where everyone at work can see it, noting that it helps them keep themselves accountable and productive. You’re more likely to plan out responsible ways to use your time if you know that peers will be able to judge your schedule. You may be able to benefit from a public schedule as long as you plan blocks of time to work in private and make it clear to your coworkers that you don’t want to be interrupted during this time.)

Instead of leaving your employees vulnerable to interruptions whenever they have free time, **Fried and Hansson recommend instructing your most knowledgeable employees to host university-style “office hours”** : They should schedule a regular time in which coworkers can consult them and save the rest of their time at work solely for themselves. If a coworker needs an expert’s input, they have to wait for their office hours to roll around.

(Shortform note: Setting office hours is a form of “task batching”: the productivity practice of completing similar small tasks during a predetermined time rather than sporadically throughout the day. This saves you time because it removes the need to frequently switch between different types of tasks and adjust to each new context. You can use task batching to efficiently complete many different kinds of tasks—for instance, set a predetermined time every day or two to check your email rather than answering emails one at a time as they enter your inbox.)

#### Tip #3: Embrace Asynchronous Communication

According to Fried and Hansson, many organizations hurt their employees’ productivity by creating a culture in which they’re expected to constantly check their messages, stay aware of the discussion going on in real-time chatrooms, and respond as quickly as possible to anyone who mentions them. The threat of missing important information frightens employees into perpetually keeping tabs on all this synchronous communication—at the expense of their personal responsibilities.

To avoid this, the authors recommend relying primarily on asynchronous rather than real-time communication in the workplace. If someone needs to share important information, they shouldn’t just post it in a chatroom and assume that everyone will see it. **Instead, they should create a permanent document that relevant team members can consult whenever they want**. This way, workers are free to ignore real-time chats and concentrate on their work, trusting that they can seek out necessary information later. That said, if you need to communicate something urgent, real-time chat may be the right tool for the situation.

(Shortform note: In _Indistractable_ , Nir Eyal agrees that real-time chat in the workplace often pressures employees into distracting themselves from substantial work. If you need to use real-time chat (perhaps for urgent matters), consider scheduling an urgent, time-limited chat meeting to resolve the issue quickly, rather than having a prolonged, sporadic ongoing conversation. Additionally, like Fried and Hansson, Eyal suggests using permanent documents to share important information. However, he notes that particularly sensitive topics (such as necessary criticism of someone’s work) should be addressed in person so everyone involved can read the emotional tone and body language behind their coworkers’ words—nuances lost in written communication.)

**Another benefit of asynchronous communication is that it facilitates deeper thinking,** Fried and Hansson note. When employees share important information and seek collaborative input, they’ll receive more intelligent feedback if other team members have time to think deeply. In contrast, people at most companies present their ideas in real time (for instance, in an in-person meeting) and expect immediate feedback. Consequently, their colleagues’ underdeveloped first impressions compromise their ideas and decisions.

(Shortform note: In _Working Backwards_ , former Amazon executives Colin Bryar and Bill Carr explain how Amazon developed a different way of facilitating deep thinking in communication between employees. Like Fried and Hansson, Bryar and Carr observed that real-time PowerPoint-style presentations prompted underdeveloped immediate feedback from the audience. Their solution was to replace verbal presentations in meetings with refined six-page documents delivering the necessary information. Then, at the beginning of each meeting, all participants would silently read through and take notes on the material at their own pace. This gave the audience enough time to think deeply about the ideas at hand before giving feedback.)

### Maintain an Effective Team

We’ll end this guide with a discussion of Fried and Hansson’s perspective that **treating your employees as a long-term investment makes your organization a more effective and satisfying place to work**. Let’s discuss two of their tips on how to invest in a productive team.

#### Tip #1: Don’t Hunt for Talented Employees—Create Them

Most companies get skilled employees by identifying the most talented workers in their industry and trying to steal them away from whatever company they’re currently working for. However, transplanting successful employees from other companies can end in disaster if the new recruits struggle to adjust to your organization. Fried and Hansson argue that **the more reliable strategy is to hire employees who show promise and help them reach their full potential.**

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that training employees rather than poaching them from other companies doesn’t just result in better work. This approach also makes it more difficult for other companies to poach employees from you. Training employees to flourish at work is an act of support, and it leads people to believe that you’ll continue supporting them for as long as they work with you. Such well-supported employees are less likely to leave if other companies try to poach them. You can reinforce this promise of future support by mapping out long-term career paths at your organization.)

##### Three Effective Hiring Criteria

This mindset of _creating_ rather than _hunting for_ employees means that your hiring process will look different from the industry standard. Fried and Hansson recommend ignoring traditional résumé items such as a prestigious education or impressive past job titles. Instead, ask yourself three questions to determine whether someone has the potential to grow into an exceptional employee.

**First, are they likable?** For the good of the team, make sure to only hire people that everyone would be excited to work with.

(Shortform note: Gary Vaynerchuk (_Crush It!_) argues that an employee’s personality can be more important than the work they’re capable of doing. He elaborates that likable employees don’t just make the workplace more enjoyable, they also make it more productive. Antisocial employees force their coworkers to spend time figuring out how to avoid interpersonal conflict instead of getting real work done.)

**Second, do they add a unique perspective to the team?** Hiring people from a wide range of diverse backgrounds helps the team produce good ideas and better serve a wider range of customers.

(Shortform note: Diversity arguably yields these benefits not only on an organizational level, but also on the level of teams within your organization. In _Range_ , David Epstein asserts that managers can spark more valuable insights by encouraging employees to periodically work with different teams, increasing the range of diverse backgrounds each team has access to.)

**Third, what tangible work have they personally done?** Fried and Hansson note that the work someone typically lists on their résumé is too vague or exaggerated to illustrate what they’re actually capable of. Use the interview to uncover what specific _tasks_ they executed in past jobs rather than inferring their skill sets based on their previous work experience. This allows you to avoid onboarding workers who appear valuable on paper but end up being a costly mismatch.

For example, imagine you hire a former software engineer from a prestigious company to be a manager at your new tech startup. Unfortunately, the leadership responsibilities and disorganized startup environment are too overwhelming for them, and they end up resigning after six weeks. If you had instead hired someone who’d managed a scrappy team before, they likely would’ve succeeded as a manager for your startup.

(Shortform note: In _Rework,_ Fried and Hansson elaborate on what they look for during the hiring process. They note that _cover letters_ are often more reliable indicators of how well a candidate will fit than résumé credentials—a well-written cover letter demonstrates that the candidate is a good communicator (an invaluable skill) and reveals how passionate the candidate is about your specific organization. Judging a cover letter may be effective for the same reason as judging tasks applicants have done at past jobs: The cover letter itself is work they’ve produced entirely on their own and serves as firsthand evidence of their skills.)

#### Tip #2: Supply Generous Benefits

Finally, Fried and Hansson recommend supplying your team with enough generous benefits to make them want to stay at your company for the long haul. Retaining your current employees by offering them benefits is more effective than replacing them for a couple of reasons. **First, high employee turnover is expensive for your company.** Second, every time you hire someone new, your team has to divert time and attention away from serving your customers to conduct interviews and get the new employees up to speed (a long, arduous process).

(Shortform note: Some business experts argue that the high cost of employee turnover is a worthwhile expense. In _No Rules Rules_ , Reed Hastings reveals that Netflix encourages its managers to fire any employee they wouldn’t actively fight to keep. Their rationale is that if everyone in the company is an elite-level performer, it motivates the entire organization to maintain high standards. Netflix seeks to soften the blow of frequent firings by providing generous severance packages.)

Many companies entice employees with benefits that seem generous but that incentivize them to spend too much time at work instead of cultivating work-life balance. For example, they deck out the office with ping-pong tables or on-campus workout facilities that are free for employees to use but encourage them to stay at the workplace instead of going home.

In contrast, **Fried and Hansson recommend offering employees generous benefits that genuinely support employees—especially their lives outside of work.** For instance, the authors pay for their employees to take three weeks of vacation every year and even cover the costs of travel and accommodation for their workers.

> **Counterpoint: Excessive Employee Benefits Are Demotivating**
> 
> In contrast to Fried and Hansson, Daniel H. Pink argues in _Drive_ that excessive employee benefits of any kind will demotivate workers.
> 
> Pink asserts that any sources of _external motivation_ (like employee benefits) reduce employees’ subjective sense of autonomy by making them feel like the work is something they _have_ to do to get more rewards. This makes the job itself less appealing and consequently demotivates workers. Instead, Pink recommends fostering your employees’ _internal motivation_ by giving them more autonomy at work—for instance, by letting them work on projects of their own devising for 20% of their time at work.
> 
> However, this doesn’t mean that businesses should scrap all employee benefits. Pink explains that workers need a certain baseline of external incentives to feel motivated; otherwise, they’ll be demoralized by how unfair their situation is. For instance, employees in many industries expect a certain amount of paid vacation. They may not expect you to cover the costs of their trip as Fried and Hansson do, but if you demand that they never take time off, they’ll feel cheated and won’t build a sense of intrinsic motivation.
