## Chapter 7: Getting Started With Investing

Now that you know that investing is the surest and simplest way to grow your wealth (and that you’re totally capable of managing your own investments), it’s time to actually get started investing. There are two main investment strategies to choose from, and how you invest will ultimately depend on your financial needs as well as your risk tolerance.

In this chapter, you’ll learn more about different asset classes, which are the building blocks of investing. Then, you’ll learn how to allocate and diversify your investments based on your age and risk tolerance. Finally, we’ll discuss the two main investment strategies: choosing your own portfolio (which gives you full control over your investments) and target date funds (which automatically adjust your portfolio based on when you want to retire). However you choose to invest, remember that you don’t have to do it perfectly, you just have to get started.

### Asset Classes

Before you can start investing, you’ll need to understand the different asset classes that will make up your investment portfolio. Asset classes are simply types of investments (like stocks or bonds), and each asset class has varied assets within it. For example, “stocks” is an asset class composed of all kinds of different stocks: large companies, small companies, international companies, and so on. Let’s look at each asset class in more detail, starting with stocks.

#### Stocks

When you think of investing, you probably think of stocks first. **Stocks are shares of ownership in a particular company.** Stocks are one of the most unpredictable investments because their value is determined by the shareholders. For example, if a company seems to be doing really well, more and more people will want to buy stock in that company, which drives up the price of each individual share. But if something happens to shake people’s faith in that company (like a merger or a supply shortage), shareholders will start selling off their shares and cause the stock price to drop.

There are many different types of stocks. You’ll want to invest in several of these different types in order to create a healthy, diverse portfolio. Here are the most common types of stocks:

  * **Large-Cap.** These are the big company stocks that have a market capitalization (the amount invested in that company by its current shareholders) over $10 billion. 
  * **Mid-Cap.** These companies have a market capitalization of $1 billion to $5 billion. 
  * **Small-Cap.** These companies have a market capitalization under $1 billion.
  * **International.** These are stocks from companies in other countries. 
  * **Growth**. These are stocks that experts expect to grow in value, potentially outpacing the growth of the market as a whole.
  * **Value.** These are stocks that are relatively low priced compared to their actual value.



#### Bonds

Bonds are a different type of asset class. They’re a much more stable investment than stocks because the value of a bond doesn’t fluctuate based on the whims of the market. **When you buy a bond, you’re essentially giving a small loan to the bond issuer**(which can be the federal government, local governments, or a corporation) with a predetermined payback period. For example, say you buy a $100 bond with a 20 year term. If you hold onto that bond for the full 20 years (instead of selling it prematurely), you’ll get your $100 back, plus 20 years worth of interest.

Bonds provide a buffer against market volatility, which means that if some of your investments are in bonds rather than stocks, you won’t lose your entire investment if the market crashes. If you’re younger (in your twenties), you can afford to have a portfolio made up entirely of stocks, because even if you lose money, you’ll have enough time to earn it back before you really need it. If you’re in your thirties, you’ll want to start adding bonds into the mix since you have less time before retirement to bounce back if the market dips. If you’re in your forties or fifties, you’ll want the majority of your money to be in stable bonds—that way, you don’t risk losing your entire retirement income.

There are several types of bonds available, such as:

  * **Government.** These are bonds issued by the federal government and are generally considered one of the safest possible investments. The tradeoff for that safety is a comparatively lower rate of return than stocks.
  * **Corporate.** These bonds are issued by corporations. They’re a relatively safe investment (as long as the corporation stays in business). 
  * **Short-term.** These bonds mature in three years or less and provide relatively small returns.
  * **Long-term.** These bonds take at least 10 years to mature, but provide higher yields than short-term bonds. 
  * **Municipal**. These are bonds issued by local governments.
  * **Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)**. These are one of the safest investments because your investment won’t lose any value due to inflation. 



#### Cash

**In the past, financial experts recommended keeping part of your portfolio in cash, but as long as you’re funding your savings accounts, you don’t need to worry about this.** In the context of investing, “cash” doesn’t refer to paper money—it’s any money that isn’t actively invested and is just sitting in a money market account, slowly earning interest. This type of cash is specifically part of your investment portfolio (so it doesn’t refer to the money in your savings account).

The benefit of having part of your portfolio in cash is that it remains completely liquid, which means you can withdraw it at any time, for any reason, without penalty. Traditionally, people kept part of their portfolio in cash in case of emergencies. However, that money will lose value over time due to inflation as long as it continues to sit there uninvested—which is why you shouldn’t set aside part of your portfolio for liquid cash.

### Asset Allocation and Diversification

Now that we understand the building blocks of investing, let’s learn how to combine them into a healthy investment portfolio using asset allocation, which is the division of assets (like stocks and bonds) in your portfolio. **Managing your asset allocation is the best way to control the amount of risk in your portfolio** because you control how much of your money is invested in higher-risk options (like stocks) versus safer investments like bonds. In other words, **the way you distribute your investments is more important than the specific stocks, bonds, or funds you choose to invest in.**

Your asset allocation should reflect your risk tolerance. In your twenties and thirties, you can afford to take bigger risks with your money because you have plenty of time to recover from any losses before you retire. However, as you get older, your risk tolerance will decrease (because if you take a big loss in the stock market at age 59, you won’t necessarily have the time to recoup your investment before retirement). Your asset allocation should change to reflect those changes in your risk tolerance.

  * For example, at age 35, you can afford to invest 90% of your money in stocks (a higher-risk option) and 10% in bonds (a low-risk option). By age 65, that allocation should change so that nearly half of your total portfolio is invested in bonds. At that point, you’ll be less concerned about growing your money and more concerned about protecting the money you’ve made from investing. 



![IWT_assetsbyage.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/IWT_assetsbyage.png)

These numbers are just guidelines, not hard and fast rules, so you can adjust them based on your personal risk tolerance (so, if you’re young and want to be extra aggressive, you could invest 100% of your portfolio in stocks). Your financial situation also influences your asset allocation. **If your net worth is in the millions, your investment portfolio should be almost entirely composed of bonds.** You don’t need to aggressively grow your returns, so you have no reason to take unnecessary risks with your money.

#### Diversification

Your asset allocation refers to how your portfolio is divided _across_ asset classes, but you also need to consider diversification, which refers to the diversity of your investments _within_ each asset class. This also protects your investments in case one type of stock or bond doesn’t perform well in a given time period. So, for example, if you’re in your twenties and have 90% of your money invested in stocks and the other 10% invested in bonds, you have a solid asset allocation—but if all that money is invested in just large-cap stocks and government bonds, your portfolio isn’t diversified.

### Investment Option 1: Choose Your Own Portfolio

So far in this summary, we’ve covered all the basic building blocks of investing. Now, it’s time to actually take the plunge. When you’re ready to invest, you have two options: choosing your own portfolio or buying a single target date fund. If you value control over convenience and you’re up to the challenge of learning all about the logistics of investing, choosing your own portfolio is the path for you. In this option, you’ll learn how to create a diverse, well-allocated portfolio to maximize your investments while protecting yourself from unnecessary risk.

Before you commit to choosing your own portfolio, make sure you understand the downsides to this approach. **Most people who manage their own portfolios can’t match the market, let alone beat it,** because they overreact to small changes in the market and end up buying and selling frequently, which ultimately diminishes their returns. If you’re determined to choose your own portfolio, you’ll need to resist the temptation to sell when the market dips, which is easier said than done. Plus, you’ll need to understand the market well enough to determine your own specific asset allocation, then manually rebalance it every year.

If choosing your own portfolio still sounds like the right choice for you, start by deciding how to allocate your portfolio. Sethi recommends using this template from David Swensen, who manages Yale’s endowment and is famous for maintaining a 13.5% return over thirty years of investing (remember, most fund managers can’t even match the average 8% market return). Swensen recommends dividing your investments like this:

  * **30% in domestic equities.** These are funds composed of small-, mid-, and large-cap stocks in American companies.
  * **15% in developed-world international equities.** These are funds composed of stocks from companies in developed countries like Germany and France. 
  * **5% in emerging market equities.** These stocks are from companies in developing countries like Brazil and India. They’re generally considered riskier than developed-world entities, which is why they make up such a small percentage of your overall portfolio. 
  * **20% in real estate investment trusts (REITs).** REITs are essentially funds that invest in real estate rather than stocks.
  * **15% in government bonds.** As we saw earlier in this chapter, bonds are a stable investment that help balance the risk in your portfolio. 
  * **15% in treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).** These are one of the safest investments because they’re protected against inflation, but they typically have much smaller returns than the other investing options listed above. 



![david_swensen_asset_allocation.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/david_swensen_asset_allocation.png)

You can use Swensen’s model as-is or adjust it based on your own needs and goals.

Once you have your ideal asset allocation planned out, it’s time to start researching specific index funds within each of those categories. (Remember, there are thousands of index funds available, so choosing your own portfolio requires a _lot_ of research!) Start your search using the websites of investment companies like Vanguard and Schwab (information about specific funds is usually under the “Products and Services” tab). Here’s how to choose the exact funds to include in your portfolio.

  1. Look for funds with low fees (expense ratios of no more than 0.2%). 
  2. Dig into each fund you’re considering to see how it aligns with your asset allocation (for example, if a stock fund is made up entirely of domestic equities, you’ll have to find specific international index funds to balance your portfolio). 
  3. Research the fund’s performance over the last 10 to 15 years. 



#### What If You Can’t Afford Multiple Funds?

**Ideally, your search turned up three to seven funds that meet your criteria.** Since each index fund typically has a $1,000 minimum investment, that’s $3,000 to $7,000 total for initial investments alone. If you can’t afford to buy into all your ideal funds right now, don’t worry—you can set up a step-by-step plan to buy into each fund over time.

To start, choose the first index fund you want to buy into (this should be a stock fund so that you can start early and take full advantage of compounding over time). Then, take a look at the plan for expenditure you made in Chapter 4. Whatever you set aside for investing each month (after your 401(k) contribution), save that amount every month instead until you have enough to buy into your first fund. Once you buy into that first fund, you’ll set up a small automatic investment into that fund, then use the rest of your monthly investment allowance to save up for the next fund.

  * Let’s clarify this with an example. Say you have $500 per month to invest on your own (after your 401(k) contribution) according to your plan. If each fund you want to buy into has a $1,000 minimum, start by saving your monthly $500 investment allowance for two months. That gives you enough money to buy into the first fund. Then, set up an automatic $100 monthly contribution to that fund. You now have $400 per month in unallocated investment funds. If you save that $400 for another three months, you’ll have $1,200—enough to buy into your second index fund. You can keep repeating this process until you own all the index funds you need for a solid portfolio. 



Once you’ve saved up enough to buy into all your index funds, you’ll split your monthly investment allowance across all those funds. **Use your asset allocation to decide how to split up that money instead of just dividing it evenly.** For example, if you’re using David Swensen’s asset allocation, 30% of your portfolio is invested in domestic equities—which means you should contribute 30% of your monthly investment allowance to your domestic equities funds.

### Investment Option 2: Target Date Funds

If keeping track of a portfolio full of stocks, bonds, and index funds makes your head spin, don’t worry. **There’s an easier way to invest: Target date funds (also called “target retirement” or “lifecycle” funds), which automatically rebalance your investments based on the year you plan to retire.** That way, you don’t have to worry about adjusting your asset allocation as you age—a target date fund will automatically reallocate more of your investments into safer options like bonds as you get closer to retirement. This is one of the biggest benefits of target date funds because it saves you the headache of reevaluating your investments every single year.

Target date funds also provide automatic diversification because they’re essentially funds made up of other funds (and those funds, in turn, are made up of different stocks). That means you can own stock in a huge variety of companies just by buying into a single target date fund, giving you all the benefits of diversification without the headache of juggling a complex portfolio.

Target date funds are a great example of the “good enough” mentality: They don’t always have the very best returns, but they make it incredibly easy to invest, so they’re good enough. If you’re chasing the biggest possible returns and would rather sit back and let your money grow without having to worry about it, target date funds are the perfect choice. To find the right target date fund for you, you can start your research on investment company websites (just as you would if you were researching index funds). These funds are typically named after the target retirement year (for example, if you plan to retire in 2045, you can look for funds called “Target Retirement 2045”).

### How to Actually Invest

By now, you know your investment strategy (either building a portfolio from scratch or using a target date fund), how to research different funds, and how to save up the required minimum investments. Now, it’s finally time to actually invest!

One crucial thing to note is that **_funding_ an investment account is different from actually _investing_ that money.** If you set up automatic contributions to your 401(k) and Roth IRA earlier in this summary, _you haven’t actually invested that money yet_ —and it will just sit there, earning zero returns, until you do! This is a common mistake that can cost you thousands of dollars in lost potential returns.

When you’re ready to take the final step and invest the money in your investment accounts, **start with your 401(k)**. Companies that offer 401(k)s typically only offer a small handful of funds for you to choose from (to see the funds your company offers, talk to your HR representative). These will usually be divided based on your risk tolerance, so you can choose between an aggressive fund, a balanced fund, or a conservative fund (as we saw with asset allocation, if you’re young, you can and should invest as aggressively as possible).

Next, you can invest the money in your Roth IRA. **The great thing about Roth IRAs is that you can invest in any fund you like.** This is where you have the freedom to invest in the target date funds or index funds that you found in your research (and still get the tax benefits of investing through your Roth IRA). When you’re ready to buy in, log into your Roth IRA, search the name of the fund, and click “buy.”

### Automatic Investing

Once you own a target date fund or a handful of index funds, you should keep contributing money to them each month on top of your initial investment. You’ll do this using the automatic payment infrastructure you set up in Chapter 5. Automation is especially important for investing because you continue automatic contributions every month, _regardless of whether the market is going up or down_. In practice, that means that **even if the stock market drops severely, you continue funding your investments** because you know that those dramatic highs and lows will even out over time to a modest-but-predictable gain of about 8%.

It can be scary to keep buying into the market during a recession, but consider the long-term view: When the market is down, you’re essentially buying shares on sale that will almost certainly appreciate in value over the course of your 40 or 50 years of investing. When you invest automatically, you don’t have to worry about buying and selling stocks, which means you won’t incur any trading fees. You also won’t have to consciously think about investing because it will all be taken care of for you automatically.

### Extra Credit: Other Types of Investments

You may be wondering about other types of investments, like real estate, art, or cryptocurrency. As a general rule, Sethi cautions against these types of investments because they tend to have unpredictable returns. For example, when most people talk about investing in real estate, they mean their own homes, and they forget how quickly the cost of upkeep and property taxes eat away at any annual returns from owning property.

The art world is equally unpredictable: One study of a famous art collection worth $99 million found that just two of the 135 pieces in the collection accounted for _half_ the collection’s value. The odds of choosing the art piece that will appreciate most in value are about the same as the odds of choosing which individual stock will skyrocket (which, as we know, even professional fund managers typically can’t do). The same boom-and-bust pattern tends to apply to cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin). In 2017, Bitcoin generated a 240% return on investment—and then immediately bottomed out.

**The bottom line for these alternative investments is this: They’re too high-risk for a reliable, long-term investment strategy** , so if you want to invest in them, you should use your guilt-free spending money to do so. However, once you have a mature, well-balanced portfolio and at least six months of emergency funds saved up, you can use 5-10% of your monthly investment money to invest in something fun.

### Action Items

  * **Decide whether to invest in a single target date fund or select your own portfolio of index funds.** Remember, don’t take too much time on this decision—just choose whatever will help you get started quickest (for most people, this will be a target date fund).
  * **Research the different funds available.**
  * **Buy your funds.**
