## Chapter 6: Managing Your Own Investments—Without a Financial Advisor

Now that your pre-planned system of transfers is funneling money into your investment accounts each month, you can start thinking about how to actually invest that money. If you’re not a personal finance expert, managing your own investments might seem intimidating, and you may even be tempted to hire a professional financial advisor. However, unless your financial situation is especially complicated, you don’t need a financial advisor—you can get the same (or even _better_) results by managing your own investments, even without any special expertise.

In this chapter, we’ll see how financial “experts” are typically no better than amateurs when it comes to predicting the market or choosing where to invest—and how falling for their false expertise can cost you thousands of dollars in fees. Then, we’ll cover the basics of investing, including the difference between actively-managed mutual funds and passively-managed index funds.

### Financial Experts Rarely Beat the Market

When you think of a financial expert (or, more specifically, an investing expert), who do you think of? Most people picture one of two things: media pundits who make their living loudly predicting stock market trends on television, or mutual fund managers (people who choose how to invest the money in a mutual fund, which is a group of different stocks that make up a single fund people can invest in). In either case, their job is to “beat the market,” which means getting better-than-average returns by correctly predicting which specific stocks will rise or fall in value

We tend to put these people on a pedestal because we assume that their investing experience will equate to better financial returns. However, that’s rarely the case: **Mutual fund managers only “beat the market” about 25% of the time.** Even if they _do_ manage to beat the market one year, that result typically involves more chance than skill—and they’re rarely able to replicate their success the next year, let alone for several years in a row. That’s because the stock market is an extremely complicated system by nature, so it’s nearly impossible to predict how it will change in the short-term.

To see how chaotic the market can be, consider this example: Back in 2008, if you had the option to buy stock in Google or in Domino’s Pizza, which would you choose? Most people would choose Google, and they’d see some great returns—between 2008 and 2018, Google’s stock tripled in value. However, in that same period, Domino’s Pizza’s stock grew to _18 times_ its 2008 value. That’s why fund managers can so rarely beat the market—it’s almost completely unpredictable.

#### Hiding Poor Performance

You might wonder why so many people put so much faith in pundits and fund managers when they have such a poor track record for predicting the market. There are a few reasons for this.

  * **First, many people make their investment decisions based on information from companies (like Morningstar) that rate various mutual funds based on their performance.** If a fund is well-rated, the company advises investors to buy more shares (or hold onto their current shares). The problem with that is that these ratings don’t actually reflect a fund’s performance. One study even found that 47 out of 50 financial ratings companies told investors to buy or hold shares in mutual funds right up until the day the company in charge of the mutual fund filed for bankruptcy. 
  * **Second, fund ratings are subject to _survivorship bias_** because financial ratings companies can only rate funds that still exist, which means they’re automatically ignoring all the funds that performed poorly and ultimately closed down. In other words, if a mutual fund management company starts 20 new funds and only five produce better-than-average returns, the company will drop the 15 failed funds. Then, when companies like Morningstar rate that fund-management company based on how their funds perform, they only see the five successful funds, so the resulting rating gives a skewed picture of how well that company’s funds actually perform. 



### Understanding Financial Advisors

By now, we know not to rely on financial pundits or mutual fund managers, but deciding whether to rely on a financial advisor is a bit more nuanced. Financial advisors are professionals who make their money by advising people on how to invest given their individual needs and financial situation. If you’re overwhelmed by the idea of managing your own finances, you may be tempted to pay a financial advisor to take over for you, but remember—when you give up control of your money, you also give up the opportunity to create your own Rich Life.

In general, **most young people can manage their own finances just fine without the help of a professional advisor.** However, if you have a complicated financial situation (for example, if you’ve inherited a substantial amount of money or if you have dependents), a financial advisor can be helpful. If you decide to hire one, there’s a few things you’ll need to look out for:

  * **Look for “fee-only” advisors** who charge a flat fee for their services and don’t make any money through commissions. That way, you can be confident that when they tell you to invest in a particular fund, it’s because that’s what’s best for _you_ , not because it will make the most money for _them_. 
  * **Ask any potential financial advisor if they’re a fiduciary** (which means they are legally obligated to give you advice based on your own best interest instead of their own bottom line). If they’re not, you’re at risk of being scammed and should choose a different advisor. 



### Financial Independence

Managing your investments might ultimately be the most important part of your financial life because it can lead to financial independence. In personal finance, the term “financial independence” means that **your investments completely cover your living expenses—meaning you no longer have to work if you don’t want to.** The moment your investments start generating more money than your salary is called the Crossover Point. (Shortform note: The term “Crossover Point'' was first coined by Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez in their book, _Your Money or Your Life_. To learn more about financial independence and the Crossover Point, read our summary of Your Money or Your Life.)

**When you reach the Crossover Point and no longer have to work for a living, you’re Financially Independent and Retiring Early (FIRE).** FIRE can look different depending on your goals and lifestyle. For example, some people pursue “LeanFire,” which means they plan to live a modest lifestyle for the rest of their lives, so their investments only need to generate $30,000 to $50,000 per year to cover their expenses. On the other hand, there’s “FatFire,” in which people try to generate the highest possible net worth before retiring so that they can invest more and rake in higher returns.

For both FIRE styles, there’s a tradeoff between money and time: With LeanFire, you can retire earlier (often in your thirties or forties), but won’t be able to spend extravagantly; with FatFire, you’ll have to work longer, but you’ll be able to afford a lavish lifestyle once you do retire.

Remember: You get to choose what your Rich Life looks like and whether it involves reaching your crossover point. If so, you have a few options for how to achieve that goal: You can increase your income, reduce your spending, or try a combination of both. In the table below, see how each option changes how long it would take you to reach your Crossover Point (and how much you’d be able to live on in retirement) based on an income of $80,000 and $6,000 in monthly expenses.

Strategy  | Yearly Income  | Monthly Expenses  | Years to Crossover Point  | Yearly Spending Allowance After Crossover Point   
---|---|---|---|---  
Save and invest 10% of income  | $80,000  | $6,000  | 38  | $72,000   
Increase income by 30%  | $104,000  | $6,000  | 22  | $72,000   
Reduce expenses by 50%  | $80,000  | $3,000  | 12  | $36,000   
Increase income by 30% _and_ reduce expenses by 30%  | $104,000  | $4,200  | 9  | $50,400   
  
Overall, setting FIRE as your goal can be a powerful way to increase your savings, but it’s not for everyone. **Remember, a Rich Life is about more than money:** If relentlessly cutting your spending or fretting over your investments is going to make you stressed and miserable, you may want to reconsider whether retiring early is worth that misery.

### Taking Control of Your Own Investments

If your financial situation is relatively straightforward and you opt to manage your own investments without an advisor (as most young people can and should), you’ll need to know the basics of investing, beginning with mutual funds and index funds. (Remember, in the context of investing, a “fund” is a diverse group of investments. When you buy into a fund, you’re actually buying a variety of stocks and bonds, without the hassle of choosing each of them individually.)

#### Active Management: Mutual Funds

A mutual fund is a collection of different investments. Mutual fund managers buy each of those specific investments (using a pool of money contributed by a group of individual investors) depending on what they think will generate the best returns. **We call this “active management” because an actual human is in charge of picking and choosing where to invest the fund’s money.**

The benefit of a mutual fund is that each person who buys into it is automatically investing a little bit of money in each of the stocks and bonds that make up the fund. In other words, as an investor, **you get all the benefits of a diverse investment portfolio without having to worry about picking specific stocks yourself** (we’ll learn more about why a diverse portfolio is important in the next chapter). Mutual funds also sometimes produce amazing returns, but that performance only lasts a year or two.

However, actively managed mutual funds have a major downside: fees. We already know that mutual fund managers typically can’t beat the average market returns—so if you invest in a mutual fund, not only will you likely see subpar returns, but you’ll pay significant fees that sap the value of your investment even further. These fees (or “expense ratios”) are usually 1-2% of assets managed per year. That may not sound like a lot, but those fees compound—which means **a 1% fee can end up reducing your overall returns by a whopping 30% in the long run.**

#### Passive Management: Index Funds

Thankfully, you can bypass those fees by investing in index funds. **Index funds are “passively managed” because they don’t have a fund manager who chooses which stocks and bonds to invest in.** Instead, they use a computer algorithm to automatically invest in all the stocks in a given _index_ , which is a section of the stock market (for example, NASDAQ is an index of technology stocks). This means that the value of an index fund will rise and fall in the same pattern as the section of the market that the index represents.

In the short term, index funds might not always match the returns of mutual funds because they track so closely with the wider market. However, **in the long run, passively managed funds are a far better deal because there is no fund manager’s salary to pay, so the fees are much lower.** For example, an index fund might have an expense ratio of 0.14% compared to a mutual fund’s 2% expense ratio.

To understand how important those low fees are, let’s look at an example. If you invest $100 per month in a mutual fund with a 1% expense ratio and keep that making that monthly investment for 25 years, you’ll pay almost $12,000 more in fees than if you’d invested that same money in an index fund**** with a 0.14% expense ratio (assuming the standard 8% return). The more money you invest, the more money you lose to mutual fund fees. For example, if you initially invested $5,000 in that same mutual fund and contributed another $1,000 each month after that, **after 25 years, you’d pay $126,418 more in fees than you would for an index fund.**
