## Exercise: Boost Your Motivation to Learn

Boosting your motivation for learning (which reduces the need to force yourself to complete essential learning tasks, like studying) is an important part of improving your learning process. The following exercise will help you apply the authorâ€™s learning motivation and willpower tips to your own life.

* * *

Think about a learning goal you want to achieve. What obstacles could deter you from achieving that goal? Are they external obstacles (like your work schedule) or personal habits and routines? Make a short list of them.

From the list you made of obstacles, reflect on which you have some control over and plan how to overcome those obstacles.

Finally, reflect on how isolated you are in your learning process. Do you study alone or with others? If you study alone, make one commitment in the next month to study or practice with others. If you study with others, how might you make that time even more productive?
