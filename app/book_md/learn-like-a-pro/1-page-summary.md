## 1-Page Summary

_Learn Like a Pro_ by Barbara Oakley and Olav Schewe is a practical and user-friendly guide to improving your approach to learning. Learning can be frustrating. Many people struggle with achieving their learning goals, whether getting good grades in school, passing licensing exams, or mastering new skills. But Oakley and Schewe argue that **you can become a better learner if you understand more about how your brain functions and adopt learning methods that work with your brain’s learning capabilities** rather than against them.

The authors are confident anyone can improve their learning processes because they themselves once struggled with learning: Both Oakley and Schewe had difficulty getting decent grades in high school. They believed they were born unable to learn certain subjects. However, they each discovered that what was holding them back was their approach to learning, and with some tweaks to their learning processes, they excelled in higher education and became successful in their careers. Oakley is now an engineering professor at Oakland University, and her online courses on improving learning skills have become some of the world's most popular. She’s also authored and co-authored several books on learning, including _Learning How to Learn_ and _A Mind for Numbers_. Schewe is the founder and CEO of an education technology company dedicated to developing better learning methods for students and the author of the internationally popular how-to-study guide _Super Student_.

In this guide, we’ll outline many of the authors’ learning techniques and explore some of the cognitive psychology and neuroscience of learning so that you can understand why these techniques work. We’ll also examine how you can boost your motivation to learn and provide practical tips for excelling in academic settings so that you can become a better learner for life. Along the way, we’ll provide additional context to help you better understand the science of learning and compare the authors’ learning techniques to those of other education, psychology, and neuroscience experts.

### Why Memory Is Essential for Learning

You have two types of memory that work together to help you learn new information and skills—working memory and long-term memory. The authors explain that **putting information into your long-term memory is the key to learning** , and working memory plays a crucial role in this process.

(Shortform note: The science of memory and learning is complex, and there’s no absolute consensus among scientists and researchers about how memory and learning happen in the brain. Oakley and Schewe have drawn from several models and theories for this book. The one they emphasize for their theories of working memory and long-term memory is the Atkinson-Shiffrin Model, outlined in _Make It Stick_ , which says that memory involves the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information and that there are different types of memory (such as short-term memory and long-term memory).)

#### Long-Term Memory Is the Key to Learning

**Full, effective learning happens when information enters and stays in your long-term memory.** This happens through neural connections: When you learn something, your neurons connect, forming pathways. When you learn something simple, like memorizing a phone number, those pathways are short. But when you learn something complex, the pathways grow longer and form webs of connections that cement learning into your long-term memory.

The more you use neural pathways, the stronger the bonds between the neurons become, and the better they become a part of your long-term memory. This is why when you practice a skill many times or when you review and recall information often, you’re less likely to forget it. Lots of long and strong pathways in your long-term memory allow you to genuinely understand concepts and easily execute skills—for example, when you fully comprehend computer programming or master a kickflip on a skateboard.

(Shortform note: In _Make It Stick_ , Peter Brown, Henry Roediger III, and Mark McDaniel further explain that the bonds between neurons are enhanced by a waxy substance called myelin which coats some of the axons (nerve cell threads) in your brain. It acts like insulation on a wire, helping signals travel faster through synapses. They note that scientists believe the more you practice a skill or think about the information you’ve learned, the thicker the myelin coating on the associated axons becomes, and the stronger and faster the signals to perform that skill or remember that information.)

#### Working Memory Feeds Long-Term Memory

Before knowledge can enter your long-term memory, it first needs to go through your _working memory_. **Working memory temporarily holds facts, thinks through information, and solves problems**. It’s a crucial part of the learning process, but it has limits: Working memory can only hold around three or four thoughts at a time, and if you’re asked to think about more than that, you’ll likely start to forget some of those thoughts.

The authors explain that working memory and long-term memory collaborate in the learning process: The neural links your working memory creates are what eventually enter into your long-term memory once those links have been sufficiently strengthened. Then, those long-term neural links in turn help your working memory operate better: When solving problems or absorbing new information, your working memory reaches into your long-term memory and uses those already established links to connect what you already know with what you’re learning at the moment.

> **Understanding Memory: The Working Memory Model**
> 
> Of the many different theories to explain how memory works in our brains, the Baddeley and Hitch Working Memory Model correlates most closely with Oakley and Schewe’s discussion of working memory’s role in forming long-term memory. It proposes that working memory has three parts that process sensory and spatial information and interact with long-term memory to make decisions. This model also suggests that working memory has a limited capacity and is essential for complicated cognitive tasks like problem-solving.
> 
> The model suggests that an _attentional control system_ is responsible for transferring information from working memory to long-term memory. The attentional control system can be thought of as a gatekeeper, deciding which information is important enough to be transferred to long-term memory. The more attention given to information in working memory, the more likely it will be transferred to long-term memory for later use.

##### How to Improve Your Working Memory

The authors explain that **if you’re struggling to understand the concepts you’re learning, it’s probably because your working memory is overloaded.** You can optimize your working memory while learning complex material with the following tips:

  * **Simplify the information you’re working with:** Think of easier words to describe the concept and focus on the main ideas rather than getting lost in the details.
  * **Start with the basic ideas:** Focus on the foundational concepts and gradually add more details and complexity as you get more comfortable with the basics.
  * **Write things down:** As you focus on your learning task, make lists of other ideas and thoughts that come into your mind that you don’t want to forget. Writing down words to jog your memory means your notes can function as your memory instead of your brain.



> **Alternative Ways to Understand and Support Working Memory**
> 
> In _A Mind for Numbers_ , Oakley uses the term _choking_ to describe the struggle to understand a concept due to overloading your working memory, painting a vivid picture of too much information jamming up the processes. As she does in _Learn Like a Pro_ , Oakley recommends that you simplify information by using easier vocabulary and by focusing on basic ideas as ways to avoid choking.
> 
> As for the technique of writing things down, research supports the effectiveness of using lists and notes as an extension of your brain to free up space in your working memory. The study adds that using digital notes, reminders, and alarms, like those on your smartphone, is a similar method that can help address information overload and help your working memory function better. In other words, you don’t have to physically write things down for this technique to be effective.

### How to Foster Learning That Lasts

**Knowledge moves from your working memory into your long-term memory through one of two ways** : either the _declarative learning system_ or the _procedural learning system_.

> **Understanding Memory: The Dual-Process Theory**
> 
> Oakley and Schewe’s two “learning systems”—declarative and procedural—correlate with a more widely accepted and research-supported model of memory called the _dual-process theory_. This model suggests that two main systems are involved in information processing: an intuitive, automatic system (procedural) and an analytical, controlled system (declarative). The intuitive system quickly and effortlessly processes information, relying on past experiences and stored knowledge. The analytical system, on the other hand, is slower and more deliberate, using logic and reasoning to analyze information.
> 
> Outside the book, the terms _declarative_ and _procedural_ are more often used to describe subtypes of long-term memory, not the processes that help form memories in your brain. The Working Memory Model discussed above is a more accurate theory for how declarative and procedural memories move from your working memory to your long-term memory.

**The declarative learning system deposits information into your _conscious_ memory** so that you’re aware of it and can purposefully recall it. This is how you store information, like facts about a subject you’re learning for a test. With this system, you learn through logical and sequential steps: A + B = C. Once you’ve learned something through the declarative system, your working memory retrieves that information from your long-term memory through the declarative neural pathways.

**The procedural system deposits information into your _subconscious_ memory.** This is the type of long-term memory you pull from when performing skills you’re so familiar with that they become automatic, and you don’t have to consciously direct them—like driving a car, typing on a keyboard, or recalling information you know deeply. The procedural system works by instinctively sensing and remembering patterns through repeated exposure to the information or by practicing an action.

(Shortform note: Cognition and neuroscience experts often refer to declarative and procedural memory as _explicit_ and _implicit memory_ , respectively. Explicit memory (declarative) has two different components: episodic memory, which allows you to recall specific events from the past, and semantic memory, which stores general knowledge and factual information about the world. Implicit memory (procedural) is often called "muscle memory" because it involves the memory of specific physical actions and movements. Because your implicit memories are thought to be supported by different neural pathways than explicit memories, they’re often less susceptible to the effects of aging and neurological damage.)

**You can learn most effectively by tapping both systems**. When you first learn something, you use your declarative system to consciously understand a concept or perform an action. Then, with practice, your procedural system builds on that learning and ingrains it into your long-term memory. For example, let’s say you’re learning to play a tune on the piano—when you first learn it, you have to consciously think about each note that comes next, what rhythm to play, and so on, using your declarative system. Then, over time, the procedural system builds on those neural connections, and eventually, you can play the piece confidently without thinking through each step.

(Shortform note: Oakley’s and Schewe’s explanation corresponds with the dual-process model of memory, which suggests that the two systems—the intuitive automatic (procedural) and the analytical controlled (declarative)—work together and influence each other. The intuitive system provides a foundation of memorized knowledge and automatic judgments for the controlled system to build upon. By working together, the two systems enhance our brain’s learning and memory abilities.)

#### Gain Mastery and Fluency With the Procedural System

The authors discuss some techniques that can help you understand concepts deeply enough that they become governed by your procedural system, so you can access that information or skill without consciously thinking about it. Two areas that can benefit from this ability are mathematics and languages.

**To comprehend complex mathematical concepts intuitively,** you must understand _why_ they work, not just the step-by-step methods of _how_ they work. To achieve that level of mastery, the authors recommend you solve practice problems for which you have access to their step-by-step resolved solutions. Then, try to figure out each step yourself before checking the solution. This will train you to listen to your inner voice—your intuition—about how to approach the problem and will help you internalize the process. Once you’ve internalized it, you’ll be able to tackle other, similar problems because your brain will have learned the patterns behind them.

(Shortform note: In _Ultralearning,_ Scott Young explains that experts’ problem-solving intuition is the result of deeply understanding those subjects’ underlying principles. He outlines many ways to develop deep, intuitive knowledge, one of which is to let yourself struggle and find your own way to the answers and solutions as you learn. This approach is exactly what the problem-solving exercise above facilitates by encouraging you to work through difficult problems on your own. Young’s suggestion is to set a timer for 10 to 15 minutes when you’re faced with a difficult problem, and then force yourself to work on it until the timer goes off. If you don’t solve it in that time, you’ll at least spur your brain to keep thinking about it.)

**To learn new languages,** you can use both your declarative and procedural systems to help you internalize vocabulary and grammar rules and to achieve fluency (a level of familiarity where you can speak naturally without having to think about it). To support the pattern-finding power of your procedural system, space out your practice sessions—the longer you want to remember, the longer you should pause between review sessions. For example, they say if you want to remember the material for a year, have a review session every three weeks.

(Shortform note: Brown, Roediger III, and McDaniel, the authors of _Make It Stick_ , explain an additional way to space out your practice which can help you achieve fluency in a new language: practicing your new skill in different contexts. Doing so enhances your understanding of the underlying patterns and improves your ability to use that skill in various situations. This method helps you apply what you have learned to different situations and encourages your brain to think quickly and fluidly—for example, talking to native speakers in the language you’re trying to learn.)

### How Different Modes of Attention Can Help You Learn

The authors explain that **the brain has two modes of attention: focused and diffuse mode**. By properly engaging both modes, you can better learn new concepts and skills, understand complex topics, and move past periods when you feel stuck and can’t seem to make progress in your learning.

**Focused mode is when you deliberately concentrate on a task in front of you** —for example, reading a chapter from your textbook or memorizing new information. This mode is best for strengthening your understanding of familiar topics or gaining new knowledge related to things you already know, such as learning new vocabulary in your native language. This is because focused mode uses neural connections that have already been formed in your brain.

**Diffuse mode is when you’re not focusing on any one thing in particular but instead are letting thoughts flow through your mind naturally** —as happens when you’re going through routine parts of your day like making breakfast or driving to work. As you’re doing these things, your brain works on problems and processes new information “in the background” by making novel connections (building new neural pathways) between ideas and knowledge that it cannot make while in focused mode. These new neural pathways are what integrate new learning into your brain.

> **A Deeper Look at the Brain’s Modes of Attention**
> 
> In _Focus_ , Daniel Goleman refers to focused mode as _selective attention_ and diffuse mode as _mind-wandering_.
> 
> Goleman’s selective attention (focused mode) is effortful attention that helps your brain filter information from your senses and focus on what is relevant. With strong selective attention skills, you can focus on a task and ignore distractions, deal with emotional distractions during stressful times, and direct your attention away from worrisome thoughts. These abilities are crucial for engaging meaningfully with learning tasks by giving you control over where you put your mind to use.
> 
> Goleman’s mind-wandering (diffuse mode) is the brain's "default mode," meaning it happens automatically when you’re not deliberately focusing on something, causing your mind to wander from topic to topic. He writes that mind-wandering can spark enormous creativity because your brain makes unique connections unconsciously before they emerge into your awareness.

**To learn something complex, you’ll need to alternate between focused and diffuse modes.** When you’re learning something simple, focused mode will be all you need. But when you’re learning something complex, you won’t be able to fully absorb the concepts if you stay in focused mode alone. This is because in focused mode, your brain suppresses all thoughts except what you’re purposefully paying attention to, which will prevent you from making the “aha” connections between different pieces of information that diffuse mode encourages.

Switch back and forth between both modes to build and strengthen your understanding of new ideas: Work in focused mode until you start to get stuck, then switch to diffuse mode to let your brain work on those ideas in the background. Then switch back to focused mode to continue your learning again.

(Shortform note: In _Learning How to Learn_ , Oakley has a slightly different way of explaining how alternating between focused attention and diffuse mode optimizes learning. She says focused mode allows you to _comprehend the problem_ at hand, taking a mental break in diffuse mode allows your brain to _discover the solution_ , and switching back into focused mode again allows you to _apply the solution to the problem._)

#### How to Improve Your Focused Mode

The authors say you can improve the power of your focused mode with the following tips:

**Reduce distractions**. The authors advise making your environment as distraction-free as possible and minimizing interruptions. Choose a location where socializing doesn’t typically occur, such as a quiet library or private study space. If you can't avoid noise, consider using noise-canceling headphones or earplugs. Keep your phone out of sight, disable notifications on your electronic devices, or use website blockers to avoid being distracted by social media or other notifications.

(Shortform note: What makes something a distraction? In _Hyperfocus, _Chris Bailey defines distraction as anything that hinders you from accomplishing your intended goal or task. In other words, if something takes your attention away from what you intend to or need to concentrate on, it can be considered a distraction. This implies that _anything_ has the potential to become a distraction if it interferes with your focus.)

**Avoid multitasking.** The authors advise that you only multitask (switch back and forth between tasks) infrequently. Studies show that constantly switching between tasks harms your ability to concentrate, which makes you more likely to make mistakes and hurts your ability to write and remember information. This is because part of your attention lingers on your previous task—what the authors call _attention residue_ —which prevents you from fully focusing on the new one.

However, task-switching has some benefits: It can foster creative thinking by freeing you from ruts in your thinking that can occur when you concentrate for too long on a single task by changing and expanding your perspective.

**Have a plan for interruptions**. The authors recommend that when inevitable interruptions occur, like your child coming into your office to ask a question, take a moment to note where you will leave off in whatever you are focusing on—the paragraph number on the page of a book, for example. This gives your brain a sense of closure that reduces the attention residue of multitasking, therefore helping you regain focus when you return to your learning task. Acknowledge and respond to the interruption, and then make a clean break from the interruption and completely switch your attention back to your learning.

(Shortform note: In _Eat That Frog!_ , Brian Tracy explains that when you switch back and forth between tasks or deal with a lot of interruptions while you’re trying to work (or learn), it takes an average of 17 minutes for you to fully regain your focus. In other words, attentional residue can last a long time. Tracy says the more you task-switch and deal with interruptions, the more mistakes you make, increasing the time you need to complete something by over 500%. In contrast, when you commit to focusing on one thing at a time and minimize interruptions, you can complete a task in less than half the time it would take you otherwise.)

#### How to Use Diffuse Mode for Learning

Being in diffuse mode might feel unproductive for learning compared to focused mode because it seems like you’re not doing anything. But the authors assert that diffuse mode is essential for learning complex topics or skills and can help you get unstuck when you’re struggling to learn something new.

(Shortform note: In addition to helping you learn, Daniel Goleman highlights some other benefits of mind-wandering (diffuse mode), including facilitating self-reflection and problem-solving by allowing your attention to sort through personal concerns, dilemmas, and regrets. However, he warns that letting your mind wander too much can lead to rumination, negatively affecting your quality of life and disrupting your concentration (focused mode).)

To take advantage of diffuse mode, the authors advise you to take frequent, five- to 10-minute breaks while learning. **The specific technique they recommend to incorporate breaks into your process is the _Pomodoro_ method**:

  1. Remove distractions from your environment, especially easily accessible technology distractions like open computer tabs and cell phones.
  2. Set a timer for 25 minutes. 
  3. Concentrate as much as you can on your learning task.
  4. After 25 minutes, take a break for five minutes. The break should be an activity that doesn’t require much concentration, like stretching for a few minutes or petting a pet. Checking emails and social media doesn’t count as a break, as these activities do not put your mind in diffuse mode.
  5. Repeat the timed work and break cycles as necessary. 



(Shortform note: The Pomodoro method is a popular tool among education and psychology experts, and one expert offers a twist on the method: Instead of using a timer to divide your learning time into 25-minute chunks with a break in between, use a music streaming service, like Pandora, which plays music for about 20-30 minutes interspersed with short commercial breaks. Work while the music is playing and take your breaks during the commercials—this way, you won’t have to set and reset a timer, and you can enjoy music as you study as long as it's not distracting.)

### Improve Learning by Boosting Motivation and Self-Discipline

Improving your motivation and self-discipline to tackle learning tasks can improve how effectively you learn. Motivation is how much effort you’re willing to put into achieving a goal, and self-discipline, or willpower, is your ability to make small sacrifices _now_ to accomplish that goal in the future. The authors argue that when it comes to your self-discipline for learning, **the best approach is not to _cultivate more of it_ but instead to focus on strategies that reduce or eliminate your need to use it in the first place**. Boosting your motivation is one of the best ways to bypass the need for self-discipline—when you’re motivated to learn, you don’t need to tap into your willpower to do it.

(Shortform note: Although the authors don’t focus on strategies to cultivate and strengthen self-discipline (but rather, to avoid the need to use it), many psychology experts offer techniques for increasing your willpower, including Kelly McGonigal in _The Willpower Instinct. _McGonigal explains that things like stress, guilt, and not getting enough sleep and exercise deplete your willpower, and by addressing these factors, you can restore your ability to delay gratification in pursuit of long-term goals.)

You may not always feel enthusiastic about your learning tasks, but the authors recommend several ways you can strengthen your motivation for learning and lessen the need to exert self-discipline to accomplish your learning goals.

**Set compelling goals.** To stay motivated, set three types of goals: long-term goals (like starting your own business), which keep you focused on and excited about the future; stepping-stone goals (like getting your MBA), which are closer in time and help you reach your long-term goal; and process goals, which are short-term and actionable daily and weekly learning tasks (like studying for your MBA exams) that build toward your stepping-stone goal.

**Make study plans** **and anticipate the obstacles that could deter you**. Strategize when, where, and how you’ll study or practice and mark it on your calendar because you’re more likely to follow through on studying if you make a plan. Then, think about what could get in the way of your plan—for example, your friends inviting you to hang out on your study day. It’s also helpful to set yourself up for success. For example, if you know you always forget your glasses when studying at a coffee shop, set your book bag up with everything you need the night before.

> **Goal-Setting and Deliberate Practice Develop Grit**
> 
> In _Grit_ , Angela Duckworth says that setting different levels of goals, making study and practice plans, and planning for potential obstacles are all techniques for developing grit—what she defines as a combination of perseverance and passion.
> 
> Duckworth explains that setting goals provides you with a clear sense of direction and purpose, which helps you stay motivated and focused over the long term. Planning and structuring your practice and study time, along with anticipating learning obstacles, would be considered a part of what Duckworth calls _deliberate practice_ —a purposeful way of focusing your effort in order to achieve tangible outcomes—which helps you develop the grit you need to stay committed to your goals.

**Change your habits.** We all have habits and routines, and some may get in the way of our learning. For example, maybe you focus and learn better in the evening, but you’re in the habit of playing video games after dinner. Identify the habits that may make it harder for you to commit to your learning goals and try to change them.

(Shortform note: The authors don’t offer explicit advice for how to go about changing a habit or routine, but Charles Duhigg in _The Power of Habit_ explores why we form habits and how to change them. Duhigg argues that having self-discipline is not enough on its own to change a habit—you must understand how habits work and address what reinforces them. Habits become automatic through a cycle of cue, routine, and reward and are reinforced by our cravings. The anticipation of a reward is often more pleasurable than actually experiencing it, driving you to continue your habitual routines. To break unwanted habits, it's important to make cues less visible, routines more challenging, and rewards less satisfying.)

**Don’t isolate yourself.** Spend time with people interested in and passionate about what you’re learning. Learning with others makes it more enjoyable and fulfilling, which are powerful emotional motivators.**** Involving others in your learning also helps keep you accountable for your goals—it’s harder to procrastinate, forget, or avoid learning tasks if you have made a commitment to another person.

(Shortform note: While spending time with others who share your interests can be a great way to enhance your learning experience, there are potential drawbacks. For example, education experts warn that group learning can sometimes be distracting or unproductive, with conversations or discussions that are not directly relevant to the task at hand. Ultimately, it's important to balance the benefits and downsides of group learning to ensure that your learning goals and needs are always front and center.)

**Match the difficulty level of a task with your skill level**. Tasks that are too challenging will discourage you, and ones that are too easy will bore you. The feeling of mastering something—when your skill level matches the difficulty level of a task—is highly motivating. If a task is just beyond your level, don’t be shy to ask for help. The authors also recommend breaking up learning tasks into manageable chunks to allow yourself more time to absorb the information.

(Shortform note: Matching your skill level with the difficulty level of a task not only improves your motivation—Chris Bailey adds that it will also boost your ability to focus. This is because when you are bored or stressed by a learning task, your mind will naturally wander. Improving your motivation and focus together make matching skill level with task level a powerful learning tool.)

### How to Excel at Academic Learning

The authors offer tips and techniques for excelling at these key elements of academic learning, including how to actively engage with your materials as well as how to read, take notes, and memorize.

#### How to Learn Actively With Engaged Retrieval

The authors argue that**the best way to learn is to actively engage with the material** , as by doing so, you’ll absorb far more information than when you engage with materials more passively. This is because active learning helps build longer and stronger neural connections.

(Shortform note: A recent study has shown that AI technology can play a role in helping people learn actively. The researchers found that incorporating an AI-based virtual helper in the learning process can improve learning during hands-on activities. The virtual helper combines physical and virtual reality elements to create an immersive learning experience. They found that when the AI helper was turned on, it encouraged students to engage in critical thinking and discussions, resulting in more thorough learning. When the AI helper was turned off, the students learned far less.)

To actively engage with your materials, they recommend a technique called _engaged retrieval_ (they call it _active recall_). **To practice engaged retrieval, periodically look away from what you’re studying and try to remember what you just learned**. It can also be helpful to explain the ideas in your own words or teach them as if you were explaining them to a grade-schooler. You can use this technique with any kind of material, such as text, videos, or lectures.

**Engaged retrieval helps you internalize concepts**. The authors say that you haven't really learned if you can't retrieve something from your memory, and that when you pull information from your memory, you help solidify it in your long-term memory. Engaged retrieval can also give you real-time feedback on how well you're absorbing new information.

(Shortform: Scott Young uses a different term— _self-testing_ —to describe the process of engaged recall and agrees that it’s the best way to learn effectively as it cements information into your memory and provides you with feedback about how well you’ve learned the material. He outlines several methods to self-test as you’re learning, including using flashcards, creating quiz questions for yourself as you’re taking notes that you can try to answer later, and, as Oakley and Schewe also suggest, writing in your own words what you’ve learned after studying an idea.)

#### How to Read

Improving reading efficiency is not only about increasing speed. It’s about optimizing your comprehension—understanding what you read and remembering it later. Focusing solely on increasing your reading speed can easily _harm_ your comprehension.

(Shortform note: Scientific research supports the authors' claim that there’s a trade-off between speed and accuracy when it comes to reading. Doubling or tripling reading speed from the normal rate (around 250 words per minute to 500-750 words per minute) may not allow readers to comprehend the text as thoroughly as they would at a normal pace. However, speed reading or skimming could be helpful for readers who prioritize getting through the text quickly over understanding it completely. To increase reading speed while maintaining high comprehension, you should improve your language skills, such as by expanding your vocabulary because language skill is a key factor in reading quickly with high comprehension.)

To increase your reading efficiency and comprehension, the authors recommend the following:

**Preview the text before reading it in detail.** Getting a big-picture view of the text, its organization, and the overall themes will prepare your mind for what is coming and make it easy to comprehend.

**Read actively.** To read actively, practice engaged retrieval by asking yourself to restate key concepts as you read. Highlighting can also help you read actively, but only when you review what you’ve highlighted the next day—your brain doesn’t build neural connections in your long-term memory unless you review your highlights after some time has passed.

**Annotate.** Another active reading strategy is annotation. As you read, write down comments and questions that come to mind. In your own words, note key concepts and their relationships, and then, in the end, write a small summary of what you read. Annotating as you go makes reviewing and referring back to the text easier. It also helps transfer the information into your long-term memory for quality learning.

(Shortform note: The authors’ reading tips above are a part of the broader reading strategy outlined by Mortimer J. Adler and Charles Van Doren In _How to Read a Book_. Pre-reading your text before reading it closely is an important aspect of what Adler and Van Doren call the _inspectional reading stage_ —glancing through the book to get an overall understanding of what the book is about before trying to understand what the author is saying. Active reading techniques like restating key concepts as you read and writing down comments and questions are a part of the _analytical reading stage_ , where you dive deeper into the concepts of the book and word to understand the concepts as best you can.)

#### How to Take Notes

To get the most out of note-taking, use engaging ways to take them, organize them, review them, and use them as study tools. The authors outline the following strategies to make the most out of your notes.

**Take notes with _the dual-column method_.** Divide your note page into two parts with a vertical line down the center. Capture the key concepts on the right side and summarize them on the left using short phrases. When reviewing your notes, cover up the right side and try to recall the meaning from the summary words. This method helps you understand the structure of ideas and retain the information better.

**Use mind mapping to organize your notes.** Mind maps are visual representations of topics. A typical mind map starts with a central idea or concept and branches into related ideas connected with lines, colors, and images.

**Use engaged retrieval to review your notes**. Review your notes the same day you write them and again the next day. Practice with them using engaged retrieval strategies like flashcards. The authors assert that the process of reviewing your notes is more important than the process of note-taking itself.

(Shortform note: Many different note-taking strategies can help you capture ideas, organize them, and retain the information—for example, Jim Kwik in _Limitless _asserts that the first step in effective note-taking is to clarify what you’re interested in learning (or what you must learn) from the material you are studying. In other words, identify your goal in studying that specific material and then take notes based on that goal. Like Oakley and Schewe, Kwik also recommends reviewing your notes, and he suggests adding highlights and additional notes to the original ones to actively engage with them and spotlight key points.)

#### How to Memorize

To improve your memorization skills, practice engaged retrieval (as discussed above) and space out your session over several days. Additionally, **try memorization hacks such as acronyms and mnemonic devices.** You can also envision unusual, vivid, and compelling images to represent concepts and information, such as with the _memory palace_ technique _._ In this technique, you create a representative image for every idea you want to remember and then “place” those images in a particular space, like a building, in your imagination.

(In _Moonwalking with Einstein_ , Joshua Foer explains that our brains are wired to remember images and places better than numbers and words, which is why image-based methods like the memory palace work. Foer recommends that you make the images in your memory palace compelling by giving them multisensory, vulgar, funny, or absurd qualities. Our brains also remember new information when we connect it to things we already know, which is why mnemonic devices and acronyms work.)

#### How to Do Well on Tests

No matter how well you know a subject, your test scores will likely suffer if you don’t know how to take a test effectively. The authors offer the following tips.

**Before a test:** Understand the test format, the types of questions that will be asked, and how the test will be evaluated. For example, are some questions weighted more than others? Discuss any unclear aspects of the test with your instructor, and talk to peers to gain insights they may have. Create a study plan with a schedule, necessary study materials, and the time you’ll devote to each topic. Having a plan can reduce stress and help you focus on studying.

(Shortform note: In addition to the authors’ recommendations to get to know the exam you’re about to take, some psychology experts suggest you review your past exams in the course to help you identify areas of strength and weakness. They also recommend that your scheduled study plan, as well as necessary materials and a checklist of topics, include routine breaks for meals, exercise, relaxation, and socializing. This is because routine helps you stick to commitments.)

**During a test:** Read the instructions carefully and, on timed tests, keep track of your progress. Try to answer all the questions, even if you’re unsure of the answer, unless the test penalizes guessing. Use the _challenge-first method_ : **Start by scanning the questions, marking the hard ones, and working on them until you feel stuck**. Then, move on to easier problems, and return to the challenging problems later. While working on the easier problems, your brain will work in diffuse mode to sort out the harder problems in the background. Be mindful of your time—don't get fixated on difficult questions while neglecting easier ones that can also earn you points.

(Shortform note: Some education experts recommend the opposite of the challenge-first method—instead of starting with the difficult questions, answer all the easy questions first and then return to the hard ones later. They explain that the benefit of tackling the hard or easy questions first depends on whether you have a limited amount of time for the exam. If you have a time limit, it may benefit you to start with the easier questions first because it can help you build up your confidence and momentum, allowing you to move through the test more quickly.)
