## Exercise: Identify Your Goals, Engagements, and Interests

Forte explains that the foundation of an effective ESS is identifying what kind of information you want to save. To do this, determine which goals and projects you want to focus on currently, which engagements you want to commit to long-term, and which areas you’re interested in possibly pursuing through a future goal or project.

* * *

First, list three to five goals or projects you want to work on (or that you’re already working on). These will be your first subfolders in your _current goals_ folder. (Feel free to add more than five or less than three based on how many projects you feel comfortable taking on at once.)

Now, list at least five topics or activities that you’re interested in and want to engage with long-term. (For example, you might list topics you want to keep up-to-date with (like your finances) or regularly learn more about (like music theory).) These items will be subfolders in your _ongoing engagements_ folder.

Finally, compile a list of topics that you’re interested in but don’t want to commit to yet. (For example, you’re interested in material that answers the question “what’s the meaning of life,” but you don’t want to create a project or ongoing commitment to answer that question.) You can also have more casual topics here that you’ll only reference from time to time, such as “recipes” or “interesting books.” These will be subfolders in your _areas of interest_ folder.
