## Exercise: What’s Most Important to You and Your Business?

Musk values employees who work well together and control over his management and production process. Determine what is most important to you and your business so you can focus your energy there—not on things you don’t actually care about.

* * *

Consider your most important goals for yourself or your business. What are they? Musk’s goal for Tesla was to make luxury electric cars a viable option for consumers—perhaps your goal might be to produce twice as much online content than your current amount.

How might you achieve these goals? Determine the essential elements of achieving your goal. The essential elements of the aforementioned goal might include hiring another content producer to your team.

Are all of the elements you listed _actually_ essential? While advertising might traditionally be considered essential for cars, Tesla doesn’t advertise its products. Perhaps you could alter your content production process for efficiency rather than hiring another person to your payroll.
