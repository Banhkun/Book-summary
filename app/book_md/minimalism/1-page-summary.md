## 1-Page Summary

_Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life,_ by Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, recounts how the authors found happiness and a meaningful life after rejecting the “American dream” of wealth and success, and instead embracing minimalism.

Based on their experiences, they offer a formula for living a meaningful life by eliminating extraneous possessions and entanglements, and instead focusing on living by a specific set of personal values.

**Minimalism is a tool to eliminate clutter in your life and focus on essentials.**

### The Authors’ Path to Minimalism

Both men, who were boyhood friends, achieved success by conventional standards in their twenties — they worked 70-hour weeks and were star salesmen for their company, winning praise, awards, and promotions. But they didn’t feel fulfilled and so, following the dictates of consumer culture, they sought happiness by buying things — big houses, fancy cars, clothes, furniture, and the latest electronics. This left them feeling just as empty and depressed as before, with the added burden of a mountain of debt.

They knew something had to change, and undertook an intense re-examination of their lives. They systematically examined their lives to figure out why they were unhappy, and what needed to change.

First, they identified dozens of **“anchors” — things or situations that made them feel stuck**. Next, they prioritized by categorizing their anchors as major or minor. Major anchors were mortgages, certain relationships, car payments, major debts, and their careers. Minor anchors included cable and internet bills, smaller debts, and unneeded possessions.

They **got rid of as many anchors as possible** , starting with their debts, which ran into the six-figure range. They cut spending on trips, expensive dinners, and vacations, and traded in their expensive cars and houses for cheaper ones. They also sorted through and sold unneeded possessions. They used the savings to pay off their debts over two years.

After clearing the clutter in their lives, they focused on “Five Values” that they determined were necessary for a meaningful life: health, relationships, passions, growth, and contributing to others.

### Five Values to Focus On

The rest of the book explores why these five areas are key, and recounts how the authors transformed their lives over time by making small daily improvements in each of these areas.

Based on their experiences, they recommend:

  * **Health** : Eat a healthy diet (avoid processed foods and sugar), and exercise daily (choose exercises you enjoy so you’ll stick with them). To enjoy life, you need to maintain your best possible level of health (levels will vary among individuals).
  * **Relationships** : Inventory your relationships — get rid of unproductive relationships and focus on the most important ones going forward. 
  * **Passions** : Reject your career identity and status, and discover and pursue your passions. Find a mission that aligns with your passions.
  * **Growth** : Keep growing by making small changes daily that add up to substantial growth over time. Raise the bar each day so you don’t plateau.
  * **Contributing to others** : A totally self-serving life is an empty life. When you contribute to society in ways that help others grow, you experience great satisfaction, and you’ll grow too.



The full summary contains many more details on how to execute their recommendations for each area.

In summary, possessions, money, and success don't make you happy, or give you a meaningful life. **The key is to live intentionally, by focusing on the important things, and happiness will be a byproduct.**
