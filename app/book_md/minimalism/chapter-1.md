## Chapter 1: Striving (Unsuccessfully) for Happiness

Society tells us that working hard, climbing the corporate ladder, acquiring material things like a big house and fancy car, and taking expensive vacations is the American dream, and will make you happy.

Co-authors Joshua and Ryan achieved those things. In 2009, they both worked for a telecommunications corporation and attained the career successes and lavish lifestyle that many aspire to.

But they weren’t happy, fulfilled, or content — in fact, **they felt empty and depressed**. Together they examined their lives (they were longtime friends) to determine what was missing and how to achieve happiness and meaning.

### Seeds of Discontent

Their problems didn’t develop overnight but started with unhappy childhoods.

Joshua and Ryan, who knew each other as kids, both grew up in dysfunctional households. Their parents divorced, and their mothers suffered substance abuse issues.

At age 12, they were both overweight, unhappy misfits. They tried unsuccessfully to escape through the instant gratification of overeating but it made things worse.

As they talked and compared their lives to others’, they concluded that poverty was the reason for their unhappiness — therefore they’d be happy if they made money as adults (they set a goal of a $50,000 annual salary) and could afford whatever material things they wanted.

#### Ryan’s Story

Ryan eventually moved in with his father, who had a stable job as the owner of a wallpaper company. Ryan’s father was a devout Jehovah’s Witness who genuinely cared for his son, but the change was too big and unsettling for Ryan and he rebelled, using alcohol and drugs.

After graduating from high school, Ryan joined his father’s company. He made enough money to meet his basic needs, but not enough to afford the luxuries he thought he needed to be happy. So he searched for contentment in other ways.

He sought happiness through his father’s religion. He married and became a devout Jehovah’s Witness. He and his wife bought a house and planned to start a family, but the couple didn’t get along and the marriage ended badly. Ryan turned again to drugs and alcohol.

Because he was dissatisfied with the money he was making, he eventually went to work for the same telecommunication company Joshua worked for. He worked hard, excelled, and earned promotions.

#### Joshua’s Story

As a result of the disorder in his home life, Joshua developed OCD—he started obsessing over small things and losing weight.

After graduating from high school, he got a sales job with a telecommunications corporation. He realized his job had long-term growth possibilities, so he worked hard, taking little time off; he became a top salesman.

He got married, built a large house, and continued to work harder and longer. But he neglected his relationship and didn’t spend much time at home because he was always working. Because he still felt unfulfilled he bought things in order to achieve temporary highs.

He remained unhappy and his health suffered — so he worked harder and bought more stuff. Though unhappy, he took solace in the fact that at least he was making money, and his career gave him an identity.

#### Common Themes

A number of common threads ran through Joshua’s and Ryan’s lives. Both of them **sought money and social status from their jobs**. They worked obsessively and earned praise, promotions, and big raises.

But these provided only momentary satisfaction. They sought happiness by constantly striving for more of these rewards, achieving more to improve their feelings of self-worth and significance. Like a drug-induced high, the more affirmation they received, the more they needed it to function and feel happy.

Meanwhile, their ever-increasing job responsibilities brought stress, worry, and depression.

They knew something needed to change, but weren’t sure what. So like many Americans, **they continued trying to buy happiness through acquiring possessions**. They went into debt purchasing luxury cars, big houses with expensive furnishings, and taking expensive vacations.

But again, they achieved only temporary highs, and **ended up feeling depressed and empty — with the addition of a mountain of debt.**

#### Their Conclusions

Eventually, both men realized that:

  * Status and material possessions didn’t bring the lasting happiness they had expected.
  * Their work was making them feel increasingly pressured and unhappy. Their earlier dream of climbing the corporate ladder began losing its appeal when they realized it would only bring more pressure.
  * **They were earning great money at jobs they came to dislike** , and they were depleted financially and emotionally.



### Taking Inventory of Life

They decided to take an inventory of their lives to find out what was making them unhappy, and what they needed to change so they could experience happiness and freedom.

#### Discovering Your Anchors

**First, they identified their anchors** — the things or situations making feel stuck. Over the course of a week, each of them wrote down anything he thought might be an anchor. Joshua listed 83 items and Ryan, 54.

**Next, they identified their priorities.** They started prioritizing by classifying their anchors as either major or minor.

**Major anchors were the obvious things keeping them from feeling free:** mortgages, car payments, large bills and debts, their careers, and particular relationships — things that demanded attention without returning comparable value.

**Minor anchors made up the majority of their lists**. They included cable and internet bills, smaller bills and debts, unused clothing and household items, and general clutter. These required small amounts of attention individually, but it added up.

They decided that **getting rid of as many anchors as possible would let them reclaim time,** which could be used in more meaningful ways.

**They started with major anchors**. For example, Joshua started with debts, which ran into the six-figure range. He took side jobs and made extra payments toward debts. He cut trips, expensive dinners, and vacations to pay off his car and credit card debt. Over two years, they both paid off their cars and paid down debts.

They addressed other anchors as well. They got rid of many possessions, keeping only the things they liked and used. Selling things they didn’t use generated money that went toward debt reduction.

#### Letting Go of Emotional Anchors

As Joshua reevaluated his life and identified anchors, his mother died, leaving him with her 64 years’ worth of possessions to sort out. He couldn’t part with them emotionally because they represented a relationship important to him — so he started putting her things into storage.

In the process of handling his mothers’ stuff, Joshua had an epiphany: **He didn’t need a storage locker full of stuff to preserve his memories of their relationship.**

The turning point was finding boxes of his old school work under her bed. She clearly hadn’t accessed the boxes in many years, but she had kept them in order to hold onto the memories of her son as a child. In the same way, **Joshua had been trying to hold onto his mother by keeping her things.**

However, just as she had remembered him and his childhood without ever opening the boxes of school work, he didn’t need a storage locker full of stuff to remember her. Once he realized he could hold onto his memories of her without holding onto all her stuff, he donated it to people who could use it.

His key takeaways were:

  * **Sentimental items aren’t necessarily a problem**. But they can become anchors when they get entangled in your emotions, almost without your realizing it. If you want to get rid of an item but you’re hesitating for sentimental reasons only — then it’s weighing on you and it may be time to get rid of it. That doesn’t mean you need to get rid of everything though.
  * **Possessions become anchors when you over-identify with them**. When you realize you are not your stuff and your memories are separate from your possessions, you can let go and free yourself from their hold on you.



Josuha and Ryan learned more about how material possessions get in the way of personal growth when they discovered minimalism and how it could be a tool for creating a meaningful life.

### Understanding Minimalism

While working on getting rid of their anchors, Joshua and Ryan started searching for others who had experienced the same process.

Through several people’s blogs, they discovered the concept of **minimalism, which is a philosophy and practice of freeing yourself from the things that weigh you down, so you can live a meaningful life.**

Minimalism is a simple concept, yet it can be misunderstood.

#### What Minimalism Is

  * Minimalism is a tool to help you get rid of excess and focus on the essentials in your life.
  * It is a lifestyle choice that means different things to different people.
  * Minimalists search for happiness through life experiences, not through possessions. 
  * Minimalism helps you get past the material things cluttering your life, so you can focus on the most important things — which aren’t things, but rather values.
  * It’s liberating: Minimalism frees you from feeling overwhelmed, and from depression, emptiness, and exhaustion.



#### What Minimalism Isn’t

  * Contrary to many people’s impressions, minimalism doesn’t demand a lifestyle of sacrifice and deprivation. A minimalist can still own a car and a house, and have children and a career. It’s about what you need.
  * It isn’t “one size fits all:” Minimalism looks different for each individual because it’s about finding and focusing on what is essential to you.
  * It isn’t rules-based: There are no rules. Minimalism is about eliminating the unnecessary things in your life, which will vary from person to person.



#### How Minimalism Helped

For Joshua and Ryan, getting rid of excess stuff allowed them to:

  * Reclaim time that had been spent maintaining their stuff.
  * Reduce stress and enjoy life more.
  * Live in the moment.
  * Pursue their passions and discover a mission.
  * Discover meaning and happiness



For the authors, minimalism got them started on the path toward a more meaningful life.

Joshua and Ryan had already realized that possessions and success don't make you happy. They embraced minimalism and simplicity as a way of freeing themselves to focus on living meaningfully rather than trying to find happiness in possessions.

**When you live deliberately, focusing on the important things, happiness is a byproduct.**

They created a website (TheMinimalists.com) to share their experiences and insights, and ultimately left their corporate jobs to focus full time on writing essays and books, and continuing to research and experiment with minimalism.

### Introducing the Five Values

After getting rid of the things they didn’t need, Joshua and Ryan could focus on changing their lives in other ways. Based on their experiences, they identified **Five Values for living a meaningful life: health, relationships, passions, growth, and contributing to others.**

The Five Values are the areas in which they experienced the greatest success and satisfaction from making improvements.

The rest of the book explores why these fives areas are key, and recounts how they changed in these areas. The final chapter ties together the values and raises questions for readers to consider.

Besides thinking, taking notes, and making lists based on the questions in the book, they stress that it’s important to take small steps each day, that over time, will radically improve your life.
