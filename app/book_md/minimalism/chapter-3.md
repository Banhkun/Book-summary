## Chapter 3: Relationships

Relationships are the second of the Five Values because without successful relationships (someone to share your life with), you can’t live a meaningful life.

**Your relationships are the people around you with whom you have frequent contact** : spouses, lovers, friends, roommates, coworkers, acquaintances, and anyone else you interact with regularly.

Extroverts need the love and attention of many relationships, while introverts seek fewer relationships. People have different needs and preferences but we all need at least some personal relationships. And we have to tend them or they won’t thrive.

There are **three ways to have stronger relationships** :

  1. Seek out valuable new relationships
  2. Improve your current relationships
  3. Change yourself



Examining your personal relationships, past and present, is the first step.

### Past Relationships

**You can learn from past relationships, good or bad** , and apply the lessons to improve current and future relationships.

Often we obsess over past relationships, particularly those that went wrong. However this doesn’t get you anywhere. Living in the past is like trying to use your rearview mirror to drive — you won’t see where you’re going and you’ll crash.

Fortunately, however, past problematic relationships aren’t necessarily indicative of future relationships. You can create better new relationships by analyzing (not obsessing over) past relationships.

The good times can tell you what worked and give you a strategy for the future, while bad times tell you what went wrong, and suggest how to avoid the same problems in the future.

### Current Relationships

Next, consider your current relationships. Overall, do they make you happy? Are your relationships positive, supportive, and helpful?

Here’s an exercise to help you answer these questions, and evaluate your current relationships. Make a list of every relationship — include every person with whom you interact regularly — in which you’re currently involved. Add two more columns and fill it them in as follows:

  * **Name** : Put names in the first column: family, close friends, significant others, coworkers, bosses, teachers, for example. 
  * **Category** : In the second column, categorize each as a primary, secondary, or peripheral relationship.
    * Primary relationships are your closest relationships (closest family, closest friends). They’re the main characters in your life story.
    * Secondary relationships are similar to the primary ones, except they are of less value for various reasons. They may include close friends, boss, a few coworkers, and extended family members. They’re your supporting cast.
    * Peripheral: The majority of people in your life fall into this category, the periphery. They include most coworkers, neighbors, members of your community, acquaintances, distant family. They’re minor characters, and occasionally extras, in your life.
  * **Effect** : In the third column, indicate the effect of each relationship on your life: positive, negative, or neutral.
    * Positive relationships make you happy and help you grow
    * Negative relationships make you unhappy, frustrated, or dissatisfied. They can stymie your personal growth.
    * Neutral relationships fall somewhere in the middle.



Important points: **Many close primary relationships can be neutral or negative**. The fact that someone is close to you doesn’t mean it’s a positive relationship. Some of your most negative relationships are in your top two tiers. As for the peripheral category, many of these relationships are neutral but some might be positive.

#### Understanding Your Current Relationships

Look at your list and consider:

  * How many relationships do you have?
  * How many are there in each tier?
  * What percentage are positive, negative, neutral?



Although your primary and secondary relationships are your most important, the **people in your peripheral category (those less significant to you) probably get most of your attention** because they’re often part of your daily life.

What do you do about this? First, you may want some of your peripheral category to play a larger role in your life (move to your primary or secondary levels). If so, think about how you could strengthen those relationships.

As for those remaining in your peripheral group, even though you may like them, you need to devote less time to them and more to your primary and secondary relationships. This might mean saying no more often to casual gatherings or commitments that you’re on the fence about attending anyway.

Similarly, you may have primary or secondary relationships that you want to de-emphasize, especially if they’re negative. Rethink what role these people should play in your life.

Your relationships don’t stay the same throughout your life. People come and go, and their significance to you changes as both of you grow. People important to you a decade ago may be less so today.

**You must actively choose your relationships** , which requires difficult decisions.

#### Focusing on the Most Important Relationships

The rest of this chapter focuses on your primary relationships (current and future). They are the people you love, the ones for whom you would do anything. These relationships typically include:

  * **Intimate relationships** : spouse or significant other. This is your most important relationship and should be treated that way. 
  * **Closest friends** : your best friends, usually fewer than five people.
  * **Immediate family** : parents, children, and other close family members.



Secondary relationships are also important but should get your attention only after fulfilling your commitments to your primary relationships, which are your top priority.

#### Changing Relationships

We all change over time. The fact that someone has changed doesn’t mean they don’t care about you — just that they’ve changed.

People evolve, separately or together. **You can’t expect a person to stay the same or to change the way you want them too.** They’re not obligated to meet your standards.

**Changing yourself, however, can lead to more positive relationships.** For example, if you improve your diet and start exercising, people around you may follow suit. You can bring out the best in other people.

That said, occasionally you may have to end a relationship if someone’s beliefs and values change in a way that you can’t tolerate (for instance, they express racial prejudices you strongly disagree with). Terminating or changing the terms of your relationships is part of managing them.

Sometimes relationships just don’t work, or they stop working. Problematic relationships may include intimate relationships, close friendships, employee-boss relationships, and family relationships.

**You can try repairing a valued relationship, but know that you can usually step away.** For instance, when Joshua and his wife began having difficulties getting along with each other. They both worked to improve their relationship, including going to counseling, but in the end it didn’t work and they eventually divorced. You don’t have to stay in a negative relationship — in fact it’s not healthy to do so.

#### Growing Your Relationships

The best relationships continue to grow. But if you want them flourish, like a gardener you must apply attention, time, and effort.

More specifically, for a relationship to grow and improve, you must cultivate eight attributes: love, trust, honesty, caring, support, attentiveness, authenticity, and understanding.

  * **Love:** The people you love are those for whom you’d do anything. You and those you love go to great lengths for each other. You also work to understand what your loved ones need, and they do the same for you. Doing these things strengthens your primary relationships.
  * **Trust:** When you trust someone completely, you’re open with them. Trust inspires more trust, and both parties develop a habit of honesty. 
  * **Honesty:** Sometimes it seems easier to lie, but no matter what lying is wrong and torpedoes your relationships. Being honest is not only the right thing to do, it’s simpler in the long run than maintaining a falsehood. A relationship not built on honesty won’t last.
  * **Caring:** Caring is the ultimate way to contribute meaningfully to your relationship. You show you care for someone through your actions. We value someone who cares about us and we should reciprocate. 
  * **Support:** The strongest relationships are mutually supportive. You’re excited and happy when your significant other is happy, and they’re happy when you’re happy. You both support each other’s growth and endeavors.
  * **Attentiveness:** You need to “be present” in your primary relationships. This means that when you’re interacting with someone, you should be giving them your undivided attention (not texting or looking at your phone while talking with them). Your full attention is a powerful thing to give someone.
  * **Authenticity:** Authentic people feel real and genuine to you. You feel safe around them, because they don’t put up a false front. When you get to know them beneath the surface, they turn out to be the person you thought they were. (We all have the capacity to be authentic, to remove all pretense and just be ourselves rather than who we think we’re supposed to be.)
  * **Understanding:** The final element of great relationships is the most complicated because it’s difficult to truly understand others.



Here are four behaviors for deepening your understanding (and avoiding misunderstandings), with the acronym TARA: tolerance, acceptance, respect, and appreciation. They’ll help you strengthen any important relationship, not just intimate relationships.

  * **Tolerance** : If someone’s behavior bothers you, avoid a knee-jerk reaction and instead be tolerant because you love them. For example, if you’re a minimalist but your partner is a collector, understand that you both have your reasons for what you do. Although you may not understand their obsession, you’ll be closer to understanding the person.
  * **Acceptance** : The next step is to move from tolerance toward acceptance. Their quirks and differences are part of who they are. While you may not share them, you still love the person.
  * **Respect** : Accepting someone’s idiosyncrasies is difficult. But you need to go even further and respect that person _because_ of their idiosyncrasies. Your beliefs may seem equally frivolous to someone else, but though they disagree with you, you still want their respect. You should extend the same respect. Sharing your life with someone you respect is more important than having an uncluttered home.
  * **Appreciation** : Honestly appreciate the other person’s desires, values, and beliefs. You want the other person to be happy, and if their collection brings them happiness, you should appreciate it because happiness is contagious. We reach understanding when we appreciate others for who they are.



Occasionally TARA isn’t the right approach. If someone engages in harmful behavior (drugs, crime, racism), you can’t accept their conduct and need to walk away.

More often, however, practicing these four behaviors deepens your understanding and therefore your relationship. You understand what drives the other person, what they want and need, and what makes them happy. With this understanding you can meet their needs and they can meet yours.

#### Making Passionate Relationships Work

**You need both differences and commonalities to make passionate or intimate relationships work.**

Sometimes two people enter into a relationship based solely on chemistry — they’re attracted to someone because they’re different. But chemistry alone isn’t sustainable — **over time too many differences can become a problem.** This is especially true of differences in values, beliefs, and individual needs — these can destroy a relationship in the long run.

At the same time, having too much in common becomes boring.**A relationship can fall apart when two people become extensions of each other** , instead of maintaining separate identities.

To be sustainable, passionate relationships must achieve balance by embracing commonalities and respecting each other’s differences.

### Future Relationships

Without a vision for your relationships, especially primary relationships, you’ll accept whatever is in front of you. **You need a vision of what you want your relationships to be**.

Consider three things when seeking new relationships or improving current ones:

  * **What do you want?** Write down everything you want from your primary relationships. What desires, beliefs, values, and interests must they have? 
  * **What are your deal-breakers?** Make a list of things you won’t tolerate in your relationships. You can find everything you want in a person, but if they also have a belief or value that you don’t want in your life, it can ruin the relationship. For instance, if your intimate partner isn’t supportive and that is a key value for you, the relationship won’t work.
  * **How must you change to attract this kind of person?** Do you need to get into better shape, learn to listen more, or get rid of bad habits? Write down what you must change to attract the relationships you want.



Once you’ve answered these questions, read this list daily to reinforce what you’re seeking in a relationship, what you want to avoid, and how you must change.
