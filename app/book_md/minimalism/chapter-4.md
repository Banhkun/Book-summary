## Chapter 4: Passions

You won’t feel fulfilled if your life lacks passion. This is often the root cause of the empty feeling many people experience. But there are things that get in the way of discovering and pursuing your passions — starting with your work.

### Work vs. Passions

How do you characterize your work? Typically people call it a job, career, or mission. A job is a daily grind, while a mission is something you feel passionate about. A career can be either or both.

Work that’s a daily grind impedes your happiness and ability to live a meaningful life.

If you’re like most people, you have a job you aren’t passionate about. We’re taught from an early age that that’s the nature of work; it’s about simply making a living, which we have a responsibility to do.

We’re taught to work hard in high school and college, doing stuff we don’t care about, so we’ll find a “good job” with reliable pay and benefits, so we can go into debt purchasing a house, car, consumer goods, etc. This process is touted as the American dream.

We’re to keep our nose to the grindstone, so one day we can retire and enjoy our lives for a few years before dying (the average lifespan of a retiree is often only three years after retirement). For 40 years or so, we trade our most precious commodity (our time) for a paycheck.

It’s true that we all need money to live — for shelter, food, clothing, medical care, etc. But beyond that, attaining the American dream won’t make you happy. For many, pursuing it saps joy and meaning from life.

#### The Truth About A Career

Many people expect a career to be more fulfilling than a job. They believe it’s the ticket to a meaningful life.

However, having a career often sidetracks you from that goal. The reason is that **people invest in their careers to the point of assuming an identity and social status based on their job title**.

Our cultural norms aid and abet this tendency. One of the first things people ask when getting acquainted is, “What do you do?” This seems innocuous, but the implied question is, “What do you do for a living?” — and you know you’ll be judged (assigned a social status) based on your occupation.

**Once you believe your career is who you are, it’s difficult to give up that identity even if you come to hate your career.**

(A better way to answer the “what do you do” question is to reply with what you’re passionate about. For instance, “I’m passionate about cooking; what are you passionate about?” It leads to more interesting conversations than the typical answer along the lines of “I’m a director of operations.”)

The truth is, you’re far more than your career; you have passions that you can pursue for a meaningful life.

#### From Career to Passion

Josuha and Ryan had conventionally successful corporate careers, but eventually they felt stressed and unhappy instead of fulfilled. So they worked harder and turned to consumerism — they bought stuff in an effort to purchase happiness. Eventually they realized this wasn’t the path to happiness — they needed to cut the excess in their lives and pursue their passions.

To discover their passions, they had to remove the many anchors holding them back, including the status/identity of their careers, and their lavish lifestyles and debt.

In creating and operating their website, TheMinimalists.com, they pursued their passions and turned them into their mission. Joshua’s passion is writing, while Ryan’s is mentoring others.

**Sometimes people stumble into a line of work that brings them great satisfaction.** They feel they’re being paid to do what they love and they refer to their work as their mission. **But they’re exceptions.**

If you don’t feel grateful and passionate about your work, then you probably haven’t found your mission. The rest of this chapter is intended to help you identify, then cultivate your passions, and pursue them as your mission.

You can be passionate about almost anything (and you can have multiple passions) — as a result, any line of work can be your mission.

Some people know what they’re passionate about, but may not be pursuing it as their full-time mission. Others don’t know what they’re passionate about, or what their mission is.

Regardless of where you fall, this chapter will help you identify the anchors keeping you from discovering and cultivating your passions.

#### Passion Fuels More Passion

Two things characterize passionate people:

  * They know what they are _most_ passionate about (people have multiple passions) and also _what else_ they are passionate about: what gets them into a peak state, and what gets them excited and energized. 
  * They turn to their passions when feeling uninspired because passion fuels more passion. When they don’t feel like starting a new project, they focus on the aspects that get them excited. For example, the authors found that some parts of writing a book are boring, but they worked through the boring stuff by keeping an eye on the end result (what the book would mean to others), which they were passionate about. 



Using what you’re passionate about to keep you focused and spark more passion is part of discovering your mission. But first you must discover what you’re passionate about by removing your anchors.

### Anchors Blocking Your Passions

**It can be difficult to find your passions because you tend to get stuck in the daily grind** , held back by four main anchors: identity, status, certainty, and money

#### The Anchor of Identity

Your occupation is an anchor holding you back when you believe it defines who you are as a person.

**When your job or career becomes your identity, it’s difficult to do anything else**. That’s why many people stay in the same industry when they change jobs. It’s hard to realize you are much more than your vocation and/or your stuff.

Joshua and Ryan worked to come up with more meaningful identities than their corporate titles. They had to publicly identify themselves with new labels, such as mentor, leader, contributor, and minimalist. These identities are transferable to whatever they do, unlike their career identities.

Once you remove the anchor of identity, you can remove other anchors.

#### The Anchor of Status

As people climb the corporate ladder, get more tenure, and become more comfortable in their careers, a feeling of status becomes part of their career identity.

**A perceived loss of status makes people feel ashamed, useless, or depressed** **when they lose their job**. They feel insignificant without it.

People associate their job with status because it’s something they have some control over. If you work hard, you’re rewarded with awards, praise, perceived power, promotion. Society programs us to want instant results, and puts more emphasis on career and money than status of any other kind.

However, the most important things in life (health, relationships, passion) are more difficult to control and don’t provide instant gratification. They don’t confer status.

For example, stay-at-home dads don’t get much respect — they might be deemed lazy — because they aren’t making a lot of money or advancing a career.

Joshua and Ryan **removed the anchor of status by placing less value on what people thought about their jobs, and also by showing people why their new identities were more important**.

With a more positive idea of status, you can embrace more variety in your life, and give up some of the certainty (comfort in the familiar) that’s weighing you down.

#### The Anchor of Certainty

Everyone needs some level of certainty. For instance, you must be certain your ceiling isn’t going to collapse while you sleep, or that an approaching car won’t run over you.

But aside from our basic needs for safety, the level of certainty people need varies from person to person. For instance, a race car driver needs less certainty than the average person. But we all need to be able to step outside our comfort zones — and remove the anchor of certainty.

Certainty feels comfortable but can be the reason you don’t make changes you want to make.

**You don’t want to trade your comfort today for something that could be less comfortable tomorrow.**

There are two ways to motivate yourself to change.

  * **Find a way to associate more pain with _not_ changing.** Consider the potential loss of not pursuing your passion. In the end, the long-term pain of regret outweighs the short-term comfort of certainty. 
  * Associate more pleasure with the long-term fulfillment of pursuing your passions.



In practice it works differently for different people. Joshua quit his corporate job without having a plan. The pain of not pursuing his passions wasn’t worth the certainty his career provided. However, Ryan eased out of his job more slowly, associating increased pleasure with pursuing his passions.

#### The Anchor of Money

Money is another layer of certainty. It has a powerful hold on many people. **Money is often the reason people keep doing something they hate** (Gotta pay the bills!). But while you need to make a living, you can do it while pursuing your passion.

Money problems inject anxiety into our daily lives, and keep us in discontent. We never seem to have enough money; we live from paycheck to paycheck, and can’t get ahead.

**The best way to remove the anchor of money is to give it less importance in your life**. The authors did this by developing a five-step plan to regain control of their finances.

Taking control of your financial life involves more than increasing your income. It requires:

  * Making good decisions with the resources you have.
  * Changing your financial habits.
  * Living deliberately.



This isn’t easy, especially in our instant gratification culture, but it can be done with five steps.

##### Step 1: Budget

Most of us don’t know where our money is going, though we may _think_ we know. This is especially true in a marriage, where it can be hard to keep track of what the other person is spending.

The first step toward financial freedom is establishing a written monthly budget, following a few guidelines:

  * **Create categories** : Identify what’s truly necessary by identifying all your monthly expenses based on the past six months. 
    * Divide them into three categories: Need, want, like.
    * Write down every expense: food, housing, cars, insurance, gas, utilities, pets, clothes, phones, internet, entertainment. Check the list with your significant other or friend. 
    * Then use the need, want, like categories to prioritize and cut where you can. The stricter you are the sooner you’ll be free. 
  * **Set boundaries** : Assign every dollar at the beginning of the month. You won’t worry about what you can and can’t buy because money that wasn’t assigned to something at the beginning of the month can’t be spent.
  * **Work as a team** : Everyone in the household including children must have a say in the written budget, so you get everyone’s buy-in. You can take from one category to fund another if everyone agrees. With everyone on board, it’s much easier to control your finances.
  * **Adjust as needed** : You’ll have some slip-ups along the way; it’s part of the process. At first, check the budget daily, then weekly, and adjust as necessary until everyone is comfortable with the allocations. The first month will be the hardest, but soon you’ll be surprised at how much money you used to waste.
  * **Create an emergency fund** : Create a savings account for emergencies ($500 to $1,000 to start with). Don’t use it unless there is a true emergency (car repairs, medical bills, job loss, etc.) This fund will allow you to stay within budget when something unexpected happens. It should eventually cover several months of income.



##### Step 2: Pay Yourself (Invest)

To make investing seem less complicated, think of it as paying your future self.

It’s easy with today’s online tools. Joshua uses a simple online investment tool (Betterment.com) as his personal savings, planning, and investing software. Using the tool, he puts money into four buckets: emergency fund, retirement fund (traditional IRA), house-buying fund, and wealth-building fund (additional retirement funds beyond the maximum IRA contribution).

**Now is the best time to start planning for your future**. Even if you don’t have money to invest, create a plan to begin investing in your future self. The best way is to automate the investments, whether you invest 1% of your income or just $20 a month to start.

##### Step 3: Debt-Free

Contrary to what you might hear, **there’s no such thing as “good debt.”** Some debt is worse than other debt, but it’s never “good.”

**You won’t feel free until you’re debt-free**. Besides, it feels great to have no car payments, credit card or student loan payments.

Throughout their twenties Joshua and Ryan ran up debt of more than six figures each. It felt debilitating. Dave Ramsey’s book, _Total Money Makeover_ , provided steps they used to create a detailed financial plan, cut up their credit cards and pay their debts.

(Shortform note: Dave Ramsey’s seven “Total Money Makeover” steps are: Create a beginner emergency fund, pay off debts, save three to six months of expenses in a fully funded emergency fund, invest 15% of your income for retirement, save for your children’s college, pay off your home, build wealth and give.)

##### Step 4: Minimize

**Minimalism is a key component for achieving financial freedom**. By clearing clutter from their lives, Joshua and Ryan were able to focus on eliminating debt, changing habits, and making better decisions with fewer resources.

By simplifying — identifying which possessions weren’t adding value to their lives — they were able to sell unneeded items and put the money toward debt.

Minimalism doesn’t mean deprivation, but sometimes **it’s helpful to temporarily deprive yourself of short-term satisfactions** while trying to move in a better direction.

For example, Joshua sold his oversized house and moved into a small apartment. Ryan sold his fancy new car and bought an older vehicle without a monthly payment. They dropped cable, satellite radio, and other luxuries. They also picked up side jobs to pay off their debt faster. And they sold many items including electronics, furniture, and clothes for extra cash.

Now, everything they own serves a purpose or brings joy, and they don’t miss the old stuff.

##### Step 5: Contribute

Helping people who are less fortunate than you are can help you appreciate what you have and gain perspective.

Get started by doing an internet search for volunteer opportunities in your area.

If you contribute even in a small way to someone’s life, you’ll realize your financial problems are small compared to the problems many others struggle with. You’ll feel empowered to take action to eliminate your own relatively minor problems.

##### Achieving Financial Freedom

The five steps to financial freedom work for anyone, regardless of your family situation or how much/how little you make.

In a short time — two or three years — you can transform your life. It takes a plan, determination (turning your shoulds into musts) and continued progress in the new direction.

**Financial freedom doesn’t come from income level, but from decisions we make with the resources we have**.

### Finding Your Passions

Once you’ve removed your anchors, you can focus on finding your passions.

First, **consider what you’d do with your life if money weren’t an object**. If you don’t know, you’re likely still being held back by some of the four anchors.

**Maybe you’re afraid of what people will say if you pursue what you really want.** Joshua never told people he wanted to be a writer for fear of what they might think.

Maybe you’re worried that you won’t make enough money to live on, or you’ll feel insignificant. You have to get past these fears to find your passion.

Here are some additional questions to help you identify your passions:

  * When was the last time you felt true excitement. What are five other experiences like this?
  * Why were you excited each of those times?
  * Which experience excited you for the longest time?
  * Was there a common thread among your most exciting experiences?



Once you know what excitement looks and feels like, you can answer the question of what you’d do if you could do anything. The answer is: things that excite me.**Think about the thing that excited you the most — that is probably your passion.**

What would you love to do each day? What would you be obsessed by? Where do love and obsession overlap? That’s your passion.

The next step is to figure out how to turn your passion into your mission.

### Turning Your Passion into Your Mission

You may think, “No one is going to pay me to do X.” But in fact, someone is earning a living doing the thing you’re passionate about.

There are likely thousands of people who pursued (your) passion with determination until it became their mission. You can learn from those people.

**To turn your passion into your mission, emulate someone who is already doing it.** The authors followed the examples and advice of other minimalist bloggers to become successful at it themselves. Find at least three people making a living doing what you’re passionate about. Learn from them, and then take action.

Of course, it isn’t easy. It takes action to remove your anchors, and reject social messages so you can live a meaningful life. But it’s worth it to pursue your passions and live your mission.
