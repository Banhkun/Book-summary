## Chapter 2: Health

Health is the first of the Five Values because **living a healthy lifestyle puts you in the best position to enjoy and improve your life.**

Few people have perfect health. Health is a continuum, and each of us falls in a different place. It’s not constructive to compare our health with others’. To be happy, **we must be as healthy as we can be, given our circumstances**.

For example, Joshua broke his back while playing basketball in school. The injury limits his flexibility, but he still strives to be as healthy as he can be given his constraints. There are many examples of people living meaningful lives with diseases, disabilities, and other problems — because they live as healthfully as they can based on their individual situations.

When we talk about health we’re not talking about competing with others, building impressive muscles, or bragging about our stats. Those are destinations. But **health isn’t a destination, it’s a vehicle to take us where we want to go**.

To enjoy life, we need to take care of the vehicle we have, which may include getting rid of harmful habits, getting regular exercise and check-ups, maintaining a good diet, getting adequate sleep, and reducing stress through daily meditation.

Although some people adopt diets and exercise in order to _look_ better, **the point of improving your health is to _feel_ better** — if you feel better, you’ll enjoy every other aspect of your life more. Of course, when you start living a healthier lifestyle you start looking better, which is a bonus but, again, not the main objective.

**The keys to a healthy life are eating and exercising** — controlling what we put into our bodies, and what we do with them. While this sounds simplistic, these are the two things that affect our health the most, yet people often ignore them.

### What You Put into Your Body

The term “diet” is typically used to mean a temporary change in what you eat to achieve a specific weight-loss goal. A temporary diet almost always fails when you resume your pre-diet behavior.

However, this book uses the term diet to refer to a dietary lifestyle. **A change in dietary lifestyle is a change not only in what you eat, but in how you think about what you eat**. A lifestyle change is long term rather than temporary, and it can’t fail, unless you reject the lifestyle.

**There isn’t a single, ideal dietary model to follow to live a healthier life**. This can be frustrating because it’s easier to be told what to eat, and to have a set of clear guidelines to follow.

It’s also important to note that what you put into your body encompasses more than just food. It includes medicine, or anything you ingest, as well as anything that enters your body in any other way (for example, through the skin).

Remember: The goal isn’t to lose weight or to look better; it’s to live a healthier life and feel better.

#### Developing Daily Food Habits

Major dietary changes usually fail because people find them overwhelming and too hard to maintain.

To avoid this, try changing your diet for just 10 days at a time. Experiment with the authors’ recommended dietary lifestyles (not diets) and see what works for you.

  * **Don’t think of your diet as something you do but as the way you live**. It’s not something you come off after a while, but a permanent lifestyle change that is reflected in your daily habits.
  * **Treat food as nutrition rather than as entertainment**.



#### Foods to Avoid

Regardless of your dietary needs or requirements, there are **two categories you should eliminate** if you want to feel better:

  * **Processed and packaged foods**. Food should be eaten in as close to its original state as possible. The additives and preservatives in processed foods don’t add nutritional value and some are harmful to your long-term health.
  * **Sugar**. Eliminate all types of sugar as well as anything with sugar as the main ingredient (soda, cookies, candy etc.); excessive sugar contributes to weight gain and health problems.



#### Foods to Reduce or Eliminate

**It’s easier to eliminate specific types of foods than to eat less of them**. That’s because people have every intention of cutting back, but end up thinking, “One more breadstick won’t hurt me.”

If it’s too hard to cut out something entirely, you can always stop eating it for a specified period, like 10 days, and then reintroduce it in smaller amounts.

These should be on your reduce-or-eliminate list:

  * **Glutens, breads, and pastas** : Many people are allergic or sensitive to gluten without knowing it. Besides, breads and pastas add unnecessary carbohydrates and sugars, which make you gain weight. They are also processed foods with unnecessary additives.
  * **Any beverage other than water** : Coffee, tea, soda, juice, and other beverages add calories, and they don’t hydrate you as well as water does.
  * **Dairy** : The human digestive system isn’t designed for digesting cow’s milk. Try removing dairy from your diet for 10 days to see if you notice a difference.
  * **Meat** : Joshua and Ryan stopped eating meat and were happy with the results. Try it for 10 days and see if it makes a difference for you. Then make your own decision.



#### More is Better

You can replace the foods and beverages that you eliminated with healthier options. Try these:

  * **Water** : Drink at least half your body weight in ounces of water every day.
  * **Green drinks** : Green drinks like the Amazing Grass Green Superfood can be mixed with water to boost your energy. They also make you feel full, keeping you from overeating.
  * **Smoothies** : Make smoothies with kale, spinach, and other nutritious greens.
  * **Vegetables** : Vegetables are low in calories and high in vitamins and nutrients. Eat as many non-starchy vegetables as you want.
  * **Beans and legumes** : These contain healthy proteins and carbohydrates, and they also help you feel full so you don’t overeat.
  * **Fruits** : Fruits contain vitamins and water but also natural sugar, so eat fruit in moderation. 
  * **Fish** : Fish such as salmon contain Omega-3 fatty acids, which reduce the risk of heart disease. However, avoid bottom feeders such as crabs and lobster because they eat dead things.
  * **Organic foods** : Organic foods are grown without using pesticides and other chemicals, which makes them a healthier choice.



_The Minimalists_ doesn’t advocate a specific diet or dietary lifestyle because different people have different dietary needs. Try experimenting with different elements of your diet until you get the results you want (feeling better). However, here are five diets that deliver good results.

  * **Vegetarianism** exists on a continuum, but basically a vegetarian diet avoids meat but might include other animal products, such as dairy and eggs.
  * **Veganism** excludes all animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, honey). Both authors reported losing a lot of weight and feeling increased energy on this diet. But they decided to add some dairy, eggs, and fish back into their diets.
  * **Pescetarianism** : Both authors follow this diet. Pescatarians are vegetarians who eat fish. Joshua and Ryan also eat some dairy products, although less than they used to.
  * **Paleo** : The Paleo Diet is limited to the types of foods people ate prior to the agricultural revolution, including fresh fruits, vegetables, lean meat, and seafood. The diet excludes refined sugars and grains, dairy, trans fats, salt, high-glycemic carbohydrates, and processed foods.
  * **Intermittent fasting** is a pattern of eating that alternates between stretches of fasting (consuming only water) and non-fasting. For example, you might not eat for 16 hours, and then eat two or three meals in an eight-hour window. Any of the four dietary lifestyles mentioned could integrate intermittent fasting. Joshua tried it and achieved less body fat and more toned muscles. 



#### Medicine, Drugs, and Chemicals

Some medications are important and life-saving but others have side-effects and/or can be eliminated with improved diet and exercise. Here are some questions to ask yourself:

  * What kind of medication do you take and why? Are there alternatives?
  * Are you doing things that harm your body, for instance smoking, drinking too much, or using drugs? Why? If you’re doing things that harm your body, you’ll eventually pay a price.



### What You Do with Your Body

Everyone knows being a couch potato is bad for your health, but you don’t have to go to the other extreme to be healthy — for instance, running five miles or going to the gym every day. The goal isn’t to look like a bodybuilder but to be healthy and fit, and feel good.

**The primary goal of exercise isn’t to lose weight either. It’s steady improvement.** The key measures are:

  * **Are you constantly improving your fitness?**
  * **Are you happy with your progress?**



You can lose weight and still not be happy with your physical fitness. For example, although Joshua lost over 80 pounds he was flabby and weak. Over two years he developed simple daily habits that improved his physical fitness.

#### Daily Exercise Habits

Developing daily exercise habits is part of attaining a healthier lifestyle, just like developing new daily food habits.

People typically try running, lifting weights, swimming, or team sports. They all improve physical fitness, and all are better than not exercising. But they may not work for everyone.

Joshua came up with something that works better for him: three principles and four daily exercises.

**Joshua’s Exercise Principles**

  * **Enjoy exercise** : Choose exercises you enjoy because you’re more likely to do them consistently if you like them. Joshua walks, does elliptical machine training, and body exercises incorporating cardio.
  * **Exercise to relieve stress** : Use exercise as your primary means to reduce stress. Exercising at the end of a stressful day gives you time and solitude to reflect on what’s important.
  * **Keep exercise fresh with variety** : Doing the same exercises all the time eventually causes you to plateau. Mix it up.



**Joshua’s 18-Minute Exercises**

Alternate among the following:

  * **Push-ups:** Joshua started off slowly, barely able to do one, but now does three to five sets a day, or about 300.
  * **Pull-ups** : After slowly building strength, he does three to five sets a day, or 40-60 pull-ups.
  * **Squats** : He does three or four sets of bodyweight squats, or 20-30.



You can work your way up, even if you can’t do a single pull-up or push-up. And 18 minutes a day is a small amount of time to focus on your health.

#### The Importance of Sleep

People often skip sleep to accomplish or complete something. But to be healthy, you need adequate rest. The amount of sleep needed varies by individual but many studies recommend eight to 10 hours a night. Make sure you’re getting the amount you need, or you’ll lack energy and focus.

### The Musts of Health

Adopting a healthier lifestyle for the long term requires motivation. You acquire this by **turning your “should dos” into “must dos” — because once you decide you _must_ do something, you will**.

Here’s how it works. When you want to change a habit (diet, exercise, or something else), you need to give yourself a rationale or leverage that makes the change urgent and essential.

Leverage comes from wanting to avoid a negative outcome, or wanting the rewards. For example, you might tell yourself that the negative effects of _not_ improving your physical fitness would be greater than the short term pain of exercising. Psychologically, changing your habit then becomes a must.

On their website Joshua and Ryan recommend creating **must lists for various areas of your life** — for instance create a list of things on which you have procrastinated; then turn those shoulds into musts.

Here are some important health musts:

  * Maintain a healthy diet.
  * Exercise regularly (and continue improving).
  * Don’t do things that harm your body.
  * Treat your body as your most important asset.
