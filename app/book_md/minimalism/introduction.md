## Introduction

_Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life_ by Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus offers a formula for how to live a meaningful life, based on their personal journey.

The coauthors achieved success by conventional standards in their twenties — corporate success, money, and possessions. They expected this to make them happy but it didn’t.

They realized that they and many others pursuing the so-called American dream were deeply unhappy. They were exhausted from overwork and heavily in debt. Their lives felt empty and unfulfilled. This book and a website, TheMinimalists.com, grew out of their determination to understand why they were unhappy, what it would take to be happy, and how to change.

They discovered a lifestyle — minimalism — that enabled them to:

  * Reject consumer culture and society’s definition of success.
  * Systematically re-examine and reflect on their lives.
  * Inventory their possessions and emotional lives, and get rid of the things making them unhappy or holding them back.
  * After ridding themselves of clutter, focus on “Five Values” that they determined were essential for a meaningful life: health, relationships, passions, growth, and contributing to others.



This book, along with several others they’ve written, and their website are intended to help you similarly examine your life, so you can reshape it to be more meaningful and be happier in the process.

It begins with the question, “Are you truly happy?” and it guides you through the steps to transform your life so that the answer is “yes.”

### How to Use This Book

It’s organized into seven chapters, including a chapter on each of five values described collectively as a “recipe for intentional living,” which you can adjust to fit your personal lifestyle. The writers recommend that you:

  * Spend a week reading and contemplating each chapter to allow you to absorb the ideas.
  * Read the book more than once.
  * Take notes, highlight passages, and make lists.
  * Act on the recommendations immediately: Make small adjustments in your life that add up to significant change over time.
