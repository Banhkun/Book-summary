## Exercise: How Would You BRRRR?

Consider how you would use the BRRRR process.

* * *

If you were looking to buy an investment property right now, would you rather buy a single-family home or a multifamily property? Why?

Would you look for deals that fall under property distress (easier to find but require significant repairs), personal distress (hard to find but require little or no renovation), or market distress (easy to find during limited windows of opportunity)? Why?

If you canâ€™t personally fund an all-cash offer, which alternative source of funding would you pursue (owner financing, private money, hard money, or a business partner)? Why?

Would you rather manage the property yourself or hire a property manager? Why?
