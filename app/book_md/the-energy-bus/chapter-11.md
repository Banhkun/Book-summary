## Chapter 11: Creating Positive Energy

Even though George had a vision for where he wanted to go, there were roadblocks standing in his way. Being positive isn’t easy when you have a lot working against you, he told the others on the bus.

Everyone has different challenges, Joy acknowledged. But in each case, the answer is the same: **To change your situation, you need to change your thoughts. If you keep thinking the way you’re thinking, you only get more of what you’ve been getting.**

There’s a formula for change: E (events) + P (perception) = O (outcome). While we can’t always control events, we can control the way we perceive them. How we perceive them and respond dictates the outcome. The “P” in this formula can also stand for positive energy.

You’ll always have hurdles, which can include people who don’t share your vision, and you’ll get discouraged at times. Choosing positive energy helps you deal with negative people and situations. It’s the way to keep your bus moving forward and avoid being run off the road. **Positive people and positive energy create positive results.**

### Rule #3: Power Your Bus with Positive Energy

While vision and focus point your bus in the right direction, **positive energy takes it where you want to go**. It’s high-octane fuel, as opposed to the sludge created by negative energy.

**You can often turn negative energy into positive energy by being grateful.** For instance, instead of reacting negatively when work piles up, be thankful you have a job or that you’re healthy enough to work. Where there's a negative, there’s almost always a positive side.

It’s important to drive your life with positive energy if you want to be successful. Negativity will fill any void, so create positive thoughts and feelings, and take positive actions so there’s no room for anything negative. Positive energy will also get your team on track too, but you have to have it yourself before you can share it.

To help George generate positive energy, Joy gave him a book of stories and exercises she often shared with passengers called The Energy Book. They read a story aloud before the bus reached George’s office building.

It told of a man who felt pulled in two directions. It was as if there were two dogs inside him battling for dominance: a positive, kind, gentle dog and a negative, angry, mean dog. The man asked the village elder which dog would win. The elder replied, “the one you feed, so feed the positive dog.”
