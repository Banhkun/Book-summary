## Chapters 12-15: George’s Bus

George started using the book to generate positive energy (feed the positive dog). On the book’s recommendation, he took a Thank-You Walk around his building, citing things he was thankful for. As the book predicted, being thankful eliminated his stress because your body can’t be thankful and stressed at the same moment. Being grateful released endorphins and walking added even more energy.

He also read a story about golf, which pointed out that, after playing, golfers don’t think about their bad shots—instead, they focus on the one great shot they made. The good feelings make them want to keep playing and can make golf addicting.

In contrast, many people go to bed thinking about everything that went wrong that day. **Instead, treat regular life like golf and savor a success each day that makes you look forward to more successes.**

That evening, inspired by the golf story, George asked each of his children at bedtime to tell him their success of the day; they responded enthusiastically. Then he took the dog for a walk and thought about a success of his own: his boss had detected something different about him and told George: “Whatever you’re doing, keep doing it.” **Whether you have positive or negative energy, people notice** , George thought.

His next steps were sharing his vision with his team at work and inviting people to get on his bus.

### Rule #4: Share Your Vision and Invite People On Board

George needed to generate positive energy for the new-product launch by getting his team on board and headed in the same direction.

Joy directed George to an Energy Bus website where he could generate “bus tickets” for inviting people on board, and email or hand-deliver them to his team members along with a message explaining his vision and expectations for the team. As Joy explained, you not only need to invite people to join you—you must tell them where you’re going and how you plan to get there so they know what they’re signing up for.

George’s plan for the day, Friday, was to:

  * Meet individually with each person and share his vision.
  * Give each person a bus ticket with the instructions: now that you know where I’m going, return the ticket by Monday at 9 if you’re ready to get on board.
