## Chapters 16-22: Overcoming Negativity

On Monday, George felt a nervous excitement as his employees began handing in their tickets, indicating they wanted to get on board. Most of them were eager to join the effort. However, there were a couple of surprises.

The first was that Tom and Larry, who were usually difficult to work with, joined the team. He’d expected them to reject the invitation. Three others—Michael, Jaime, and José—walked in together without tickets and told him they weren’t participating. Speaking for the trio, Michael told George they believed the new-product presentation would be a failure and they didn’t want to be part of it.

After they left his office, George felt discouraged. He had two problem people on his team and three others he now thought of as wolves capable of sabotaging the project. He was especially disappointed to lose José’s support because José was a hard worker who had always come through in the past when George needed help.

The team meeting that day went badly, with Tom and Larry fighting with each other and the three wolves undercutting him at every turn.

### Rule #5: Don’t Waste Effort on Those Who Don’t Join You

Geoge got on the bus the next morning feeling discouraged, with only four days left before the new-product presentation. Joy told him that everyone faces tests and setbacks; the important thing is to keep getting up when you’ve been knocked down, like Rocky in the movie. You’re not a failure until you quit trying.

George’s three “wolves” weren’t the problem, as much as the negativity they represented, she said. Negativity surrounds us.

The research firm Gallup estimated in 2004 that there are 22 million negative workers in the U.S., costing around $300 billion in productivity a year. Negativity doesn’t just cost companies money—it’s bad for your well-being: doubt, fear, and negative energy drain and sabotage you. Everyone harbors negativity inside them—that’s why it’s important to “feed the positive dog.”

Regarding George’s three wolves—the people who declined to get on his bus—Joy told him not to waste energy worrying about them or trying to change their minds (Rule #5). There will always be people who don’t want to get on your bus. Don’t take it personally, she said—maybe another bus would be a better fit for them, or they’d be a disruptive presence on your bus anyway.

**The more energy you expend on naysayers, the less you have for those who joined your team** and for inviting new people. Successful salespeople understand this—they shrug off rejection and focus their energy on getting new customers.

### Rule #6: Ban ‘Energy Vampires’ from Your Bus

George agreed not to waste energy on his three “wolves” who rejected his invitation—however, he still had to do something about the two troublemakers, Tom and Larry, who were already on his bus.

This was where Rule #6—ban ‘energy vampires’—came in, Joy told him. The people we surround ourselves with have a big impact on whether we succeed. Some people increase your energy and your team’s, and some people drain it. The latter are energy vampires, who will suck the life out of you and your projects if you allow them to. They’ll make your ride miserable and even sabotage your bus.

You need to eliminate any negativity—including negative people—standing between you/your team and your goals. That means you must refuse to tolerate negativity on your bus: **make clear to everyone where you’re going, that you need a positive team, and that anyone who’s negative is off the project.**

Joy advised George to tell Tom and Larry that they needed to contribute positively or be fired. He needed to meet with the three naysayers too, she said. Give them one more opportunity to accept the invitation; if they refuse, then isolate and exclude them from team activities and communications. After the product launch, George could consult his human resources department on what to do with them long term. George understood the need for tough action and felt ready to take it.

### The Ultimate Energy Rule

Before dropping George off at his office, Joy explained an energy principle, which she called the ultimate rule of positive energy: **To succeed, your positive energy must be stronger than anyone’s negativity.**

You can kick negative people off your bus, but you may have other negative people getting on. You may have to deal with an energy vampire, such as a boss, that you can’t oust. To handle these situations, it’s important to keep building your positive energy. Repetition is key: practice being positive until it becomes your natural response.

George resolved to be strong and get his bus moving. Before he stepped down from Joy’s bus, she handed him a small rock. Joy told him to look for value in the rock despite its dusty appearance and to keep it as a reminder to see his own value and other people’s.

### George Gets His Bus on Track

George’s first meeting when he got to work was with his problem employee Larry, an energy vampire. He immediately told Larry he’d had enough of Larry’s negativity and if he didn’t start contributing positively to the team, he’d have to leave it. Larry was shocked and agreed to change his attitude, which George had expected since he knew Larry needed his job.

His next meeting, with Tom, was more difficult. George said he couldn’t afford to have Tom on the team if Tom kept undermining their efforts. Tom went on the attack, arguing that it was George’s fault that things weren’t going well and that George needed Tom’s talent to keep the bus from crashing.

George glanced at the rock in his pocket and realized Tom didn’t find him credible because George didn’t believe in himself or see his own value. George steeled himself and said he’d forgo Tom’s talent for the sake of having a positive team. Then he fired Tom and felt like a weight had been lifted.

George had planned to isolate the three wolves, but Michael charged into his office calling George crazy for firing Tom. He said the new-product launch and George were going to fail. George responded with “it’s my way or the highway,” and Michael quit.

Jaime, another of the naysayers, said she’d rather be on the team than lose her job. But she also explained why she’d initially rejected the invitation: George had been miserable to work for in the past. He knew she was right and thanked her for being honest.

When he met with José, George said he’d been surprised by José’s refusal to be on the team since they’d worked well together. José replied that George had never expressed any appreciation for his hard work. When he asked for a raise, George promised to get back to him but didn’t. José now expected to be fired—he thought everyone was getting fired—but George responded that José was right and asked for a chance to make it up to him.

José agreed and they headed into a team meeting that was one of the most productive in recent memory.
