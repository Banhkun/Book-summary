## Exercise: Shake Up the Routine

Flynn argues that your fans will have more positive experiences with your brand if you keep things fresh for your customers by trying out new strategies for engagement. This activity will help you develop a new idea and shake up the routine.

* * *

Start by writing a list of what you already do to engage fans. Think broadly and write down everything—even if it feels obvious or small.

Now read back over your list. What's missing? Write a follow-up list brainstorming ideas you haven't tried.

Look back on your list of new ideas. Pick one activity you’d like to try and explain why it jumped out at you.
