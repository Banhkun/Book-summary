## Shortform Introduction

**_Common Sense_ was written by Thomas Paine (and published anonymously) to provide an intellectual backing for American independence from England. **An English-born philosopher, Paine authored the pamphlet between 1775-1776. Despite the fact that there were only 2.5 million people living in America, it sold between 100,000 and 500,000 copies in its first year of publication, and it was reprinted in newspapers and copied by hand and distributed that way as well. Estimates suggest that, in relation to population, it retains the title of the most widely circulated publication in American history.

The Americans to whom Paine was speaking were, by Paine’s own estimation, interested more in reconciliation with the English government than establishing their own, despite the fact that the Boston Tea Party and the battles of Lexington and Concord had already occurred at the time of writing.

While Paine’s ultimate goal certainly included convincing Americans of the righteousness of revolution and separation from England, **the pamphlet itself is actually more directly concerned with larger questions of political philosophy.** It begins with a long treatise on the natural state of humans and how government, once created, should function, and moves from there into an anti-monarchist treatise. Paine is then able to apply this framework to the American case.

(It’s unclear how much, if any, impact Paine’s pamphlet had on the ultimate U.S. Constitutional Convention. He advocated for many more citizens to be involved in the drafting of the document and for a more expansive democracy than was ultimately ratified—in particular, he believed that men who do not own property should be allowed to both vote and serve in public office.)

In this summary, we will take a direct approach to _Common Sense,_ moving largely chapter by chapter through Paine’s argument, and exploring the following principles:

  * Why humans living together need a government to function
  * Why monarchies, and in particular hereditary monarchies, are detrimental to the success of nations and the lives of citizens
  * How Kings lose their purpose in a well-functioning republic
  * What a successful republic consists of
  * Why reconciliation with England is impossible for the American colonies
  * How, in the American case, the republic should come into being
  * The specific advantages that America has in her fight for independence
