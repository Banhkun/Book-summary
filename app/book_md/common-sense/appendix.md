## Appendix

(Shortform note: This section was not in the original version of _Common Sense_ and was published as an addendum after King of England George III gave a speech to parliament on October 26, 1775, the text of which appeared in America in January of 1776, in which he called the American rebels traitors.)

**George III’s speech is not of particular concern because he has already proven that he is immoral. It just reinforces the point that America’s relationship with England is beyond reconciliation.**

The speech by George III is libelous and is entirely untrue. However, it doesn’t matter much what the King says or does, because he has already broken every moral obligation that he has, and has no conscience left. Thus, it is even more clear that reconciliation is impossible and independence is the only route forward. Because it was distributed separately, Paine uses this document to reiterate much of his argument about the necessity of American independence from England.

There are three ways that independence can be achieved:

  * A military power
  * A mob
  * The legal voice of the people
    * America has a chance to put the third option into action, and if they do not, one of the other two will occur, which will not result in the establishment of a fair or just system of government. 
  * Americans should abandon political parties (Whigs and Tories) and instead consider themselves simply citizens of the United States of America
    * (Shortform note: If this sounds familiar, that’s because a similar refrain has been used in political campaigns up until and including the modern day. The most famous recent example is in Barack Obama's 2004 speech at the DNC, where he argued “The pundits like to slice and dice us into Red States and Blue States… But I’ve got news for them… We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.)
