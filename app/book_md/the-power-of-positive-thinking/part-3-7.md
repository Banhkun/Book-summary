## Part 3.7: Make Life and Work Easier by Relaxing

Peale ran a clinic where ministers and psychiatrists worked side by side to help people with the tension and stress in their lives. According to Peale, their teamwork was based on mutual respect and recognition that psychiatry and Christianity are both sciences with their own methods and systems.

When someone came to the clinic, a psychiatrist would study the person’s problem to understand the root causes of their unhappiness. Then the psychiatrist would send the person to a minister, who would prescribe therapies based in prayer, faith, and love. Psychiatrists and ministers pooled their techniques and therapies, and many of their patients had good outcomes—they were able to move past whatever problems were causing their stress and their tension and live their lives with joy and hope.

> One of the key lessons in _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ is to do whatever you need to do calmly and efficiently, without rushing or stressing yourself about it (in fact, too much stress at work was what caused Julian’s heart attack at the start of the book).
> 
> Like the patients at Peale’s clinic, Julian used meditation and other spiritual techniques to free himself from the stress and anxiety that had previously ruled his life. As a result, he found that he was more productive and efficient than ever before.
> 
> Through the characters of Julian and John, author Robin Sharma observes that **the most productive people are the ones with time to spare, not the workaholics as one might expect.** The key, Sharma says, is to use your time and energy effectively—in short, to relax.

### Slow Down

Peale claims that tension was one of the main problems his clinic dealt with. People have difficulty relaxing, and that stops them from living a full life. **One method to reduce tension is simply to slow down.** Consciously do everything more easily, slowly, and without pressure.

Remember: A master of any skill is efficient at it.**A master is someone who can produce maximum results with minimum effort** —that’s why people often say that masters “make it look easy.”

> Martial arts illustrate the importance of taking things slowly and easily. **The best martial artists are the ones who can move and strike fluidly, without tension or strain.** Fighters who exert too much energy or who are too stiff in the ring exhaust themselves, telegraph their moves, and are overall much less effective than those who stay loose.

### Use Your Power Effectively by Relaxing

Sitting quietly and relaxing—getting yourself in tune with God—renews your power and gives you the energy you need to do your best work. That’s why it’s important to keep a quiet mind and practice peaceful thinking, especially during stressful times.

During the day, stop frantically reacting to every little thing that happens; instead, keep your tempo down and conserve energy. **Relaxing during the workday is especially difficult, but it’s important because you ultimately get more done.**

> In _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach talks about what she calls the essential pause: Taking a moment to process and accept what’s happening before you react to it.
> 
> Much like Peale, Brach warns us against immediately and frantically reacting to events. Her reasoning is that when we just react, we’re usually in a negative mindframe: We’re lashing out to try to quickly fix something that we think is “wrong.”
> 
> Instead, Brach says that **before tackling a difficult or upsetting situation, we should do several things:**
> 
>   * Take a breath
> 
>   * Recognize and acknowledge our feelings
> 
>   * Look for the _right_ way to take action—and do nothing until we find it
> 
> 

> 
> Brach says that the essential pause will allow us to take mindful and effective action, instead of wasting our energy on unhelpful reactions.

### How to Master the Skill of Relaxing and Renewing Your Power

Peale offers techniques to help you relax and do your work more easily and effectively.

  * Like what you do. When you’re doing something you like, it doesn’t seem like drudgery. You don’t need to change your job—just change yourself.
  * Create a plan for your work so you feel organized and not swamped and overwhelmed.
  * Put your thoughts to work for you. When you think that what you’re doing is difficult, it will be difficult. Believe that it’s easy, and it will become easy.
  * Get good at your job; learn how to do it right. This helps you become more efficient.
  * Keep your work in your prayers.
  * Take God as your partner; he will help make your work easy.



> Peale’s suggestions primarily fall into one of two categories: increasing efficiency (by creating a plan, developing your skills, and enjoying your work) and tapping into the power of your thoughts and prayers. One crucial aspect Peale overlooks in this list is the importance of setting and meeting goals. Experts and self-help authors have noted that reaching goals is one of the best ways to motivate yourself and to stay engaged with your work.
> 
> For example, in _Flow_ , Csikszentmihalyi says that activities with clear, achievable goals help us to reach the “flow state” (an ideal mental state where we are completely focused and achieve our best work apparently effortlessly).
> 
> Similarly, in _Switch_ , the Heath brothers say that setting short-term goals is crucial in keeping your emotional side engaged in a lengthy task. Each small goal that you reach boosts your emotional state and keeps you striving for the next small victory on the way to achieving a larger goal.
