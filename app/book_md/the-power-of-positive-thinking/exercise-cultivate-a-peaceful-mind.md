## Exercise: Cultivate a Peaceful Mind

Living without strain creates a peaceful existence.

* * *

Peale says it’s important to fill your mind with positive thoughts and peaceful images. What is your “memory visit” that you can call up when you need to find peace? Describe it in detail and explain how it makes you feel.

Meditating on peaceful words is another method for restoring peace. The author likes the words “tranquility” and “serenity.” What words or lines from a poem or Bible passage resonate for you? Write them here.

Sometimes a sense of guilt can diminish our inner peace. Peale says the answer is to put the situation in God’s hands. Is there something you feel guilty about that’s eating away at your inner peace? Try putting the situation into higher power’s hands, and letting it go. How does this make you feel?
