## Part 1.2: Restore Health With Faith

Faith, when understood and applied in the right manner, can be a powerful factor in overcoming health obstacles, according to Peale. One great surgeon who combined science with faith, Dr. Hans Finsterer, believed that the “unseen hand of God” helped in his surgeries. He felt that true progress in medicine would be made only when doctors became convinced of the importance of God's help in the treatment of patients.

There are many examples, backed by medical evidence, of the role of faith—in combination with medical science—in healing. **Faith is the added element that boosts the efficacy of medicine.**

Peale argues that faith is not used enough in modern treatments. He claims that **faith can work miracles, but these miracles are actually the result of scientific principles.**

> A researcher’s review of scientific studies on faith healing didn’t reach any strong conclusions about its efficacy. Some of the studies showed that faith healing had positive impacts on health, others showed no effect at all, and a few even showed that faith healing had a negative impact on the patient. Furthermore, the author of the review noted that there are a lot of uncontrolled variables, which makes the outcomes of any study on faith healing suspect at best.
> 
> However, Peale isn’t advocating for faith healing alone—he repeatedly says that **faith power should be used alongside __ science-based medicine.** Whether you believe in divine intervention or think that faith healing is just the placebo effect in action (recovering because you believe that you’re getting help), Peale’s suggestion that we use every type of help available to us is a good one.

### Faith Is Tied to Healing

For many centuries, religious faith was tied to healing activities. It’s generally understood that there’s a connection between how a person thinks and how he or she feels: The mental state has an effect on bodily health. Since religion deals with thoughts and attitudes, it fits that the science of faith would be involved in the healing process. Therefore, to keep yourself healthy and happy,**it’s important to use medical science to the fullest but also apply the techniques of spiritual science.**

Peale claims that God works through both doctors and ministers, and many physicians agree. Peale encountered many doctors who believed the physical and spiritual are closely interrelated, finding that people’s feelings of fear, guilt, and hate were often connected to health problems. In that case, spiritual leaders like Peale can play an important role in healing patients.

> Robin Sharma’s parable _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ is about a (fictional) man named Julian who experienced exactly the sort of healing that Peale alludes to here. Julian was a wealthy and successful lawyer, but after suffering a heart attack mid-trial he quit his law practice and traveled to India to seek spiritual guidance.
> 
> When he returned several years later, Julian—a formerly overweight, middle-aged man—was more physically fit than he’d ever been, and he looked decades younger than he really was. He attributes the physical transformation to his improved spiritual health. The rest of the book is devoted to Julian teaching his old friend John how he can achieve a similar transformation.

### Medicine Plus Faith Creates Healing

From his readers and listeners, Peale received numerous examples of healing in which the element of faith is present. In each of these instances, **the best resources of medical and psychological science are used in combination with spiritual science resources.**

Peale says that faith can boost the effects of medical therapies and bring about well-being if it is in God’s plan for the patient to live (naturally, we all have to die eventually). In the cases of faith-enhanced healing Peale investigated, he found certain factors:

  * The patient is willing to surrender their health into God’s hands. 
  * They let go of sin and have a sincere desire to have their soul cleansed. 
  * They believe in the combination of medical resources and the healing power of God.
  * They are willing to accept whatever answer God has for them. 
  * They have an unquestioning faith that God can heal.



> In _The Secret_ , Byrne takes the idea of faith healing to the extreme, claiming that the Law of Attraction can prevent or cure any disease by “attracting” good health. She does note that medicine can help this process, but implies that it’s only because medicine often helps to manage pain—she says that you may not be able to use your full abilities if you’re distracted by pain.
> 
> Peale’s approach is more holistic (and more scientifically supported) than Byrne’s absolute reliance on the power of the mind.

In his research, Peale found that cases involving heart attacks respond particularly well to faith. People who have experienced a heart attack who **practice faith in God’s healing, along with doing everything their doctors say, go on to remarkable recoveries**.

They may even gain greater health because they come to understand the strain they were putting their heart under when they were ill. By surrendering themselves to God’s healing, they opened their consciousness to the vitality and energy available in the universe. They had previously been choking off that energy with their tension and inner conflict.

(Shortform note: The American Heart Association agrees that reducing stress is important for recovering from heart attacks, and for avoiding them in the first place. Therefore, Peale’s idea that faith helps people recover from heart attacks because it reduces strain on the heart has some scientific backing.)
