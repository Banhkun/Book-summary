## Part 2.4: Use Positive Thoughts to Change Your Circumstances

Your thoughts are powerful; they dictate the type of life you lead, the kind of person you are, and the experiences you have. Your thoughts can create or change the conditions around you. You can think yourself into or out of a situation.

Peale reiterates that **positive thoughts create positive outcomes, while negative thoughts lead to negative outcomes.** If you’re unhappy with your current circumstances, you can remake your life by getting rid of your old, negative thoughts and filling your mind with new thoughts that reflect faith, creativity, love, and goodness.

> Whether or not you believe that your thoughts can literally change the world around you as Peale claims, there’s no denying that **your thought patterns have a major impact on your happiness and mental well-being.**
> 
> A major lesson of Stoicism, which Aurelius teaches in _Meditations_ , is that outside forces cannot harm you. Aurelius insists that you don’t get hurt or upset by what happens to you; **you get hurt or upset by how you respond to it.** For a Stoic like Aurelius, controlling your thoughts isn’t about removing hardships from your path, but rather making yourself immune to those hardships.
> 
> Aurelius also believed that physical pain was meaningless, and the only thing that could truly hurt you was something that hurt your character or your sense of self. He’s not claiming that you can make yourself immune to injury or disease, just that you can toughen yourself mentally so that physical pain doesn’t stop you.

### Imagine and Succeed

To start thinking differently, **form a positive mental picture of how things should be—don’t just accept the way things are**.

Hold that mental picture and believe it deeply; pray about it, and do what you can to make it a reality. This process will unleash creative thinking, helping you realize the outcome you want. Peale calls this ability to actualize your mental image one of the “greatest laws in the universe.” He says it is the key to prosperity, happiness, and success.

> Tony Robbins’s book _Awaken the Giant Within_ suggests another way in which imagining the outcomes we want can be a powerful tool for reaching our goals.
> 
> Robbins believes that we often limit ourselves by using experience, rather than imagination, as our reference point for making decisions. While using past experience to predict what might happen sounds reasonable, the problem is that **we apply our past experiences far too broadly.**
> 
> For example, someone who does poorly on a math test might conclude that he’s a bad student, rather than recognizing that he was just struggling with one subject. Instead of applying his _experience_ with that test to all schooling, Robbins would suggest that he _imagine_ what other subjects he might do well in and how exciting it could be to learn new things.

### Techniques for Changing Your Thoughts

Peale suggests some practical techniques to help you change your mental attitude from negative to positive. He claims that, by doing so, you can release creative new thoughts that will help you actualize what you visualize.

  * **Speak positively:** Try optimism for 24 hours. During this time, speak optimistically about all aspects of your life, health, and future. After speaking optimistically for 24 hours, try next for one week. Then give yourself a day or two off to be “realistic.” **You may see that what you used to think of as _realistic_ thinking is actually _pessimistic_ thinking.**

**Think positively:** Feed your mind positive thoughts. Peale recommends reading and memorizing Bible passages about faith. Though this will take time, think of how much time you’ve spent becoming a negative thinker. Say prayers of thanks for all the wonderful things God is giving you. The idea is that God wants to give you great blessings, but he can’t give you anything greater than what you can believe in. So believe big.

  * **Spend time with positive people:** Determine which of your friends are positive thinkers and which are negative thinkers. Stay closer to the positive thinkers for a while, then go back to the negative friends; you'll be able to share your positivism without absorbing their negativism.




> Peale’s suggestions here are mostly about how you interact with other people and with your Higher Power (when he suggests you think positively, he primarily means that you fill your mind with thoughts about God). In consequence, he misses a crucial and science-backed technique for changing your thoughts: positive self-talk. This is slightly different from Peale’s suggestion to speak positively about all aspects of your life: While you may have many opportunities throughout the day to speak about your life with others, you still likely aren’t addressing the thousands of negative thoughts you don’t express out loud.
> 
> In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Robbins suggests an approach that addresses these negative thoughts more directly: changing the way you talk to yourself. 
> 
> Robbins says that thinking is just asking yourself questions and then answering them. Therefore, **the questions you ask yourself form the foundation of your thought patterns.**
> 
> For example, if you ask yourself negative questions like, “Why can’t I do anything right?” you’ll force yourself into harmful, disempowering thought patterns. However, by asking yourself positive, empowering questions like, “What went well?” or even, “What can I do better next time?” you’ll put yourself into a more confident and practical mindset.
