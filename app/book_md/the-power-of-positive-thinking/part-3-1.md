## Part 3.1: Practices | Cultivate a Peaceful Mind

We’ve discussed the importance of faith and positive thinking according to Peale. Now we move on to the third and final part of his system: concrete, practical methods of incorporating faith and positive thinking into your life.

Peale says that living with strain and anxiety is difficult, but living in a state of inner peace makes for an easy, calm existence. **A mind full of anxiety leads to turmoil and unhappiness, but a mind full of peace promotes health and well-being.**

(Shortform note: There is a strong connection between mental health and physical health; each bolsters (or harms) the other; for example, anxiety can cause nausea and insomnia. Therefore, as Peale says, inner peace helps promote outer health.)

### Create a Peaceful Mind

Peale suggests several methods by which you can gain a calm and peaceful mind:

  * **Empty the mind**. (There will be more instruction on this in a later chapter.) The author recommends emptying the mind at least twice a day. When you consciously empty your mind of fear, insecurities, regrets, and other negative emotions, you’ll experience relief and release. 



(Shortform note: The Jewish ritual of _tashlich_ (“casting away”) is one way of emptying the mind. On the first day of Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish new year), congregants symbolically cast their sins—often physically represented by bread crumbs—into a body of running water. This ritual helps Jews to let go of their fears and regrets from the past year, and face the coming year with a fresh mindset.)

  * **Say peaceful words**. Peale calls this “suggestive articulation.” Repeating anxious, panicky words helps produce a state of anxiety and panic. But speaking peaceful words helps keep your mind calm. He suggests words like “tranquility,” and “serenity.” You can find peaceful words that appeal to you from a soothing poem or Bible passages.



(Shortform note: What Peale calls “suggestive articulation” is a practice more commonly referred to as reciting a _mantra_ ; a word or simple phrase that you can repeat many times in a row. Doing so focuses your attention and your willpower on what you want to do, or who you want to be. For example, someone struggling with self-esteem issues might repeat, “I am strong, I am intelligent, I am worthy.”)

  * **Engage in peaceful conversations**. The conversations you find yourself in can affect your attitude. Negative conversations—such as petty arguments or gossip—create tension, so don’t contribute to this. Instead, offer positive, optimistic expressions during your conversations with others. Remember, peaceful ideas create a peaceful mind.



> Social media didn’t exist when Peale wrote this book, but—for better or worse—we now have more social interactions, on and offline, than ever before. Therefore, **it’s important to make sure that those interactions are positive ones.**
> 
> One study found that sites like Facebook have a direct impact on young people’s self-esteem and overall mental health. Positive interactions on such sites improve their well-being, while negative interactions worsen it. We can cultivate our social media experiences based on who we connect with and follow online, and who we block from interacting with us.

  * **Use silence**. The modern world is noisy; even familiar sounds take away from our rest and peace. Quiet, on the other hand, is calming and healing. The author recommends spending at least 15 minutes in pure silence every day. While this won’t be easy at first, it will get easier with practice. Try these techniques:
    * Visualize your mind as the surface of water; you’re trying to keep it still, without even a ripple.
    * Fill your mind with peaceful experiences and then take little trips there with your memory when you need to find peace. Think of a serene place you once experienced—a walk in the woods, or sitting at the beach perhaps. Call up this experience any time you need to put yourself in a calming place. Peale calls this a “memory visit.” His favorite memory visit was to the balcony of his favorite hotel in Hawaii. He called it up in great detail and used its healing properties whenever he needed it.



> The two exercises that Peale suggests—emptying the mind and sitting in silence—are different forms of meditation.
> 
> The first is a variation on _candle meditation_. The idea of candle meditation is to either look at a candle flame or picture one in your mind, and think of nothing else. You should acknowledge any thoughts that intrude on your meditation, and then dismiss them; as you continue to practice, those intrusive thoughts should come less frequently and disappear more quickly. This is because candle meditations help you to develop focus and mental discipline.
> 
> Peale’s second exercise is a type of _visualization meditation_ that’s designed to put you into a calm, content state of mind. Some would call this particular exercise a “happy place” visualization.
> 
> Peale’s emphasis on silence and solitude is meant to help you avoid distractions, so that you can just be alone with your thoughts.

### Self-Punishment

Peale says that we may lack inner peace because we’re punishing ourselves for some real or imagined sin. When you’re unable to forgive yourself for something, you live in a state of constant anxiety that punishment is coming. In these situations, people often work constantly to try to ease whatever guilt they’re feeling.

Peale suggests you find peace of mind in this predicament by **releasing your guilt and putting it in God’s hands.**

> If you feel guilty or live in fear of punishment, it’s because you’re blaming yourself for something that you’ve done or think you’ve done. In _Meditations_(one of the definitive Stoic texts), Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius offers this advice about blame:
> 
>   * **Blame is pointless.** People cause harm either because of ignorance, or by accident. Blaming people (including yourself) for what they don’t know, or because they made a mistake, is pointless; it’s much better to teach them (or learn) how to avoid that issue in the future.
> 
>   * **Blame is useless.** Even if you _could_ reasonably blame someone (again, including yourself), doing so wouldn’t make the situation any better. Therefore, assigning blame is a waste of time and energy.
>
