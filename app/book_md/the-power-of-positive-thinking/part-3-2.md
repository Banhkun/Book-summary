## Part 3.2: Increase Your Energy

Our thoughts affect how we feel physically. When your thoughts tell you you’re tired, the body accepts this and feels tired. But **when your mind and thoughts are engaged and interested in what you’re doing, you have the energy to keep going indefinitely**. Peale believes that thoughts involving faith are especially powerful because they bring you feelings of endless support and power, which further fuel you.

Peale’s idea is that God is the source of all energy; maintaining contact with God taps us into all of this energy, giving us access to the very same energy that God used to create the world.

> Robin Sharma’s _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ shows how spiritual health can boost your energy through a parable:
> 
> Julian Mantle is a famous and wealthy lawyer, but he suffers from his unbalanced lifestyle: He overworks himself, has unhealthy eating and drinking habits, and never makes time for his spiritual health. This all culminates in a mid-trial heart attack.
> 
> Julian recovers, but quits practicing law and travels to India to seek spiritual guidance. When he returns, he claims to have found inner peace—**and, as a result, he now has the strength and energy of a man half his age.**
> 
> Sharma says that you can achieve similar results to Julian’s through a combination of meditation or prayer, physical and mental exercises, and clean, simple living.

### Find Your Rhythm

Peale believes that people who are capable of immense amounts of work, fueled by seemingly endless energy, are in touch with what he calls the natural rhythm of God. Such people don’t necessarily have more energy than others; instead, they use their energy efficiently. **They exert effort at the proper times and places, and they never waste their energy trying to force something to happen at the wrong time or in the wrong way.**

Peale suggests you get in touch with the proper tempo of life by listening to the sounds of nature, or by hearing the word of God at church. However, he adds that you can also find it in your daily life. To boost your energy and avoid exhaustion, **find the natural rhythm in everything you do by relaxing your body and mind.**

> What Peale calls “God’s rhythm” is better known by another name: _flow._ Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi coined the term in his book of the same name. He describes flow as an optimal state in which we’re both completely focused and completely happy. While in a state of flow, we can do our best work seemingly without effort, and we often lose track of time.
> 
> Csikszentmihalyi says that reaching a state of flow requires a few conditions:
> 
>   * **Your task must be enjoyable.** A major part of flow is losing yourself in your work. That won’t be possible if you hate what you’re doing.
> 
>   * **You must have a clear goal.** People often talk about focusing on their work, but they’re really focusing on a goal—the work to reach that goal is incidental.
> 
>   * **Your task must be challenging, but not frustrating.** Something too easy will be boring, while something too hard will be discouraging. Neither situation will allow you to reach a flow state.
> 
> 


### Fight Your Feelings of Disinterest

Sometimes people are tired and have no energy because they're not interested in anything. They are so wrapped up in their personal concerns that nothing outside of themselves moves them. As a result, they’re constantly bored and lacking in energy.

(Shortform note: Disinterest and lethargy can also be signs of depression. If you think that might be the case for you, recall that Peale suggests seeking professional counseling when needed.)

To fight this, Peale advises you to **get interested in something worthwhile outside of yourself, and throw yourself into it wholeheartedly.** When you lose yourself in something bigger than you, you’ll have more energy.

> In _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ , Sharma says that knowing your purpose in life is like having a lighthouse to guide you through dangerous waters. To find your purpose, Sharma suggests setting specific, attainable, long-term goals for yourself in key areas of your life (physical health, spiritual health, relationships, career goals, and so on).
> 
> He also suggests keeping a “Dream Book.” In this book, you keep track of all the different goals you set for yourself, and your progress toward those goals. By doing so, **you’ll be able to easily see which goals come naturally to you, and which ones you’re most excited to work toward.** That will be important information in determining your ultimate purpose in life.

#### Fight Staleness

Another cause of low energy is staleness—feeling a sense of monotony that undercuts the freshness you need to do your work successfully. When you feel bored and stale, it takes more energy to do things you used to do easily.

Peale’s advice for those suffering from such staleness is to reconnect with God, the Bible, and nature.

> _Ennui_ is another word for this kind of staleness. Ennui is more than simple boredom; it’s a deep-seated dissatisfaction with your life, coupled with a total lack of drive to change things.
> 
> Whereas Peale suggests overcoming ennui by reconnecting with meaningful things such as God and nature, Kieran Setiya—a professor of philosophy at MIT—claims that a shift in perspective may be all that you need. He suggests these four steps to overcome ennui (or staleness):
> 
>   * **Forget about FOMO.** FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) is the regret that we all feel about the things we _didn’t_ do. For example, if you go to school for business, some part of you might regret that you didn’t go for English or computer science. **The key to overcoming FOMO is to recognize that there will _always_ be paths you didn’t take**—it’s not possible to make every choice at once. Since “missing out” is unavoidable, there’s no sense in dwelling on it.
> 
>   * **Trade regret for appreciation.** Take time to think about everything you currently have: your friends and loved ones, your current career, and all the different ways your life is adding value to the world. Focus your attention on those positives, instead of on worries or regrets about what you chose _not_ to do.
> 
>   * **Make small changes.** Ennui is about boredom just as much as it’s about regret. Therefore, you can fight ennui by making changes to your current life. For example, try taking up a new hobby (or rekindling your interest in an old one). Alternatively, take on an interesting challenge at work.
> 
>   * **Enjoy the process.** Goals are important, but it’s equally important to enjoy the day-to-day work that you put into reaching those goals. Take each moment as it comes, and relish each opportunity to put your skills to work.
