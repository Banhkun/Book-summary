## Part 3.9: Cure Heartache

Grief, sorrow, and other forms of heartache and inner suffering are part of being human; it happens at some point to everyone. Peale encountered a young man who was having trouble rising above his sorrow. He asked for a “prescription for heartache.”

Peale suggests concrete things to do when you are hurting emotionally:

  * **Get back to normal**. If you’re in a bad situation, get out of it and return to your normal life and its activities. Being as normal and natural as possible helps to cure heartache. For example, if a loved one has died, don’t avoid the places you used to go together.
  * **Get physically active.** Avoid the temptation to sit and brood.
  * **Get busy with a worthwhile project**. Make sure you stay busy with something creative to occupy your time (not just partying and drinking). 
  * **Feel your grief**. It’s natural and helpful to cry when sorrow comes. Trying to bottle up your grief and not show emotion is unhealthy. But you can’t let crying and grieving get out of control, either. It’s not healthy for it to become a habitual process.
  * **Turn to God**. On a more spiritual level, curing your heartache requires turning to God with faith and trust. You don’t have to carry your burden of sorrow alone; putting yourself in the presence of God is healing and soothing. 



> One helpful tool that Peale overlooks here is grief counseling. Speaking with a professional therapist or a spiritual leader (or both) can be invaluable in helping you come to terms with grief and sadness.
> 
> One major thing grief counselors recommend, which Peale’s list excludes, is seeking support from your friends and loved ones. This article specifically recommends that you seek out people who won’t feel uncomfortable in the face of your grief; you need people whom you can share your deepest feelings with and who will listen when you tell them how to help you.
> 
> It’s also important to note that grieving isn’t always about the death of a loved one. People can grieve for relationships, jobs, homes, and so on—any major life change means losing something, and it’s natural to grieve for what you’ve lost.

### Faith in Life After Death

There is no greater heartache than the death of a loved one. A spiritual way to help live with this heartache is to gain an understanding of the deeper meaning of life and death. **When you carry with you the faith that all life is connected—and that when you die, you merely continue your journey in another form—you gain a deep peace and comfort about the loss of a loved one**.

For Peale, coming to the realization that there is no death—that “here” and “hereafter” are all part of one universe—brought him great comfort. This philosophy doesn’t take away the sadness when a loved one dies, but it will help lift and dissolve grief.

> **Visiting Heaven?**
> 
> People of many different faiths take comfort in the belief that there’s some sort of afterlife waiting for us. Some people even claim to have seen it; that’s the case with _Heaven is For Real_ , a book by pastor Todd Burpo, who relates his young son’s memories of a near-death experience.
> 
> When Colton Burpo was just under four years old, he became extremely sick. The doctors concluded that there was nothing they could do to save him. That night, Todd’s congregation came together to pray for Colton; by the next day, he had almost completely recovered.
> 
> Colton told his father that he’d visited Heaven while he was in the hospital. Todd was initially skeptical, but Colton’s memories of that time were so vivid that the pastor came to believe that his son had indeed seen the afterlife.
> 
> Some highlights of Colton’s memories were:
> 
>   * Attending a “school” where Jesus was the teacher
> 
>   * Meeting his great-grandfather, whom he only knew as “Pop.”
> 
>   * Meeting his sister who died in the womb—Colton’s parents are shocked, as they had indeed suffered a miscarriage in the past, but had never told him about it.
> 
>   * Seeing God’s throne, with Jesus’s throne to the right of it.
> 
> 

> 
> Of course, there’s no way to prove that events played out as the book says they did, or that what Colton saw was really Heaven. However, Colton’s parents—and Colton himself—found great comfort in the belief that Heaven was real and their loved ones were waiting for them there.
