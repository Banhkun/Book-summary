## Conclusion: Draw Upon Your Higher Power

Many people are depressed and unhappy, but they don’t have to live that way. Peale’s answer is to draw upon God or the Higher Power. The Higher Power can do everything for you.

How do we do that? **State your problem, then ask for a specific answer. Believe you will get that answer and believe that right now you are gaining the power to deal with your problem.** An important element of drawing upon the Higher Power is to relax and rest into that power.

Another important element in drawing on the Higher Power is to be positive; keep an optimistic attitude toward every problem. The level of your faith is the level of power you will receive to meet your obstacles. No matter what your problem is, drawing upon the Higher Power can help you through it.

> **Counterpoint: The Power of Negative Thinking**
> 
> _The Power of Positive Thinking_ focuses on keeping a positive attitude and having faith that you can accomplish anything. However, Peale essentially encourages us to bull through our problems with sheer willpower and confidence, an approach that some critics feel is simplistic and shortsighted.
> 
> For example, famous basketball coach Bob Knight wrote _The Power of Negative Thinking_ specifically to rebut _The Power of Positive Thinking_. There are several points within Knight’s book that directly counter Peale’s ideas:
> 
>   * It’s important to know when to quit rather than stay in a situation that won’t improve, as opposed to Peale’s “no defeat” mindset.
> 
>   * One needs to eliminate bad ideas, or ideas that have lived past their expiration date, which requires looking at the downsides of those ideas, as opposed to Peale’s emphasis on blind positivity.
> 
>   * Anticipate and realize when one’s typical style or approach won’t work and when it needs to be changed, as opposed to Peale’s absolute faith in oneself and in God.
> 
>   * It can be useful to doubt, think about, and delay a decision, rather than charge ahead and believe it will work out—again, in opposition to Peale’s emphasis on faith and positive thinking.
> 
>   * Most critically, Knight believes that **negative thinking, when it results in preparing for the worst, can help avoid unintended consequences down the line.**
> 
> 

> 
> Knight says that **everyone wants to win, but the winner will be the one who wants to _prepare_. **In other words, you can’t just walk into a situation believing that your desire and your faith will get the results you want; you have to put in the work and prepare for the worst.
