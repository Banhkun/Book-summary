## Part 2.1: Positive Thinking | Decide to Be Happy

The second part of Peale’s system for a good life is positive thinking: He believes that **a positive mindset will allow us to take control of our lives and reach our goals.**

Peale argues that we create our own happiness in this life, and **we get to decide if we’re happy or unhappy.** If you want to be unhappy, filled with fear, worry, resentment, and hate, you can choose unhappiness by going around complaining that things aren’t going your way. Even though bad things in life can and do happen, we can manufacture unhappiness by thinking unhappy thoughts and having unhappy attitudes.

However, Peale suggests that you choose happiness instead. He says **every one of us can achieve happiness, if we want it and if we apply the right formula.** For example, instead of telling yourself that things never go your way, you can focus on telling yourself that life is good.

(Shortform note: A 2020 study found that smiling—even faking a smile—can improve your mood and cause others to respond to you more positively. This effect seems to stem from a subconscious connection between the physical act of smiling and the good mood that usually accompanies it. In other words, Peale is correct: We can force ourselves to be happy, at least to some extent.)

### The Happiness Habit

Peale’s first suggestion for a positive mindset is to **develop the habit of being happy.** When you develop the happiness habit, life becomes more enjoyable every day. Because habits are something you can develop, you have the power to create your own happiness.

When cultivating the happiness habit, stick to some simple principles proven to help you live a happy life, such as **keeping your heart free of hate, giving more and expecting less, thinking of others, living simply, and keeping the mind free of worry.**

Peale says that practicing these principles for one week will bring you to the beginnings of a happy life.

> **The Anatomy of a Habit**
> 
> _Atomic Habits _by James Clear teaches you how to intentionally form a new habit, such as the happiness habit that Peale recommends here.
> 
> Clear says that there are four parts to a habit:
> 
>   * **Cue:** This is **what triggers the habit,** like how the smell of cigarette smoke might make a smoker want to indulge. For Peale’s happiness habit, the cue might be waking up in the morning, or feeling negative emotions creeping in.
> 
>   * **Craving:** This is**the emotional response** that the cue triggers. In other words, it’s what prompts you to perform your habit. For someone with a happiness habit, the craving would be the desire to feel good.
> 
>   * **Response:** This is**the actual behavior,** like when the smoker from the previous example lights a cigarette. In a happiness habit, the response might be reciting a Psalm as Peale suggests, or replacing a negative thought with a positive one.
> 
>   * **Reward:** This is **the satisfaction you gain from performing your habit.** As your brain comes to associate that satisfaction with the previous three steps, you’ll form a habit. In other words, your brain will remember what prompted you to do a certain thing, and that you felt better after doing it, so it’ll prompt you to keep repeating that behavior.
> 
> 

> 
> According to Clear, you can intentionally use this process to form positive and helpful habits: Recognize your cue and the craving it triggers, then choose a healthy response to that craving. Use that same response each time you feel the craving, and it will eventually become a habit.
