## Introduction: The Goal of This Book

Norman Vincent Peale wrote _The Power of Positive Thinking_ as a practical guide to help regular, everyday people live a happy, worthwhile life. In this book, he outlines a system intended to improve your life. He claims **you will take control of the events in your life, rather than being directed by them.** Your relationships will improve, you’ll become more popular, have a greater sense of well-being, better health, and an increased zest for life, and you will become more useful to the world and influential to other people.

Peale’s system is rooted in Christian teachings and focuses on **faith, positive thinking,** and **specific practices** you can use to improve your life. For this guide, we’ve divided his teachings among those three categories as follows:

Faith:

  * Have faith in yourself
  * Restore health with faith
  * Solve problems with faith



Positive thinking:

  * Decide to be happy
  * Expect the best to get the best
  * Defeat is not an option
  * Use positive thoughts to change your circumstances



Practices:

  * Cultivate a peaceful mind
  * Use the power of prayer
  * Stop worrying and fretting
  * Get rid of negative emotions
  * Relax into your life and work
  * Be liked
  * Cure heartache



We conclude with Peale’s statements about what calling upon God (or your higher power of choice) can do for you; in essence, those statements are a brief summary of the book as a whole.

> While Peale—who was a Christian minister—drew upon his faith for inspiration and strength, you don’t have to be Christian yourself to benefit from _The Power of Positive Thinking_.
> 
> In many ways, _The Power of Positive Thinking_ is comparable to _Alcoholics Anonymous: The Big Book. _Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) was also founded based on Christian teachings and beliefs, but it has expanded to welcome people of all faiths, as well as those without any faith.
> 
> To do so, it reframed God and “Higher Power” (both of which are prominent in the _Big Book_) to mean _any power that you accept as greater than yourself._ To give some examples, that power might be:
> 
>   * A deity
> 
>   * Your family
> 
>   * Your community
> 
>   * AA itself
> 
>   * Your ideal self
> 
> 

> 
> You can take the same approach to _The Power of Positive Thinking_ : Rather than taking Peale’s talk of God and Jesus literally, you can choose to envision whatever higher power will inspire and comfort you.
