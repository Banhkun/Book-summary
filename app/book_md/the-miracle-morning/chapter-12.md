## Chapter 12: Getting into the Habit

**The quality of your habits (the behaviors you repeat regularly and often subconsciously) determines the quality of your life.** A person who’s successful has established the habits necessary for achieving and sustaining success. In contrast, someone who’s struggling in any area of life hasn’t committed themselves to the habits that generate success.

Because your habits dictate your life, it’s critical that you learn to control them. **You need to identify, practice, and sustain the habits that will create the success you want** while eliminating detrimental habits.

Most people fail at controlling or changing their habits. New Year’s resolutions are a prime example. A New Year’s resolution is typically a positive habit you want to establish (exercising) or a negative one you want to stop (smoking). But less than 5% of those who make resolutions stick with them.

Most people fail to change habits because they aren’t prepared to overcome the mental challenges that are part of the process. However, with the right strategy, you can change any habit in thirty days. The Miracle Morning 30-Day Habit Mastery Strategy will enable you to stick to the Life S.A.V.E.R.S. routine or to establish any other habit you want to.

Mastering a new habit involves three 10-day phases:

#### Phase 1: Unbearable (Days 1-10)

Whether you’re implementing a new habit or dumping an unproductive one, the first ten days are the most difficult—in fact, during this phase, change seems unbearable or impossible.

The key to getting through it is realizing **this only temporary, rather than the way the new habit will always feel**. Knowing that the worst is temporary—you only have to endure it for ten days—and the benefit is long-term gives you the willpower to get through this phase.

Example: When Elrod first started running, the first 10 days were physically painful and all he wanted to do was quit. He hated it. Mentally, he had to force himself to keep going.

#### Phase 2: Uncomfortable (Days 11-20)

Having survived the first phase will generate confidence, but you still need commitment and discipline to get through Phase 2. You’ll be tempted to backslide into your old behaviors—for instance, sleeping in instead of getting up early to exercise. However, you can overcome the temptation by focusing on and looking forward to the next phase, in which change will prevail.

Example: Elrod’s second phase of running was a bit less painful, he hated it less, and getting up and running every morning started to feel normal.

#### Phase 3: Unstoppable (Days 21-30)

In the first two phases, you’ve formed and established a new habit, but you’re not done yet. (Many people think they’re done after twenty days.) Phase 3 is important because it sets you up to sustain the new habit. Completely replace the pain of first twenty days with positive reinforcement and enjoyment of the new habit, and it will become part of your identity. You’ll move from _trying_ to _living_ the habit.

Example: In this phase, Elrod forgot that he had hated running and began to enjoy it. Instead of battling mentally to keep going, he occupied his mind with affirmations and listening to self-help books and lectures. He went from believing he couldn’t run (a self-imposed limitation) to becoming a runner in thirty days. Soon, he even joined friends and ran a 52-mile ultra-marathon, which previously would have been unthinkable.

Similarly, you can make the Miracle Morning routine a habit. For encouragement, read some of the success stories at the front of the book, on the website, or in the Facebook community. For instance, one practitioner wrote: “I am on day 79 … and have not missed a single day. Honestly, this is the first time in my life that I’ve ever set out to do something and have actually stuck with it … I now look forward to waking up every day. The Miracle Morning has completely changed my life.”

#### Steps to Begin

**Here are four steps for starting your Miracle Morning** :

1) Download the Thirty-Day Life Transformation Challenge Kit here, which includes exercises, affirmations, checklists, and a tracking sheet.

2) Plan your first miracle morning for tomorrow. Decide where you’ll do the routine.

3) In preparation, read page one of the kit and do the exercises. This should take no more than an hour. This includes:

  * Answering “clarity” questions, such as what you want to change and what’s holding you back
  * Completing a “life assessment”
  * Defining your vision for success in each area of your life
  * Spelling out the habits you will need to establish for success in each area



4) Get an accountability partner, but start your Miracle Morning tomorrow whether you find a partner immediately or not.

Regardless of your past, you can change your future by doing something different in the present. Your results will depend on who you choose to be from now on.
