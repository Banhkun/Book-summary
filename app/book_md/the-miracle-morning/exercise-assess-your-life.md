## Exercise: Assess Your Life

You can achieve “level 10” success in every area of life—health, career, finances, spirituality, family/relationships, recreation, contributing to others—by establishing daily habits that create success.

* * *

On a scale of 1-10, how would you rank your current level of success/fulfillment in each of the above areas?

What would “level 10” success look like for you in each area?

Because your level of success in any area is usually a result of your habits, what habits can you develop now in each area that would create level 10 success?
