## Chapter 4: Life S.A.V.E.R.S.

When you want to change, there’s a gap between where you are and where you want to be. You may feel frustrated with yourself for lacking the motivation and effort necessary to produce the results you want. You know what you need to do—and spend time thinking about it—but you don’t do it.

The size of the potential gap varies depending on the person. For some, the gap seems huge and almost insurmountable, while others feel close to reaching their potential. But whatever your distance from the life you want, it’s absolutely attainable.

The rest of this book will explain the Life S.A.V.E.R.S.—the six tools for bridging your potential gap by developing yourself into the person capable of achieving your dreams. They are: silence, affirmation, visualization, exercise, reading, and scribing (writing in a journal). These practices help you develop physically, intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually so you can change your life situation.

#### Getting Ready

Since the first step in Life S.A.V.E.R.S. is silence, don’t try to practice this step in bed or even in your bedroom, where it would be easy to slide back into sleep. Sit on a couch, a chair, or the floor in another room where you won’t be interrupted and where you’ve set up the things you’ll be using: a printout of your affirmations, the book you’ll read, a notebook or journal, and possibly an exercise DVD or app.

With everything ready, you’ll be able to jump into your Miracle Morning without delay.
