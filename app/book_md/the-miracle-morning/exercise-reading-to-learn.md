## Exercise: Reading to Learn

Hal Elrod recommends reading at least ten pages a day and thinking about what you want to learn from a particular book before you start reading. He advises re-reading books you’ve found helpful so the concepts really sink in.

* * *

Think of a book you’ve read in the past that had an impact on you. Why and how did it affect you? How might you benefit from reading it again?

What’s the name of a book you’ve wanted to read, but haven’t, which you can incorporate in a daily reading program? What’s kept you from reading it?

What ideas, strategies, inspiration, or other benefit might you get from reading this book?
