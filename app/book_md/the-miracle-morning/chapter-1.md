## Chapter 1: Introducing the Miracle Morning

**The Miracle Morning method gives you regular time each day for personal development**. It requires getting up thirty to sixty minutes earlier each day to devote time to six self-development practices proven to help people change their lives. (People with extremely limited time may have a Miracle Morning routine that’s as short as six minutes long.)

**These practices—Life S.A.V.E.R.S.—are silence, affirmation, visualization, exercise, reading, and scribing (writing in a journal)**. Each will be detailed in an upcoming chapter. They’ll help you develop the mindset and habits to succeed.

The Miracle Morning process is something you’ll look forward to doing and it will quickly and seamlessly become part of your life. There are a host of benefits:

  * You’ll wake up feeling energized, with a strategy to take your life to the next level.
  * You’ll feel less stressed.
  * You’ll have clarity and focus, enabling you to solve problems and overcome beliefs that have held you back.
  * You can get in shape, improve your health, and lose weight if you want to.
  * You’ll be more productive and focused on your priorities
  * You’ll worry less and be more grateful.
  * You’ll increase your income and attract wealth.
  * You’ll choose and start living your life’s purpose.
  * You’ll stop settling for less and live out your vision for an extraordinary life.



The Miracle Morning is compatible with everyone’s work schedule and lifestyle. Whether you’re a “morning person” or not, or whether you’ve had trouble waking up in the past, you’ll learn to wake up earlier, excited to start your day. Most people who implement it on weekdays no longer want to sleep in on weekends because they feel better and get more done when they keep doing the Life S.A.V.E.R.S.

**You’ll find that your Miracle Morning experience will become key to unlocking your potential**.

### A Journey of Discovery

Here’s how Hal Elrod used the Miracle Morning to advance in less than a year from his lowest point—a failing business, debt, and depression—to renewed financial success, achieving his dream job, and even completing an ultra-marathon.

Although he’d recovered from a debilitating car accident, he found overcoming financial failure, debt, and depression to be more difficult. After his accident, he had family, friends, and medical professionals taking care of him and encouraging him. In contrast, when financial disaster struck, he didn’t have anyone feeling sorry for him—others had their own problems as a result of the recession.

It was a struggle to get out of bed until a friend suggested that running would lift his spirits and help him think more clearly about his problems. With nothing to lose, he went for a run, during which he listened to a personal development talk by Jim Rohn. He experienced a breakthrough when he heard the message:**Your level of personal development determines your level of success; you attract success by who you become**. This philosophy changed Elrod’s life.

#### The ‘Success Parallel’

It struck Elrod that he hadn’t been developing himself into the person he needed to be to create the life he desired. He’d wanted level 10 success, while his personal development remained at a level 3 or 4. Most of us are in this position. If we want level 10 success, while our personal development (knowledge, experience, mindset, beliefs, habits) isn’t a level 10, we’re going to struggle.

Our outer world reflects our inner world: our success level parallels our personal development level. **To be successful we have to commit time to developing ourselves.** Elrod reports that when he had this insight, he ran straight home, ready to change his life.

His first challenge was finding the time. He was so busy just keeping his head above water financially that finding additional time for personal development was daunting.

Evenings wouldn’t work because he was usually too tired to focus, and finding time consistently during the day didn’t seem feasible. The only feasible option was early morning. He hated waking up, but hoped committing himself to personal development in the morning would be positive and motivating and would carry over into the rest of his day. Also, in the morning, he’d be less distracted or tempted to skip the personal work.

He recalled a mentor telling him that **if you want your life to be different, you have to be willing to _do_ something different**.

#### The First Try

Next, he needed to determine how best to use the time he was setting aside. In the first hour of his day, he wanted to **engage in activities that would have the greatest impact in the shortest amount of time.**

He decided to use six tried-and-true development tools—meditation, affirmation, visualization, exercise, reading, and journal writing. He assigned ten minutes to each one and planned to try all six the next morning, waking up an hour earlier than usual. He woke up feeling excited and motivated, the way he felt when waking up on Christmas morning as a child.

After starting with silent meditation, he read from the book _Think and Grow Rich_ , picking up a few useful ideas for the day. (Shortform note: Read the Shortform summary of Think and Grow Rich here.)

Moving on to affirmations, he wrote and repeated affirmations based on what he wanted in life, the kind of person he was committed to becoming, and what he was committed to doing to change his life (see one of Elrod’s affirmations in Chapter 7). He then visualized success. In a journal, he wrote down things he was grateful for. As exercise, he did pushups, situps, and yoga. When he finished, he felt calm, motivated, and empowered.

#### Miracle Morning Takes Off

Elrod continued to follow through on this routine. He started even earlier—at 4 a.m. instead of 5—and found to his surprise that waking up wasn’t difficult. With newfound clarity, he was able to conceive and implement a plan to save his business and income. In fact, less than two months after his first Miracle Morning, his income exceeded what it had been before the economy crashed.

He shared the powerful routine with his life coaching clients; they experienced the same benefits and shared it with friends and coworkers. As the idea spread, people started posting Miracle Morning videos on social media. A movement began to take shape, which continues to grow.

#### Your Challenge

This book is an invitation to start now to change yourself and your life by committing to making consistent daily progress toward becoming the kind of person who can create the level 10 life you want.
