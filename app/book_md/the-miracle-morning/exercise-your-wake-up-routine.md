## Exercise: Your Wake-Up Routine

Elrod argues that you can change your life by changing the way you wake up because how you wake up sets the stage for the rest of your day. Preparing the night before to wake up on a positive note and also having a morning routine can make waking up easier.

How do you usually feel when you wake up? What is your morning wake-up routine?
