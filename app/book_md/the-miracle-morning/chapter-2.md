## Chapter 2: Reject Mediocrity

**Every day, we face the challenge of rejecting mediocrity and living up to our potential**. Most people—95%—don’t succeed. They settle for the life they have and live with regret, without realizing they have the ability to be who they want to be, do what they want to do, and have whatever they want.

If you take one hundred people at the start of their working life and follow them for forty years, you’ll find, according to the Social Security Administration, that:

  * One will be wealthy.
  * Four will be financially secure.
  * Five will continue working because they have to.
  * Thirty-six will be dead.
  * Fifty-four will be broke and dependent on friends, family, and the government.



**The challenge is ensuring that you are among the successful minority rather than the struggling majority**.

Here are three steps to rise above mediocrity and join the top 5%.

### Step 1: Realize that Mediocrity is the Norm

If you don’t think and live differently than the mediocre majority, you’ll experience the same life of struggle, failure, and regret as most people, including your friends, family, and peers.

Every day, most people struggle physically, mentally, financially, and in relationships:

  * **Physically:** Obesity is epidemic; the average person is exhausted and lacks energy (with many relying on caffeine to keep going).
  * **Mentally:** Many people take prescription drugs to counter depression, anxiety, and other disorders.
  * **Financially:** Americans have more debt than ever; they overspend, fail to save, and struggle financially.
  * **Relationships:** Half of all marriages fail.



### Step 2: Understand the Causes of Mediocrity

The most common reasons people struggle and accept mediocrity are:

#### 1) Rearview Mirror Thinking

It’s human nature to view current choices through the filter of our past experiences—the rearview mirror syndrome. If we failed at something in the past, we believe we’ll continue to fail in the future at anything remotely similar.

**We measure every new opportunity against our past experiences and capabilities** —for instance, thinking: “I’ve never done anything like that before; I’ve never succeeded at that.”

Thus, we limit our future development based on the limitations of our past. Even though we want to change, we’re stuck on the way things have always been.

Most people process up to 60,000 thoughts a day, but 95% are recurring thoughts, including fears and worries from yesterday. Instead, you must recognize these as limitations, move past them, and imagine a future without limits. Overcome limitations by repeating affirmations that inspire confidence that anything is possible and that you can make it happen. Focus on what you want, reprogram your beliefs about what’s possible, and move in the direction of your goals until they become reality.

Remember: your past doesn’t dictate your future. **Your present is a result of who you were, but your future will be determined by who you are from now on**.

#### 2) Lack of Purpose

**The average person can’t tell you their life purpose, the reason they keep getting up every day**. They just do what they have to do to survive; they take the easiest path, pursuing short-term gratification and staying in their comfort zone.

However, to escape mediocrity, you need to have a purpose. For example, Elrod realized he wasn’t living up to his potential as a sales representative and that when he moved on to a new job, his average performance would follow him unless he changed it.

So he decided that for the next year, his purpose would be to develop himself into someone capable of achieving the success he wanted. He added a second purpose: to “add value” to others’ lives. Each day, he focused his thoughts and actions on these goals—for instance, by holding regular coaching calls with his team to help them improve. He had his best sales year and more members of his team posted their best performances. Having a clear purpose made the difference.

A life purpose can be anything that’s meaningful to you, that inspires you and directs your daily actions and priorities. It isn’t something you “discover”—you decide what your purpose will be.

You can start with a small purpose—for instance, smiling more or being more helpful—and make it bigger as you grow and evolve. The point is to create a purpose now, and start living it. Use your Miracle Morning to come up with something. Write it down and keep it where you’ll see it.

**When you commit yourself to a purpose bigger than your problems, they’ll shrink in comparison** and you’ll find you can easily overcome them.

#### 3) Viewing Small Actions in Isolation

We wrongly think our choices affect only the moment—for instance, that it’s no big deal to eat something unhealthy or to skip exercising today because we’ll get a “do-over” tomorrow.

However, your individual actions, as well as thoughts, have long-term consequences. **Every thought, decision, and action determines who you’re becoming** and, ultimately, the life you create. In _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ , T Harv Eker, wrote: “How you do anything is how you do everything.”

For example, when the alarm goes off and you hit the snooze button, you tell your subconscious mind that it’s OK to not follow through on your intentions. Instead, when tempted to go back to sleep, tell yourself, “I’m not a person who lacks discipline. I’m getting up because I am committed to waking up early and working toward my goals.”

**By keeping your commitments, you’re developing the discipline to achieve the results you want**. Every action counts: what you do determines who you’re becoming.

#### 4) Lack of Accountability

Accomplishment and success require accountability, which means being responsible to someone else for our actions or outcomes. As children, we were accountable to parents, teachers, and coaches; as a result, we did homework and ate our vegetables—things we wouldn’t have done on our own.

As adults, however, **we often resist accountability and, as a result, we’re prone to mediocre performance** , short cuts, laziness, and ducking responsibility. To be successful, you need to create your own systems of accountability, using friends, family, mentors, and partners—for instance, having an exercise partner who expects you to show up at the gym. The most successful people use the power of accountability as motivation to act when they don’t feel like it and reach their goals.

For that reason, Elrod recommends finding an “accountability partner” for your Miracle Morning routine. To team up with someone else while reading this book, post an invitation in The Miracle Morning Facebook group. (Shortform note: Refer your partner to this summary or the “crash course” at www.miraclemorning.com.)

#### 5) A Mediocre ‘Circle of Influence’

**We emulate the people we spend the most time with—our circle of influence.**

If you’re surrounded by negative, complaining, lazy, people, you’ll be like them. Likewise, if you spend time with positive, successful people, their attitudes will rub off and you’ll become more like them. This is true of every aspect of life, including happiness, health, and even income. If your friends are financially successful, you’ll think the way they do and adopt the habits that made them successful. However, if the majority of the people around you are struggling financially, they won’t inspire you to do better.

Spend less time with people who pull you down (this can include family) and associate instead with those who believe in and encourage you. Work actively to improve your circle of influence, through resources such as online networking, professional groups, and the Miracle Morning Facebook group.

**Look for people who will add value to your life and strive to add value to others’ lives** by contributing to their personal development, so they, in turn, can be a better influence on you.

#### 6) Lack of Personal Development

The amount of success you achieve is determined by how much you develop yourself. The Miracle Morning provides structured daily personal development time to practice silence, affirmation, visualization, exercise, reading, and scribing (writing in a journal). These practices help you develop physically, intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually.

When you don’t commit time to personal development, you’ll spend it spinning your wheels on problems.

#### 7) Lack of Urgency

The greatest cause of mediocrity is lacking a sense of urgency to improve yourself and your life. Most people put off challenges, planning to tackle them “someday,” or they hope problems will work themselves out. This is the path of lost opportunity and regret. However, what you do _now_ matters immensely because it shapes who you become and sets the course of your life.

### Step 3: Draw Your Line

In addition to realizing that most people accept mediocrity by default and understanding the causes, **there’s a third step to overcoming mediocrity: drawing your personal line in the sand and committing yourself to being different**.

It’s important to draw your line today because at the moment you reject mediocrity, your life changes going forward. Commit yourself to achieving an extraordinary level of personal development and success—to being, doing, and having what you want. The Miracle Morning is your key.
