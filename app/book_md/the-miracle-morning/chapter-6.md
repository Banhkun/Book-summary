## Chapter 6: A—Affirmations

Affirmations are positive, constructive statements that you repeat to yourself as a tool for reprogramming negative thinking to help you change or accomplish something. **They’re one of the most effective tools for becoming the person you want to be and achieving your goals**. For instance, Muhammad Ali repeated a simple affirmation—“I am the greatest”—over and over and he became the greatest boxer of his time.

Besides Ali, positive thinking and the use of affirmations have helped people like Will Smith, Jim Carrey, Suze Orman, Oprah, and many others achieve success and wealth. Affirmations allow you to develop the mindset (thoughts, beliefs, focus) that you need to increase your level of achievement in any area of your life.

We all talk to ourselves already—we have an unconscious, internal dialogue running through our minds, replaying and interpreting past experiences. Unfortunately, for many people, it works against them. For instance, around 80% of women have self-defeating thoughts daily; many men likely have negative thoughts as well.

However, getting control of this process by **actively choosing positive, constructive thoughts is a powerful way to change your life**. When you design affirmations that target your goals and repeat them frequently, they begin influencing your subconscious mind, transforming your thoughts and actions.

### An Affirmation Experience

In his car accident, Elrod suffered brain damage that initially destroyed most of his short-term memory. At first, when people visited him in the hospital, took a break, and returned later, he’d greet them as though seeing them for the first time that day. He didn’t remember that they’d been there only an hour or so before.

Every incident reinforced his belief that he now had a poor memory. When someone asked him to remember or remind them of something later, he’d respond, “I wish I could, but I have a horrible memory.”

In reading the book _Think and Grow Rich_ , he realized how this thinking was limiting him, so he created his first affirmation: “I let go of the limiting belief that I have a horrible memory. My brain is … capable of healing itself and my memory can improve …” He repeated it daily.

A few months later, a friend asked him to remember to call her, and he responded without hesitation, “Sure, no problem.” His affirmation had begun changing his mindset and his memory improved.

### Create Your Own Affirmations

Here are five simple steps for creating affirmations. Affirmations need to be in writing so you can post and read them aloud frequently. You can download free Miracle Morning affirmations here.

**1) Specify what you want**. Spell out what you want your life to be like in every area (write an affirmation for each)—for instance, health, relationships, career, finances, contributions, and spirituality.

**2) Explain why you want it**. Everyone wants to be healthy, happy, and successful, but you need more than just desire to achieve success. Knowing why a goal is important motivates you to act.

**3) Specify how you’ll change** —who you’re committed to becoming—to achieve level 10 success in your life.

**4) Explain what you’re committed to doing to attain success**. List the specific actions you’ll take; include how often you’ll do them and your time frame (beginning and end). Start small so you don’t get discouraged; write down a daily or weekly goal you can increase. For instance, if you want to lose weight, this part of your affirmation might read: “I’m committed to going to the gym three days a week and using the treadmill for at least twenty minutes.”

**5) Add inspirational quotes** and philosophies. When you hear or read quotes and strategies that inspire you, incorporate them into your affirmations.

Here’s a condensed example of a Miracle Morning affirmation on overcoming adversity:

“I know that where I am in my life now is both temporary and exactly where I need to be to learn what I must learn, so that I can become the person I need to be to create the life I truly want. This moment is an opportunity for me to learn and become better than I've ever been before. I can turn my adversity into an advantage by accepting all that is out of my control so that I can give myself freedom from emotional pain, be at peace, and create the life I truly want.”

For your affirmations to work, be sure to repeat them daily. Also, you must repeat them with feeling rather than by rote to embed them in your subconscious. Continually update them as you grow and your goals evolve.
