## Exercise: Write an Affirmation

Affirmations are positive, constructive statements that you repeat to yourself as a tool for reprogramming negative thinking to help you change or accomplish something. An effective affirmation states what you want and why, how you’ll change, and what steps you’ll take.

* * *

Think of a negative belief you have about yourself—for instance, a belief that you’re not good at something or not capable of accomplishing something. How is this belief limiting you?

Write a positive statement that flips this belief around, starting with something like, “I’m fully capable of learning what I need to know in order to achieve…”

Add to the statement the ways in which you’ll change to achieve what you want and the steps you’ll take to do so. Start repeating the affirmation aloud several times a day.
