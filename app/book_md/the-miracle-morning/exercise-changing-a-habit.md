## Exercise: Changing a Habit

It takes about thirty days to establish a new habit or eliminate an old one. Many people fail but itâ€™s doable if you understand the three phases of the process (unbearable, uncomfortable, and unstoppable) and have a mental strategy for getting through them.

* * *

Think of a habit you failed at changing in the past. What actions or steps did you take and for how long?

What was the reason or reasons you either succeeded or failed? What did you learn from the experience?

What current habit would you like to change and what could you do during each phase to succeed?
