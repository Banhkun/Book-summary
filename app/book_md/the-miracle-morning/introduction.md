## Introduction

_The Miracle Morning_ presents best-selling author and speaker Hal Elrod’s antidote to living a life of mediocrity.

Although we’re born with a desire to learn and grow, most of us ultimately fall short of our potential and “settle” for less than what we want in life. Each day is much the same as the day before.

However, Elrod argues that **everyone deserves to get and is capable of getting what they want in every area of life** , including relationships, finances, career, health, spirituality, happiness, and more. **The answer is implementing a simple daily personal development routine** , which he says can empower anyone to surmount challenges, turn circumstances around, and transform any area of life, in a surprisingly short time.

Elrod promises that “The Miracle Morning” described in his book “can absolutely be the one thing that takes you where you want to be.”

### Elrod’s story

The Miracle Morning method grew from lessons Elrod learned from two “rock bottom” experiences in his life.

When the first occurred, he was a successful 20-year-old salesman for a large marketing company and was climbing the corporate ladder. Suddenly, **a devastating car accident changed his life**.

As he drove home from a speech and dinner, his car was struck head on by a pickup truck and then struck again by the car behind him. **He sustained serious head injuries and eleven broken bones, and his heart stopped beating for six minutes at the scene**. Rescuers revived him, but he faced a long rehabilitation and the possibility he wouldn’t walk again.

He eventually recovered, returned to his sales job and set performance records. He later began speaking to high school and college students about overcoming adversity, became a life coach, and wrote a book, _Taking Life Head On_.

His message was that it’s pointless to wish things were different. The only thing to do when encountering adversity is to focus on having a fulfilling life going forward. **He chose to be grateful for what he had and take responsibility for creating the life he wanted**.

Elrod concluded that everything happens for a reason and it’s up to us to choose the most empowering reasons for our challenges and circumstances. Ultimately, he viewed his accident as a positive because it changed his life for the better.

**After recovering from his accident, Elrod suffered a second rock-bottom experience six years later—this time, financial ruin during the 2008 recession**. He pulled himself out of depression by developing a morning routine that motivated him to get out of bed. On a friend’s advice, he started his days with running, while listening on earphones to motivational speakers, in order to feel better and think more clearly.

His depression began to lift and he continued to develop his morning routine, experimenting with his sleep schedule and various personal development methods, such as affirmation and journaling. He came up with a daily sequence of six practices. The routine was so successful in helping him turn his life around that he began calling it his Miracle Morning and sharing it with coaching clients and friends, who also found it transformative.

To share it more widely, Elrod wrote _The Miracle Morning,_ which became an Amazon best-seller and led to the creation of a website, Facebook community, and a series of additional books.

### Your Life Story

Elrod contends that his experience of overcoming two major setbacks and achieving success is evidence that others can do the same.

**The first step is accepting full responsibility for every part of your life, rather than blaming someone else**. Blaming is assigning fault for something, while **taking responsibility means leaving the past behind and committing yourself to creating the life you want, starting immediately**.

Wherever you are in your life, it’s temporary and it’s a place of opportunity—to learn what you need to know, to become a person capable of creating the life you desire. **Right now, you’re writing your life story by what you do**. You’re the hero or heroine, likely overcoming challenges (the more challenges, the better the story). You’re in charge of what the next page will say.

**You can create and attract anything you want in your life by developing into a person capable of doing so**. This book is about helping you become that person. Your potential is unlimited.

A baby’s birth is often described as a miracle of life, yet many of us lose sight of the miracle of our own lives. When we’re young, adults assure us we can do anything and be anything we aspire to. At some point, as adults, many of us settle for less than the life we dreamed of. The average American is at least twenty pounds overweight, $10,000 in debt, mildly depressed, dislikes her job and has few, if any, close friends. This book is for those ready to reject the norm and create the life of your dreams.

### A ‘Level 10’ Life

**Most people passively accept the cards that life deals them**. Even people who achieve success in one area, such as a career, accept less-than-optimum results in other areas, such as relationships or health.

However, there’s no reason to settle for less in any area—happiness, health, money, freedom, love, or success. Of course, no one consciously chooses to accept less in a given area. For instance, on a fulfillment scale of 1-10, we don’t decide we’re okay with a level 5 relationship, where we’re unhappy half the time. Yet, we still end up accepting less in most areas.

You can achieve level 10 success in every area of life by committing time daily to personal development or becoming a level 10 person. Success rests on accepting three principles:

1) You’re capable of achieving a life of happiness, success, wealth, love, and anything else you want.

2) You need to commit time each day to work on becoming a person capable of attracting and achieving the success you want.

3) How you start your day is crucial. A focused, productive morning routine leads to productive days, which create a successful life. **Changing how you wake up can change any area of your life more quickly than you think**.
