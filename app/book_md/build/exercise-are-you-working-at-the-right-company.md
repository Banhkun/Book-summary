## Exercise: Are You Working at the Right Company?

Fadell argues that if you want to build a successful startup, you must learn as much as you can by working at the right company. In this exercise, you’ll evaluate whether your current position is helping you pave the right path.

* * *

What mission or objective are you chasing right now? Recall that Fadell’s mission was to create handheld computing devices.

How is your current position helping you achieve that mission?

If you’re satisfied with how your current position is helping you on your mission, how can you adjust it to be even _more_ helpful? For example, Fadell recommends talking to other people in your company so that you can learn as much as possible about what you’re trying to do.

If you’re dissatisfied with how your current position is helping you on your mission, what kind of changes could you make? For example, Fadell recommends looking for jobs at smaller companies in which you can learn from your mentors.
