## 1-Page Summary

What are the secrets to being successful in your career? How do you build a world-changing product-based business? Entrepreneur Tony Fadell answers these questions and more in _Build_. The book is part career encyclopedia and part memoir, detailing Fadell’s journey building the iPhone and starting Nest, a smart home device company.

In this guide, we’ll first discuss Fadell’s career trajectory. Then, we’ll share the lessons Fadell learned throughout his life, beginning with his tips on succeeding in every stage of your career. Then, we’ll share his advice on creating successful product-based businesses and building a great team. Along the way, we'll discuss how Fadell’s advice compares with other experts’ tips on building successful products, businesses, and teams.

### Fadell’s Career: A Primer

Fadell’s lessons stem from his own career. In the early 1990s, Fadell’s passion for computers led him to a job at General Magic with the software industry’s leaders. Fadell was thrilled to be building Magic Link, a then-revolutionary handheld computing device that would let users connect to the internet, play games, and more. (Shortform note: In _Outliers_ , Malcolm Gladwell argues that people who succeed early in life have an advantage, as these early opportunities tend to snowball into larger advantages. Fadell’s career trajectory demonstrates this; much of his later success stemmed from the knowledge he gained and people he met building Magic Link.)

However, Fadell soon realized that the Magic Link was bound to fail: It was directed toward the average American, who had no need or desire for it. He urged company leadership to redesign the product for businesspeople, who _would_ benefit from a handheld computing device. Despite Fadell’s best efforts, company leadership refused, and the Magic Link failed to sell. (Shortform note: What should you do if you have revolutionary technology, like the Magic Link, that’s too early to market and thus unappealing to your target? Fadell looked for other customers by switching industries; other companies have successfully targeted other countries that are more receptive to new technologies.)

In 1995, Fadell quit General Magic and joined Philips—which was on board with Fadell’s idea—as CTO. As a first-time manager, Fadell struggled to manage people effectively and to convince business leadership to go along with his ideas. (Shortform note: Surveys suggest that it’s even harder to be a first-time manager now than it was in Fadell’s time thanks to the prevalence of remote working. Managers’ inability to connect with their team face-to-face and the lack of mentoring from peers and senior managers contribute to burnout—and when managers burn out, so do their teams.)

Despite these challenges, Fadell oversaw the release of the Philips Velo and Nino—essentially business-focused smartphones. Although the products received critical acclaim, they didn’t sell well: Fadell’s team didn’t think through how to _market_ them. Most people shopped at brick-and-mortar stores, which didn’t have a clear aisle in which to sell smartphones. An entirely new product also meant that stores didn’t know how to advertise or sell it.

(Shortform note: Fadell laments this period as a “decade of failure,” due to both his management failures and his failure to build a profitable product. But some experts argue that these failures paved the way for his future success, citing research that suggests most successful entrepreneurs don’t build companies until they’re in their 40s—in part because they’ve learned from their many failures. However, Fadell may not have learned _all_ the lessons that he should have from the failure of the Philips Velo and Nino: He blames their failure to sell on a lack of knowledge on how to market them, but critics at the time found fault with the Windows CE platform the phones operated on, which they deemed unfriendly to users.)

In 1999, Fadell quit Philips to focus on his dream of building a handheld music device. That dream led to a job at Apple, where Fadell built several generations of the iPod and the iPhone and rose through the ranks to Senior Vice President. (Shortform note: In _Steve Jobs_ , Walter Isaacson explains that Fadell’s journey to and at Apple was not without controversy. Notably, Fadell was pressured into signing onto Apple full-time when he initially only wanted to stay on as a consultant. Additionally, Fadell and engineer Jonathan Rubinstein (who brought Fadell on) often clashed, as both believed that they were the main creator of the iPod.)

#### Fadell After Apple

In 2010, Fadell quit Apple to travel the world with his family—and was consistently frustrated by old, inefficient thermostats. So that same year, Fadell (along with co-founder Matt Rogers) started Nest and became CEO. The company successfully released a smart thermostat and a smoke and carbon monoxide alarm. This success was thanks in part to Fadell’s insistence that brick-and-mortar stores market Nest products in a dedicated “Connected Home” aisle.

(Shortform note: Fadell and Rogers successfully kicked off the smart home revolution—a dramatic rise in the development of internet-connected home appliances—and with it, a host of privacy and security concerns. Nest hasn’t been immune to these; after Fadell’s tenure, the company attracted controversy for hiding microphones in their security cameras.)

In 2014, Fadell sold Nest to Google, which wanted to expand into the smart home market. Fadell was thrilled at the opportunity to use Google’s massive resources to achieve Nest’s vision of creating a fully connected smart home. But the two companies struggled to integrate their cultures. Then, in 2015, Google restructured itself into Alphabet and gave Fadell one week’s notice that Nest would effectively turn into a non-Google company with no access to the resources Fadell had expected. Shortly after, Google told Fadell they were selling Nest—at which point Fadell quit. Google never sold Nest. But Fadell never looked back: Today, he spends his time on Build Collective, a venture capital firm.

(Shortform note: Fadell’s departure from Alphabet was mired in controversy, as headlines speculated about the “tumult” that Fadell’s management style caused at Nest. And Google’s restructuring campaign didn’t change after Fadell’s departure. After several rebrands, customers in 2023 remain unclear as to what Nest products Google will continue to support in the coming years. But Fadell’s career remains active, as he focuses his efforts on the cryptoverse.)

### How to Create a Successful Career

Now that we’ve discussed how Fadell built his career, we’ll share his tips on building a successful career at three stages of your professional life: when you’re starting out, when you’re managing, and when you’re CEO.

#### How to Start Your Career

The first step to creating a successful career, according to Fadell, is to **figure out what you want to do.** This doesn’t entail a specific salary or position; rather, ask yourself: What “mission,” or objective, inspires me to learn? For example, Fadell’s objective was to make handheld computing devices, which inspired him to learn everything he could about making them. Knowing what you want to accomplish will help you make better career decisions.

(Shortform note: If you don’t have a clear objective, _The Defining Decade_ author Meg Jay recommends that you seek out experiences that will help you build “identity capital”: the collection of things you’ve done long enough or well enough that they become part of who you are. For example, if you’re interested in filmmaking, seek out an entry-level job at a film production company instead of one at a coffee shop.)

Second, Fadell recommends that you **work for the right company**. It should be working toward an objective similar to yours, have an original solution to an everyday problem experienced by the masses, and have the technical know-how to successfully create the product they’re promising. Ideally, the experts in your field will be working there and the company is small enough that you can learn from them—fewer than 100 people is ideal. If a company fits all these criteria, don’t worry about your exact position. You can always switch internally within the company, but you can’t manufacture passion for an objective.

(Shortform note: Fadell’s recommendations for finding the right company don’t apply to every industry. For example, a writer could work at a small publication whose mission they believe in and learn from the experts in their field—but that publication likely won’t be creating an original solution to an everyday problem experienced by the masses. If Fadell’s recommendations don’t apply to your industry, look for a job you’ll love. In _168 Hours_ , Laura Vanderkam argues that such a job will have four characteristics: It’s work you enjoy, it’s work that challenges you, it gives you some autonomy, and it provides a supportive environment.)

Third, Fadell suggests that you **pay attention to the broader goals of the company**. Instead of focusing exclusively on your short-term goals, occasionally shift your perspective so you can assess how your job fits into the company’s long-term goals, how you can do your job better, and notice any potential landmines that could harm the company. To do so, **talk to your colleagues** : your internal customers (the colleagues you send deliverables to), the people for whom _you_ are the internal customer, and the people who talk directly to the customer (like sales or customer service). Each of these teams has a different perspective; by talking to them, you’ll have a more well-rounded view of what’s going on and how you can better support the company’s (and your) objective.

(Shortform note: Fadell describes what _Measure What Matters_ author John Doerr calls a bottom-up approach to alignment: Junior employees working on the frontlines to identify pressing needs and relay them up the chain of command. In addition to encouraging interdepartmental collaboration, a bottom-up alignment helps motivate employees to accomplish their goals because they get to choose them. But Doerr emphasizes that the best companies have both a bottom-up and top-down approach to alignment. In the top-down approach, directives start with the CEO and cascade down through the ranks to the junior employees. Ideally, the employee should set half her directives herself and receive half from the top.)

Fourth, Fadell suggests that you **know when to quit**. At some point, you may realize that your company is not on track to fulfill the objective you share. If you see a major problem down the pipeline, point it out to your manager and offer a potential solution. If nobody does anything even after you’ve escalated the problem to the highest level you possibly can, leave, but make sure you don’t burn any bridges to keep your reputation intact.

(Shortform note: Other experts suggest that you should quit not just if you see potential issues with the _company_ but also if you see potential issues with your career track. In particular, they suggest looking for alternative employment if you don’t want your manager’s job and can’t realistically envision a future at this company. But they agree with Fadell that it’s essential to quit as respectfully as possible. To do so, imagine how you’d want someone to quit if you were in your boss’s shoes.)

#### How to Be a Good Manager

As you move further along in your career, you may be promoted to management. To be a good manager, Fadell contends that you must learn both how to manage _people_ and how to manage _decisions_.

##### How to Manage People Well

Fadell argues that the key to managing people well is to **find a balance between being hands-on and hanging back.** As a manager, it’s your job to ensure that your team creates an amazing product—so be hands-on in service of that mission and push back if they’re not meeting your high expectations. But it’s _not_ your job to nitpick about exactly _how_ the team produces results—if you do, you’ll veer rapidly into inefficient micromanagement. So hang back and let your team do what they do best. This will be easiest if you decide together at the beginning of the project how the team will create the product then check in regularly on their progress.

(Shortform note: Finding a balance between being hands-on and hanging back won’t just prevent you from inefficient micromanagement; it may also give your team the flexibility it needs to adapt to unexpected challenges when you’re not there—as it did in the German military. In _Superforecasting_ , the authors describe how Germany successfully followed the principle of _Auftragstaktik_ , or “mission command.” Just as a manager should tell people _what_ to do but not _how_ to do it, military leaders told soldiers the next step of the plan, who then carried that step out in whatever way the situation required. As a result, soldiers were able to adapt to unexpected changes without needing to wait for new orders.)

##### How to Manage Decisions

Fadell argues that managing decisions well depends on **understanding what type of decision you’re making**. You’ll make two types of decisions: informed (or “data-driven”) decisions and instinctive (or “opinion-driven”) decisions. Informed decisions rely primarily on hard data, so they’ll be relatively easy to make. But instinctive decisions rely primarily on your own intuition. As such, they’re inherently risky and difficult to make, and they may invite pushback from leadership—who often want hard data to confirm that you’re making the right decision.

To deal with this pushback, Fadell recommends that you **tell a good story**. If you can convince leadership that you have all the data you could possibly get, that you’re a good decision-maker who knows the customer well, that you’re mindful of the risks involved, and that this decision could be good for the company, you’ll gain their approval.

> **How to Tell a Convincing Story**
> 
> The authors of _Made to Stick_ suggest that you inspire agreement by including one of three elements in your story: challenge (overcoming obstacles), connection (developing relationships across gaps), or creativity (solving problems and inspiring new ways of thinking).
> 
> Such a story may help you convince leadership not just of your _instinctive_ decisions but also of your _informed_ decisions. In _Smarter Faster Better_ , Charles Duhigg explains that people who receive too much data grow overwhelmed and stop taking any of it in. To counteract this phenomenon, you must actively engage with the data. So if you’re explaining your informed decisions to leadership and see their eyes glazing over, tell a story that forces them to engage with that data—try asking them questions that encourage interaction, for example.

#### How to Be a Good CEO

If you’re extremely successful, you may one day become CEO. If that happens, Fadell explains that your job is now to **care about the company**. Everybody in your company will now look to _you_ for cues on how to behave,so pay attention to and demand high standards from _every_ department: If you do, lower-level managers will _also_ demand high standards from their employees. (Shortform note: While demanding high standards is important, be wary of expecting total perfection. In _Steve Jobs_ , Isaacson describes how Fadell’s one-time boss’s perfectionism often resulted in delays, cost increases, and overworked employees.)

Additionally, pay attention to developments _outside_ the company. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that any idea that your company didn’t come up with must be bad; if you do, you risk ignoring innovative technologies that could transform your field. (Shortform note: In The Innovator’s Dilemma, Clayton M. Christensen argues that companies often ignore innovative technologies _not_ because of the CEO’s ego but because these technologies usually appeal to a new market that initially does not include the established company’s main customer. These customers only turn to the innovation later, once the technology improves.)

One day, you may need to decide whether to sell your company. If so, Fadell recommends taking into account three major factors. First, ensure that your long-term goals complement each other. Second, know exactly what potential benefits this merger will provide. Third, evaluate how well your cultures mesh together—if your core values are contradictory, you’ll face issues. (Shortform note: If you’re considering selling your company, _The Hard Thing About Hard Things _author Ben Horowitz recommends asking yourself two questions: Is the market still growing, and do you have a realistic chance at being number one in the market? If the answer is yes to both, don’t sell. You’ll likely estimate a lofty valuation for your company that no one will be willing to meet.)

### How to Create a Product-Based Business

Now we’ll share Fadell’s advice on how to create a product-based business (a business that sells a tangible item). We’ll first discuss the three stages of building your product-based business: Get ready, discover your story, and release and evolve your product. Then, we’ll describe Fadell’s strategies for handling three major problems you may face: a lack of funds, a lack of work/life balance, and a potential catastrophe.

#### Get Ready

Fadell asserts that being ready to start your own company requires that you **have an incredible idea**. A good idea proposes a solution to a real, tangible problem that people face consistently in their daily lives, and it has a clear _why_ , or reason, for existing. Moreover, it’s something you can’t stop thinking about. If you’re going to commit years of your life to an idea, do research. What exactly are you getting yourself into? What issues might you face, and how might you get around those? If, after at least a month, you’re still excited by the idea, that’s a great sign that you should pursue it.

(Shortform note: Not all experts believe that having a great company _starts_ with a great idea. In _Built to Last_ , Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras argue that you should initially focus not on designing a great product but on designing a great organization. As long as you have that, you can try several products and stumble before finding your footing with the right product. But if you _do_ want a clear product idea, _The $100 Startup_ author Chris Guillebeau recommends that you find one by deciding upon a target audience, looking for ways that you can solve a problem they have, and paying attention to trends—like new technologies—that might spark ideas.)

Additionally, Fadell argues that you must **have the right experience and the right people**. You have the right experience if you’ve worked at a startup and learned how to effectively hire people you need when you need them. You should have also worked at a large organization so you have some understanding of the issues, such as corporate drama, that large organizations face. You have the right people if you have an experienced, trustworthy mentor and a cofounder who can support you. You should also have a clear list of five amazing people you can hire—most of whom have robust networks and could hire even more amazing people. (We’ll discuss how to hire the right people later on.)

(Shortform note: Fadell’s advice applies if you plan on growing your company from a startup into a large organization and thus need the experience to handle both. But if you started what _The $100 Startup_ ’s Guillebeau calls a microbusiness—a business that typically only involves one person—you wouldn’t need this experience, and you’d only ever need to hire others much later in the process if you wanted to expand a successful business. That said, experts suggest that you might still want a mentor, who can help you navigate unexpected challenges as you start your business.)

#### Discover Your Story

Once you have a good idea for a product, the experience to start a company, and the right people with which to build them, _how_ do you start building the product? The most crucial step, Fadell argues, is to **discover your story**. In other words, you must figure out _who_ wants your product and _why_ , design every conceivable aspect of your product around that story, and test to ensure that story works.

(Shortform note: _The Lean Startup_ author Eric Ries agrees that it’s crucial to keep your customers’ desires in mind when creating your product. However, he recommends that you figure out those desires as quickly as possible in order to maximize profitability. To do so, first figure out what you _think_ your customers want, then create a minimum viable product (MVP) to test whether they _actually_ want it. This MVP may involve no hardware at all; you could simply build a landing page that describes your product’s features and see how much traffic you attract.)

Fadell explains that thinking through the whole story with your team (especially marketing) is essential because it drives both _what_ you build and _how_ you sell it—to investors and later to consumers. Many companies focus too much on the product itself, because that’s what they think they’re selling; but in reality, a company sells an _experience_ with a product—from how the customer installs it to the customer service they encounter if they run into trouble. Thinking through every aspect of that story will help you build and provide the best possible experience.

(Shortform note: When thinking through your product story, keep your ego in check. Otherwise, you risk making some ill-advised choices—as the executives at Ford did when creating the Ford Edsel, a car that’s considered one of the biggest product launch failures of all time. In _Business Adventures_ , John Brooks argues that this happened because the egos of Ford’s executives, designers, and marketers led them to build a product based on what they thought consumers wanted rather than one that met the market’s _actual_ demands. Moreover, Ford built up marketing hype but failed to deliver on any of it; early Edsel buyers complained about subpar quality and reliability, and Ford stopped manufacturing the car just two years after its release.)

To tell an**** effective story,**** include three elements. First, remind people of the annoyance you’re solving so that they can get excited for the solution. Second, provide both logical _and_ emotional reasons that your solution is the best possible choice. Third, simplify technical concepts so that your customers can easily grasp them and relate them to others. If you struggle to determine your story, try writing a press release to clarify what you want your product to do and why it matters.

> **A Different Kind of Product Story**
> 
> _Building a Storybrand_ author Donald Miller also recommends writing down a good, multi-part story when building your product. But rather than a press release, he asserts that you should create a “storyline”: a document telling the story of how your brand helps customers achieve their goals.
> 
> Miller recommends that you include seven elements in this storyline. First, understand 1) what the customer wants _and_ 2) the problem that prevents them from achieving those desires. Then, get the customer to trust you by 3) _demonstrating_ that you understand their needs and 4) showing competence in dealing with this problem. Finally, 5) tell the customer to buy your product, 6) warn them of the consequences of not doing so, and 7) demonstrate the happy ending of buying your product.
> 
> Miller’s system doesn’t include information about explaining technical concepts with analogies, presumably because his text isn’t directed primarily towards technical companies. However, he does suggest another way to encourage word-of-mouth marketing: Implement a referral system that enables happy customers to recommend your product to others and rewards them for it.

#### Release and Evolve the Product

The next step is to release the product. Fadell asserts that what you focus on in each release will depend on which product generation you’re working on.

##### The First Generation

Fadell asserts that your first-generation product must be “disruptive”—it must represent some sort of fundamental shift in how people normally do things. You may need to disrupt multiple elements of the customer experience; Nest disrupted both the thermostat (by making it smart) and how it was sold (by selling it directly to consumers). But don’t disrupt so many elements that your product isn't immediately understandable. For example, the Segway, which was meant to disrupt transportation, failed in part because people didn't understand how to use it.

(Shortform note: Fadell’s definition of disruptive product aligns with that of _Crossing the Chasm_ author Geoffrey Moore, who contends that such a product requires the customer to change how she uses a product in order to adopt it. In contrast, _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ author Christensen suggests that a disruptive product disrupts the market; it initially appeals only to a certain niche but gains mainstream appeal as it evolves and grows more refined. However, Christensen does agree with Fadell that disruptive products like Nest often require retooling of other processes (like sales channels), which is why established companies often ignore them: Retooling their operations is too expensive.)

To create a disruptive product, Fadell recommends that you work within clear limitations. Keep your team and budget small; the larger these become, the more likely you’ll waste time and money building unnecessary features. Additionally, set a clear timeline: It should take between nine and 18 months to ship your first product. To stick to that, create several internal deadlines. Each team should have recurring deadlines to ensure that they’re producing what they need to; there should also be regular project updates to ensure that everyone is on the same page. Finally, set a deadline for completing the product. If, when you reach that point, your product does almost everything you wrote in your press release, it’s ready to launch.

(Shortform note: It will likely take much longer than you expect to ship your first product, as humans are subject to the planning fallacy: We consistently overestimate how long it will take us to finish a project _despite_ having clear evidence to the contrary. Creating several internal deadlines can help mitigate this fallacy, as we tend to be better at estimating how long it will take to finish short-term projects than long-term projects. Alternatively, set your deadline _later_ than you think you need; _Eat That Frog!_ author Brian Tracy recommends pushing it back by 20%. Setting a realistic deadline may help you combat the perfectionism that prevents you from releasing a product that’s mostly ready, agrees _Big Magic_ author Elizabeth Gilbert.)

If your launch fails, figure out _why_. Examine the data to determine whether your intuition was flawed or if something external harmed your launch. Once you know _why_ it failed, apply these lessons to your next launch—whether it’s a new version of this product or a new project entirely.

(Shortform note: Keeping your team and budget small may also make potential failures easier to tolerate. In _Creativity, Inc._ , Ed Catmull suggests that failure is often hard to accept because we don’t want all the resources we put into the project to go to waste; innovating in low-stakes environments that use fewer resources can circumvent this issue.)

##### The Second Generation

When creating your second-generation product, _don’t_ focus on disruption. Instead, improve upon the first generation without drastically changing the features that your customers have grown accustomed to. Now that you have real data from actual customers, making these improvements will rely more on this data than your opinion.

(Shortform note: Other experts add something else you shouldn’t change when updating your first-generation product: the name. Research suggests that if you change the name, your customers will expect drastically different features and may be turned off from using the product. To find out what you _should_ change, pay attention to any patterns you see in the data; understanding these patterns will help you make more informed decisions.)

Additionally, consider the timing. Fadell recommends that you release updates to your products on a predictable schedule; that way, your customers will know when to expect new products, and your team will have clear deadlines to work toward. He recommends releasing one to three smaller updates and one large launch each year.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest that you should change how often you release product updates depending on what stage your company is in. If your company is still growing, release product updates as soon as they’re ready to help build excitement. If your company is more established, create a release schedule, which allows developers to prioritize the most important fixes and builds customer anticipation ahead of the expected release dates. But be careful if you want to do _more_ than three smaller updates and a large launch each year; if you update your product _too_ often, your customers will start to ignore the news.)

##### The Third Generation

By the third-generation product launch, focus on making money. Fadell states that your first-generation product likely won’t make you money, as most customers are generally wary of new technology. Your second-generation product should allow you to recoup your investments; by this point, you should have fixed the issues in the first generation and made a better product that works well for your customers. The third-generation product is when you focus on profitability so that you can keep the business going.

(Shortform note: While Fadell suggests that you can wait until the third generation to grow profitable, in _Crossing the Chasm_ (which Fadell cites in his discussion of product generations), Moore warns that if your company runs on venture capital (and not its own profits), you risk developing a “welfare state mentality” and losing your sense of focus and urgency. Instead, Moore advises that you become self-sustaining on profits as soon as possible.)

#### Handling Problems

No matter how well your launches go, you’ll likely face problems in your business. Fadell recommends strategies for three common ones: a lack of funds, a lack of work/life balance, and catastrophes.

##### Lack of Funds

If you lack funds for your business, you’ll need to find investors. To do so, Fadell first recommends that you have a clear plan regarding how much money you desire and what specifically you’ll use it for. However, you should have enough money to last for a few months since that’s how long finding the right investors will take. Second, Fadell suggests that you **vet your investors carefully** since you can’t fire an investor even if they’re bad. Pay attention to how well they treat you when you’re pitching them. If they’re disrespectful, want too much (more than 22%), or have a poor reputation among other startups, look for someone else.

(Shortform note: The authors of _Blitzscaling _recommend looking for more money than you think you need and acting as if you have half of the funding you have access to, as you’re likely to assume a best-case scenario when raising money and underestimate the number of difficulties you’ll face. Additionally, keep in mind that no matter how well you vet a venture capitalist, how well they treat you when you’re pitching them, and how good their reputation is, their goal is not the same as yours. VCs need outsized returns on a few companies to make up most of the returns of their entire portfolio—so they don’t necessarily care if you fail, as long as one of their companies is a blockbuster.)

##### Lack of Work/Life Balance

Another problem you may face when building a startup is a lack of work/life balance. Fadell asserts that if you’re starting a business, you’ll likely spend most of your time at work; however, it’s essential that you**carve out _some_ time for yourself so that you’re able to lead effectively**. Get adequate sleep, nutrition, and exercise. Devote a few weekly blocks in your schedule for reflection so that you can give your brain an occasional break from work. If you’re overwhelmed with administrative tasks, hire an assistant so that you can focus on leading your team effectively. Finally, once the business is up and running, take vacations—and train yourself to let _other_ people on your team handle the business.

(Shortform note: In _Clockwork_ , Mike Michalowicz warns against Fadell’s approach, arguing that entrepreneurs who involve themselves in their company’s daily operations are prone to burnout. This isn’t because they’re neglecting their health and rest or are overwhelmed by administrative tasks. Rather, they don’t have time to improve the company framework (like its daily operations), so small issues grow into crises, and the entrepreneurs burn out while trying to manage these crises. Michalowicz advocates developing a hands-off approach to your business that allows you to focus on more visionary work—and then taking a four-week vacation to force your employees to learn how to operate without you.)

##### Catastrophes

Another problem you may face when building a startup is some form of “crisis” or catastrophe. When you encounter a catastrophe, your first priority is to fix the problem. As a leader, you should dive into the everyday work your team does so that you can figure out with them how to fix it. You must also communicate effectively with your customers, apologizing if necessary. Only once you fix the problem should you examine why it happened and adjust your processes to ensure that something similar doesn’t occur again.

(Shortform note: Other experts support Fadell’s recommendations for dealing with a crisis. In _Good to Great_ , Jim Collins argues that subpar leaders try to shift the blame or hide bad news when something goes wrong; in contrast, the most effective executives focus on figuring out and fixing the problem so that the same mistake doesn’t happen twice. And the authors of _Rework_ agree with Fadell that you should communicate your mistakes to your customers immediately to avoid unwanted media attention. If an apology is necessary, say “I’m sorry,” which sounds sincere, instead of “I apologize,” which sounds distant and standoffish.)

Then, Fadell recommends that you memorialize what happened. The narrative of how you successfully faced and fought through a catastrophe is important to your company; in the future, it will remind your employees that you can fight through another catastrophe because you’ve done it before. (Shortform note: In _The Hard Thing About Hard Things_ , Horowitz writes that you should talk about problems openly not because it motivates future employees, but because doing so sends the message that it’s OK to talk about problems—if an employee sees a problem, they’ll feel they can communicate it without fear of repercussion.)

### How to Create the Right Team

In this section, we’ll first discuss how to hire people effectively. Then, we’ll share how to keep those people engaged at the company. Finally, we’ll discuss the four types of people you need on your team.

#### How to Hire the Right People

The first key to building an amazing team, Fadell explains, is to hire the right people. This should be your company’s biggest priority in the growth stage, as the people will make or break your company. To do it well, Fadell recommends that you **develop a hiring structure that helps you decide whether the candidate will work well in the company** by letting the candidate’s internal customers (ICs) make hiring decisions. As discussed earlier, everybody in a company has ICs—the people with whom they share deliverables. For example, a writer’s IC is their editor, as that’s to whom they submit their manuscript. ICs should vet candidates so that they can ensure they’ll work well together.

(Shortform note: In _The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive_ , Patrick Lencioni agrees that hiring effectively is essential to building your company, but this is because hiring the right people ensures that everybody in the company abides by its core values. Therefore, Lencioni recommends assessing potential candidates based on both their resumes and how well they align with your company’s core values—the latter of which will better indicate the candidate’s potential. Lencioni also recommends that candidates be interviewed by potential team members, but he argues that they should be interviewed by _as many_ of them as possible—both to assess the candidates’ values and to determine how well they gel with the team.)

#### How to Keep People Engaged

Fadell suggests two strategies for keeping the candidates you hire engaged throughout their time with your company: Handle transitions well, and prioritize benefits over perks.

Fadell argues that **handling transitions well** is essential to maintaining your company culture—the intangible elements that your employees value—and thus keeping your employees happy. As your business grows, you’ll face “breakpoints”—transitions in sizes that will require you to change how your company functions. As your company adds more employees, you’ll need to refine job descriptions, hierarchical structures, and communication processes to ensure that everyone stays in the loop and your company runs smoothly.

(Shortform note: The authors of _Managing Transitions_ suggest an alternate framework for viewing the evolution of your company. _Changes_ are the external events that happen to your company; _transitions_ are the psychological processes by which your employees deal with change. Like Fadell, the authors agree that it’s essential to help employees manage these transitions psychologically by supporting the people impacted—not because you’ll lose the culture if you don’t but because the change you’re trying to implement will fail.)

Fadell explains that you must prep for these transitions, which inevitably cause big changes in employees’ roles and the company. Otherwise, you risk losing the culture that ties employees to your company—and thus the employees themselves. To do that, ensure that the culture that grew organically in the early stages of your company remains even as you grow larger. Prior to each transition, ask everybody to write down what they love about the company and _exactly_ how they do things. Then, create systems to keep those things: Teach new employees what matters and how to follow old processes. As long as they’re written down, your company can maintain its culture—even as people leave.

> **Other Perspectives on Scaling Your Company**
> 
> In _The Hard Thing About Hard Things_ , Horowitz agrees that you need to scale processes as your company grows. However, he suggests that you do so not when you hit a specific number but when adding a new employee feels harder than adding more work to your existing employees, and this feeling is preventing you from growing the team quickly enough to reach company goals. Moreover, he doesn’t advocate asking employees to define the processes they like so that you can keep them; rather, he recommends defining your ultimate goal, figuring out what steps you need to reach it, measuring the success of each step, and holding someone accountable for that success.
> 
> That said, Andrew Grove, who wrote _High Output Management_ and whose ideas Horowitz supports, _does_ emphasize the importance of culture; he argues that management must develop and establish culture by both explaining and demonstrating how to do things. But this is not to keep your employees happy; rather, it’s a way to get your employees to behave in the way _you_ want them to, as people’s behavior is controlled by culture.

Additionally, Fadell urges you to **prioritize benefits over perks**. Benefits are non-wage compensation, such as medical insurance; perks are fun bonuses, such as massages. Fadell warns that giving employees perks is dangerous: When people constantly get gifts, they don’t value the gift as much—but they still get upset if someone takes that gift away. So save your limited funds for benefits, which people value more.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree with Fadell’s definitions of benefits and perks, but they name a third type of reward that companies give: performance-based rewards-,The%20Difference%20Between%20Benefits%20and%20Perks,work%20on%20a%20particular%20project.), which are perks that employees receive only if they meet a certain standard. No matter the type, perks may be more important than Fadell realizes: They can help you attract and retain top talent—especially if you provide the most coveted types, like flexible schedules and extra training.)

#### Who You Need on Your Team

Fadell explains that you’ll need four types of people on your team: great product managers, the right salespeople, a good lawyer, and an amazing board.

##### Great Product Managers

A great product manager understands what the customer wants, communicates those desires to the team building the product, and later translates them into a marketing message to share with potential customers. For example, one female Nest product manager helped the team building a security alarm realize that mothers wanted reassurance when they were home with their kids. In response, the team built in a feature that allowed customers to open doors from inside without triggering the alarm but kept the system active so that it would alert you to intruders. This feature helped Nest tell its female customers why they should buy the product.

> **Other Characteristics of Good Product Managers**
> 
> In _Inspired_ , Marty Cagan agrees that a product manager must understand the customer’s desires and help the product-building team build features that meet those desires. However, he argues that the product manager should communicate what the product does to the marketer rather than _create_ the marketing message herself.
> 
> Whatever role the product manager fills in your company, pay attention to how well they meet your customer profile. At Nest, a female product manager noticed female customers’ concerns; often, men are unreceptive to women’s concerns because they don’t have personal experience with the issues women face, as Caroline Criado-Perez points out in _Invisible Women_. This may be an issue with product managers, who are mostly men.

##### The Right Salespeople

Fadell suggests that you **find salespeople willing to work outside of the traditional commission model**. If your salespeople’s salaries depend only on whether the customer _buys_ the product, they’re incentivized to sell at all costs. As such, they may treat the customer poorly—perhaps by misleading them about product features. Instead, implement a vested commission strategy. Incentivize the salespeople to treat potential customers well by giving them part of the commission when they sell, and the full commission the longer the customer stays with the company.

(Shortform note: Other experts suggest that salespeople are incentivized to sell at all costs and mislead potential customers about products if they’re operating on an _exclusively_ commission-based model. If you or the salespeople you want to hire are skeptical of a vested commission strategy (perhaps because they’re worried that the customers will leave due to unforeseeable reasons), try offering your salespeople a base salary plus commission: Having that base salary as a cushion will make salespeople less likely to resort to misleading sales tactics, but the commission structure will still encourage them to sell.)

##### A Good Lawyer

To run any business, you must make legal decisions. At some point, it will be more cost-effective to hire your own lawyers instead of continuously outsourcing legal issues. Fadell recommends **hiring a lawyer familiar with your business’s core competencies**. A generalist won’t be able to advise you effectively without hiring other specialist lawyers and will also lack the legal expertise to advise those specialists effectively. So you’ll spend more money to get worse advice.

(Shortform note: Another route you can follow when building a legal team is to hire a startup lawyer—someone who's experienced in the legal ins and outs of funding and starting a company. These lawyers can help you find the legal specialists you need; just read your agreement carefully to ensure that the startup lawyer doesn’t make an unreasonable amount of money from doing so.)

Fadell also cautions against**blindly following your lawyer’s advice**. Success often requires taking risks. A good lawyer will inform you of the potential legal consequences of those risks; a great one will help you find a better workaround to accomplish your goals. But ultimately, only _you_ can decide what’s worth the risk. (Shortform note: Other experts note another sign of a great (and not just good) startup lawyer: They’ll connect you to a wide range of experts—both in and outside the legal fields—who can help your business.)

(Shortform note: It’s not just business success that requires risk-taking. In _Who Will Cry When You Die?,_ Robin Sharma argues that living a full personal life also requires taking risks. But many of us are risk-averse, no matter how well your mentors (or lawyers) advise you. If you want to be less fearful of taking risks, try practicing with low-risk and low-pressure decisions. For instance, take the risk of purchasing a new toothpaste brand. From there, you can slowly build up to taking bigger risks.)

##### An Amazing Board

Fadell writes that once you’re CEO, you’ll also need to **create a good board** : These are the people you’ll turn to for advice and the ones who can fire you if you do poorly.

Creating a good board requires that you include four types of people: a master networker who can introduce you to people who can help your business; investors, ideally those who are compassionate about the grind of building a company and not _exclusively_ focused on their potential returns; an operations person—someone who’s built a company before and whose brain you can pick; and finally, a chairperson—someone who facilitates the board meetings, addresses any bad blood between board members, and supports your vision with the board.

(Shortform note: _Trillion Dollar Coach_ provides further advice on creating and managing boards from Bill Campbell, whom Fadell mentions in _Build_ as a long-time mentor. In addition to having the specific expertise Fadell names, every board member should care deeply about the company and always be available and willing to get their hands dirty to help you do your job. If they don’t come prepared to meetings or contribute in any useful way, remember that you have the power to fire them; it’s not just the other way around.)
