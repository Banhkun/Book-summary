## Chapter 3: The Likeability Conundrum

The 2003 “Heidi/Howard” study tested perceptions of women and men in the workforce. Participants in one group got a case study of an entrepreneur named Heidi, detailing her “outgoing personality” and powerful network. A second group got the same profile, but with “Heidi” renamed “Howard.” Both groups were asked to give their impression of the entrepreneur.

The students _respected_ Heidi and Howard equally, but gave Howard greater _likeability_ scores. **They found Howard more appealing than Heidi, though it was the same story. The same data created different impressions depending on which gender it cited.** Heidi was seen as selfish; Howard was seen as appealing.

### The More Successful a Woman Is, the Less Likeable She Is

This study demonstrates the difference between likeability and success for men and women. The more successful a man is, the greater his likeability. The more successful a woman is, the worse her likeability.

Why is this? Professional achievement is considered a “male” attribute. If a man is high-achieving, it’s normal. If a woman is highly successful, she is seen as pushy, unlikeable and unfeminine. This reflects traditional gender stereotypes: males are providers, decisive and driven. They’re given positive reinforcement for these traits. Women are seen as caregivers, nurturing and communal. They’re given positive reinforcement for _these_ traits.

**When women break traditional gender stereotypes** by displaying traits of professional achievement, such as being decisive and driven, **they're deemed “too aggressive,”** “not a team player,” and “difficult.” If a woman focuses on getting the job done instead of pleasing others, she’s acting like a man.

Consider these examples of women leaders who had unsavory nicknames:

  * Margaret Thatcher was called “Attila the Hen”
  * Indira Gandhi was called “the old witch” by Nixon
  * Angela Merkel is called “the iron frau” 



Heidi violated our stereotypes; Howard lived up to our expectations. **This bias is at the heart of why women are held back _and_ why they hold themselves back.**

### Downplaying Success for Likeability

Little girls learn early on that being branded the smartest or most successful can work against them. For Sandberg, being the smartest girl in class made her a target of derision, so she muted her achievements from a young age to fit in and be liked.

This tendency to downplay success follows women from the classroom to the workplace, which creates a problem: striving for success requires women to be able to discuss their achievements, but doing so impedes their likeability -- and **being liked is _a critical_ component of leadership.** When leaders are liked, they gain the support of others to get things done.

Men can claim credit for past accomplishments and be respected and liked, but women have to strike a balance between owning their success and being liked. For example, data shows that when a woman discusses previous successes in a job interview, she’s actually less likely to be hired -- she comes across as bragging. It’s a double-edged sword. **A competent woman doesn’t seem nice; if a woman seems _too_ nice she doesn’t seem competent.**

### The Gender Discount Problem

Women pay a financial price for being perceived as more communal: they often do more in the workplace without more reward. This is called the “gender discount problem.”

For example, if a man helps a colleague, that colleague is indebted to him and will return the favor. **A woman, on the other hand, is seen as “happy to help” and is less likely to have the favor reciprocated.** If a man is too busy to help a colleague, it’s not an issue, but if a woman is too busy, she is penalized with unfavorable reviews or fewer rewards. She’s damned if she does and damned if she doesn’t.

The gender discount problem comes into play when negotiating for compensation. Men tend to negotiate more than women. There’s no downside for them; they are _expected_ to advocate for themselves. **But when a woman negotiates, both men _and_ women react unfavorably.** She’s seen as demanding, violating the perceived gender norms. Even if her negotiations are successful she pays a long-term penalty in goodwill and future opportunities.

#### How can women negotiate successfully and still have people like them?

  1. **Show concern for the common good**. 
     * For example, women can say that by negotiating for themselves, they are acting on behalf of other women, to lower the pay inequality and set a standard for negotiating women.
     * When women use the word “we” instead of “I” the outcome is better. She’s indicating that she’s communal, a welcome female trait. 
     * Emphasize bigger goals, not just her own interests.
  2. **Offer a valid explanation**. 
     * Better outcomes occur when women justify their requests. Examples: “My manager suggested I discuss my compensation with you.” “My research shows me that compensation for this type of position is within this range.”
  3. **Guard against appearing _too_ nice**. 
     * When she’s too nice, others have a hard time seeing her as a leader. To succeed she has to mix niceness with persistence -- being “relentlessly pleasant.”



Sandberg knows that adhering to these unwritten rules is terribly unfair to women. But, she counters, it is reality; this advice is a means to an end in a world that works this way right now. When more women are in leadership roles, then we can change the rules as a society.

### Handling the Hate

Even while delicately balancing likeability and strong leadership, female leaders deal with resentment and wariness. When Sandbeg was hired at Facebook, she was trolled mercilessly online and told she’d ruin the company. It was devastating.

Women in leadership roles will **likely have to sacrifice some likeability for success.** Mark Zuckerberg**** even**** warned Sandberg that her desire to be liked could hold her back, saying, “**When you want to change things, you can’t please everyone.”**

To withstand the inevitable criticism, poor treatment and resentment, Sandberg’s advice is to

**let yourself react emotionally and then move on.** Real change will come as more women enter leadership positions. With more women in power, we’ll move toward a world where both men and women are comfortable with women leaders.
