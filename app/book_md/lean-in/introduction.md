## Introduction

Women in the U.S. and developed countries are better off today than the women who came before them -- the ones who fought for the rights women take for granted, such as voting.

They are certainly better off than women in countries without even basic civil rights. In too many places, women face incomprehensible struggles. In Afghanistan and Sudan, for example, most girls aren’t allowed an education. Worldwide, 4.4 million women and girls are trapped in the sex trade. There are places where rape victims are cast out of their homes or even jailed for “moral crimes.”

Women in the U.S. and developed countries have also made great strides academically and post-college, comprising 50% of college graduates by the early 1980s. Numbers have steadily improved for women in the areas of degrees earned, jobs taken, earnings made, and entering traditionally male-dominated fields.

But women can’t be complacent and rest on the strides already made. There is still a great deal of work to be done to create gender equality in the professional world.

  * **Gender inequality in the professional world and in roles of government leadership is still prevalent.** In the most important decisions that affect our world, women’s voices aren’t being heard. A the time of Lean In’s writing (2013), only 17 of 195 independent countries were run by women, and women held only about 25 percent of executive corporate positions. Numbers are even lower for women of color.
  * **Compensation in the workplace is unfairly unequal**. In 1970, women were paid 59 cents for every man’s dollar earned. In 2010, that number was 77 cents, prompting activist Marlo Thomas to joke, “A dozen eggs have gone up 10 times that amount.”



### Where Are Women in Leadership?

Author Sheryl Sandberg saw women excel in college; she observed an even mix of men and women in post-graduation entry-level jobs. Even if men still dominated leadership positions at that point, she thought the “glass ceiling” had cracked and it was just a matter of time until leadership roles were equally filled by women.

But as the years passed and Sandberg advanced in her career, her women peers diminished. Often she was the only woman in the room. She once asked where the women’s restroom was at a business meeting and no one knew -- no woman had ever been in that conference room before!

Sandberg realized the “revolution” in women’s equality had stalled. **Women were fading out of the workforce before reaching top-level, leadership positions** , stalled by internal and external barriers keeping them from advancing in their careers.

Externally, women face:

  * Sexism in the workplace, both overt and subtle.
  * Discrimination in the workplace.
  * Sexual harassment.
  * Workplaces unfriendly to the needs of parenting.
  * A lack of professional mentors.
  * Difficulties in getting promoted.



Internal barriers are perhaps more insidious; they’re not discussed as much and many women don’t realize these factors are holding them back. They include:

  * Lack of self confidence.
  * Reluctance to speak up.
  * Pulling back when they should be leaning in.
  * Internalizing gender-specific expectations of women.
  * Lower expectations of themselves.
  * Handling most of the home duties, compromising career goals for family.



In this summary, we’ll cover most of these issues and how to overcome them.

### How Do We Fix This?

This lack of women in leadership roles hurts everyone. Without gender equality in leadership, we’re not tapping half the pool of human resources and talent, so we’re not achieving and innovating everything that’s possible. Warren Buffett attributed his success in part to the fact that he was competing against only half the population.

More women in power will create better conditions for all women, expanding opportunity and fairer treatment. Women leaders would better understand the needs of working mothers, set an example for young women to follow, and ensure equality in pay and respect.

To get more women into leadership positions and begin the sea change toward gender equality, Sandberg advises women to focus on overcoming the internal barriers to success -- the things they _can_ control.

She wants women to “lean in,” which means to take risks and be ambitious in their professional goals. She urges women to speak up, gain confidence, and demand more help at home from their partners. In turn, she calls on men to be partners who understand what their wives, colleagues, mothers, sisters and friends are up against.

### Choices and Caveats

Sandberg understands that not every woman wants career success, or children, or both. But, she believes, it’s about having choices and opportunities. Women who _do_ aspire to positions of leadership should be encouraged on their journey.

Sandberg is criticized for being out of touch; she’s wealthy and has access to excellent help and childcare. She counters that the advice in this book is what she would have told herself when she was just starting out.

She has also been criticized for “blaming the victim”-- pressing women to lean in and take responsibility for their career growth and staying in the workforce. She disagrees; she believes female leaders are key to reaching gender equality, so she is focusing on what women can change. The institutional changes will follow when more women are in power.

(Shortform note: because the book is aimed at women, we’ll often address the reader “you” as though you’re a woman. But we’re aware that this book is useful for men to read, and much of the career advice is useful to men as well.)
