## Chapter 1: Women Are Missing in Leadership Positions

The experiences of the women in Sandberg’s family mirror societal changes through the years.

Her grandmother, born in the 1910s, was pulled out of high school to help earn money for the family. After a teacher insisted she return, she went on to graduate from UC Berkeley. Lore has it that when she left her job to get married it took four people to replace her. During her marriage, she saved her husband’s ailing business and even sold watches out of her car to raise money for a clinic -- turning a profit.

Sandberg’s mother, born in the 1940s, was treated equally with her brothers in terms of educational expectations. She graduated from UPenn and entered a Ph.D. program, but dropped out to become a stay-at-home parent and active volunteer.

Sandberg, her brother and sister, were all expected to achieve academically. In an era of increasing equality, she was raised to believe all career paths were open to her. In college, she saw both genders focus equally on academics; men and women were aggressively competitive. She and her friends assumed they would have careers _and_ children. The playing field finally seemed level.

But as Sandberg ascended to the top of the business world, **she looked around and realized she was a rarity**. Her male classmates from college still worked professionally, but of her high-achieving female classmates, some were professionals, some worked part time, and many stayed at home with children.

This mirrors the national trend of women’s journey through the workforce. **In the years after college, women tend to scale back and even drop out of the workforce.** This leads to companies and mentors investing in men, who are more likely to stay in the workforce.

So why did progress stall for women’s equality in the workforce just when the playing field seemed more level? There are a few reasons:

  * **Naivete turned to cynicism**. The years that jobs demand maximum input for advancement are the same years women start families. The workplace didn’t evolve to create flexibility for women with children, and partners didn’t evolve enough to share child-rearing and home duties. Women discovered that balancing a family and career is full of sacrifices and hardships.
  * **Academic skills don’t translate to the workplace.** Girls and women shine in the classroom, but academic success skills (compliance, raising hands) don’t translate to the workplace. Career success rewards taking risks and advocating for yourself. Girls are discouraged from these behaviors from an early age (more about this later).
  * **The “Leadership Ambition Gap**.” Fewer women than men aspire to the senior level jobs. This bears a more in-depth look.



### The “Leadership Ambition Gap”

Perhaps the biggest reason women don’t advance in the workforce is what Sandberg terms the “leadership ambition gap.” Data shows fewer women than men aspire to senior level jobs:

  * A McKinsey survey showed 36 percent of male employees wanted to reach senior leadership positions, compared to 18 percent of women. 
  * When jobs are described as “powerful” and “challenging,” they appeal more to men. 
  * More men use the word “ambitious” to describe themselves than women.



**This lack of leadership ambition in women starts before they enter the workforce.** A survey of college students showed that “becoming a manager within 3 years of graduation” was less of a career priority for women than men. (While strides are being made a bit with millennial women, there’s still a long way to go.)

The result: **more men _aim for_ leadership roles and more men _get_ leadership roles**. This pattern starts in childhood and grows stronger. Data shows that in middle school, more boys aspire to leadership roles when they grow up. At the top 50 colleges, more than two thirds of student government presidents are male.

(Some disagree with the idea of inherent lesser ambition in women, saying women are simply more enlightened with more meaningful goals than being a corporate executive. Sandberg doesn’t completely disagree and doesn’t dispute that women may have more innate nurturing tendencies. But, Sandberg argues, a desire for leadership is a culturally enforced trait, and our culture sends the leadership message to boys -- and not girls -- early on.)

There are several factors behind the leadership ambition gap:

  * **Ambition is a “dirty word” for women.** Men are applauded for being ambitious, but hard-charging women violate societal conventions. Hearing “she’s so ambitious” is not a compliment.
  * **Pressure to get married and start families**. Women are still under enormous pressure to get married, conditioned to prioritize marriage over career. Sandberg’s parents urged her to “marry young before all the good ones are taken.” Sandberg even rejected an international fellowship after college because it wasn’t good husband-hunting ground. 
  * **The workplace is unfriendly to working parents**. Once they become mothers, women know things will grow even more difficult at work. Without family-friendly policies, conflicts arise at work when you try to be a good employee and a good parent. (The good news: data shows kids, parents and marriages can flourish with two full-time working parents. More on this in later chapters.)



But perhaps the two biggest factors are:

  * Gender stereotypes limit girls from an early age.
  * Fear of failing keeps women from pushing forward.



#### Gender Stereotypes

Gender stereotypes imposed from birth encourage boys to see themselves as leaders and girls to see themselves as nurturers. This stereotype extends into adulthood, affecting how women behave in their careers.

**Boys and girls are treated differently even as babies.** Data shows mothers nurture girls more, offering more help and comfort; meanwhile, boys are encouraged to play by themselves. Moms overestimate baby boys’ crawling ability while underestimating that of girls.

Society soon chimes in to reinforce the stereotype. Sandberg recounts seeing Gymboree baby **onesies that read, “Pretty Like Mommy,” and “Smart Like Daddy.”** A viral video of 4-year-old girl in a toy store drives home the pressure: Upset by the sea of pink she’s supposed to like in the girls’ toy section, she laments, “Some girls like superheroes.”

As they grow, girls are actively discouraged from leadership.They are rewarded for being pretty and encouraged to be nurturing. **If a girl is assertive, she’s labeled “bossy.”** Sandberg recalls her childhood as a “bossy” girl, directing other kids’ play and organizing neighborhood shows. **These behaviors would have been seen as leadership traits, not bossiness, in a boy.**

School reinforces the stereotypes. Data shows teachers interact more with boys (calling on them, asking questions) than girls. Boys are more likely to shout out answers without raising their hand -- and get listened to. In contrast, if a girl shouts out an answer without raising her hand, she is more likely to be scolded.

The “stereotype threat” complicates the fight against stereotypes. Social scientists say when a group is made aware of a negative stereotype, they are more likely to perform according to that stereotype. For example, if girls are aware of the stereotype that boys are better at math or science, when they are reminded of their gender before a test (even something as simple as checking the box F for female), they perform worse. This phenomenon discourages girls from entering tech fields.

Stereotypes in the media help reinforce a negative image of women in leadership. Working women are portrayed as consumed by career with no personal life, like Sigourney Weaver in _Working Girl_ or Sandra Bullock in _The Proposal_.

Media stereotypes have real-world results: a survey showed that when there is a woman in a senior leadership role in a company, female subordinates say they “don’t want to be like her.”

When women accept the stereotype of a woman in management as negative, they are less likely to pursue opportunities for advancement.

#### Fear Is Holding Women Back

While men assume they can have successful work and family lives, women assume that doing both will be difficult to impossible. Women are afraid of the challenges they’ll face with a demanding job and family commitments. They’re afraid of not being liked, making wrong choices, drawing negative attention, and failing. They fear being a bad wife and mother.

Without fear, Sandberg asserts, doors open for women. They can pursue work, family, or both. They can take risks. **Sandberg urges women to fight their fears and pursue leadership boldly, without caring what other people think and what stereotypes say.** A sign in the Facebook office said: “What would you do if you weren’t afraid?” For Sandberg, this advice led to her writing _Lean In_ , something that initially scared her.
