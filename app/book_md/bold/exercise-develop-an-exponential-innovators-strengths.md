## Exercise: Develop an Exponential Innovator’s Strengths

Adopting an exponential innovator’s psychological strengths is crucial for creating successful innovations—ones that are completely novel and change the world in some way. This exercise will help you identify whether or not you’re exhibiting these strengths and how you can improve them.

* * *

To determine whether you’re thinking unconventionally and autonomously, consider the novelty of your recent innovative ideas. List these ideas below and ask yourself: What other products, services, or ideas like these currently exist? How easy or difficult was it for you to generate original ideas, and why? (For example, maybe you’re working on an idea for a new movie. Consider whether there are numerous other movies based on the same premise or framework.)

Which pieces of Diamandis and Kotler’s advice can you use to boost your unconventional and autonomous thinking? (For example, do you need to spend more time in a closed environment or around other unconventional and autonomous thinkers?)

To determine whether you’re comfortable with risks and failures, note down how often you take risks when innovating or sharing your innovation, how comfortable you are with doing so on a scale from one to 10, and what might be preventing you from taking risks more frequently. (For example, maybe you’ve only pitched your movie idea to one studio in three months. This is likely because you have a 3/10 comfortability with risk-taking due to your fear of rejection.)

Which of the authors’ recommendations can you follow to improve your comfort with risk-taking? (For example, you can get into the habit of experimenting more frequently to get more comfortable with failure, or you can seek more critical feedback to get comfortable with rejection.)

Finally, identify your larger purpose for innovating—how exactly do you want to change the world through your actions? (For example, maybe the larger purpose of your movie idea is to educate the world on the social pressures that Alaskan Yupik teens face during their coming of age.)
