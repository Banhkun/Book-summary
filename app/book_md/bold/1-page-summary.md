## 1-Page Summary

Over the past few decades, technology has fundamentally altered our way of life. According to Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler, it’s also changed the nature of business and the steps up-and-coming entrepreneurs must take to succeed. Technology has caused products and industries to develop at an exponential rate, making old ways of innovating and competing obsolete. If entrepreneurs fail to adapt to this new rate of change, their success will either be short-lived or nonexistent. To achieve and maintain success—the ability to change the world in some way—in the technological age, Diamandis and Kotler argue that **entrepreneurs must adjust their mindset and strategies so they’re always _ahead_ of the exponential curve.**

Diamandis is a physician, engineer, and entrepreneur. He’s founded over 20 companies, including The XPRIZE Foundation, Singularity University, Celularity, and Bold Capital Partners.

Kotler is an author, journalist, and entrepreneur. He’s published numerous best sellers, including the nonfiction book _The Art of Impossible _and the sci-fi thriller _The Devil’s Dictionary_. Both works explore the maximum potential of human minds and bodies. Kotler is also well-known as the founder of Flow Research Collective, a peak performance research and training organization.

Diamandis and Kotler are also the best-selling authors of _Abundance_ , which discusses how humanity can harness the power of exponentially growing technologies to support the basic needs of everyone on Earth.

This guide will present Diamandis and Kotler’s advice on how to become a successful, impactful innovator. Step 1 will discuss the psychological strengths and habits that exponential innovators use to stay ahead of the curve. Then, in Steps 2 and 3, we’ll explain how to tap into the power of human networks. Step 2 will explain how to gain credibility with a closed network of people you know personally, and Step 3 will explore how to leverage that credibility to achieve large-scale success with an open network of investors.

Throughout the guide, our commentary will discuss theories, methods, and advice on how to thrive as an entrepreneur and create an impactful, long-lasting brand, citing other business experts like Peter Thiel (_Zero to One_) and Keith Ferrazzi (_Never Eat Alone_).

### Step #1: Become an Exponential Innovator

**To achieve and maintain success in the digital era, the authors argue that entrepreneurs must become _exponential innovators_** —this means adopting a ceaseless commitment to creating daring and novel ideas, products, or services that change the world in some way. (The authors refer to this as having a “bold mindset.”)

Becoming an exponential innovator is important because, in the age of the internet, innovations are _never_ safe from competition. Once an idea or product is made available online, it develops at an exponential rate because anyone anywhere can instantaneously access and share it. This means that someone will inevitably use your idea to create something better. **The only way to avoid this inevitability is to ceaselessly innovate and** **outperform yourself before someone else does** —to become an exponential innovator.

There are two main components that make exponential innovators successful and that you must adopt to become one— _psychological strengths_ and _innovators’ habits_. Psychological strengths are the mental abilities that give you the confidence and motivation necessary to pursue daring ideas. Innovators’ habits are the strategies and techniques you rely on to develop daring ideas and bring them to fruition.

> **Has the Internet Sparked Exponential Growth, or Stagnation?**
> 
> In _Zero to One_ , Peter Thiel makes a similar claim to Diamandis and Kotler’s in _Bold,_ arguing that founding a successful business requires you to create something the world has never seen before. However, while _Bold_ ’s authors claim you should innovate by continually upgrading your existing innovations _and_ creating new ones, Thiel argues that it’s more effective to create unique, novel ideas from scratch each time.
> 
> Why do Thiel, Diamandis, and Kotler differ in their approach? It’s arguably due to their differing perceptions of the impact of technology on business. _Bold_ ’s authors argue that continually upgrading ideas is necessary because the internet has exponentially _increased_ the growth and development of innovations, meaning that someone will eventually develop an innovation that outperforms yours—unless you do it first. On the other hand, Thiel argues that novel innovation is crucial because the internet has led to the _stagnation_ of ideas, products, and services—we get caught up on a good idea and work on perfecting and globalizing it rather than developing something completely new (and better).
> 
> Despite this difference in perception, Thiel seems to agree with Diamandis and Kotler that having certain psychological strengths and habits is necessary for creating something the world has never seen before. We’ll explore how Thiel’s recommendations align with Diamandis and Kotler’s in later commentary.

The following sections will explain the major psychological strengths and innovators’ habits that Diamandis and Kolter discuss.

#### Psychological Strengths

According to the authors, to become an exponential innovator, **you must first develop psychological strengths that will allow you to handle the high-stress commitment to innovation and exponential growth**. These strengths will also allow you to successfully perform innovators’ habits. This section will explore each of these strengths and how you can maintain them.

##### Strength #1: Think Unconventionally and Autonomously

The authors explain that to create something truly novel that effects major change in the world, **an innovator needs to think _unconventionally_** —beyond the limits of what’s currently possible. Further, **unconventional thinking requires the ability to think _autonomously_** —without being fazed by the doubts and restraints of society. For example, wireless technology wouldn’t exist if innovators listened to the public opinion that it was simply a science fiction fantasy. Instead, innovators ignored societal doubts and changed the world.

(Shortform note: In _Zero to One, _Peter Thiel agrees that unconventional and autonomous thinking is one of the hallmarks of a great innovator. In his view, most people fail to develop novel ideas because they think all the questions in the world have either been answered or are unanswerable. To foster unconventional and autonomous thinking, Thiel recommends making a list of truths that no one else knows about—he calls these “secrets.” To uncover “secrets,” ask: What questions do mainstream people refuse to address or investigate? What do they overlook?)

##### Strength #2: Be Comfortable With Risks and Failure

Most people are afraid of taking risks because doing so introduces the potential for failure and loss. However, the authors explain that **repeated risk-taking and failure are keys to successful innovation** —you might have to try 20 different ideas before you find the one that works best.

(Shortform note: Experts explain that one of the best ways to get comfortable with risks and failure is to develop a growth mindset. People with growth mindsets focus on hope, improvement, and effort rather than on outcome and performance—the two factors that often contribute to issues like the fear of risks and failure. You can read more about developing a growth mindset in our guide to _Mindset_ by Carol S. Dweck.)

##### Strength #3: Know Your Purpose

The authors explain that the most successful innovators all have one thing in common: an underlying purpose that shapes their values and drives their innovations. **Having a purpose that you’re passionate about provides you with motivation in uncertain times and the confidence needed to take big risks.**

(Shortform note: Many business experts agree that having passion and having purpose are vital traits in a successful innovator. However, they warn of confusing passion with competence. Passion about a certain idea can make you overconfident, causing you to overestimate your competence—having passion doesn’t necessarily mean you have the skills and resources necessary to succeed. To avoid this trap, develop “innovation bipolarity”—the ability to argue passionately for your idea while, at the same time, honestly assessing the risks and barriers in your way, whether they’re surmountable, and what can be done to overcome them.)

##### Maintain Psychological Strengths With Inspiring Facts and Principles

The authors propose that **you can maintain these psychological strengths by creating a list of inspiring facts and principles about innovation**. When tough circumstances make you doubt yourself, you can revisit this list to rekindle your innovator's mindset and remind yourself of the strengths needed to succeed.

For example, recording a fact such as “turning a tree into a table must have seemed impossible until someone made it happen” can remind you of the importance of Strength #1—something that seems impossible can be accomplished through _unconventional and autonomous thinking_.

(Shortform note: In _Principles: Life and Work_ , Ray Dalio agrees that creating principles is one of the best ways to maintain your strengths and achieve success. He adds that the _most effective_ principles reflect your _inner character_ (or personality) and _individual values_ —these principles let people know what you stand for, help you manage difficult situations, and set you up for success _._ Effective principles should also be refined and perfected in an interactive loop: Set goals, follow your principles to achieve them, make mistakes along the way, reflect on your mistakes, adjust your principles and develop new ones, and then set bigger goals and repeat.)

#### Innovators’ Habits

In addition to describing psychological strengths, Diamandis and Kotler present a number of **strategies that successful innovators rely on to come up with ideas, products, and services that change the world**. Their recommendations can be condensed into four main habits, which we’ll explore below.

##### Habit #1: Back Your Innovations With Far-Reaching __ and Purpose-Driven Goals

First, the authors recommend backing your innovations with _far-reaching_ and _purpose-driven_ goals. **A _far-reaching_ goal is so big that it seems nearly impossible to the average person.** Creating far-reaching goals will hinge on Strength #1: the ability to think unconventionally and autonomously. **A _purpose-driven_ goal aligns with your values and aims to accomplish something higher than its basic purpose**. Creating purpose-driven goals will hinge on Strength #3: knowing your purpose.

For example, imagine that your innovation is a service that connects people who want to care for animals to animals in need. The far-reaching and purpose-driven goal inspiring that innovation might be to reduce the number of homeless, malnourished, abused, and injured animals in the world. This is an extremely ambitious goal that has a higher purpose of making the world a better, more humane place.

**Backing your innovations with _far-reaching_ and _purpose-driven_ goals is crucial because these innovations are the most impactful**—the kind that change the world in some way.

> **Create a Company Vision**
> 
> The _Bold_ authors argue that you must create far-reaching, purpose-driven goals to drive your innovations and, ultimately, achieve success. In _Traction,_ Gino Wickman makes a similar argument. He sees setting these goals as two steps to creating a _defining vision_ for your company that will lead to its success. Here’s Wickman’s full process for creating a defining vision:
> 
>   * Come up with a list of defining values for your company.
> 
>   * Create a 10-year goal (the far-reaching goal that _Bold_ ’s authors recommend), a three-year goal, and a one-year goal for your company.
> 
>   * Create a marketing strategy based on your core focus (the purpose underlying your company’s mission or your innovation, similar to Diamandis and Kotler’s purpose-driven goals).
> 
>   * Identify priorities for the next 90 days that will help you move toward your far-reaching goal and that align with your purpose.
> 
>   * Identify the issues preventing you from reaching your goals.
> 
> 


##### Habit #2: Create Micro-Goals That Build Your Credibility

The authors recommend breaking down your end goal of having a successful, world-changing innovation into _micro-goals_ :**smaller achievements intended to pave your way toward success by _building credibility._**

Having high credibility is crucial to success because it makes outside stakeholders, like customers and critics, see your innovation as _likely to succeed_. And once your innovation goes public, these stakeholders are the ones who’ll determine your success—they’ll either endorse your product, leading to success, or they’ll be unimpressed and you’ll fade into the background.

**To help identify your micro-goals,** **consider the steps necessary to complete your innovation and gain credibility in the industry** : Are there any skills or abilities you must demonstrate to the public? Any important contacts or supporters you should acquire?

For example, if your end goal is to establish an online platform that connects people who want to care for animals to animals in need, a few of your micro-goals might be:

  1. Hold a conference to discuss animal welfare and invite people and organizations dedicated to the cause, such as veterinarians, animal shelters, welfare societies, farms, and pet foster parents.
  2. Raise $1,000 every month to donate to animal welfare societies.
  3. Create a user-friendly website where members can sign up to either adopt an animal or advertise for an animal in need.



Ultimately, your micro-goals will build a track record that shows the public that you’re credible—you know what you’re doing, you’ve succeeded in the past, and you have other credible people supporting you.

> **Build Credibility by Starting With Your Online Presence**
> 
> Business experts generally agree that building credibility, and setting sub-goals to do so, is one of the best ways to achieve success and public acceptance as an entrepreneur. However, in today’s age of social media, some experts argue that the _best way_ to gain success is to focus your micro-goals on improving your _online image_ ’s credibility. This is because consumers are most likely to support products based on how they appear online and on social media. It only takes 0.05 seconds for someone to make their mind up about the product, so it’s crucial that your public image screams “credible!”
> 
> Experts make a few recommendations for creating micro goals that, when accomplished, will give your idea a credible online public image:
> 
>   * Perform a SWOT analysis of yourself and your brand to determine which _strengths_ you can use to improve your credibility, which _weaknesses_ are holding you back, which _opportunities_ you can take advantage of to boost your credibility, and which _threats_ might get in your way.
> 
>   * Update your social media accounts with new photos and bios that are authentic and showcase your values. Ensure that these images and bios are consistent across all your accounts.
> 
>   * Clearly showcase stats that will boost your credibility, using numerical figures specifically. For example, rather than tweeting something like “Eight thousand people logged on to our platform in the last day,” say “8,000 people logged on to our platform in the last 24 hours.” Words are less awe-inspiring than numbers.
> 
>   * Create partnerships with other credible people and brands in your industry. You can do this by attending online events or webinars.
> 
> 


##### Habit #3: Work in a Controlled Environment

**The authors explain that the best innovations occur in environments that are closed from the outside world** and only allow access to a select few who share your innovator’s mindset. This is because these environments encourage _unconventional, autonomous thinking_ and _risk-taking_ —as we’ve noted, two psychological strengths necessary for innovation. On the other hand, exposure to the predictability and doubts of wider society hinders these strengths.

(Shortform note: While the _Bold_ authors focus on _who_ is in your environment, the _setup_ of that environment is arguably just as important. Research shows that changing a few environmental factors might boost your innovative potential even more:__ for example, including random items around the environment for inspiration, using moderate levels of ambient background noise, decorating the space with creative colors like green and blue, and using softer lighting rather than bright overheads. These changes will boost your creativity and help you think outside the box—crucial elements for successful innovation.)

##### Habit #4: Experiment Constantly

**Finally, innovators must put their psychological strength of being comfortable with risk-taking and failure into action by _constantly experimenting_.** As previously discussed, the authors note that you must repeatedly experiment and fail before you can find a strategy or idea that works. The more experiments you conduct, and the more frequently you conduct them, the faster you’ll determine what works and the more progress you’ll make toward your goal.

(Shortform note: In _The Confidence Code, _Katty Kay and Claire Shipman __ agree that experimenting constantly and failing often are crucial to uncovering the best ideas. They also argue that experimenting and failing are crucial to _building confidence_ —in their view, the true key to becoming successful. Confidence is crucial for success because it turns desire and skill into actions that lead to success. Other techniques that will help you build confidence, and arguably improve your experimentation abilities, are 1) choosing action over stagnation, even when the action is risky; and 2) practicing thought exercises that encourage positive thinking and prevent rumination that might slow you down.)

### Step #2: Build Credibility With a Closed Network

Once you’ve adopted the psychological skills and innovators’ habits necessary to become an exponential innovator, you must create a support network. **Your support network will help** **advance your innovation from the infant stage—a good idea—into a large-scale success** : a publicly-endorsed innovation that has changed the world in some way.****

We’ve organized the authors’ ideas on networking into two themes. **First, create a _closed network_** of people that you have personal relationships with. These people will help you build credibility by offering the critical feedback, connections, and resources necessary for you to accomplish your micro-goals. The people in your closed network are specifically chosen by you.

**After creating a closed network and accomplishing your micro-goals, create an _open_ _network_** of people who may not know you personally but support—often financially—your innovation. These people will help you achieve large-scale success. Unlike your closed network, any member of the public can choose to join your open network.

> **Keith Ferrazzi’s Four Types of Support Networks**
> 
> In _Never Eat Alone, _Keith Ferrazzi agrees with the _Bold_ authors that building support networks is key to gaining professional success. While Ferrazzi’s framework is similar to the _open_ and _closed_ networks discussed in this guide, he recommends forming four specific types of networks rather than two:
> 
> **1)A network of people who will help you achieve your goals.** They actively help you identify goals, create plans to reach them, and hold you accountable. These actions align with those of your _closed_ network members.
> 
> **2)A network of mentors _._ **They provide professional advice, skill-development techniques, insider information, contacts, emotional support, and inspiration. These actions also align with those of your _closed_ network members.
> 
> **3)A network of super-connectors**—people who have dozens or hundreds of professional connections that they can share with you. The _Bold_ authors don’t discuss this specific type of _network_ , but the _role_ of these members would align with that of closed network members. In turn, they can help widen your _open_ network of people you don’t know personally or work closely with, but who may be willing to support your innovation.
> 
> **4)A network of prominent or famous industry leaders. **They teach you, boost your credibility, and attract outside supporters to your innovation (such as investors, customers, or other supporters: in other words, potential members of your _open_ network). These famous leaders may be part of your _closed_ network, if you know them personally or develop a close business relationship with them. Or, they might be more distant, _open_ -network acquaintances who are nevertheless happy to support you.

In this section, we’ll focus on the first part of building a support network: creating a closed network.

#### How to Create a Closed Network

There are two ways to build a closed network. **First,** **you can recruit in-person members who already know you** and who have seen you succeed in the past or want to see you succeed in the future. For example, you could recruit family, friends, colleagues, mentors, or past employers.

(Shortform note: The authors recommend first approaching people who already know you and want to support you. However, this isn’t always an option—what do you do if your family and friends _aren’t_ supportive of your goals? One option is to build close relationships from scratch by finding like-minded people on social media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, or other public forums. There are likely many other people in similar situations to yours who would be happy to trade their support for yours.)

**Second, you can recruit online members who will work closely with you for a small fee** —this is a common strategy called _crowdsourcing_. The authors note that this technique is especially useful because the internet now allows the average person to hire experts to do small but extremely helpful tasks. They recommend recruiting online members through websites like Freelancer or Fiverr.

(Shortform note: While many experts agree on the benefits of crowdsourcing in today’s age of technology, there are also a few downsides that you should be aware of before getting started. For example, ensure that you’re handing your intellectual property over to someone whom you trust to maintain confidentiality—if not, someone else could steal your idea. Further, crowdsourcing multiple freelancers adds complexity that makes your project harder to manage.)

In the sections below, we’ll discuss the three primary ways you can use your closed network members to accomplish your micro-goals and build credibility.

##### Use #1: Critical Feedback

**The first and easiest way to use your closed network to accomplish your micro-goals is to ask for their critical feedback—their opinions and advice**. For example, imagine that one of your micro-goals is to hold a conference to discuss animal welfare. You can make a request to your closed network—in-person members, online members, or both—to review the schedule you’ve designed for the conference. Or, you can request that they review and critique your topics for discussion or add topics to the list.

> **How to Request and Receive Feedback**
> 
> The authors recommend relying on your closed network members for feedback, but they don’t discuss how to request and receive feedback in a way that will actually help you improve. Experts make a few suggestions:
> 
>   * **Ask the right people.** Not everyone will have a _relevant_ perspective on your specific project. For example, your artist friend might not be the best person to ask for feedback on your website’s code.
> 
>   * **Prepare specific questions.** Rather than just asking for general feedback, ask something like, “How does my tone sound in this article, and do you think it fits with my purpose?”
> 
>   * **Review your feedback** and create a plan that will help you implement it.
> 
> 


##### Use #2: Connections

According to the authors,**the second way you can use your closed network to accomplish your micro-goals is by borrowing their credibility and connections.** The people in your closed network have likely built credibility in their own industries and have their own closed network that they can extend to you.

For example, members of your network might know important people who’d be interested in your animal welfare conference, such as veterinarians, animal shelter owners, welfare society presidents, farm owners, pet foster parents, and so on.

**Gaining public support from these secondhand connections will boost your public credibility.** Some of these connections might even decide to become a member of _your_ closed network, extending your web of connections further _._

(Shortform note: In _Never Eat Alone, _Keith Ferrazzi also emphasizes the importance of borrowing the credibility and connections of network members. As previously noted, he calls these types of members “super-connectors.” He explains that there are eight types of super-connectors you should try to recruit to your closed network: high-class restaurateurs, headhunters, political lobbyists, politicians, fundraisers, PR professionals, journalists, and social media gurus. These people are likely to have dozens, if not hundreds, of professional contacts that they can share, and who can help you succeed.)

##### Use #3: Resources

The third way you can use your closed network to accomplish your micro-goals is by gathering resources. **The authors recommend requesting that your _in-person_ closed network _donate_ resources to your cause.** For example, you could request your network members make donations for your conference—money, podiums, chairs, tables, food, and so on. You can also request that specific members donate specific resources—for example, if one of your network members owns a hotel, you can ask to use their conference room for the event.

**_Online_ closed members can be recruited to provide resources in exchange for a small fee. **This will be especially useful to complete smaller tasks that are important but that you might not have the time or expertise to do yourself. For example, you might want to create a poster to advertise your company, but you’re not a design expert—you can hire someone to do this for you. Or, you might want to create a video introducing your innovation at your conference, but you don’t know how to edit—crowdsourcing allows you to easily find someone who does.

> **How to Gather Resources From In-Person and Online Members**
> 
> Gathering resources from closed network members may present various challenges. Asking friends and family for donations—especially monetary donations—can be difficult. Furthermore, when trying to hire online members, you’ll have to compete with thousands of other employers. So, how do you avoid the awkwardness of asking for money and actually get people to apply for your job listing?
> 
> Experts make a few recommendations to help avoid the awkwardness of asking for donations. First, affirm that your relationship is more important than any donation they make, so if they don’t donate, that’s alright. Second, acknowledge that it feels weird to be asking for donations—this helps to break the ice. Third, periodically share the progress you’ve made with their donations. That way, they’ll know that their money went to good use.
> 
> Other experts suggest keeping the following tips in mind when creating a listing to draw top freelancers: First, indicate flexibility in the listing title, like “work from home” or “remote.” Second, post early in the week—candidates view postings most often on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Third, include the details of compensation, such as your budget and whether the pay is hourly, fixed, or based on milestones.

### Step #3: Reach Large-Scale Success With an Open Network of Investors

The third step in creating a successful innovation, and the second part of building a support network, is to **create an open network of members of the public who’ll provide you with the finances and popularity necessary for your innovation to succeed.**

Why do you need an open network to succeed? Diamandis and Kotler elaborate that the final step to releasing your innovation with high credibility is to capture public attention through excellent advertising and press coverage. This will allow your innovation to reach as many people as possible and achieve true success—the ability to change the world in some way. However, the necessary publicity requires more funds than your closed network members can provide—hence the necessity of open network members who’ll invest in your cause.

> **Are Investors Necessary for Large-Scale Success?**
> 
> In _Rework, _Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson claim that instead of seeking an open network of investors to fund the final stages of your product release, you should actually avoid outside funding altogether. Gathering outside funding comes with strings like having to please investors rather than customers, and they claim that it’s very possible to successfully launch your product _without_ outside funding.
> 
> Fried and Heinemeier Hansson suggest the following methods to successfully publicize your innovation without outside funding:
> 
>   * Get free advertising by posting blogs, tweets, or promotional Instagram videos online.
> 
>   * Teach people about your business or industry for free. People who are interested will also likely become supporters of your innovation.
> 
>   * Show people how your product is made by giving tours of your “factory” or creative space.
> 
>   * Avoid press releases. The media usually ignores them. Instead, personally write to journalists who might be interested in explaining why your company would make a good story.
> 
>   * Choose small media companies in your niche area over big media companies who’ll likely ignore you.
> 
> 


#### When to Recruit Your Open Network

Diamandis and Kotler state that you should start recruiting open network members when you meet the following criteria:

**1) You have a solid closed network of members who are willing to help you.** You’ll need further support while running your campaign to recruit investors.

**2) You’ve completed the majority of your micro-goals and have sufficient credibility.** This credibility will be important when convincing people who don’t know you that you and your innovation are worth supporting.

**3) You have a draft model of your innovation and are close to completing the final model.** People need to have an idea of what exactly they’re supporting before they commit.

(Shortform note: Some experts agree that a strong team (closed network) and high credibility are necessary before seeking outside funding. However, they argue that having a prototype at this stage isn’t always necessary or possible—especially if your prototype is expensive and you need outside funds to build it. In this situation, you’ll need two additional criteria before seeking investors. First, you must be able to show investors that you have _skilled_ team members with talent and experience in the industry (not just a _supportive_ team). Second, you must provide an exact time frame indicating how long it’ll take for you to build a deliverable prototype.)

#### How to Create an Open Network

The authors explain that a proven, reliable way to recruit open network members is to start **a fundraising campaign where each investor receives a small return for their contribution** —this strategy is called reward-based crowdfunding. For example, if someone contributes $25, they’ll receive a sticker, and for $50, they’ll receive a bandana.

This technique is beneficial because it tends to attract people who are truly interested in your innovation or purpose _,_ and offering a reward provides them with a deeper connection to your cause. As a result, these supporters are likely to be regular contributors to your cause—either through further investments, by becoming customers, or by spreading the word about your innovation and increasing its popularity. You can recruit these members by posting your campaign on crowdfunding websites such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter.

(Shortform note: Some experts agree that reward-based crowdfunding is a great way to attract individuals who'll support your product before _and_ after it’s released. However, it can arguably become more expensive than originally planned due to hidden costs like taxes, packaging materials, shipping costs, and so on. To minimize these expenses as much as possible while still compelling investors to support you in the long run, experts emphasize offering unique, exclusive digital rewards over material items: for example, a digital tour of your creative space or a video explaining how the product’s made.)

There are three main tasks for creating a successful crowdfunding campaign:

##### Task #1: Determine Your Financial Goal

**First, determine how much money you need.** This will be the financial target attached to your campaign and what investors will see when they donate. The authors emphasize that this number must be _realistic_. You likely won’t be able to support your _entire_ project with these funds; rather, they should offset _some_ of the costs. You’ll need to provide some of your own money as well, which you’ll make back once your investment starts generating revenue.

**To determine your financial goal, consider the following factors** : What’s the minimum amount of money you need to raise to launch (keeping in mind that you’ll be spending your own money as well)? How much will the rewards for investors (stickers, bandanas, and so on) cost? How much will credit card and platform fees (like Indiegogo’s fee) cost?

> **How to Calculate Your Financial Need and Goal**
> 
> The authors of _Bold_ explain that you should determine your financial goal by first identifying how much money you need to move forward and then adding associated costs like rewards and platform fees to that amount. Other experts agree with this general framework for calculating your financial goal. However, they provide important details on how to calculate your initial financial need that the Bold authors leave out.
> 
> To determine how much money you need to move forward, experts explain that you should consider _all_ costs involved, such as rights acquisition, labor expenses, sales and distribution, marketing, equipment, and administrative costs. Once you’ve determined this amount, you can subtract the amount you’re willing to spend from your own pocket. Finally, experts recommend increasing this number by 33% to leave room for unexpected costs.

##### Task #2: Create a Timetable

**Next, determine how long your campaign will run.** The authors note that most campaigns are between one and four months, but shorter campaigns (under two months) tend to do better. The length of your campaign will primarily depend on your financial goal—larger financial goals, such as raising hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, will take longer to reach.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that it’s crucial to create a timetable for your campaign, but some add that the perfect campaign length is exactly 31 days—regardless of the size of your financial goal. This is largely due to the natural rate of donations over time. All campaigns face a spike in donations at the beginning and end of their campaign, with a drop in donations in the middle—this drop is called the “dead zone.” Because of the dead zone, these experts argue that longer campaigns don’t generally raise _more money_ ; rather they just waste _more time_ trying to do so.)

##### Task #3: Create a Meaningful Message

Finally, to make people _want_ to support you, you must convey the purpose-driven goal that underlies your innovation in a moving way. To do this, the authors recommend creating a story with a logical progression and emotional appeal, explaining what your innovation will do for people and why it’s important. This story should also be crafted to suit your target audience and use keywords that will appeal to them, and it should feature on your campaign page.

> **7 Steps to Creating a Meaningful Message**
> 
> The authors of _Bold_ recommend creating a meaningful, logical, and emotionally appealing story to influence people to engage with your campaign. In _Building a StoryBrand, _Donald Miller agrees and presents a more in-depth, seven-step method to help you do so:
> 
>   * Start your story by pinpointing a desire that the customer has but is unable to reach (the thing that your innovation will help them achieve).
> 
>   * Next, identify the problem that’s getting in the customer’s way of reaching their desire (what your innovation will help them overcome).
> 
>   * Then, introduce yourself (or your brand) as a mentor who once faced the same problem but learned how to overcome it and can help customers do the same.
> 
>   * Afterward, present a plan that will help the customer overcome their problem and reach their desire (explain how your innovation will solve their problem).
> 
>   * Next, call the customer to action (urge them to buy or support your innovation).
> 
>   * Then, explain what’s at stake if the customer _doesn’t_ take action (how the problem will continue getting in the way of their desire).
> 
>   * Finally, close your story with a happy ending (describe how the customer will achieve their desire once they’ve bought or supported your innovation).
