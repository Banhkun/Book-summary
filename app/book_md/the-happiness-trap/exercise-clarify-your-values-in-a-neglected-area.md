## Exercise: Clarify Your Values in a Neglected Area

Psychologists Kelly Wilson and Tobias Lundgren identified four domains in which we should know our values: relationships, education and work, personal development and wellness, and leisure.

* * *

In which of the four domains are you least clear on your values? Why do you think that’s the case? For instance, you may not have clear values around leisure because your family prioritized work or success over personal enjoyment.

To clarify your values in this domain, walk through Harris’s values clarification questions. Which values have you identified?

Which values in this domain might warrant changing and why?

What actions can you take that align with your new understanding of your values?
