## Exercise: Practice Being Mindful

Connection, according to ACT, means using our observing self to shift our attention away from the past and future to fully engage in the present moment, or achieve mindfulness.

* * *

Describe a recurring experience in which you would like to be more mindful of or attentive to your environment—for instance, when your child comes to you to describe her school day.

What is typically the biggest barrier to you being mindful during these experiences? For example, you may still be thinking about your workday when you see your child after school.

What would you gain from being more mindful during these moments?

Which of Harris’s exercises could you practice right before or during the experience next time? For example, you could practice the “Five Things” exercise before picking your child up from school.
