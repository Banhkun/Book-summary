## Exercise: Distance Yourself From a Negative Thought

Defusion allows you to separate yourself from your thoughts, so you can simply accept and consider negative thoughts rather than being engulfed by them.

* * *

Recall a situation in which you “fused with” or treated a negative thought or feeling as reality. Was the thought helpful—why or why not?

Reflecting on this thought or feeling, walk through one of Harris’s defusion exercises to distance yourself from it. Describe the process.

After the exercise, does the thought or feeling seem any different (for example, less urgent or less definitive)? If so, in what way?

How can you be more accepting and analytical toward a negative thought or feeling in a similar situation next time?
