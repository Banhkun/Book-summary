## Exercise: Surf an Urge

Urge surfing can help you accept problematic urges, and act on them constructively.

* * *

Describe an urge, or tendency to act, that you’ve struggled with in the past, such as an urge to play video games rather than complete a work project that’s due.

Go through Harris’s five steps of urge surfing to accept the urge and decide what action to take. Which step was the most difficult and why?

What action did you decide to take and why? How was it different from what you’ve done in the past?
