## Exercise: Consider Which Impairments You Currently Face

Now that you’ve read about Lencioni’s five team impairments and how to work through them, think about which impairments are currently holding your team back or preventing you from fully committing yourself to a team or company.

* * *

If you’re currently part of a team, which of the five impairments (distrust, lack of healthy disagreements, lack of unity, fear of accountability, or self-interest) do you think the team struggles with most, and why? If you’re not on a team at the moment, which impairment do you anticipate you’d personally struggle with on a team, and why? For example, maybe you’re uncomfortable with disagreements (lack of healthy disagreements), or you can’t imagine yourself publicly supporting a decision you think is wrong (lack of unity).

Whether you’re currently on a team or not, what’s one thing you can do _today_ to start overcoming the impairment you identified in the previous question? For example, if you have trouble building trust with others, you might start by sharing an amusing anecdote about yourself with your coworkers at lunch; by sharing a personal story, you’ll leave yourself slightly vulnerable and thereby start establishing trust with your colleagues.

Think about a personal goal. How could helping a team or company achieve its goals help you to achieve that goal? This answer might be as simple as getting a steady paycheck to help fund your goal, or as complex as finding a team or company with a mission you believe in and then doing your part to help them realize that mission.
