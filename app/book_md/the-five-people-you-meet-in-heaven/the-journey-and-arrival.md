## The Journey and Arrival

Eddie did not get to witness anything after his final breath. He didn’t see the cart shatter or the crowd on the pier. He remembers the little girl’s face as she cried and the feeling of her hands in his. _Then what?_ He wonders if he was able to save her.

Eddie is floating in the sky, which turns from pink to yellow to green to sapphire. He feels calm. Any pain or sadness he had in life has vanished. He wonders where his worry has gone. Now, he is dropping towards a colorful ocean, but he is not afraid.

Eddie wakes up in a teacup. Though his instinct is to reach for his cane, he realizes it isn’t there and he doesn’t need it. His back doesn’t hurt. His knee doesn’t throb. He jumps out of the teacup and lands awkwardly on the ground. Three things strike Eddie as odd:

  * He feels great.
  * He is completely alone.
  * He is still at Ruby Pier. But it’s the Ruby Pier he knew as a young boy, 75 years ago.



Eddie begins to walk around and take in his surroundings. Realizing he feels no pain, he starts to run for the first time in 60 years - the first time since the war. He runs and leaps and tries to fly like a child would. He only stops when he hears a voice.

Looking towards a large theater, Eddie realizes it’s the voice of a barker announcing a freak show. As a kid, Eddie always felt bad for the cast of the freak shows and how they were forced to sit behind bars while people pointed at them. For some reason, he still walks inside.

In the dark hall, he sees a man sitting alone. The man’s skin is blue. Eddie has seen this man before.

The Blue Man says, “Hello, Edward... I have been waiting for you.”
