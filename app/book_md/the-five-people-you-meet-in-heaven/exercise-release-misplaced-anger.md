## Exercise: Release Misplaced Anger

Ruby teaches Eddie that his anger with his father has been acting as a poison against him. Consider what anger or resentment you could release from your life.

* * *

Think of a time when you blamed someone else for something that went wrong in your life. How did your anger or resentment toward that person change your attitude toward your own life?

Write a short letter of forgiveness to that person, and try to release any grudge you might still hold toward them.
