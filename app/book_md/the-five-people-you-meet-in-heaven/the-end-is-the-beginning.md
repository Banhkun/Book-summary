## The End Is the Beginning

This story begins at the end, on the day that a man named Eddie dies. **Like most endings, Eddie’s death is also a beginning** , even though he doesn’t know it.

Eddie spends his final hour at Ruby Pier amusement park, a place that he has worked for most of his life. He is the maintenance man, so his job is to maintain and fix the park’s many rides, attractions, and games. After so many years, he can detect problems with the rides just by listening to them. He is an old, resilient man. He has the stature and dress of a workingman, which is exactly what he is.

Eddie walks with a cane now because of a knee injury he got in the war. He has white hair and a strong, barrel chest. Despite Eddie’s past of alley fights in his youth, the park’s regulars trust Eddie and children like him. Many people have taken to calling him “Eddie Maintenance,” like it says on his name tag. He doesn’t think that’s funny.

Today is Eddie’s 83rd birthday. If he had known he was about to die, he would have gone somewhere else and done something new. He had always dreamed of leaving Ruby Pier behind and starting a different life. But he never got around to leaving after the war. So, he goes about his last day as he did every other.

With thirty-four minutes left to live, Eddie walks into the amusement park maintenance shop. There, he talks with Dominguez, one of the fellow workers. Dominguez tells Eddie that he is planning a trip to Mexico with his wife. Eddie takes out 40 dollars, hands it to “Dom,” and tells him to get his wife a nice gift. Then, he walks away.

With only 19 minutes left in his life, Eddie goes to sit in his special spot. It’s an old aluminum beach chair that he has placed behind the ride where he first met his late wife Marguerite. The ride used to be called the Stardust Band Shell in those days. The night they met, Eddie and Marguerite danced together on the boardwalk. Listening to the sounds of the ocean, he visualizes that moment, which he considers the snapshot of true love. Eddie used to think of his wife all the time, but lately, he tries to forget the pain like an old wound.

Eddie’s daydream of Marguerite is interrupted by a young girl with blonde curls. Eddie has seen her around the park many times before, but can’t remember her name. Annie? Amy? She asks him to make her an animal out of the pipe cleaners he is known to carry in his front pocket. He twists up a small, yellow bunny for her, and she dances away, smiling.

All of a sudden, Eddie hears screams and immediately knows something is wrong. Looking up, he sees the cart of the Freddy’s Free Fall ride dangling at a dangerous angle. The passengers are terrified. He calls to Dom and the rest of the park maintenance and security teams. He gives everyone directions of how to handle the situation. He tells them to evacuate the passengers from the ride, then send the broken cart down to be examined.

Eddie could never have known this, but a few months earlier, a young man lost his car key at Ruby Pier. He had been keeping it in his jacket pocket while he rode the rides. As it turns out, the key had fallen and become lodged in Freddy’s Free Fall and had been slowly wearing away at the cable. There was no way to see that this was happening. **Every person’s story overlaps with someone else’s**.

Just as the passengers are being taken off the dangerous ride, Eddie realizes that there must be something wrong with the cable. He screams for Dom to keep the cart at the top, but it’s too late. He sees the cart hurling toward the ground. Just underneath, the little girl with the pipe cleaner bunny is crying out for her mom.

Without hesitation, Eddie runs toward the girl, ignoring the pain in his injured knee. He jumps toward her and feels her small hands just before the impact and a flash of light. Then, he feels nothing.

> **Eddie’s First Birthday**
> 
> In a crowded hospital room in the 1920’s, Eddie’s father smokes a cigarette and waits. Finally, a nurse enters and calls his name. He is shown into the nursery where the nurse passes several babies that aren’t his. Then, she nods towards a tiny baby in a blue cap, covered in a blanket. The father takes a deep breath and cries happy tears.

> **Eddie’s Fifth Birthday**
> 
> On a Sunday afternoon at Ruby Pier amusement park, Eddie plays with his birthday presents. He got a red cowboy hat and a toy holster. Eddie’s dad plays cards with his fellow maintenance men while his older brother, Joe, does push-ups to impress women.
> 
> All of a sudden, a man named Mickey Shea picks Eddie up, turns him upside down, and gives him his “birthday bumps.” According to the Irish tradition, he lifts and lowers Eddie until his head bumps the floor one time for each of his five birthdays. Eddie does not like being upside down.
> 
> Once it’s over, Eddie weakly punches Mickey in the arm and tries to run away. Eddie’s mom picks him up, gives him a hug, and walks with him along the pier. Holding his mom’s hand and hearing her call him a good boy makes everything in the world feel right-side-up again.
