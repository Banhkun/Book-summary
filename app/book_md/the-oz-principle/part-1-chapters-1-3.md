## Part 1 | Chapters 1-3: Accountability Is the Key to Achieving Your Goals

_The Oz Principle_ opens with a big-picture view of the core ideas, which essentially boil down to this: You have the power to make your life better, even when you may think that you don’t. From there, we’ll discuss how a victim mentality might be holding you back and how accepting the authors’ definition of accountability instead can empower you.

### What Is the Oz Principle?

The authors use the story of _The Wizard of Oz_ to teach people—from individuals seeking to improve their personal lives to company leaders trying to push their teams to new heights—how to get what they want. The lesson from _The Wizard of Oz_ is:

  * No one is going to give you the things you want or need. But you have the power to achieve them yourself—as long as you don’t get stuck in a victim mindset.



_The Oz Principle_ lays out a journey from a mindset of victimism to one of _accountability_. The authors argue that the most common problems that plague companies—low productivity, slow innovation, and poor morale—can be solved. But there aren’t any tricks or shortcuts. Working through those problems requires people to take responsibility and hold themselves accountable, individually and then companywide.

**Accountability is the bridge or behavior that moves you from victimism and failure to success.** Thus, succeeding through accountability is “the Oz Principle.”

(Shortform note: While many experts focus on skill, luck, and determination as the keys to success, accountability is often an underrated factor. However, accountability is arguably _more_ important than these characteristics. In fact, the authors of _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_ cite accountability as one of four essentials for successful execution (the others are focus, leverage, and engagement). Accountability in this formula takes the form of weekly sessions in which you review and account for your progress toward your goals.)

#### Lessons in Accountability From the Oz Story

_The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ by L. Frank Baum, published in 1900, is one of the quintessential “quest” texts in the literary canon, though most people probably know it from the 1939 movie starring Judy Garland. The authors use the story to illustrate their principles of accountability.

After a tornado transports Dorothy from Kansas to Oz, she travels the Yellow Brick Road with three companions in search of the Wizard, who they hope will help them. In _The Oz Principle_ , the authors liken their steps to accountability to Dorothy’s journey.

  * The Cowardly Lion hopes the Wizard can make him brave. In _The Oz Principle_ , the Cowardly Lion represents the first step to accountability—**facing facts** —which requires the courage to face something you might prefer to avoid.
  * The Tin Woodman wants the Wizard to grant him a heart. In _The Oz Principle_ , the character represents the second step to accountability—**admitting your role** —because taking ownership of your circumstances (rather than blaming them on external forces) requires strength of character, or “heart.”
  * The Scarecrow hopes the Wizard can give him a brain. He represents the third step to accountability—**taking responsibility** —which requires you to plan, problem-solve, and address the root of your problems.
  * Dorothy represents the last accountability step—**taking** **action** —or following through on the solutions you come up with.



The companions learn that the Wizard is a fraud; there’s no simple, magical solution to their problems. But it turns out they didn’t need the Wizard—they each already had what they’d wished for. For instance, the Cowardly Lion frequently showed courage in the face of danger; he was already brave. And Dorothy needed only to click her heels together to activate the magic that would take her home.

> **The Political Symbolism of _The Wizard of Oz_**
> 
> Viewing _The Wizard of Oz_ as a tale about the journey from victimism to accountability isn’t the only, or even the most common, interpretation of this classic. Since its publication, both book and movie have inspired numerous allegorical interpretations.
> 
> The most popular may be that Baum’s book is a political allegory for early 20th-century America. The plot apparently represents the bimetallism debate raging in the U.S. just before the book’s publication: In 1896, Democrats and Populists, represented by William Jennings Bryan, argued for a currency backed by both gold and silver, whereas the Republican Party and their leader, William McKinley, favored gold-only currency. Baum, a staunch Republican, is believed to have favored the gold standard. (McKinley won the presidential election, and the gold standard was used until FDR’s New Deal program in 1934.)
> 
> The characters represent key players in the debate:
> 
>   * Dorothy stands in for middle America (and its virtue), the “everyman” who’s been led astray.
> 
>   * The Cowardly Lion represents Democrat William Jennings Bryan.
> 
>   * The Tin Man represents industry.
> 
>   * The Scarecrow represents agriculture and the challenges farmers faced in the late 19th century.
> 
> 

> 
> The yellow brick road stands in for the gold standard, and Dorothy’s silver slippers, taken from the Wicked Witch of the East (they became ruby slippers in the film), represent the silver standard. “Oz” is thought to derive its name from the abbreviation for “ounces,” as in “ounces of gold and silver.”
> 
> However, other analysts have used the same narrative details to come to almost completely opposite interpretations.

### Understanding the Victim Mentality

First, we’ll discuss what being a “victim” means in the context of “the Oz Principle,” and what the consequences of victimhood are. The authors contend that being stuck in a victim cycle or mentality is the opposite of being accountable.

**The victim mentality encompasses behaviors and thought patterns that keep you trapped, disempowered, and unable to realize your potential.** They prevent you from taking advantage of opportunities to learn and grow.

That said, you really _can_ be a victim of circumstance or other people’s mistreatment at times. No matter what happens, the authors argue that there are almost always ways you can act to make your situation better. (Shortform note: There’s a difference between playing the victim and being a target at work. Some employees are targets of bullying by a coworker or a group (called mobbing), but targeted individuals often have a choice in how they respond.)

The authors divide typical victim behaviors into two categories: passivity and selfishness. (Shortform note: The essence of both is that they’re reactive, in contrast to accountability, which is proactive.)

##### Passivity

This category includes:

  * Ignoring or denying problems
  * Acknowledging a problem but waiting for it to go away on its own, or for an obvious solution to appear
  * Using confusion as an excuse to not solve a problem
  * Refusing to respond to a problem unless it’s on someone’s direct orders



We see these behaviors everywhere—in individuals, within companies, and even on a larger, national scale. Consider the issue of climate change: Many people ignore it, deny its existence, pretend it doesn’t and won’t affect them, or claim it will fix itself over time. But none of those approaches will resolve the problem.

(Shortform note: Passive behavior, which causes you to feel stuck at work so you complain rather than acting, may stem from a lack of energy and motivation, a lack of goals, or analysis paralysis. Alternatively, you may be passive simply because you haven’t learned assertiveness, not because you want to duck accountability. Either way, it doesn’t help you or your company succeed.)

##### Selfishness

The second category of victim behavior includes:

  * Shifting responsibility or blame onto other people
  * Preparing excuses in advance in case something goes wrong
  * Creating a narrative that justifies your actions and absolves you of any wrongdoing
  * Choosing not to get involved in order to avoid risk



By blaming others rather than considering how your actions (or inaction) played a part in the failure, you're unlikely to learn, and you set yourself up to miss future problems as well. People who avoid accountability end up feeling powerless and losing motivation, which makes it even harder to move from failure to success.

(Shortform note: Similarly, a _Harvard Business Review_ article also notes that shifting blame erodes your credibility and performance. To keep blame from spreading, the authors recommend that you: Resist blaming others, only blame constructively with the goal of learning, own failures, always focus on learning, and reward people for making mistakes that teach valuable lessons. Rather than blaming, sales trainer Grant Cardone recommends assuming “radical control” of your circumstances even when you’re not at fault, because when you assume a victim role, you give up your power to effect change.)

**Differentiating Between a Victim Mentality and Victimization**

_The Oz Principle_ ’s “victimhood” aligns with what other people refer to as _a victim mentality_ : when you view yourself as a permanent victim, blaming every negative thing in your life on the actions of others. Usually, a victim mentality describes someone who consistently, repeatedly refuses to take responsibility for their actions, or exaggerates their suffering to gain sympathy. A key distinction is that a victim mentality refers only to people _falsely_ claiming to be victims, not someone who has experienced a crime or disaster; you can suffer real hardships, literally becoming a victim, and not wind up exhibiting a victim mentality.

_Scientific American_ ’s “Unraveling the Mindset of Victimhood” gives an overview of psychological and clinical research on the victim mentality (or "interpersonal victimhood"), discussing its signs and consequences. For example, the article cites clinical research that observed four key components of interpersonal victimhood: wanting to be viewed as a victim, moral superiority, a lack of empathy for others, and dwelling on the past.

Another word for having a victim mentality is _victimism_ —not to be confused with _victimization_ , which refers to the process of becoming a victim.

Unlike typical characterizations of the victim mentality, _The Oz Principle_ ’s take on victims/victimhood is a narrow one, because this book is serving a specific purpose: to help individuals and organizations overcome work-related problems. Consequently, the book doesn’t always convey the complexities of distinguishing victimism from victimization. In real life, there are times when “passive” and “selfish” behaviors are the best course of action—or they’re your only option.

For example, in an organization where people are reprimanded for not following instructions or acting outside the boundaries of their specific role, you’re more likely to be “passive” rather than proactive for fear of losing your job. Likewise, keeping a written record of events and saving emails so you can defend yourself from potential blame—viewed by the authors as selfish or victim behavior—allows you to avoid being taken advantage of. _The Oz Principle_ can come off as unempathetic to employees who may be dealing with truly toxic work environments.

#### Signs You’re Stuck in a Victim Mentality

**You may be acting from a victim mentality without being aware of it.** Here are the common passive and/or selfish behaviors indicating you’re stuck:

  * Deflecting responsibility (making excuses, blaming others, or waiting for someone else to act.)
  * Rejecting opportunities to improve (ignoring feedback and being defensive)
  * Being pessimistic and negative (complaining without offering solutions)
  * Being lazy (prioritizing easy or short-term solutions over long-term ones, or glossing over problems so you look like you’re in control)



(Shortform note: These behaviors are basically opposites of the authors’ four steps to accountability: face facts, admit your role, take responsibility for solving the problem, and take action.)

**How Other Authors Describe a Victim Mentality**

Other popular authors also address signs of having a victim mentality, but with some additional nuances not addressed by _The Oz Principle_.

Brené Brown’s take in _Daring Greatly_ is unique in that, in addition to discussing people with victim mentalities, she addresses the other extreme, people who _never_ admit to being powerless. She calls this mindset the “Viking mentality.” Essentially, both "Vikings" (people who use aggression and power to present the image that they're always in control) and "victims" (people who always feel and believe themselves to be inherently weak or powerless) are each limiting themselves in their own way. They're not engaging with their own vulnerability in ways that allow them to grow from it. Brown acknowledges that these mindsets often arise due to trauma, but she argues that it’s a mistake when “Vikings” and “victims” blame continued hardship solely on the past trauma and not at all on the unhealthy mentality they’ve developed since.

In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson underscores the ceaseless nature of victimism with his term "perpetual victims," those who view themselves as uniquely helpless or powerless to solve their own problems. He characterizes perpetual victims as selfish, prone to overreacting, and likely to blame other people or factors out of their control for the problems they’re facing. Like the authors of _The Oz Principle_ , Manson emphasizes the importance of taking charge of your circumstances and focusing on the things you can control, including how you feel, how you react, and what actions you take in response.

All three of these texts portray victim mentalities as self-imposed, and as a barrier to leading your best possible life. They also all acknowledge the ways that outside factors (such as trauma) can send you down a path of developing a victim mentality, but they assert the importance of recognizing these self-sabotaging thoughts and behaviors and overcoming them.

_The Oz Principle’s_ authors note that to a point, victim behaviors are understandable—in fact, they can be comforting, like a security blanket, because you’re avoiding the risks of responsibility. But they prevent you from maximizing your potential and creating a fulfilling life. By recognizing these behaviors in yourself, you can begin to let them go and focus on more productive actions. Solving problems, improving your circumstances, and getting closer to your goals will ultimately feel better than the security of victimism.

(Shortform note: Besides security, other reasons people play the victim include getting attention, gaining control or influence over others’ feelings and actions, or as a way to cope with a difficult situation. However, if your victim behaviors stem from past trauma, you may need professional help because feeling helpless to change your circumstances can lead to depression, relationship problems, and many physical and emotional symptoms.)

**Overemphasis on the Victim Mentality Can Lead to Victim Blaming**

Although most of _The Oz Principle_ discusses victimism as a mentality to be overcome, the authors occasionally acknowledge that some people are victims due to circumstances beyond their control. The authors don’t dwell on that point much beyond reasserting that how you respond to your circumstances is still up to you, which is in line with the overall accountability message of the book.

However, attributing _all_ problems to a victim mentality can become unfair and unproductive _victim-blaming_ , which plays a role in public discussions of many hot button topics. Victim blaming __ is blaming a crime or a circumstance on the victim rather than the perpetrator. This idea came up in the context of the #MeToo movement, which spotlighted the prevalence of sexual assault and harassment in various industries and in society generally. Some victims who had delayed reporting their assaults did so for fear of being blamed (or blaming themselves) for what happened to them—for instance, for drinking alcohol or dressing a certain way.

A 1971 book, _Blaming the Victim_ by William Ryan, popularized the term. Ryan discussed victim-blaming in the context of race and poverty, citing structural inequities that keep some groups powerless and critiquing a mindset suggesting that if these people only tried harder, they could overcome their obstacles.

**Why We Blame Victims**

Researchers say we tend to blame victims because of a “just-world bias”—that is, we prefer to see the world as just and fair and to believe that all will turn out well if we do certain things. Therefore, we react harshly toward people in trouble, rationalizing what happened to them by blaming them for not doing what they should have.

**A Nuanced View: Victims’ Behavior Matters**

Nonetheless, a psychologist writing in _Psychology Today_ argues that _while_ _assigning moral and legal blame to the perpetrator_ , it can also be valuable to examine the victim’s behavior—for instance, in order to improve crime prevention and treatment of victims. This view avoids victim-blaming while aligning with _The Oz Principle’s_ view of accountability for future action (discussed in the next section).

### Redefining Accountability

Most people have a negative—and incomplete—definition of accountability, one synonymous with _fault_. As a result, people resist the idea of being accountable because that’s like saying (as in victim-blaming) that you’re to blame for whatever goes wrong.

However, _The Oz Principle_ defines accountability differently. **Accountability means taking ownership of your circumstances by identifying how _your_ actions contributed to them—and how _your_ actions affect what happens to you next. **Put another way, it’s taking responsibility and being proactive.

(Shortform note: In _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cardone argues that to be extraordinarily successful, you must take full responsibility for whatever happens in your life, even negative things like being in a car crash or having your identity stolen. Claiming responsibility for both the good and bad empowers you to act for better future outcomes. For instance, to reduce the future risk of a car accident, you could avoid peak traffic times or start a trip earlier so you don’t have to rush to your destination.)

The authors of _The Oz Principle_ note that this philosophy is a more forward-thinking, constructive view of accountability than the typical reactive focus on fault. **Owning failures allows you to act to not only avoid future problems, but also to create and own your future successes.**

**Accountability and Agency**

_The Oz Principle_ ’s idea of accountability is similar to the sociological concept of _agency_. Sociologist Nicki Lisa Cole describes it as "the power people have to think for themselves and act in ways that shape their experiences and life trajectories."

In _The 12 Week Year,_ author and consultant Brian P. Moran similarly describes accountability as personal action. You hold yourself accountable when you make the choice to do what is needed. When you do something because you choose to do it rather than because you have to, you're more empowered to perform the task to the best of your ability. Moran says that when you realize your choices create your path to success, you’ll see greater possibilities for your future and gain the courage to try new things to bring them to fruition.

### Moving Toward Accountability

In contrast to passive and selfish behaviors, the authors say that the following accountability behaviors will push you across the bridge from victimism to success:

  * **Face facts**
  * **Admit your role**
  * **Take responsibility for solving the problem**
  * **Take action**



These behaviors comprise _The Oz Principle’s_ four steps to accountability, which we’ll discuss in the next chapters. (Shortform note: In addition to these steps, other authors stress the need to make accountability a habit. However, this may require changing _other_ habits—for example, to be accountable for consistently making it to work on time, you may need to wake up earlier and do fewer early morning chores, requiring you to do your chores in the evening and go to bed earlier. To help you form and stick with new habits, find an accountability partner.)

> **Surround Yourself With Accountable People**
> 
> In _The 12 Week Year_ , Brian Moran more generally cites four ways to develop accountability in your personal life. The first two, don’t be a victim and don’t complain, echo _The Oz Principle_. The third—change your behavior—stresses that to change your life, you can’t keep doing the same things, but must change your habits and behaviors so you can make choices that create better outcomes. The fourth—surround yourself with accountable people—advises associating with people who provide an example and inspiration by owning their destinies. In contrast, being around negative people who blame the world for their problems will rub off on you, and you won’t accomplish anything.

> 
>   * Own your choices by focusing only on things you can control.
