## Exercise: Anticipate Obstacles

Remember the exercise in which you reflected on your least favorite part of your job? Let’s return to that. You’ll use the ideas you came up with already and prepare yourself to follow through on those plans.

* * *

You listed three actions that you could take to either improve that negative aspect of your job or lessen the amount of time you’d need to spend on it. For each of those actions, list one obstacle that might prevent you from seeing it through.

What are some precautions you could take to ensure that you don’t run into those obstacles?

Say your precautions fail. How do you overcome or recover from those setbacks?
