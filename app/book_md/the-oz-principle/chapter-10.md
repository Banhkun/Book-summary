## Chapter 10: Solving Common Problems With Accountability

Although the accountability strategies in _The Oz Principle_ seem like common sense, they're challenging to implement. Instead of making the effort, many organizations waste time on trendy management and leadership programs that don’t effect lasting change.

In the final chapter, the authors highlight the most common and most harmful issues they’ve observed in organizations. Resolving them requires time, resources, and change; but to leave them unresolved is to ensure that your company never achieves its full potential.

We’ll group these issues into three categories: employee development, communication, and individual motivation.

### 1\. Employee Development

For the organization to grow, your people have to grow. Sometimes that growth can happen organically—often, though, it comes only as the result of deliberate effort.

**Problem _:_** Many companies don’t invest time and resources in developing their employees' skills. In turn, employees do the bare minimum because they're not motivated to improve and their progress is not being monitored.

**Accountability Solution _:_** In an accountability culture, it’s on leaders to provide feedback. Then, it's on the employees to act on it.**** In addition, individuals must hold themselves accountable by finding ways to grow their own skills, take on more responsibility, and improve by monitoring their results. The organization and the individual must meet in the middle.

(Shortform note: A _Harvard Business Review_ article notes that in addition to providing motivation, the right kind of employee development is critical to retention. Providing effective development programs entails: conducting one-on-one meetings to learn about the needs of your employees, creating hands-on learning opportunities, and giving feedback.)

### 2\. Communication

Poor communication is at the root of many problems. And communication issues can take many forms. Sometimes people aren't accessible to each other. Sometimes they don't ask the right questions, or they don't really listen to what other people have to say. Key information doesn’t get properly disseminated to everyone.

**Problem** : A communication failure can balloon into other issues when people within the company aren't on the same page about their shared goals. This leads to a lack of focus and unity. And even if that lack of unity doesn't cause immediate or obvious problems, it makes the team less effective and slows the company’s growth.

**Accountability Solution** : Results are key to accountability—and people can’t be accountable if everyone's looking for different results, or doesn't know what the ideal results are at all. Confused or directionless employees aren’t effective. It’s on leaders to make sure everyone is on the same page and communicating clearly with each other. And it’s on employees to speak up when they’re confused and to take accountability for their own role in the organization.

> **Communicate Your Strategy for Results**
> 
> A _Harvard Business Review_ article emphasizes that companies can’t grow if they don’t communicate their strategy and goals to employees. Communication approaches for results include:
> 
>   * Keep your message to employees simple but meaningful (communicate your company’s core purpose).
> 
>   * Use market and customer insights to build behavior. To understand your strategy and goals, employees need to be in touch with market realities.
> 
>   * Create a message with three components: it should inspire, educate and reinforce. In addition to reinforcing the connection between company strategy and goals, reinforce behavior that advances the goals through rewards and recognition.
> 
>   * Be visible: Leaders should be visible and engage with employees at all levels (don’t give a big strategy presentation and then disappear).
> 
>   * Avoid corporate-speak, or employees will tune out.
> 
>   * Invest resources in internal communication.

### 3\. Individual Motivation

A final business problem has to do with ownership, empowerment, and taking initiative.

**Problem** : Employees sometimes fail to take initiative because they don't realize they can or _should_. Supervisors want more proactive employees, but they fail to show them trust or give them the space to make mistakes without repercussions (within reason). It's a vicious cycle: Managers expect their employees to _earn_ more power and responsibilities, while employees hold themselves back because of a lack of trust from their leaders.

**Accountability Solution** : As an employee, show that you can be trusted by getting _results_. Concrete evidence of your skills and problem-solving ability is the easiest way to build yourself up in the eyes of your teammates and supervisors. As a leader, learn to be present and involved without being too controlling; give your team a chance to rise to the occasion.

(Shortform note: _Carrots and Sticks Don’t Work_ offers empowerment steps including: Regularly ask employees how you can help them be more successful, delegate as much responsibility for decision-making as possible, improve training during onboarding, devote time and resources to continued training, encourage employees to take educated risks, ask employees how you can remove roadblocks or change restrictive policies, allow employees to cross-train and expand their skills, turn employees into coaches, and provide a range of new opportunities and allow employees to choose.)

**Problem _:_** Complacency is a related issue—people may feel so secure in their jobs that they begin to slack off because they’ve started to take it for granted. We’re all susceptible to that behavior.

**Accountability Solution** : Make sure everyone understands that **they have to _continue_ earning their jobs**, in the same way that they continually work to maintain a relationship or keep their home in good shape. You never really stop earning your job, its benefits or perks, raises and promotions, and your place in the company.

If the company grows, you get more of the benefits; but if it goes through a rough patch, you might lose some of the perks or the job itself. So it’s in your best interest to do everything you can to make sure the company succeeds. It’s not just the boss’s responsibility—it’s everyone’s.

(Shortform note: Signs that your employees are becoming complacent include: disengagement, not asking questions or challenging themselves or others, not taking initiative, not investing in their skills and relationships or building their personal brand, taking shortcuts, playing it safe, and complaining and playing the victim.)
