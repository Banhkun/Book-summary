## 1-Page Summary

In 2004 in Iraq, the U.S. Joint Special Operations Task Force was struggling to counter Al Qaeda, which was spreading sectarian discord and violence to undermine the shaky Iraqi government.

The U.S. task force—consisting of elite special forces teams, strategists, and analysts from every branch of the U.S. military—was charged with disrupting Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) by conducting raids, gathering intelligence, and killing or capturing terrorist leaders. However, despite its enormous resources and expertise, the task force soon found its conventional approach—based on a rigid command structure and lengthy centralized planning processes—failing for two reasons:

**1) They faced a new type of enemy.** The huge, slow-moving task force couldn’t keep up with AQI, which functioned as a decentralized network of agile teams that could strike quickly, reconfigure immediately, and integrate their actions globally.

**2) They faced a new type of environment.** Iraq was a complex environment far different from what the military organized and trained for—it was characterized by rapid, unpredictable events, rather than events that military organizers could foresee and plan for.

In addition,**the technology of global connectedness allowed terrorists to operate in radically different ways.** It meant AQI leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi could build an effective organization despite having few resources. Through bomb-making videos and online propaganda, AQI incited sectarian conflict in Iraq. Further, the ability to transmit information instantly and widely gave AQI enormous influence among disaffected people and enabled it to constantly expand.

When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the task force, he realized that to counter the chaos that AQI nurtured and thrived on, the task force needed a dynamic approach to fit the dynamic enemy and environment.

The first step was to overcome what the military refers to as its _limfac_ , or its limiting factor—the biggest element hindering success. The task force’s limiting factor was its inflexible structure or organizational model. **McChrystal set out to transform the task force into a “team of teams” that functioned on a huge scale with the agility and effectiveness demonstrated by its small, elite commando teams in individual missions.**

### Understanding the Strengths of Teams

McChrystal identified four qualities of special forces teams that he wanted to scale up to organization level:

  1. Empowerment: a bottom-up structure as opposed to a command-and-control model
  2. A shared consciousness (a common understanding and mindset)
  3. Bonds of trust and a strong purpose
  4. A sense of the whole or awareness of the entire playing field



#### Empowerment and Shared Consciousness

Navy SEALs apply all of these four qualities to deliver extraordinary performance, adapting to handle unpredictable and complex challenges. The following is an example of how they apply the first two qualities—empowerment and shared consciousness.

In 2009, Somali pirates boarded a U.S. container ship off the coast of Somalia, seized the captain, Richard Phillips, and held him at gunpoint on a small lifeboat.

Two Navy ships arrived on scene with three Navy SEAL snipers who’d been air-dropped onto one of the ships. Through night-vision scopes, the SEALs watched the three pirates holding the captain hostage and waited for the right moment to strike. Suddenly, all three snipers fired simultaneously from 75 feet away, each striking a different pirate in the head without injuring Captain Phillips.

The SEAL team succeeded not only because of their skills, but also because they became essentially one mind, thinking as a unit. Sharing a collective team consciousness or mindset, they each came to the decision to fire at the same time. Additionally, although they were in constant contact with their commander, the snipers acted on their own in choosing the moment to strike.

The team’s _structure_(empowered members thinking as one)__ rather than having a centrally determined and controlled _plan_ led to success in this operation.

#### Trust and Purpose

Besides empowerment and shared consciousness, trust and purpose are critical to team functioning. Navy SEALs training is designed to build trust and purpose so SEALs can function effectively (as the snipers did) as a unit.

Prospective SEALs undergo a six-month, three-part program called Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training (BUD/S). While it involves physical conditioning, diving, and fighting on land, its major purpose is teambuilding. In contrast, command structures like the task force’s initial structure aren’t about teamwork, only following orders.

In SEAL training, trainees rarely do anything alone (not even walking to meals). At minimum, they complete tasks with a partner. They’re divided into crews of five to eight that work together for the six months. They develop trust and learn to function within a small group, communicating, negotiating, and taking cues from each other.

Teams whose members know and trust each other unequivocally are capable of extraordinary performance.**** Like the snipers who rescued the ship’s captain, these teams can organize a coordinated response on the fly in environments where the complexity exceeds a single leader’s or commander’s ability to predict an outcome or control and monitor the response.

##### Building Commitment to a Purpose

In addition to building trust, SEAL training ensures that each team member is in sync with their unit’s function, the mission objectives, and their individual role. Part of building this commitment involves making the training so onerous that only the most committed believers complete it—this level of dedication is critical when teammates put their lives on the line for each other and the mission.

#### A Sense of the Whole

In order for team members to work toward the same goal, they first need an understanding of what the goal is. This contrasts with command structures, like factory assembly lines, where workers don’t need to know the company’s goals, only how to follow directions.

**In addition to the overall goal, all members must understand the current playing field.** In volatile situations, SEALs are taught to monitor the operation as a whole, much the way soccer players keep track of the whole field. Having a sense of the whole allows SEALs to assess risks and know what actions to take in relation to other team members. They are all responsible for the team’s success and act to ensure it.

### Transforming the Task Force

Although the task force’s special forces teams were adaptable, its command-oriented overall structure (a “command of teams”) limited the adaptability of the organization as a whole. Teams functioned in their own spheres or silos, coordinating with their commands but not with other teams. This created disconnects that hindered the overall mission. To change this, McChrystal had to do two things:

  1. Create a shared consciousness or mindset by breaking down silos.
  2. Build the same kind of trust _between_ task force teams as existed _within_ teams.



#### Breaking Down Silos

To change the organizational culture of silos, the task force adopted a policy of “extreme transparency,” or wide information sharing that provided everyone with an unvarnished, real-time view of the organization.

McChrystal created an open-office environment at the task force headquarters. His staff cc’d a wide range of people on emails and took most calls on speaker phone to “normalize” the sharing of information.

Central to creating transparency was the daily Operations and Intelligence briefing, or O&I. Having a regular leadership meeting to update everyone on operations is standard military practice—however, the task force used technology to greatly expand participation well beyond the headquarters team in Iraq. Anyone who was invited, from embassies to FBI field offices to staff at Fort Bragg, could connect to the meeting via laptop from anywhere. Conducted by video conference six days a week at the same time each day, the meeting was an unfiltered discussion of the task force’s successes and failures.

##### Resistance and Success

At its headquarters, the task force provided extra seats for partner agencies it hoped would participate in O&I—it was important that the CIA, NSA, FBI, and other outside agencies who provided intelligence hear first hand what the task force needed based on what was happening in the field. However, at first, only the CIA participated, while other agencies were wary of the open-sharing environment.

But the task force leaders tried to lead by example, quickly sharing data as raids were completed. McChrystal believed that the value of information grew as it was shared and more people were able to make use of it. As the intelligence agencies got faster and more useful information from the task force, they stepped up their participation, further developing and using the information—for instance, in questioning detainees. Special forces operating in the field communicated with analysts about what they were finding during raids.

O&I attendance grew to 7,000 as the value of the information and interaction increased. Everyone could see problems being solved and conflicting information being reconciled. Many participants developed their own problem-solving skills as a result. Despite involving thousands of people for two hours daily, the O&I saved untold time by eliminating the need for people to get clarification. While there was a risk of information falling into the wrong hands, the task force never had any leaks, and sharing information saved lives.

#### Scaling Up Trust

To build trust and familiarity between teams accustomed to operating in silos, the task force established an embedding program, which assigned a team member to a different team for six months. The idea was to:

  * Provide embedded team members with a view of the war from within a different team
  * Build new personal relationships
  * Consequently, create ties between teams



Special operations teams at first resisted the program—however, as a point of pride, each sent their best team member to represent them. The experience built understanding and trust as the embedded team members saw the other teams’ strengths and shared their new-found knowledge with their “home” team.

In a similar effort to build ties with the external agencies (the CIA, NSA, and so on), the task force greatly expanded an existing program of sending liaison officers to these partner agencies. As the special ops teams had sent their best operatives to be embeds, the task force chose only top quality candidates as liaisons.

In addition to building trust through the liaison program, the connections and knowledge sharing enabled the task force to develop a more well-rounded understanding of AQI from partner agencies—for instance, about how the terrorist group’s global finance system worked.

Also, partner agencies began sending people to the task force meetings—and all the extra seats eventually filled up. Agencies and teams found that the more they cooperated, the more they benefited.

##### A Liaison Success Story

The task force sent a Navy SEAL officer to a U.S. embassy in the Middle East to coordinate efforts against Al Qaeda—however, the embassy staff at first didn’t welcome him or share intelligence with him. Having little work to do, he volunteered to collect the trash from each office, and used the task to meet people and build relationships. For instance, from taking out the trash, he learned that one embassy employee liked a certain fast-food sandwich, so he requested the task force send these sandwiches with its next delivery.

The SEAL officer slowly won respect and eventually the ambassador approached him to request help with protecting the embassy and its forces against Al Qaeda, which was ramping up in that country. The officer provided expert advice and task force intelligence, as well as pulling in task force resources.

### Transforming Leadership

Even though the restructured task force in Iraq developed the shared consciousness and team connectivity to determine the right things to do to counter AQI, they often couldn’t act on their own or act quickly—decisions had to travel up and down a lengthy chain of command.

**Paradoxically, the instant communication enabled by technology _slowed_ decision-making, as more people had the ability to weigh in**; senior leaders wanted to approve things that, in the past, they wouldn’t have been directly involved in due to lack of real-time communication. Approval processes for strikes on terrorist leaders extended to the Pentagon or even the White House. Yet delayed decisions could allow a target to escape or could mean life or death in the complex, ever-changing circumstances on the ground.

To speed up the reaction time, McChrystal began pushing decision-making authority down, in a policy of “empowered execution.” Often, he didn’t explicitly delegate—instead, he created a general rule: If it advances the task force effort, do it (assuming it’s moral and legal).

His more self-assured officers made decisions and reported them at the O&I briefing, where McChrystal’s public approval encouraged more people to act. The task force decentralized until it became uncomfortable, which McChrystal defined as the “sweet spot.” He knew that because sharing decision-making authority is uncomfortable for leaders, discomfort would be a sign they’d achieved their goal.

Naturally, there was a learning curve: Subordinate officers had to become comfortable with not only making decisions, but also pushing authority down further. Partner agencies were initially confused and wanted verification that subordinate officers were acting with McChrystal’s approval.

Soon though, empowered execution began paying off:

  * Decisions were made more quickly, increasing the effectiveness of special operations.
  * The quality of the decisions actually improved because those making them were more invested in the outcomes, and because the people closer to the action were better equipped to decide what to do. Task force leaders had expected decision quality to _decline_ as a trade-off for speed because they believed their own decisions as leaders were superior—however, that turned out not to be the case.



In addition to the policy of pushing authority down throughout the organization, McChrystal adopted an “eyes on, hands off” policy for himself, meaning that if subordinates fully informed him about what they were doing, he’d simply observe without getting involved. Conversely, if they _didn’t_ provide sufficient “visibility” (part of shared consciousness), he would jump in aggressively.

McChrystal found he was more effective when he supervised processes to ensure the task force avoided silos and bureaucracy that would hinder agility. He used technological capabilities to do his job of coordination better, rather than to monitor and intervene in others’ jobs or operations. He likened this concept of leadership to “leading like a gardener,” that is, creating and cultivating an organizational ecosystem in which others could operate more effectively.

### Putting the Pieces Together

The Task Force’s team-of-teams organizational model, incorporating the transformational concepts of trust, purpose, shared consciousness, and empowered execution, finally brought down AQI leader Abu Musab al Zarqawi.

By the spring of 2006, the playing field had changed: In several years, the task force had 1) learned a great deal more about Zarqawi and his organization and 2) dramatically increased its effectiveness in gathering intelligence and disrupting the terrorist network.

A break came when task force units captured a dozen AQI fighters in a raid on a farmhouse—U.S. intelligence analysts soon identified several of them as not merely fighters but mid-level AQI operatives potentially connected to terrorist leadership. Interrogators homed in on one particular operative, Allawi (not his real name), and brought the vast, now-networked, task force resources to bear on determining what he knew. A hive mind consisting of teams across Iraq, intelligence agencies in the U.S. and United Kingdom, partners across the region, and more than 70 task force liaison officers coordinated questions to ask the detainee and offered insights on his answers.

Finally, Allawi revealed the name of Zarqawi’s spiritual adviser, Sheikh Abd al-Rahman, with whom the terrorist leader had regular in-person contact. The task force determined Rahman’s location and monitored it 24/7. Maintaining constant surveillance diverted resources from other task force operations, which in the past would have prompted competitiveness or distrust among units. However, thanks to shared consciousness, trust, and transparency, everyone understood and united around the common purpose of taking down Zarqawi.

The task force was able to track Rahman to a meeting with Zarqawi at a farmhouse outside Baghdad. When Rahman arrived there, a man dressed in black robes emerged to greet him, and the task force’s network of analysts quickly identified the man as Zarqawi. At the task force HQ, McChrystal’s Baghdad operations commander called for an air strike and dispatched a special operations team. Practicing empowered execution, McChrystal didn’t question or intervene in the orders. The strike blew up the house, and the commando team arriving a half-hour later found Iraqi medics outside with a still-alive Zarqawi on a stretcher. However, Zarqawi died a few minutes later.

Next, the task force drew on resources stretching to the FBI in Washington, to confirm Zarqawi’s fingerprints and thus, his identity. Finally, task force units across Iraq struck multiple targets, including 14 in Baghdad, in an effort to hit each one before word of Zarqawi’s death spread to AQI operatives and caused them to flee. These strikes yielded intelligence revealing further connections among the terrorists and leading to new raids.

#### A Transformed Organization

By the time of the successful strike against Zarqawi, the task force had begun taking for granted the network of relationships, trust, and shared consciousness that enabled the huge success. These elements had become part of their everyday operations.

They were now winning the fight against AQI because they were learning and adapting more quickly than the enemy. They were striking unpredictably, day and night, more quickly than AQI could regroup—enabled by the networking and trust between analysts and field operators.

It was all the result of a management transformation. Now, instead of being a centralized efficiency-oriented organization, the task force was an interconnected network constantly learning and adapting.

#### The Challenge Is Ongoing

However, the subsequent rise of ISIS in Iraq under a new terrorist leader, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, less than 10 years after McChrystal’s success in transforming the task force and capturing Zarqawi, underscored two truths about change:

  1. There’s no permanent fix in a constantly and rapidly changing complex environment.
  2. Transforming organizations is an ongoing, uphill battle due to a tendency to backslide. 



When facing challenges, there’s a temptation in organizations to revert to the planning and efficiency-oriented processes they’re comfortable with and that have worked in the past. But results are what count—and getting results in a new environment requires transforming how organizations do things for the long term.
