## Exercise: What Is Your Organization’s Limfac?

The military refers to the biggest element hindering the success of a mission or operation as its _limfac_ , or its limiting factor. For example, in Iraq, the joint operations task force’s limfac was its unwieldy structure, which rendered its response to AQI ineffective.

* * *

What is your organization’s mission? What is its limfac—the main factor standing in the way of the mission’s success?

How is this major limitation manifesting itself? Does it relate to people, processes, or structure?

What steps have been taken so far to address the limfac? Have they succeeded? If not, what should the next step be?
