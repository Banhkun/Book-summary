## Chapter 9: Scaling Up Trust

  * In addition to shared consciousness, cooperation across silos was necessary for success. To foster cooperation between teams, the task force used embedding and liaison programs to create connections and build trust among teams and partner organizations.



### Cooperation Versus Competition

Despite expanded information sharing, individual agencies and close-knit teams within the task force weren’t naturally inclined to cooperate with each other—they thought in terms of competition instead (as noted in Chapter 7). They needed to understand how cooperation rather than competition served both _their_ interests _and_ those of the task force as a whole.

A scenario of game theory called the Prisoner’s Dilemma illustrates how you can serve yourself in the process of acting in the group’s interest:

  * Two crooks are arrested, interrogated individually, and offered the same deal: Stay mum and get one year in jail, or rat on your partner and be released. But if your partner rats on you, you get two years.
  * Each crook is motivated to rat in order to be released (that is, to serve his own interest at the expense of his partner). But if they _both_ rat, they’ll both get two years.
  * In contrast, if they both stay mum (that is, cooperate with each other), both will be better off because they’ll get only one year each.



The exercise shows that individuals can benefit more from cooperation than competition. If task force agencies cooperated with each other, they and especially the task force as a whole would both benefit. Further, in a complex environment, collaboration was essential for survival.

However, individual agencies or teams were often too suspicious of other agencies’ motives to cooperate. An agency might fear that if it shared intelligence with another agency, that agency might not reciprocate, thereby giving the other agency a competitive advantage.

The task force’s transparency policy, especially as practiced in the O&I, created an awareness of the need for and value of cooperating. But being the first to share or cooperate with another team was still a leap of faith. **The key to encouraging cooperation was to build strong teamlike trust _between_ teams so they started thinking of themselves as part of a network.**

### An Embedding Program Builds Trust

To scale up trust between teams accustomed to operating in silos, the task force established an embedding program, which assigned a team member to a different team for six months. The idea was to:

  * Provide embedded team members with a view of the war from within a different team
  * Build new personal relationships
  * Consequently, create ties between teams



Special operations teams at first resisted the program—however, as a point of pride, each sent their best team member to represent them. The experience built understanding and trust as the embedded team members saw the other teams’ strengths and shared their new-found knowledge with their “home” team.

In a similar program to build ties with the external agencies (the CIA, NSA, and so on), the task force greatly expanded an existing program of sending liaison officers to these partner agencies. As the special ops teams had sent their best operatives to be embeds, the task force chose only top quality leaders as liaisons.

In addition to building trust through the liaison program, the connections and knowledge sharing enabled the task force to develop a more well-rounded understanding of AQI from partner agencies—for instance, about how the terrorist group’s global finance system worked.

Also, partner agencies began sending more people to the task force meetings—and the seats at the Situational Awareness Room table filled up. Agencies and teams found that the more they cooperated, the more they benefited.

#### A Liaison Success Story

The task force sent a Navy SEAL officer to a U.S. embassy in the Middle East to coordinate efforts against Al Qaeda—however, the embassy staff at first didn’t welcome him or share intelligence with him. Having little work to do, he volunteered to collect the trash from each office—and used the job to meet people and build relationships. For instance, from taking out the trash, he learned that one embassy employee liked a certain fast-food sandwich, so he requested the task force send these sandwiches with its next delivery.

The SEAL officer slowly won respect and eventually the ambassador approached him to request help with protecting the embassy and its forces against Al Qaeda, which was ramping up in that country. The officer provided expert advice and task force intelligence, as well as pulling in task force resources.

### Cooperation Becomes Automatic

McChrystal knew that the task force was overcoming the Prisoner’s Dilemma when special operations teams began competing less for limited ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) assets such as drones or aircraft for their missions. Since these resources were scarce, some missions had to be postponed when air support was diverted elsewhere.

Through information sharing, especially in the O&I, team members could see the overall operation beyond their team missions and support the use of resources where the fighting was most intense and air support was most needed. Further, because of the relationships built between teams, they trusted the decisions being made and also trusted that when _they_ had a priority mission, it would get air support.

Researchers studying cooperation and the Prisoner’s Dilemma have identified two ways of making a decision to cooperate:

  1. Reflection: “If I help them now, they’ll help me later.”
  2. Second nature: The decision to cooperate is automatic.



In the task force, decisions to cooperate were reflective at first, but after positive experiences with the benefits of cooperation, decisions became automatic—cooperation became the norm. However, another feature of the command structure—the leadership—was getting in the way of team cooperation. Part 4 examines how the role of leaders must change in an adaptable organization.
