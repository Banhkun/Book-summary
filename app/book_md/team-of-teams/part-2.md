## Part 2: Forging Effective Teams | Chapter 5: Building Trust and Purpose

  * The task force’s elite commando units from all branches of the military were models of the kind of adaptability needed at the organization level. The qualities that made them adaptable were their empowerment structure, a “shared consciousness” or team mindset, trust, and purpose forged during rigorous training. The most effective teams in other organizations share these qualities.



Part 2 examines the strengths of adaptable teams and the challenges of scaling them up in a large organization. This chapter looks at examples of teamwork in life-and-death situations that demonstrate the following qualities of effective, adaptable teams:

  1. Empowerment: a bottom-up structure as opposed to a command-and-control model
  2. A shared consciousness (a common understanding or mindset)
  3. Bonds of trust and a strong purpose
  4. A sense of the whole or awareness of the entire playing field



### Team Qualities: Empowerment and Shared Consciousness

**For teams to respond effectively in a crisis, members need to be empowered to act quickly on their own based on their training, rather than waiting for instructions** from authorities who aren’t present or who can’t formulate a response to every aspect of a complex situation. They also need to act with a shared consciousness or team mindset.

#### Empowerment

Two examples of critical airline incidents illustrate the importance of empowerment. The key difference between the two incidents was that in the first, crew members felt empowered to act immediately (adapt), while the second crew followed a command-and-control structure in which they waited for the captain’s orders (they failed to adapt).

##### US Airways 1549

The story of US Airways Flight 1549 is well-known. It was the plane that Captain Chesley Sullenberger landed safely on New York’s Hudson River in 2009 after hitting a flock of geese, which disabled the engines.

The crew had only moments to respond to the crisis, which occurred at only 2,000 feet (emergency training addresses engine failure at 20,000 feet but not below that). Every member of the crew sprang into action without being told what to do. In less than four minutes, they turned the plane around, prepared for a crash landing, and splashed down on the Hudson. Everyone on board survived as a result of the empowered teamwork—Sullenberger wouldn’t have had time to assign and supervise all the crew members and still land the plane safely.

##### United Flight 173

In contrast, United Flight 173, en route from New York to Portland in 1978, crashed, killing two crew members and seriously injuring 24 people.

The tragedy began when the aircraft developed a minor problem with landing gear while nearing Portland—the gear was down but the crew didn’t know it due to an indicator light not working. When they finally determined the gear was down, they weren’t sure the wheel suspension was working, in which case the wheels could collapse upon landing.

Rather than functioning as an adaptive team, the crew waited to act until they received instructions from the captain, who alone decided what steps to take. The crew then spent 70 minutes following instructions to prepare for an emergency landing—which was five minutes beyond the plane’s fuel capacity. The captain was so focused ensuring that everyone followed their protocols for a rough landing that he didn’t check the fuel gauge. The plane lost its engines before reaching the runway, and it crashed into two empty houses and many trees.

#### Shared Consciousness: Navy SEALs

Along with empowerment, shared consciousness, or a team mindset, is another quality that enables teams to perform effectively. A Navy SEAL team’s response to a 2009 incident in which Somali pirates boarded a U.S. container ship off Somalia and seized the captain illustrates how shared consciousness works.

Three pirates held the captain, Richard Phillips, at gunpoint on a small lifeboat. Two Navy ships arrived on scene with three Navy SEAL snipers who’d been air-dropped onto one of the ships. Through night-vision scopes, the SEALs watched and waited for the right moment to shoot. Suddenly, all three fired simultaneously from 75 feet away, each striking one of the three pirates in the head without injuring Captain Phillips.

The SEAL team succeeded because of their skills but also because they became essentially one mind, thinking as a unit. Sharing a collective team consciousness, they each came to the decision to fire at the same time. Additionally, although they were in constant contact with their commander, the snipers acted on their own (they were empowered) in choosing the moment to strike.

For the SEAL snipers and for the US Airways Flight 1546 crew that landed on the Hudson, **the team’s _structure_(empowered members acting in concert)__ rather than a preordained _plan_ was the successful strategy.**

### Team Qualities: Trust and Purpose

Besides empowerment and shared consciousness, trust and purpose are critical to team functioning. Navy SEAL training is designed to build trust and purpose so SEALs can function effectively (as the snipers did) as a unit.

##### Building Trust

Prospective SEALs undergo a six-month, three-part program called Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL Training (BUD/S). While it involves physical conditioning, diving, and fighting on land, its major purpose is teambuilding. In contrast, command structures aren’t about teamwork, only following orders.

In SEAL training, trainees rarely do anything alone (not even walking to meals). At minimum, they complete tasks with a partner. They’re divided into crews of five to eight that work together for the six months. They develop trust and learn to function within a small group, communicating, negotiating, and taking cues from each other.

**Teams whose members know and trust each other unequivocally perform better.** Like the snipers who rescued the ship’s captain, these teams are capable of organizing a coordinated response on the fly in environments where the complexity exceeds a single leader’s or commander’s ability to predict an outcome or control and monitor the response.

##### Building Commitment to a Purpose

In addition to building trust, SEAL training ensures that each team member is in sync with their unit’s function, the mission objectives, and their individual role. Part of building this commitment involves making the training so onerous that only the most committed believers in the unit’s purpose stick it out—this level of dedication is critical when teammates put their lives on the line for each other and the mission.

### Team Qualities: A Sense of the Whole

In order for team members to work toward the same goal, they first need an understanding of what the goal is. This contrasts with command structures, like Taylor’s factory assembly lines, where workers didn’t need to know the company’s goals, only how to follow directions.

**In addition to the overall goal, all members must understand the current playing field.** In volatile situations, SEALs are taught to monitor the operation as a whole, much the way soccer players keep track of the whole field. Having a sense of the whole allows SEALs to assess risks and know what actions to take in relation to other team members. They are all responsible for the team’s success and act to ensure it.

### The Role of ‘Emergent Intelligence’

**Another feature of effective teamwork is “emergent intelligence.”** Emergence refers to the way something comes together as a result of many low-level actions without a coordinating force. Order emerges from the bottom up as opposed to being directed top down.

An example of emergence is Adam Smith’s concept of the “invisible hand,” where free markets are shaped by the individual actions of many buyers and sellers rather than a centralized design. Similarly, an ant colony’s structure is the result of the instinctive behavior of millions of individual ants doing various things such as digging and foraging. The colony comes together although no individual ant has the brainpower to organize it. (It’s a myth that the queen manages an ant colony—her sole purpose is to reproduce.)

**In teamwork, innovative solutions can emerge through the interactivity of the members without direction from an authority.** Whether you have multiple computers (networking) or multiple people acting as a unit (referred to as group cognition), you can solve bigger, more complex problems with emergent intelligence.

Building a team requires both the _visible_ hand of authority integrating the members and the _invisible_ hand of emergence creating organic solutions. SEAL training is designed to foster emergent intelligence to solve problems that can’t be predicted or planned for.

### Example: United Airlines Creates Adaptable Teams

In the wake of the Flight 173 crash in Portland, United Airlines implemented a teamwork program called Crew Resource Management (CRM), which involved training crews to be assertive, training captains to be less authoritarian, and building teams with trust and purpose to prepare crews to act effectively in a crisis.

While some pilots were initially dismissive of the program, it paid off in 1989, when United Flight 232 blew an engine, and debris damaged the movement of wing flaps. There was no protocol for handling the problem because the chance of it happening was considered to be extremely remote. Lacking any steering capability, the crew, which had CRM training, improvised a solution involving manipulating the thrust of the two remaining engines. The plane crash-landed but 185 of 296 on board survived. Subsequently, the FAA mandated CRM training for all airlines.

CRM-type empowerment programs have been developed in other settings—for example, operating rooms, oil rigs, and nuclear power plants—for handling complex challenges.
