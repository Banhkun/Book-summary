## Part 1: Old Methods, New Environment | Chapter 1: Getting a Handle on AQI

  * In Iraq, the U.S. Joint Special Operations Task Force faced a new type of enemy and environment, for which its structure and methods weren’t designed.



**Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was an entirely new kind of threat operating in a changed environment, and the war against them** **was unlike any 20th-century war.** Terrorism, radicalism, and insurgency weren’t new, but in 2004, they were transformed by the technology of global connectedness, which allowed terrorists to operate in radically different ways.

### A New Type of Enemy

The Joint Special Operations Task Force struggled to get a handle on an agile enemy constantly on the move with no fixed base of operations, no MO (standard method of operation), and no hierarchy or structure—only a loose network, shifting leaders, and skillful use of cyberspace.

On paper, the task force had a lopsided advantage over AQI:

  * **Recruitment** : U.S. special operators were top quality; AQI recruited disgruntled locals and smuggled in foreign fighters.
  * **Communications** : U.S. specialists had sophisticated and instantaneous communications systems; AQI relied on face-to-face meetings and letters delivered by courier to maintain secrecy in individual operations.
  * **Training** : Special operators underwent extreme training; AQI recruits attended scattered madrassas or religious schools.
  * **Firepower** : Special operators could draw on vast resources, including weapons, electronic surveillance, airpower, and armored vehicles; AQI, working in “safe-house” basements, created IEDs from expired Soviet explosives and propane tanks.
  * **Persistence** : U.S. operators worked around the clock, meticulously planning and executing huge numbers of precise raids with no end in sight; AQI seemed to organize briefly, strike suddenly, then vanish.



Yet, AQI managed to prevail. An example of AQI’s effectiveness against the task force was its September 2004 bombing of a celebration to open Baghdad sewer plant. AQI terrorists drove cars loaded with explosives into the crowd, killing 35 children and wounding 10 Americans and 140 Iraqis. Within hours, AQI had posted a video of its success on the internet.

Despite being the “best of the best,” the task force’s elite special forces, strategists, and intelligence analysts hadn’t discovered the plans and prevented the bombing. Moreover, terrorist attacks like the sewer plant bombing kept increasing. In 2004, there had been more terrorist attacks in Iraq than in the entire world in 2003. They continued to escalate and by spring 2006, attacks were killing more than 1,000 Iraqis a month.

#### AQI Tactics

AQI’s foothold in Iraq dated back to the U.S. invasion of Iraq and the fall of Saddam Hussein. After Hussein’s fall, Abu Musab al Zarqawi, who ran a jihadist organization and training camp in Afghanistan, moved into Iraq and joined with dispossessed Sunnis to resist the new Iraqi government.

Zarqawi’s goal was to trigger a sectarian civil war that would destroy Iraq, paving the way for an Islamic caliphate. By targeting Shia Iraqis with attacks, he started a bloodbath; each terrorist strike would set off a chain of reprisals, multiplying the death toll. In October 2004, he swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden and took charge of AQI.

AQI seemed to change shape at will. They adjusted to any environment: They infiltrated rural communities by wearing traditional dress and fitting into religious organizations; they also blended into urban environments by wearing city clothes and driving nondescript vehicles so they could carry out suicide attacks unhindered. Equally nondescript monitors or supervisors followed the attackers to video the attacks and then slipped away unnoticed.

**Despite having no standard method of operation or hierarchy, they maintained their purpose and strategy.** No matter how many leaders the task force killed or captured, AQI continued to function.

#### A Lesson From History

A student of military history, McChrystal found that AQI’s successful adaptability had a parallel in historical warfare, specifically to an 1805 naval battle.

In the Battle of Trafalgar, British Admiral Horatio Nelson used adaptability to overcome the superior Franco-Spanish fleet and thus staved off a land invasion of Britain. Nelson’s battle plan foreshadowed AQI tactics: The British admiral created and capitalized on chaos to render his opponent’s superior firepower ineffective. This required empowering multiple teams to react and adapt to circumstances in the moment, as AQI teams did. Here’s how Nelson’s plan worked.

In Nelson’s era, opposing fleets typically lined up their ships parallel to each other, and fired volleys until one side surrendered. Instead, his fleet approached the enemy line perpendicularly in two columns, which split the line into three parts. This created chaos among the enemy ships because they couldn’t receive orders and communicate in the usual way with signal flags; the smoke, disruption, and insertion of Nelson’s ships in the enemy line blocked the enemy ships’ views of each other.

In contrast to commanding from the top, Nelson shared his overall strategy with his forces and empowered British captains to act on their own once the battle started. No one had to wait for orders to be signaled. Nelson won, not just because of a clever and unconventional plan, but also because he empowered his captains to adapt to changing circumstances.

### A New Environment

Lacking an obvious chain of command and predictable methods, AQI should have dissolved into anarchy. But it didn’t, in part because, in addition to its loosely networked structure and adaptability, AQI benefited from the environment in which it operated in two ways:

  1. The failure of the Iraqi state created chaos in which AQI could thrive unimpeded by the government. 
  2. Technology made instant global connectedness among terrorists and their supporters possible. 



Technology, which created an entirely different and constantly shifting landscape, was the bigger of the two factors. Global connectedness meant al Zarqawi could build an organization despite having few resources. Through bomb-making videos and online recruiting, he incited sectarian conflict in Iraq. The ability to transmit information instantly and widely gave small groups like his enormous influence among disaffected people and enabled AQI to constantly expand.

While the task force had the best equipment, training, and skill, it wasn’t suited to the environment because it couldn’t counter AQI’s instantaneous global reach, nor could its centrally planned and tightly controlled operations adapt to changing circumstances on the ground due to AQI’s constant movement.

### Countering Chaos

To manage and counter the chaos that AQI nurtured and thrived on, **the task force had to transform its huge organization to match both the adaptable enemy and the complex environment.** This entailed restructuring based on trust, transparency and information sharing, and decentralized decision-making (empowered execution).

These ideas ran against the grain of military tradition, 20th-century concepts of efficiency, and general management practices. Yet the task force couldn’t effectively counter AQI without first overcoming what the military refers to as _limfac_ , or its limiting factor—the element hindering success.

The task force’s limiting factor was its outdated structure or organizational model. The same is true for many other types of organizations also facing a complex environment. **Rather than planning and optimizing for predictable outcomes, organizations must restructure themselves to respond to a constantly shifting environment.**
