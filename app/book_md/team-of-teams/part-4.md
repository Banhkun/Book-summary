## Part 4: Reconsidering Leadership | Chapter 10: Empowered Execution

  * Shared consciousness enabled the task force to understand and react to the interdependence of the complex environment, where actions had wide ripple effects. But speed—reacting fast enough—remained a challenge due to the command structure. The answer was the scaling up the empowerment model that enabled teams to make on-the-fly decisions based on conditions.



### The Need for Speed

While the restructured task force in Iraq had the shared consciousness and team connectivity to determine the right thing to do, they often couldn’t act on their own—decisions had to travel up and down a lengthy chain of command, which took time and delayed action. This chapter looks at how the task force improved its response time by pushing decision-making authority down.

**Paradoxically, the instant communication enabled by technology _slowed_ decision-making, as more people had the ability to weigh in;** senior leaders wanted to approve things that, in the past, they wouldn’t have been directly involved in due to lack of real-time communication. Approval processes for strikes on terrorist leaders extended to the Pentagon or even the White House.

Yet delayed decisions could allow a target to escape or could mean life or death in the complex, ever-changing circumstances on the ground. The situation was akin to a soccer player having to get the coach’s permission to pass the ball.

### Visibility and Control

An upward communication flow has long been traditional in organizations including the military. Information typically flows from the field up the chain of command, where decisions are made and orders are sent back down.

Human nature also plays a role in reinforcing the command-and-control model in the minds of leaders: **When leaders can see or monitor what’s going on, they want to control it.** Today’s technology allows closer, more constant monitoring than ever. But the concentration of power and control at the top goes back to the mid-1800s, when a Taylor contemporary, Henri Fayol, developed a theory of business administration. He argued that the job of workers was to provide information to superiors, then await orders from them.

The military operated the same way, on land at least. During the Civil War in 1864, Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant controlled where Major Gen. George Meade moved troops by communicating detailed instructions via letters and postal service.

However, naval operations were another matter—leaders lacked visibility and a communication line to naval commanders. So, a few years earlier, in 1852, President Millard Fillmore empowered Commodore Matthew Perry to do whatever was necessary to “open” feudal Japan as a trade gateway to Asia (foreigners couldn’t enter the country and the Japanese couldn’t leave).

Perry landed, then threatened Japanese officials with attack. He gave them a white flag with the explanation that if they fought, they’d lose, so they might as well keep the surrender option handy. They gave in and, after having threatened war, Perry took it upon himself to negotiate a trade agreement. However, since Perry’s time, communications advances have _reduced_ the authority and autonomy of Navy commanders.

### Task Force Empowerment

In 2004 Iraq, McChrystal set out to reverse the command-and-control model in military operations. He realized that running decisions up and down the chain of command took too much time and created too much risk. Enemy operatives were empowered to make decisions and act quickly, while task force staff had to follow protocols. So McChrystal began pushing decision-making authority down, in a policy of empowered execution. Often, he didn’t explicitly delegate—instead, he created a general rule: If it advances the task force effort, do it (assuming it’s moral and legal).

His more self-assured officers made decisions and reported them at the O&I briefing, where McChrystal’s public approval encouraged more people to act. The task force decentralized until it became uncomfortable, which McChrystal defined as the “sweet spot.”

Of course, there was a learning curve: Subordinate officers had to become comfortable with not only making decisions, but also pushing authority down further. Partner agencies were initially confused and wanted verification that subordinate officers were acting with McChrystal’s approval.

Soon though, empowered execution began paying off:

  * Decisions were made more quickly, increasing the effectiveness of special operations.
  * The quality of the decisions actually improved because those making them were more invested in the outcomes, and because the people closer to the action were better equipped to decide what to do (the way a baseball pitcher knows what pitch to throw). Task force leaders had expected decision quality to decline as a trade-off for speed—however, the results belied assumptions about leaders’ superior wisdom.



The key was preparation: Empowerment wouldn’t have worked without first creating shared consciousness. This provided context for making decisions: In a reverse of the traditional model, _leaders_ provided information so that subordinates with a systems understanding could make decisions.

#### Hands-Off Leadership

In addition to the policy of pushing authority down throughout the organization, McChrystal adopted an “eyes on, hands off” policy for himself, meaning that if subordinates fully informed him about what they were doing, he’d simply observe without getting involved. Conversely, if they _didn’t_ provide sufficient “visibility” (part of shared consciousness), he would jump in aggressively.

This was the reverse of the command-and-control model where leaders sought to control what they could see. In contrast, McChrystal found he was more effective when he supervised processes to ensure the task force avoided silos and bureaucracy that would hinder agility. He used technological capabilities to do his job of coordination better, rather than intervening in others’ jobs or in raids.

By 2006, the task force had transformed the way it operated. Under the empowered execution model, they were doing 300 raids a month and hitting more of their targets, compared to 18 raids a month under the previous command structure. Further, they were keeping pace with AQI because they were making faster, better quality decisions.
