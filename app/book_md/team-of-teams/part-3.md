## Part 3: Reinventing the Task Force | Chapter 8: Changing Space and Culture

  * To scale up the individual team strengths of shared consciousness and strong bonds of trust, McChrystal overhauled both the task force’s physical space and its culture. This included rethinking every organizational procedure; a key was transforming the daily Operations and Intelligence briefing or O&I.



The first step was redesigning the physical space in which the task force worked. When the task force moved its headquarters from the Baghdad Airport to Balad Airbase, a former Iraqi base 64 miles to the north, McCrystal had an opportunity to create a new physical space conducive to the shared consciousness he wanted to create.

### Changing the Space

The typical layout of military facilities and offices of many organizations reflects hierarchy and specialization or silos. For example, the Army’s installation at Fort Bragg, the task force’s U.S. headquarters, was originally built in the 1980s as a collection of windowless buildings divided into offices. These offices were further subdivided into cubicles separating commanders from lower-ranking officers and limiting communication between people handling different tasks.

Similarly, corporate high rises are divided into offices stacked vertically to reflect the hierarchy of the companies. Executives have top-floor office suites and managers often get “corner” offices separating them from workers. There are few common areas for interaction.

However, tech companies in Silicon Valley have adopted campus settings and open office designs in an effort to promote interaction, creativity, and innovation. When Michael Bloomberg became mayor of New York City in 2002, he converted one of the largest rooms in City Hall to an open office or “bullpen” to get people working together and sharing ideas. He also shunned the mayoral suite and worked in the bullpen himself.

Similarly, to facilitate information sharing at its new location, the task force in Iraq created a central open space referred to as the JOC or Joint Operations Center. A wall of screens displayed live video updates of ongoing operations. Key leaders worked at a U-shaped table, with other tables extending outward for different functions: air and artillery support, intelligence, medical evacuation, and so on. Off to one side was a Situational Awareness Room (SAR) where McChrystal and senior staff tracked global terrorism while the JOC focused on Iraq.

Along with facilitating a shared consciousness through transparency and information sharing, the open layout aimed to encourage emergent intelligence, in which ideas and solutions would bubble up organically. The task force further facilitated this by designating the entire facility as a “top secret” security space, so anyone could discuss anything openly.

### Changing the Culture

The new headquarters environment by itself wasn’t enough to change how the task force functioned. **To change organizational culture, the task force adopted “extreme transparency,” or wide information sharing that provided every team with an unvarnished, real-time view of the organization.**

While staff members used to functioning in silos initially found information sharing uncomfortable, it was essential to succeeding as a team of teams. Rather than trying to predict who would need information, McChrystal and his staff cc’d a wide range of people on emails and took most calls on speaker phone to “normalize” the sharing of information.

Central to creating transparency was the daily Operations and Intelligence briefing, or O&I. Having a regular leadership meeting to update everyone on operations is standard military practice—however, the task force used technology to greatly expand participation. Anyone who was invited, from embassies to FBI field offices to staff at Fort Bragg, could connect to the meeting via laptop from anywhere. Conducted by video conference six days a week at the same time each day, the meeting was an unfiltered discussion of the task force’s successes and failures.

### Resistance and Success

Extra seats had been provided in the Situational Awareness Room (SAR) for partner agencies that the task force hoped would participate in O&I—they needed the CIA, NSA, FBI, and other outside agencies who provided intelligence to hear first hand what the task force needed based on recent events. At first, only the CIA participated.

But the task force leaders tried to lead by example, quickly sharing data as raids were completed. McChrystal believed that the value of information grew as it was shared and more people could make use of it, especially in contrast to leaving it sitting in unopened bags. As the intelligence agencies got faster and more useful information from the task force, they stepped up their participation, further developing and using the information—for instance, in questioning detainees. Special forces operating in the field communicated with analysts.

O&I attendance grew to 7,000 as the value of the information and interaction increased.

Everyone could see problems being solved and conflicting information being reconciled. Many people developed their own problem-solving skills as a result. Despite involving thousands of people for two hours daily, the O&I saved untold time by eliminating the need for people to get clarification or permission to act. While there was a risk of information falling into the wrong hands, the task force never had any leaks, and sharing information saved lives.
