## Chapter 3: Responding in a Complicated Versus Complex Environment

  * The task force’s initial structure and efficiency approach was designed to work in a _complicated_ environment. However, Iraq was a _complex_ environment, which required a different approach.



Systems and the environments in which they operate can be either complicated or complex. This chapter looks at the differences between the two, and why complicated solutions don’t work for complex problems and environments.

_Complicated_ systems and problems are those that require effort to sort out, but that ultimately are understandable and predictable. For example, engines are complicated, with many parts, but with study, you can see how the parts connect and behave, and you can predict what will happen if you change a part. Similarly, in complicated factory or military operations of the past, you could understand connections and predict the results of specific actions.

In contrast, _complex_ systems are nonlinear with infinite components and interactions that are enabled and speeded up by global technology. A key feature**** of these systems is that**small events can have ripple effects that build to an outcome no one could have imagined**. An example is the Tunisian fruit vendor’s act of self-immolation in 2010 that launched a wave of anti-government protests that became the Arab Spring.

Global connectedness generated these far-reaching effects because the man’s cousin videoed his act and posted it on YouTube. Other protests erupted and videos of those events were posted. Soon Arabs everywhere took to the streets and within three months, the Arab Spring had undermined the governments of Egypt, Libya, and Syria. No government responded effectively to the chain reaction because they couldn’t predict and plan for it.

Similarly, in Iraq, the task force found that:

  * A U.S. operation in one city could trigger a series of AQI and citizen responses throughout the country as word traveled via the internet.
  * An AQI propaganda post could trigger riots over a wide area.
  * A video posted online of a successful AQI attack could immediately boost recruitment.



### How Complexity Works

Scientists have been studying complexity for years. **In 1961, Edward Lorenz of MIT had a key insight into complexity that became known as the butterfly effect**. While manipulating weather data with numerous variables, he realized that a tiny change he made in rounding the data the second time through had a huge cumulative effect on the results. This led him to two theories about interconnectedness:

**1)** **Complex systems have countless parts that interact in countless ways.** Therefore, a small event could trigger a chain of interactions that has a cumulative impact over time. Illustrating this, Lorenz theorized that **the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil could start a chain of billions of interactions in air currents and weather systems leading to a tornado in Texas.**

**2)** **Predicting the future in a complex system is nearly impossible because any number of interlinked factors could come into play and affect the outcome**. A small action could have no effect or a colossal one—but it’s impossible to foresee which outcome it will be.

Examples of complex systems with interconnected parts making prediction impossible include:

  * **Weather** : A small disruption could set off interactions that build to an extreme outcome far away.
  * **Economies** : Failure of a single financial institution could have no effect or upend an entire economy.
  * **Ecosystems** : A virus could mutate and spread through a population, reducing some species and thereby affect the food chain and biological balance.



Because the interactions are impossible to predict, outcomes are uncertain as well.

### The Challenge for Organizations

**You can’t force complex systems to behave like complicated systems that can be sorted out by focusing on one or two variables.** An example of trying to do this is introducing predators to eliminate a pest without taking complexity into consideration—predators interact with numerous species, not just the pest, and often attack and wipe out the “wrong” species.

Similarly, you can’t control economic systems affected by complex human factors. Economist Friedrich Hayek argued against state-run economic planning due to complexity (you can’t accurately predict the result of your actions). This complexity has only grown with globalization.

**Yet many organizations still cling to the belief that any problem can be broken down and addressed with a process for a predictable result.** While our environment is now complex, we’ve responded by designing ever more complicated solutions entailing hierarchies, rules, and processes. The defense department’s continuously growing collection of rules, codes, and procedures is an example of this.

In Iraq, the task force tried to attack complex problems with complicated solutions. But the battleground had changed by the time the most efficiently developed plan was ready to implement. The task force couldn’t predict where AQI would strike or react quickly to its attacks. Anyone could become a suicide bomber overnight.

Like the task force, many businesses facing challenges keep trying to predict and plan better because that’s considered good management. But in a constantly changing global economy, good management can’t predict demand, prices, interest and exchange rates, and so on, let alone the impact of political movements, unrest, wars, or natural disasters. This leaves companies with little control over their own destinies. Unpredictable volatility is one reason companies have shorter lifespans today—50 years ago, a Fortune 500 company had a lifespan of 75 years versus less than 15 years today.

**Planning based on the assumption that the future will be similar to the present—that is, following a preset course in an uncertain environment—is a recipe for failure.**
