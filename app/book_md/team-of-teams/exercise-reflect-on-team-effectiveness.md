## Exercise: Reflect on Team Effectiveness

Effective teams share several qualities: a bottom-up empowerment structure, a shared consciousness or team mindset, a sense of the big picture, and bonds of trust and purpose.

* * *

Think of an effective team you’ve participated in or one you’ve observed in your organization. What were its functions, aims, and results?

Which of the qualities outlined above made the team effective and why?

Now think of an ineffective team—what were its functions, aims, and results?

Why do you think this team failed? What essential qualities were missing?
