## Exercise: Rate Your Organization’s Transparency

For organizations to function effectively as a network of teams, members need a common knowledge of what’s going on. Yet a majority of organizations share only the information they think people need to know to do their specific jobs.

* * *

Describe your organization’s policy or practice for handling information.

Do you feel you know what’s going in the organization as a whole? Why or why not?

How has the handling of information affected your ability to do your job well and advance the organization’s overall goals? (For instance, has it helped or hindered you? How?)

If you’re a manager, how could increasing your transparency improve your team’s and your organization’s effectiveness? (If you’re an employee, how would increased transparency from your manager help you or your team?)
