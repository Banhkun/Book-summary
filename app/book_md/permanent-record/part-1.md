## Part 1: Growing Up | Chapter 1: Childhood

Part 1 covers the early years of Edward’s life, from childhood until college. Each chapter starts with a section about the context in which Ed was growing up, followed by a section about Ed’s life.

### Birth

> **Context: The Internet**
> 
> When we talk about the Internet, we tend to treat it like a single entity. In fact, **“Internet” most broadly refers to the network of networks that connect computers all over the world.** The computers connect via “languages” called protocols. There are many kinds of protocols. For example, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http) allows computers to communicate about websites. There are so many different types of protocols that there are few things that can’t be digitized. Food, water, clothes, and homes are some of the only things that can’t go online.
> 
> The public Internet was created in 1983 by the US Department of Defense. The Department of Defense had a group of interconnected computers that they split in half. They kept half for their own use and named the network MILNET. The other half became the Internet.
> 
> **At the time of the book’s publication (2019), around three billion people—42% of the world’s population—used the Internet regularly.**

Edward Snowden was born on June 21, 1983, in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. He came from a long line of heroes and patriots. His grandfather and father both worked for the Coast Guard and his mother was directly descended from the barrelmaker on the _Mayflower_.

**Ed was part of the last generation whose childhood wasn’t digitized.** His baby photos are in photo albums instead of on Facebook, and his home videos are on VHS tapes instead of YouTube. Unlike online digital records, these analog formats won’t last forever.

### Age 6: Encountering Computers

> **Context: The World Wide Web**
> 
> **The World Wide Web is the collection of web pages accessed via the Internet.** It was invented in 1989 in Geneva by the Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire/European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).

As a child, Ed liked spying. In his parents’ house, there was a window between his room and the den and he would spy on his family members as they watched TV, did chores, or in the case of his father Lonnie, played with technology.

#### Meeting a Computer

In his work as an engineer with the Coast Guard, Lonnie often had access to new technology and sometimes he brought it home. One day, Lonnie brought home a Commodore 64, one of the first home computers. Ed spied on his father while he played _Choplifter!_

Ed got caught, but his father wasn’t mad. Instead, Lonnie let Ed sit on his lap as he played _Choplifter!_ He even gave Ed an unplugged joystick so he could pretend to play along.

#### Learning From Mom

Lonnie was often away for work, so Ed’s mother Wendy was a large part of his childhood. She taught Ed and his sister, Jessica, how to read by labeling their dresser drawers (socks, underwear) and taking them to the library. Ed’s favorite books were about machines, but he also liked King Arthur and Greco-Roman myths, especially the story of Hephaestus/Vulcan. He liked the idea of a group of goddesses and gods who fought among themselves and interfered with and spied on humanity.

Wendy also taught Ed math. She would buy him things only if he could correctly add up the prices. At first, he only had to round to the nearest dollar, then get the actual amount, then calculate tax.

#### Getting a Nintendo

In 1989, when Ed was six, his family got a Nintendo (8-bit NES). He loved it so much his mother made a rule that he had to finish a book every time he wanted to rent a new game. He was faster at beating games than reading, so he beat the system by taking out short books with lots of pictures so he could get through them more quickly.

### Age 7: Nintendo Problems

> **Context: Fix-It Culture**
> 
> In the author’s parents’ generation, when something broke, you fixed it, or got it fixed. **By the time the author’s generation came along, however, when something broke, it was easier, cheaper, and faster to just get a new one.** Getting something fixed was often more expensive than buying a new version, and buying the parts and fixing it yourself was even more expensive.
> 
> **As a result, no one really knows how a lot of technology works anymore. When it breaks, we’re at its mercy.**

When Ed was seven, the Nintendo stopped working. Ed tried the only fix he knew—blowing into the slots where the game and console connected to clear out the dust. It didn’t work, so he took the Nintendo apart, which was what he’d seen Lonnie do with electronics that weren’t working. Ed didn’t know how to repair it and ended up making the problem worse.

When Lonnie got home, he explained that **to fix things, you can’t just look for a broken part, you also have to consider how and why something had gone wrong.** He showed Ed what every part of the Nintendo did on its own and how it worked together with the other parts. According to Lonnie, fixing things wasn’t just about fixing the existing design. If something is set up in the most efficient way and just malfunctioning, then all you have to do is fix it. But if there’s something off with the design, you have to improve it.

#### Remeeting Computers

To fix the Nintendo, Lonnie wanted to use some special equipment at the Coast Guard base, so he brought Ed to work. The base had advanced (for the time) computers. Up until this point, Ed had only used video game consoles. While Lonnie fixed the Nintendo, he gave Ed some simple instructions to type into the computer. Ed found typing much more natural than writing (he was left-handed but forced to become a rightie) and loved that he had the power to tell a machine to do something. He realized gaming systems had nothing on computers—you could interact with them and play through levels, but you couldn’t change the game. **With a computer, you could do anything, and anyone could reproduce it.**

### Age 9: Moving to Maryland

> **Context: Employment at Fort Meade**
> 
> _Fort Meade_
> 
> **Fort Meade is the second-largest US army base and the headquarters of the National Security Agency (NSA).** In the 90s, every fourth person in the surrounding Anne Arundel County worked for Fort Meade and the area had a civil servant monoculture. The base was part of the community and had a pool, grocery store, and post office.
> 
> _Job Compartmentalization_
> 
> In the 90s, people in the government didn’t talk much about their jobs, either to their kids or to each other. This was partly because of confidentiality, but also because people’s jobs were so specialized and technical no one else was interested in the details.
> 
> **Even today, the government values compartmentalization, and it’s normal for employees not to understand how their job fits into the larger picture.**

When Ed was nine, his family moved to Crofton, Maryland. Lonnie continued to work for the Coast Guard. Wendy took a new job at the NSA, the National Security Agency, making retirement arrangements for spies.

#### Schooling

Ed had been popular enough and had good grades back in North Carolina, but he didn’t fit in at his new school. He didn’t like sports, he wore glasses, and his classmates mocked his Southern accent. He was so insecure about his accent that he taught himself to speak differently and didn’t talk at school until he’d ironed it out. Not talking affected his grades enough that his teachers thought he might have a learning disability. They got him to take an IQ test, which he scored very high on. This resulted in “enrichment assignments.”

#### Getting a Computer

Shortly after moving to Crofton **Ed’s family got a Compaq Presario 425, their first home computer.** At the time it seemed state of the art—it had a 25MHz CPU, 200MG hard disk, and a 256-color monitor.

**Ed adored the computer. He spent all his time on it and hated sharing it with his other family members.** He particularly liked a video game called _Loom._ Video games had advanced since _Choplifter!_ —now they had plots instead of simply premises—and _Loom_ was about a magical loom that can control events. A boy learns about the loom and what it can do and is sent into exile. The parallel between the magical loom and a computer wasn’t lost on Ed—a magical loom connected to the world via threads while a computer connected to the Internet via cables, and both could influence the world.

**Computers and the Internet would have a huge effect on Ed during his formative years.**
