## Chapter 10: What Happened to Lindsay

Almost right after Lindsay returned from her camping trip, Ed’s mother Wendy arrived for a visit. At first, Lindsay was annoyed that Ed had left while his mom was visiting, but as time went on, both Lindsay and Wendy started to think something was wrong. It had been normal for Ed to be called away during some of his previous jobs, but not since they’d been living in Hawaii. Additionally, the other times he’d been away he was always in touch. Wendy thought he was on medical leave. Lindsay was more worried he might be having an affair.

On June 7, the government started to get in touch with Lindsay about Ed. He was supposed to have returned to work on May 31. Lindsay saw some headlines in the paper about the NSA and started to connect them to Ed.

On June 8, Lindsay went to San Diego to visit her friend Sandra for her birthday. She also needed some emotional support. Lindsay told the police that her grandma was having open-heart surgery, which was true, but it wasn’t happening until the end of June and in Florida.

On June 9, Lindsay’s friend Tiffany called to ask her how she was doing. Lindsay asked her what she was talking about, and Tiffany told her Ed had come forward as the whistleblower. The FBI immediately tracked Lindsay down and interrogated her for days. She hired a lawyer, Jerry Farber. The FBI was convinced that she knew something.

When she wasn’t being interrogated, she was being followed. She had an FBI tail 24/7 for her own protection. The media got a hold of her photo and the public labeled Lindsay a whore and stripper.

**Lindsay was angry with Ed, but she knew he’d done the right thing.**

Lindsay left Hawaii a couple of months later.
