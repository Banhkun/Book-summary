## Shortform Introduction

In 2013, Edward Snowden leaked top secret documents to the media. The documents revealed that the US government was conducting mass surveillance on its citizens and nearly everyone in the world.

_Permanent Record_ is Ed’s memoir. It was originally written in three parts and 29 chapters. This summary has reorganized the part and chapter divisions for concision and clarity.

In this summary, Ed’s story is organized as follows:

  * Part 1 covers Ed’s childhood, from birth in 1983 to approximately age 18 in 2001.
  * Part 2 covers Ed’s stint in the army in 2004.
  * Part 3 covers Ed’s career as a technologist from approximately 2005 until 2009.
  * Part 4 covers Ed’s discovery of the mass surveillance program, STELLARWIND, from approximately 2009 to 2012.
  * Part 5 covers Ed’s decision to blow the whistle, how he did so, and the fallout. It covers early 2013 until 2019.
