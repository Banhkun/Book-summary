## Part 3: Technologist Career | Chapter 4: Working for the University of Maryland

Part 3 covers Ed’s career as a technologist, from approximately 2005 to 2009.

> **Context: Careers in Technology**
> 
> _Career Options_
> 
> Technologists have a few career options if they want to specialize:
> 
>   * **Software developers/programmers.** These people write computer code.
> 
>   * **Network/hardware specialists.** These people physically set up wires and servers.
> 
>   * Systems technologists. These people work with the big picture of computing. They work with software, hardware, and networks. More specifically, the job titles are:
> 
>     * **Systems administrators/sysadmins.** These people are responsible for maintaining an entire system. When it breaks, they fix it, and they slowly make it better as a whole over time.
> 
>     * **Systems engineers.** These people solve a problem by inventing a new system to address it, or by massaging existing solutions into something custom.
> 
> 

> 
> _Security Clearances_
> 
> **The federal government is the only entity that can grant a security clearance and they only clear people who are sponsored—people who have an offer for a job that requires clearance.** Most private companies don’t want to hire uncleared people and pay them while they’re waiting for clearance to come through. Therefore, most people get their clearance by taking a government job. Once they have it, they can leave the government and take their clearance with them.
> 
> There are three levels of security clearance: confidential is lowest, then secret, then top secret. Top secret also has an additional qualifier, Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). **The highest-level intelligence positions require TS/SCI and it can take over a year to get this clearance.**
> 
> To get TS/SCI, a candidate undergoes a Single Scope Background Investigation. This investigation is primarily to find out if a candidate has anything that could be used against them. They care less if your record is perfect and more that you’re honest. If you have a secret, an enemy could use it against you to get access to sensitive parts of your job.

After some time, Ed’s legs healed and he thought about what he would do with the rest of his life. He may not have made the cut for the army, but he was young and smart and had plenty of other options. Part of why he’d gone to the army was because he wanted to succeed at something that was hard for him. Computers had always been easy.

Now, however, **Ed realized that he would best be able to serve via a computer. He also realized that computers would have a better chance than guns at implementing and maintaining democracy.** Ed wasn’t really a veteran, but having gotten into the army could be some help if he applied to work at an intelligence agency. If he was going to get into intelligence, however, he would also need a security clearance

### Getting Clearance

Ed aimed for TS/SCI. **He got a government job with the University of Maryland that would sponsor his clearance application.** Ed was a good candidate: he didn’t have a criminal record or drug habit, plenty of his family members had served and so had he, and his only debt was student loans. However, he was still nervous because the check would look into every element of his life. The National Background Investigations Bureau talked to everyone Ed knew, including, he suspects, a man he worked with once at a snow cone stand.

**The background check made Ed reflect on his childhood online activities.** He was less worried about embarrassing searches for porn—everyone does that—and more concerned about his posts on forums. They weren’t necessarily going to cause a problem for his clearance, but he felt they were stupid. They reflected opinions he’d changed, things he’d said just to be inflammatory (a large part of early Internet culture), or things he’d never meant at all and had said just to get attention. He disagreed with what a lot of his childhood self had written.

Ed could have deleted his posts if he’d wanted to. This wasn’t illegal, nor would it have affected his clearance. However, he decided to leave everything up. **If he took things down, he’d perpetuate the idea that you can’t make a mistake—you have to be perfect, and if you’re not, you’ll pay for it forever.** Ed decided he’d figure out how to live with what he’d posted, and that in that spirit, he’d keep posting so that his self another ten years from now would get to go through the same thing as his current self was.

Interestingly, his dating profiles never embarrassed him. Reflecting back on this as an adult, he thinks this is because they were supposed to attract real-life attention, so he’d been thoughtful about the content.

The final stage of Ed’s clearance was a polygraph interview. All the questions were yes or no answers and he had to answer them all three times. He passed all three times and came out with the TS/SCI as well as the “full scope polygraph.”

#### Lindsay Mills

Ed met Lindsay Mills, the woman who would become his wife, on HotOrNot.com. Ed was worried their connection would break when they met in person, but it didn’t. On their first meeting, Lindsay picked him up in her car. Ed had spent so much time worrying about meeting her that he hadn’t actually thought about what they’d do. They ended up driving around talking and then parking and talking.

#### Personal Values

**Ed didn’t have his own set of political values at age 22, he had a mish-mash of principles he’d learned from his parents and online.** His parents were federal civil servants who worked for the government, not a particular leader. They were loyal to their country, not a party or specific person who ran the country.

From the Internet and video games, Ed learned that there was a clear line between bad and good. The early Internet also had a lot in common with American values—online, everyone was equal, free, and allowed to pursue whatever they wanted. Ed believed that if you were brave and smart enough, you could succeed.

### Contract Job at the Center for Advanced Study of Language (CASL)

> **Context: Government Contracting**
> 
> In the 2000s, much of the government’s work was done by contractors, including intelligence work. Contractors had a different attitude towards the government than the civil servants of yore—the government was simply a client that paid well, not something to feel patriotic about.
> 
> Many people believe that the government uses contractors for nefarious ends—contractors do the dirty work and the government never needs to learn the details. However,**it’s more likely that the intelligence community employs contractors because it allows them to get around caps on hiring.** Contractors aren’t included in hiring caps, so agencies can hire as many as they want and can afford.
> 
> The contractor model has some advantages: the government doesn’t have to pay contractors benefits or pensions, and the government can often get a better deal on the work costs because contractors compete with each other.
> 
> However, there are also some disadvantages:
> 
>   * **Conflicts of interest.** For example, a director might campaign for money to hire a particular contractor, and then later get a job with the same contractor.
> 
>   * **Additional costs to taxpayers.** “Cost-plus” contractors, middlemen between contracted employees and the government, bill the government for employees’ salaries and then an extra 3-5% of the salaries, as a fee. As a result, contractors try to pay their employees a lot, because they get paid more too.
>

Ed’s first job was working for the state of Maryland at the University of Maryland, which was helping the NSA open the Center for Advanced Study of Language (CASL). The CASL was supposed to help the NSA figure out how to use computers to understand foreign languages, however, when Ed started, it wasn’t open yet. Ed’s job was to patrol the under-construction building at night. He was basically a security guard.

Ed spent some of his shift looking for a better job. As he was searching, **he learned that it was hard to directly serve the government. It would be much easier to get a job with a company that contracted services to the government.** Ed found it a bit frightening that the government was hiring outsiders for national security work, because to do anything systems-level, contractors would need access to all sorts of sensitive information. Contracted technologists would also work at secure facilities such as NSA headquarters.
