## Exercise: What Does Your Data Say About You?

Everyone’s data reveals information about them.

* * *

What data do you consciously create and share publicly with the Internet? For example, you might post a profile photo on a social media site.

What data do you consciously create and keep private? For example, you might talk on the phone to your mom about family.

How would you feel if the government were to look through your browsing history or read transcripts of your phone conversations? Why?

The President’s Surveillance Program was established after 9/11, and retroactively legalized in 2008, with the ostensible purpose of protecting Americans from acts of terror. Do you think it’s in Americans’ best interest for the government to wiretap phone and internet communication without a warrant? Why or why not?
