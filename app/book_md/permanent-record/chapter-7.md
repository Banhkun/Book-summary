## Chapter 7: Return to the US

> **Context: Privacy and Clouds**
> 
> _Why Privacy Is Important_
> 
> You may not think you particularly care about privacy. Maybe you think you don’t have anything to hide, or you don’t mind giving up some information about yourself for convenience. For example, you might think giving Google your location is worth getting driving directions.
> 
> However, not caring about your personal privacy also has an impact on everyone else’s. If you don’t value your privacy, then you’re assuming that no one else should either. There are plenty of things such as medical history and religion that people have good reasons to want to keep to themselves.
> 
> **Privacy is a right. People shouldn’t have to defend why they want it; the government should have to justify why it’s allowed to violate it.**
> 
> _Clouds_
> 
> In 2011, clouds—servers that are accessed via the Internet—were becoming popular both with the intelligence community and the public. Public clouds were available through sites such as Amazon, Apple, and Google. Clouds solved the problem of limited storage on a personal computer—clouds had lots of free or inexpensive space. Clouds can also be used as a backup for information stored on a computer.
> 
> **However, whenever you put something on the cloud, you’re saving it to someone else’s server. Whoever owns the server can dictate the terms of service,** and some terms give the owner a lot of power over what they can do with files saved on their servers. They can often delete whatever they want, delete your accounts but keep your data, and sometimes take ownership of your data.

### Relocating to Columbia, Maryland

**Ed decided not to do anything about the mass surveillance program he’d discovered, except that he stopped using credit cards and talked to Lindsay about getting off Facebook and Instagram.** (She wasn’t willing to; she was an artist and needed both to promote her art.)

In 2011, they returned from Japan and bought a condo in Columbia, Maryland. While they were furnishing their new home, Ed encountered a fridge that had wifi. Knowing everything that he did about surveillance, he was sure the reason a fridge needed Internet access was to spy on people and collect data, then allow the manufacturer to sell the data. **Ed wondered if it was even worth worrying about government surveillance if people were buying things like smart fridges.** (Amazon Alexa and Google Home wouldn’t come out for a few years.)

#### Working in Sales

Ed continued working for Dell and went back to being a contractor for the CIA. He was now working in sales—Dell’s account manager, Cliff, convinced him to be a solutions consultant. Cliff would sell yet-to-be-invented technology and Ed would build whatever he described. Cliff lied freely about what was possible, and Ed had to build something close enough that they wouldn’t be arrested.

**Their main job was to advance the CIA’s technology systems to match those of the NSA. Ed and his team would work towards this goal by building the CIA a private cloud.** The goal was to make all the CIA’s data available to agents all over the world. Currently, the data was stored in “silos,” which were storage facilities in different locations that couldn’t be easily accessed remotely.

#### Epilepsy

**Ed had his first epileptic seizure** and struggled with his health for the last half of 2011. His job was flexible and he could work from home, but he had to attend meetings, and because of his epilepsy, he wasn’t allowed to drive. He ended up taking short-term disability leave. He spent weeks on the couch, not feeling well enough to do much more than read, eat, or sleep.

Ed was still struggling with what he’d learned in the classified report. He watched the news and wondered if mass surveillance was really even that much of a problem in comparison to what so much of the world was facing—violence, dictatorships, and so on. However, he noticed that whenever and wherever people were protesting, the exact causes were often different but the desired outcome was always the same: they wanted freedom from censorship, oppression, and instability. They wanted their governments to answer to them, not the other way around, and they wanted human rights.

Ed still didn’t know what he was going to do about the report, but he did know how to help youth in the Middle East access the Internet. He set up a way to get past the Iranian blockades and then shared it with Tor developers, who would hopefully get it to Iranians who wanted to go online.

### Relocating to Hawaii

> **Context: Surveillance Legislation**
> 
> _The Patriot Act_
> 
> 2001’s Patriot Act has a section that allows the government to ask the FISA Court to force third parties to give them information on anything that could be considered “relevant” to terrorism or foreign intelligence.
> 
> The NSA interpreted this to mean they could collect telephone metadata from American telecoms every day forever on the grounds that one day, some of that information might be “relevant.”
> 
> _FISA Amendments Act_

The NSA also interpreted a section of the FISA Amendments Act aggressively. This section lets the intelligence community target any non-citizen outside the US who might communicate “foreign intelligence information.” People who fit this role according to the NSA include anyone from aid workers to journalists to academics.

> _Data Collection_
> 
> The NSA collects data using two main methods:
> 
>   * The **PRISM** program collects data from service providers including photos, emails, web data, and files stored on cloud servers.
> 
>     * For example, PRISM would collect data from Facebook, Paltalk, Skype, YouTube, AOL, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo! 
>   * **Upstream collection** gathers data from Internet infrastructure. Whenever you go on the Internet and try to visit a URL, your request to visit the URL travels to the server where the URL is hosted. Before it gets to the destination server, however, it’ll pass through servers that the NSA has set up in telecommunications buildings as part of a program called TURBULENCE. TURBULENCE has two facets:
> 
>     * TURMOIL creates a copy of your request and evaluates it for “selectors.” Selectors are characteristics that the NSA has deemed suspicious, such as a request's originating location or its inclusion of specific keywords, phone numbers, or emails. If your request contains a selector, TURMOIL passes the request to TURBINE.
> 
>     * TURBINE detours your request to NSA servers. The NSA servers house malware programs—“exploits”— and when you’re redirected to your URL, you’re also sent an exploit. Exploits give the NSA access to all the data on your computer.
> 
> 


In early 2012, Ed made some changes to his life to accommodate his epilepsy. He took a new, less stressful job as Dell contractor for the NSA that involved managing documents and who was allowed to access, edit, and read them. The job was in Hawaii and the state’s climate and relaxed culture were supposed to be good for Ed’s epilepsy. Additionally, he didn’t have to drive in Hawaii because he could commute by bicycle.

#### Learning More About Mass Surveillance

As usual, Ed wrote scripts to do all his work for him so he could use his time to do whatever he liked, which was to learn more about mass surveillance programs. He wanted to confirm mass surveillance was happening and learn all the technical details on how it was achieved. **Ed knew he wouldn’t be able to make a decision on what to do about STELLARWIND until he understood exactly how everything worked.** He wanted to know if the NSA was doing all the surveillance it was capable of doing, and who knew about it and approved it.

It was difficult to find information about the mass surveillance program. Every time Ed would find something promising, he couldn’t find further information about it, and if he did eventually turn up something, it would be a place unrelated to where he’d originally discovered its existence (for example, he might find a file within a different department.) Sometimes he’d find program names but no information about what the program was, or he’d find an explanation without a name and then he couldn’t tell if the explanation was for a real program, or just something the NSA eventually wanted to do.

#### Heartbeat

Ed’s research included “readboards”—NSA versions of news blogs. **He wrote a program called Heartbeat that was similar to EPICSHELTER—it would pull new and unique readboard posts from intelligence databases** of the NSA, FBI, CIA, and the Department of Defense’s Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System.

Heartbeat quickly pulled so much data that people complained about how much digital storage space it was taking up, so Ed decided to share the program. He set up Heartbeat to curate personal readboards for NSA officers based on their office, clearance, and interests. All the documents Heartbeat pulled Ed stored on a server that only he managed so that he could easily search all the available intelligence info.

#### Finding Documentation

**The documents Ed pulled using Heartbeat proved that the US government was carrying out mass surveillance.** He found schematics and engineering diagrams that showed upstream collection was possible.
