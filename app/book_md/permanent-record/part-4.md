## Part 4: Discovering Government Mass Surveillance | Chapter 6: Relocation to Tokyo

Parts 1-3 covered Ed’s life until approximately 2009. Part 4 covers Ed’s life from 2009 until 2012, during which he learned about the US government’s mass surveillance program, STELLARWIND.

> **Context: Mass Surveillance**
> 
> _Historical Mass Surveillance_
> 
> The pre-Internet version of mass surveillance is a census. In Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany, the census was used to collect information about people’s ethnicity and religion. Post-census, when the government wanted to discriminate against a group, they knew exactly who belonged to it.
> 
> The US census, however, hasn’t historically been used as surveillance. It’s used to reinforce democracy. The goal of the US census is to count how many people live in each state so that it can be proportionally represented in the House of Representatives.
> 
> _President’s Surveillance Program (PSP)_
> 
> After 9/11, George Bush came up with the President’s Surveillance Program (PSP). **A major part of this program was that the NSA could wiretap phone and Internet communication between the US and abroad _without_ a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). **The justification was the threat of terror.
> 
> This detail of the program was revealed to the public by whistleblowers in 2005. Public outcry ensued because the constitutionality of PSP was questionable. The program allegedly expired in 2007; however, the Protect America Act (2007) and FISA Amendments Act (2008) retroactively legalized the PSP and immunized the companies that had helped with it. The language of the two new acts was intentionally misleading—citizens thought their communications weren’t being monitored, but the acts actually gave the NSA more power.
> 
> Surprisingly, instead of a full congressional investigation into the PSP, the government only summarized the program. In 2009, the _Unclassified Report on the President’s Surveillance Program_ was released. The report was vague, the tone was chastising, and hardly any authoritative sources had been interviewed.
> 
> _Metadata_
> 
> **Metadata is information about how content is made.** For example, if you make a phone call, the metadata is how long the call was, the time and date, the numbers on the call, and where the phones were at the time of the call.
> 
> Your devices are constantly and automatically creating and emitting metadata. If someone is surveilling you and has access to your metadata, they know your routines and where you are at all times. They can predict your behavior. (In theory. Using data to predict people’s behavior isn’t very accurate and is, in fact, more like manipulation. For example, the government might try to predict what you’ll do based on the pattern of what you’ve done, the same way a website might suggest a book you’d like because you’ve read a different book. This is less prediction and more like getting you to do an action you’re presented with.)
> 
> **In terms of mass surveillance, metadata is more useful than exact transcripts of your phone calls** because it helps the NSA narrow down whom to target. For example, if you send an email to an organization that the NSA is interested in, they might become interested in you. Ironically, the law protects content more than metadata.
> 
> _American-ness of the Internet_
> 
> **America owns and controls most of the infrastructure of the Internet,** such as the towers, servers, satellites, and cables. As a result, most of the world’s Internet traffic—over 90%—at some point encounter something that’s operated, owned, or developed by US businesses or the government.
> 
> Additionally, most of this US technology is physically housed in the US and owned by American companies who must follow American law. **As a result, American laws about technology affect nearly everyone in the world who’s ever used a phone or computer.**
> 
> Unsurprisingly, the American-ness of the Internet makes some people and countries nervous. For example, China came up with their own system, the Great Firewall, but it doesn’t match the scale or the global reach of the Internet.

After Geneva, Ed took a new job in Japan in 2009. He went back to being a contractor (for Perot Systems, which was acquired by Dell) and worked for the NSA. Initially, his job was to connect the CIA and NSA’s infrastructure so they could share data.

#### EPICSHELTER

One of the problems the NSA faced in Japan was how to back up data. Ideally, local NSA facilities would send copies of their data back to headquarters at Fort Meade. However, sending data takes up a lot of bandwidth, so people weren’t doing it. As a result, if anything happened to the local server, the information was gone forever.

Ed was assigned to solving this problem. He was to build a storage and backup system that was automatic and constantly updated. The system was code-named EPICSHELTER.

The project was hard for several reasons, the main one being duplicated data. The NSA had tons of computers, many of which had the same files on them. Sending a hundred copies of the same file to NSA headquarters was a waste of bandwidth and storage space.

Ed built a deduplication system that compared files on all NSA computers. _If,_ and only if,__ a file on a local computer didn’t already exist at headquarters, the system would send it to headquarters to be backed up. This cut down on the number of files that needed to be sent, saving bandwidth.

#### Suspicion of Mass Surveillance Programs

While Ed was working in Japan, he attended a conference on China. The technology briefer canceled at the last minute and one of the chiefs asked Ed to step in. The topic was how much China could monitor US agents working in China.

Ed researched the topic on the NSA and CIA networks and learned exactly how China surveilled its citizens—with what machines, on what scale, and so on. **As Ed read about what China was doing, he came to the conclusion that the US must have done some of the same things to their own citizens.** If mass surveillance was possible, and the US already had the information about how to do it, there was no way they wouldn’t have tried it themselves, he reasoned. However, while China was spying on its citizens publicly, if the US was doing it, it was in secret.

Ed tried not to dwell on his suspicions. He rationalized them by comparing US views on freedom to China’s. China has an authoritarian government and the Great Firewall keeps citizens in and everyone else out. In contrast, the US government is democratic and doesn’t control Internet content or who can access it. At the time, Ed thought the US government only interfered with the Internet for defensive, targeted purposes.

#### Reports on the President’s Surveillance Program

The _Unclassified Report on the President’s Surveillance Program_ was released around the same time Ed was starting to suspect the US might be conducting some form of mass surveillance.**Ed thought the report had holes in it, so he went looking through the CIA and NSA networks for the classified version.** He couldn’t find it and eventually gave up.

However, the classified version found him. Because Ed was a sysadmin, whenever someone accidentally saved a draft copy of something they shouldn’t have, the system alerted him. The most confidential files had labels called “dirty words” that indicated that the file shouldn’t be stored outside of high-security drives. Whenever the system encountered a dirty word, it would notify the sysadmin—in this case, Ed—so he could get rid of it. He was expected to take a look at flagged files to make sure they weren’t flagged by accident.

Someone saved a draft of the classified report where they shouldn’t have (it normally lived in a compartment of Exceptionally Controlled Information).**Ed read it and discovered that the US government was in fact conducting mass surveillance.** The report said:

  * Warrantless data collection had continued past the PSP’s alleged expiry in 2007.
  * A program called STELLARWIND was carrying out “bulk collection” (a euphemism for mass surveillance).
  * The legislation surrounding technology was outdated and the issuing of warrants was too slow and bureaucratic, so bulk collection was necessary.
  * The definitions of “acquire” and “obtain,” in a legal sense, were changing. According to the report, data was only “acquired” or “obtained” when someone searched and retrieved that data from the NSA database. Therefore, the actual collection of communications didn’t require any warrant, because it wasn’t considered “acquired” or “obtained” until someone searched for the information. Using these definitions, the NSA could collect data on everyone.



**Ed struggled with everything he read in the report as he realized the implications.** He had known the NSA’s goal was to keep intelligence forever and he’d even helped build a system that would help them store it.
