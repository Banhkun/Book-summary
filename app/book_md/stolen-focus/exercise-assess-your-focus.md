## Exercise: Assess Your Focus

Hari argues that an attention crisis is undermining our ability to find flow, read, and think. Examine your own experience to see if you find evidence for these difficulties.

* * *

Describe the last time you were able to find a state of flow. How long ago was it? How long were you able to sustain your flow? What difficulties did you experience in reaching and maintaining flow?

Describe the last time you finished a physical book. How long ago was it? What difficulties did you experience in keeping your concentration while reading?

Describe the last time you let your mind wander. How long ago was it? What new insights or connections were you able to make? What difficulties did you experience in letting your mind wander?
