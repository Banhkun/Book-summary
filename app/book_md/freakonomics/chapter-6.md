## Chapter 6: What Data Can Teach Us

(Shortform note: this chapter is meant to illustrate what we can learn from applying statistical tools like regression analysis to a rich and large dataset. Like other chapters in _Freakonomics_ , **it employs an unusual, counterintuitive, and decidedly** **non-economic story** —in this case, the effect on life outcomes of individuals with black-sounding names—as a framing device for economic principles. When reading the book, it can be easy to get lost in the minutiae of the individual stories, so we reinforce the larger, overarching ideas.)

### Natural Experiments and Economics

**Economics is not an easy field in which to conduct randomized controlled experiments.** Since much of economics focuses on quantities that are very large (national GDP, effects of fiscal policy on employment) and involves the study of individual decisions made by billions of people, it’s rare for economists to be able to test their hypotheses in a lab.

For this reason, economists must observe events in the real world that happen create “variable” and “control” groups that can substitute for the classical design of a laboratory experiment. **These real world events are called** **natural experiments.** Throughout _Freakonomics_ , we’ve relied on several such naturally occurring datasets:

  * The CPS test scores indicating teacher cheating
  * The Chicago home sales data illuminating real estate agent incentives
  * The post-_Wade v. Roe_ crime statistics



**Raw public data sets are one of the best resources available to economists**.

(Shortform note: a good example of this approach within the economics field is a famous 1994 study on the effect of minimum wage on unemployment. Conventional wisdom held that increasing minimum wage would increase unemployment, by raising the price of hiring employees. This would be hard to run an experiment at scale. Instead, two economists studied a natural experiment: New Jersey increased its minimum wage, while neighboring Pennsylvania didn’t. New Jersey thus acted as the variable group and Pennsylvania as the control group. The result: New Jersey’s employment rate did _not_ suffer relative to Pennsylvania’s, even after New Jersey hiked its minimum wage.)

### Can People Be Harmed By Their Names? A Public Study Sheds Some Light

In 2004, an economist **studied a massive trove of public data,** published by the state of California,**** consisting of birth certificate information for every child born in the state since 1961. The dataset, which encompassed over 16 million births, contained invaluable information for each birth, including:

  * Standard information like name, gender, race, and birthweight
  * Parents’ marital status
  * Economic status indicators like zip code, parents’ means of paying the hospital bill, and parents’ level of education



He used this natural experiment to explore whether or not having a distinctively “black” name had a negative impact on an individual’s life prospects. In other words, would naming your son DeShawn lower his life outcomes compared to naming him Connor, even if you changed nothing else? The point of the study was to unpack the socioeconomic disparity between blacks and whites—might black culture _cause_ economic differences between races? In the case of names, having a blacker-sounding name might unfortunately cause more discrimination in job applications.

Given the impossibility and unethical nature of conducting a randomized controlled experiment on this topic (i.e., forcing two groups of parents to give their children black and non-black names, respectively, and then analyzing the children’s life outcomes), the dataset was the next best thing.

So what did the data show?

Over time, black and white parents diverged in the types of names they gave their children. In 1970, the typical girl in a black neighborhood received a name that was only twice as common among blacks as whites—by 1980, a girl in the same neighborhood would receive a name _twenty_ times as common among blacks. By the 2000s, 40 percent of black girls born in California in a given year would receive a name that **_not one_ of the 100,000+ white girls born in the state that year would have**. A further 30 percent of black girls receive names that _no_ other babies (white or black) would have.

As a standard for comparison, white, Asian-American, and Hispanic-American parents differ a bit, but nowhere near as much as the white-black difference.

The economist also saw points of commonality between the mothers who were most likely to give their children distinctively black names. They tended to be:

  * Teen mothers 
  * Unmarried
  * From low socioeconomic backgrounds 
  * Have low educational attainment
  * **Have distinctively black names themselves**



This last data point was critical, since **it enabled researchers to build** **another natural experiment.**

Combing through the data,**they could track the full life trajectory of those _mothers_ who had distinctively black names and** **compare them against a control group of mothers who _didn’t_ have distinctively black names**. Using regression analysis, they could control for other factors that might have influenced these women’s life trajectories like (education, income, or criminal history) and measure the impact of**** their names.

The research indicated that, all other things being equal, individuals with black names _did_ tend to have worse life outcomes than those with less ethnically distinct monikers.

But as with the parenting factors above, we must not draw causal relationships for which we have no basis. The name is an _indicator_ that is associated with poor outcomes. Absent a formal randomized controlled trial, we cannot establish causality with certainty. As the data demonstrated, the kind of black parents who give their children names like “DeShawn” or “Shaniqua” are disproportionately likely to be poor and suffer from low educational attainment, which makes it likely that this cycle of poverty will manifest in the life outcomes of their children. Despite the trends, the causality is unclear - distinctively black names may be more symptom than cause.
