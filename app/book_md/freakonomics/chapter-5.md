## Chapter 5: Correlation vs. Causation

### Why We Falsely Link Effects to Causes

When two things happen together, it’s tempting to believe that one caused the other. For example, in the previous chapter, we saw that the economy improved while crime rates dropped. This seems like a satisfying explanation, until the data show the economy couldn’t have had a large effect.

**In reality, many correlated phenomena are correlated purely by chance.** This gives rise to the well-known saying, “correlation does not imply causation.”

(Shortform note: this underlies a lot of popular superstitions, like people who wear their “lucky hats” to baseball games because they think it helps their team win.)

### How Parents Fall Prey to the Correlation vs. Causation Trap

A great demonstration of the correlation/causation trap can be found in the proliferation of popular theories about how “best” to raise children. For years, childcare **experts have advocated** **contradictory and ever-changing theories:**

  * They used to advocate co-sleeping—now they don’t.
  * They used to encourage stomach-sleeping for infants—now, since we know so much more about sudden infant death syndrome, they REALLY don’t.



Because the stakes are so high, parents are _highly_ susceptible to fearmongering and conventional wisdom on childcare. Unfortunately, this leads parents to go to extraordinary lengths and expend vast resources on measures that have a questionable impact on child safety. They purchase expensive car seats, despite their dubious safety record. They forbid their children from playing at homes where guns are present, while ignoring more mundane, but far more likely risks like unfenced pools.

In general, **we tend to fear things that seem random, sudden, and unpredictable (even if they are wildly unlikely).** It’s why we demand action against terrorism (which you stand almost a zero percent chance of falling victim to), but are blasé about heart disease (which kills over 600,000 Americans annually). It’s why we panic over mad cow disease (a similarly low risk), while being relatively sanguine about global warming (a slow-moving catastrophe that nevertheless threatens to destroy civilization as we know it).

**So do parents need to worry as much as they do? Do our efforts as parents even make as much of a difference as we think they do?**

### Regression Analysis: Breaking Down the Correlation/Causation Fallacy

The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS), launched by the US. Department of Education in the 1990s, measured the academic progress of over 20,000 students as they progressed from kindergarten to the fifth grade, interviewing parents and educators and asking a broad range of questions about the children’s home environment. **The study** **provided an ample resource of data** that researchers could use to identify more statistically meaningful relationships between specific parenting tactics and children’s academic outcomes.

**Researchers used regression analysis to draw conclusions from this rich data set.** Regression analysis enables researchers to**** isolate two variables in a complicated and messy set of data, holding everything else constant to identify relationships between variables. Its main benefit is that **it allows analysts to control for confounding variables that might otherwise confuse the true causal relationship.**

It is important to note that regression analysis does not “prove” causal relationships. The only way to truly do that would be to set up a randomized, controlled experiment, similar to what would be done in a clinical trial for a new pharmaceutical. This is very hard (if not impossible) to do in a field like economics, where it is highly impractical to create these conditions. Thus, economists use regression analysis to study causative relationships in natural experiments.

According to the ECLS study, **these are the factors that were strongly correlated with children’s test scores:**

  * Having highly educated parents
  * Having parents with a high socioeconomic status
  * Having a mother thirty or older at the time of her ﬁrst child’s birth
  * Being born with a low birthweight
  * Speaking English in the home
  * Being adopted
  * Having parents active in PTA
  * Living in a home with many books



Meanwhile,**these factors were _not_ correlated with children’s test scores**:

  * Coming from a traditional, two-parent home
  * Moving to a better neighborhood
  * Having a stay-at-home mom between birth and kindergarten
  * Attending Head Start
  * Regularly attending museums
  * Being spanked on a regular basis
  * Watching television frequently
  * Being read to daily



If you look at the lists of factors above, do you notice a pattern? **Most of the traits that correlated with academic performance were** **immutable characteristics that parents _possessed_**. They were either rooted in the parents’ identity or had to do with things the parents had achieved _before_ they had children. They weren’t active decisions made by the parents.

Accordingly, the traits that _weren’t_ linked to children’s academic performance were things that parents _made the deliberate choice to do_(like going to museums, reading, limiting TV).

In some ways, this is unsatisfying. We like to focus on what tangible things we can do (like reading to our kids or cutting their TV time), and we like to believe those actions make a difference. In contrast, we don’t like being subject to environmental causes outside our control (like how rich our parents were), because it punctures the idea that we as individuals are fully in control of our own destiny.

But regardless of how we feel, the data speak for itself. Who parents _are_ , what attributes they possess, matters more than what they _do_. **Parent _ing_ may not make a difference—but _parents_ most likely do.**
