## Chapter 4: Big Effects Can Have Small Causes

(Shortform note: this chapter discusses the dramatic and unexpected fall in US crime rates beginning in the early 1990s, examining a number of popular theories for why this happened before proposing an alternative, and quite counterintuitive, explanation. As we’ll discuss later, the authors’ theory has become controversial since the initial publication of _Freakonomics_.)

### The Rise and Fall of Crime

We discussed the crack-fueled violence of the 1980s in the preceding chapter. But crack was just one part of an alarming rise in violent crime that had begun in the 1950s and continued for a generation. In 1989, violent crime in America was at a peak, having risen **15 percent since 1975.**

Criminologists and law enforcement personnel warned the public that these trends would continue well into the 1990s and beyond. But this also proved to be wrong.

Beginning in the mid-1990s, crime began an unexpected and precipitous decline, dropping to levels not seen since the 1950s. The much-predicted (and much-feared) rise in murders, rapes, burglaries, and assaults simply failed to materialize.

### Why Did This Happen?

Experts cited six main explanations for the phenomenon:

  1. Economic growth
  2. More incarceration/capital punishment
  3. Putting more cops on the streets/innovative policing strategies
  4. Gun control
  5. Aging of the population
  6. Structural changes to crack markets



It’s a standard economics approach to investigate each hypothesis, looking for data to support or contradict the theory.

As we crunch the numbers below, however, **all these theories added together don’t come close to accounting for the falling crime rate.** Furthermore, the list leaves out a major (and surprising) cause of the phenomenon. We’ll examine each of the conventional theories in turn.

#### Economic growth?

Some experts argued that the economy improved in the 1990s, leading fewer people into crime.

It is true that the great decline in crime coincided with the 1990s economic boom, but not enough. According to studies, a 1 percent drop in unemployment would be expected to be matched by a 1 percent drop in nonviolent, economically motivated crime.

**Unemployment declined by only 2 percent during the 1990s, while** **_nonviolent_ crime alone plummeted by 40 percent! **The economy might contribute a bit, but not enough.

#### More incarceration/capital punishment?

The idea is that being “tougher on crime” in the 1990s dissuaded people from committing crimes.

It’s true that crime had flourished during a relatively lax period of criminal justice enforcement in the 1960s and 1970s. Conviction rates declined during this era, and those who _were_ convicted tended to serve shorter sentences. If we think back to incentives, we’ll see that **the cost of committing crime was relatively low** , which encouraged criminal activity.

In response, the public began clamoring for “tough on crime” policies, first with putting more people in jail. **The national prison population increased by a factor of 15 from 1980 to 2000** , with more than 2 million behind bars by 2000.**** The mass incarceration theory, while far from being a _complete_ explanation, does have _some_ merit as an underlying cause of the fall in crime. Prison sentencing explains about **one-third of the decline in crime.**

(Shortform note: after this book was published, a 2015 review by the Brennan Center for Justice argued that incarceration only accounted for just **0 and 7 percent** of the reduction in crime during the 1990s.)

Being “tough on crime” also included capital punishment. **Proponents of the death penalty argue that it acts as a** **strong disincentive to crime** and that its increased use during the 1990s coincided with the decline in crime.

But the rate of execution is actually quite low. **Fewer than 500 people were executed in the US during the the 1990s**. Even among prisoners _already convicted and on death row_ , **the annual execution rate is only 2 percent.** Given the low likelihood of actually facing execution, it doesn’t make sense that criminals would be deterred. In other words, capital punishment is more of an empty threat than a real cost.

#### More cops/better policing?

Maybe it was driven by putting more cops on the street? From the 1950s to 1980s, police number relative to the number of crimes decreased by 50%. Then there _was_ a 14 percent increase in the number of police officers**** during the 1990s**.**

**This alone, however, doesn’t prove the _causal_ relationship**—in fact, **where there are a lot of police, there tends to be _more_ crime** (because the public demands more police when crime levels are high). Obviously, police aren’t _causing_ crime, so the true causal mechanism must be more complex than that.

How can we get closer to the real dynamic at play? **We look for real-world examples that enable us to conduct natural experiments** through which we can which we can test the theory. Of course, we want examples where more police were hired for reasons _other than an ongoing crime wave_ , so as to not confuse cause and effect.

When mayors run for reelection, they often go on a police hiring binge in the months leading up to the election. **The data does show that** a short surge in police presence is correlated with a drop in crime rates**during these brief periods**. **Research suggests that about 10 percent of the drop in 1990s crime can be credited to hiring more police officers.**

If putting more**** police on the beat isn’t the whole answer, then **perhaps it’s about better policing strategies?** It might have been _quality_ of policing rather than _quantity_ of policing that helped cut down on crime.

Unfortunately, the data doesn’t bear this story out either.**** In New York City in the 1990s, Mayor Giuliani hired a new commissioner to revamp the police approach, including using data-driven tools to spot crime and cracking down on petty crime. The results initially looked promising: **NYC’s sky-high crime rate plummeted, faster than anywhere else in the country**. Murder rates decreased by 72%.

**In retrospect, however, this decline in 1991,_before_ Giuliani took office!** The NYPD had begun a hiring surge under Giuliani’s predecessor, ultimately growing by 45 percent during the 1990s. When you subtract the effect of these new officers, the city’s performance runs about even with national trends.

Moreover, the decline in crime was a _nationwide_ phenomenon, including in cities that _did not_ deploy cutting-edge law enforcement strategies. The notion that policing quality wasthe main driving factor in bringing down crime seems weak.

#### Gun control?

Guns make it easier to inflict lethal violence, but whether or not they will be used in a deliberate act of homicide comes down to _who_ is wielding them. Research does suggest the abundance of firearms contributes to the country’s high murder rate: two-thirds of US homicides involve a gun, a far higher percentage than in other industrialized countries.

It would seem, then, that **policies that strongly limited the availability and circulation of guns** **would reduce crime.**

Perhaps they would, but the _actual_ policies adopted during the 1990s were a far cry from this ideal, and did little to curb the circulation and supply of firearms.

Take the Brady Act from 1993, which established background checks and waiting periods for buying handguns. However, **it failed to crack down on the** **black market for handguns** , where most criminals get their guns. According to its critics, the main effect was to make it harder for law-abiding citizens to access handguns.

Therefore, it’s unlikely 1990s gun laws had any meaningful impact on crime rates.

#### Structural changes to crack markets?

Since we’ve shown that crack was a major driving force behind the rising violence of urban America in the 1980s, did its subsequent fall in the 1990s have something to do with crack as well?

It did, although like all the other theories, crack is only part of the story. Crack use never actually went away - what did decrease was**** the violence associated with it**.**

Why? While there were profits to be made in crack, eventually supply and demand stabilized the market::

  * The allure of high profits drove new entrants to the market.
  * With more competitors, gangs began undercutting one another on price.
  * The price war drove down _overall_ prices.
  * The once-high profit margins collapsed.
  * Street dealers were paid less, and saw less incentive to commit violent crime for low pay.



As a result, crack violence started to wane, **accounting for 15 percent of the drop in crime during the 1990s.**

#### Aging population?

Experts in the 1990s believed the population was trending younger. Since people between age 16-24 commit the most crimes, a younger population would mean more crime.

**In fact, this was doubly-wrong.** Firstly, the population was actually getting older, not younger, and old people commit crimes much less often. Secondly, even when we account for an aging population, that kind of**demographic change is a very long, slow process**. It’s unlikely to produce the kind of swift and sudden decline in crime as we saw in the 1990s.

### The Hidden Factor: Legal Abortion

So, the seven above factors only account for about 60 percent of the reduction in crime. What about the other 40 percent?

According to _Freakonomics_ , the missing answer was _Roe v. Wade’s_ nationwide legalization of abortion in 1973. Because this happened two decades before the declining crime trend began, it wasn’t top of mind for researchers who came up with the other seven explanations.

Here’s the idea: before _Roe v. Wade_ , women who sought abortions but couldn’t get them were disproportionately likely to be teenage mothers who were poor, single, undereducated, and/or drug and alcohol dependent. In turn, their children (raised in unstable homes) were more likely to become criminals later in life, particularly when they reach the 16-24 age group, which are the peak years of criminal activity.

The numbers are large—by 1980, **1.6 million abortions were performed**. And these post-_Roe_ abortions were disproportionately requested by women who fell into the demographic set identified above.

But the real effects of legalized abortion on crime wouldn’t be felt for almost twenty years later. Beginning in the early 1990s, **crime started to fall, precisely at the time when these babies aborted following _Roe_ would have been entering their peak crime-committing years. **In effect, a large cohort of at-risk children who would have been teenagers in the early 1990s was never born.

The theory is bolstered by research showing that states that had legalized abortion _before_ 1973 saw crime rates drop _earlier_ in the 1990s than those that hadn’t, and states with _highest_ abortion rates in the 1970s saw the _largest_ crime decreases in the 1990s.

(Shortform caveat: in recent years, the outlawing of lead additives in motor fuel in the early 1970s has been suggested as another reason for the crime fall. Since **lead exposure has been linked to learning disabilities, low IQ, and poor impulse control** , researchers argue that children with a high degree of lead exposure run a higher risk of becoming criminals. This theory also explains why crime rose during the mid-20th century as widespread motorization resulted in more lead exposure by children, particularly in dense urban areas.

Regardless of the ultimate answer, the point of this chapter, in our eyes, is to **show the process of using scientific inquiry and data to unravel a complex phenomenon**. There is rarely one clear answer, and different causes can have differently-sized effects. Rather than accepting conventional wisdom, examine all the hypotheses, and figure out how likely each is.)
