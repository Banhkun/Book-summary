## 1-Page Summary

_Freaknomics: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything_ is the book for readers who run screaming at the thought of cracking open a book with the word “economics” in the title. When most readers think economics, they think advanced math, complicated models, and subjects like unemployment, the stock market, and the trade deficit.

In _Freakonomics,_ authors Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner take a different approach. They use economics to, as the title says, “explore the hidden side of everything.” **They argue that economic motivations determine much of human behavior** , and demonstrate that **economic analysis can be applied to a wide range of problems in the real world.**

**This approach to economics is empirical, not theoretical.**

Throughout, the authors emphasize some key themes.

### The Power of Incentives

Simply put, human beings are self-motivated creatures. They are driven by their desire to get what they want, and they will always look for ways to achieve their ends by the easiest or least-costly means.

Therefore, **proper incentive design is key, and poorly designed incentives often misfire**. For example, it might seem like a great idea to hold individual teachers accountable for their students’ scores on standardized tests—until that incentive drives those same teachers to start cheating on behalf of their students!

Not all incentives are purely monetary. **There are economic, social, and moral incentives** , and they all exert a powerful grip on human behavior. The key for economists and for those who wish to move public policy in a certain direction is to harness the power of incentives to make them work toward some desired goal.

### Beware Conventional Wisdom

**Conventional wisdom is easy to understand, comforting, and confirms our own preconceived notions** —it’s not necessarily _correct_. Conventional wisdom held that violent crime would keep soaring through the 1990s and into the 21st century, as it had in the decades before, except it didn’t. Conventional wisdom says that money is the decisive factor in elections, but it’s not.

### Tune Out the Experts

Supposed “experts,” like the talking heads on TV or even your doctors, aren’t neutral, unbiased actors, motivated solely by their desire to put their knowledge to work for you. They’re fallible human beings, just as motivated by incentives and guided by conventional wisdom as everyone else.

Instead of listening to these “trusted” sources of information, _Freakonomics_ argues that we should apply rigorous data analysis to get a better picture of what’s _really_ going on.

### Information Can Be Abused

**Information asymmetry** **describes situations where information is unequally distributed between parties.** Experts rely on knowing more than the other party to extract value from others.

For example, you might think that your real estate agent has your best interests at heart. The more she sells your home for, the larger her commission will be. But she’s actually using her vastly superior knowledge of the real estate market to get the best deal for _herself_ , often at your expense. With her information advantage, she can convince you that a lowball offer on your house is actually a _good_ one and encourage you to quickly sell your house below-market, so she can pocket her commission and move on to her next client.

Other common situations where one party has significantly more information include:

  * Doctors recommending treatments that pay more without yielding better outcomes.
  * Policy makers pushing policies that benefit some groups at the expense of general society.
  * Employers negotiating your salary.



In all of these situations, the layperson (patient, citizen, employee) is at a considerable information disadvantage relative to the expert (doctor, lobbyist, employer). _Freakonomics_ brings a critical lens to these transactions and shows how information can be wielded as a weapon.

### Analyze Data to Find the Truth

It’s a messy world out there. Human behavior often seems irrational and unpredictable, with no guiding principle driving or explaining any of it. **To pierce through the haze of conventional wisdom, self-interested experts, and information asymmetry,** **look to** **data analysis.** People can lie and cheat, but it’s a lot harder for numbers to.**** Using tools from economics like regression analysis, we can make a little more sense of why events unfold the way they do.

### Effects Have Distant and Surprising Causes

Seemingly small events can have powerful ripple effects across vast distances of space and time. Something as routine as one woman seeking an abortion in the early 1970’s may have been the catalyzing event for a nationwide reduction in violent crime— _twenty years later_. As the old adage goes, big doors can swing on small hinges.
