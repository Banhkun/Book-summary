## Exercise: Identify the Incentive

If you define the incentive in a situation, you’ll understand the human behavior better.

* * *

A bank decides to increase its profit margins and motivate its workforce by creating a new incentive program: employees receive bonuses for having customers open new accounts or sign up for additional products and services. Employees are also threatened with termination if they do _not_ meet predetermined quotas assigned by management. Describe how this incentive structure could end up encouraging bad or unethical behavior.

In your workplace or personal life, do you see any economic incentives that are unintentionally leading to bad behavior? Describe the situation:1) what is the incentive, 2) what is the intended effect, and 3) what bad behavior is it encouraging?

In society, social and moral incentives keep people acting in ways deemed “socially acceptable.” What is a social or moral incentive that you disagree with? How would you instead prefer that people behave?
