## Exercise: Plan a Parenting Decision

In _Cribsheet_ , Oster identifies some of the challenges that complicate the process of making parenting decisions, and she offers advice on how to make better-informed, less stressful decisions. Take some time to apply her ideas to an upcoming parenting decision.

* * *

Think about a parenting decision that’s on the horizon for you (whether you’re planning to have a child or currently have a young child). Describe the decision below. (For example, perhaps you’re determining whether to use cloth or disposable diapers.)

Reflect on some of the challenges that complicate the process of making parenting decisions: other parents’ moral judgments, contradictory advice, and the difficulty of interpreting and applying data. Which of these challenges are you currently facing or do you anticipate you’ll face? Describe your encounters with these challenges (or expected encounters) in detail. (For example, other parents might judge your decision to use disposable diapers as environmentally unfriendly.)

Make a plan for how you’ll locate research with actionable data to inform your decision. (For example, you could check out a library book on a relevant topic, reach out to your doctor for recommendations, or browse online for a relevant, randomized trial. If your decision relates to a parenting topic already covered in this guide, describe the findings that are most relevant to your decision.)

List your options for this parenting decision and consider how they’ll each affect your unique situation. Describe each option’s benefits and (known) risks for you, your child, and your budget. Furthermore, describe any ways you can think of to minimize these risks. (For example, babies who wear cloth diapers have a higher risk of diaper rash because cloth diapers don’t absorb moisture as well as disposable diapers do. However, you can minimize the risk of diaper rash by changing your baby’s cloth diaper more frequently.)

Finally, apply economic reasoning to your decision by describing each option’s opportunity cost. Then, reflect on those opportunity costs and everything else you’ve considered so far. Which option are you leaning toward, and why? (For example, choosing cloth diapers could save you $120 to $270, which you could spend on something else—but washing cloth diapers is also time-consuming. You may decide that the time you save using disposable diapers is worth the extra cost of those diapers.)
