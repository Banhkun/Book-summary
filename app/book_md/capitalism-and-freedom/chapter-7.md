## Chapter 7: Capitalism and Discrimination

We’ve seen in earlier chapters how voluntary exchange provides a decentralizing check against the power-centralizing forces of government. Despite this, capitalism is often seen by its critics as an exploitative system that rewards the already-powerful and subjugates the powerless. But precisely the opposite is the case.

**By celebrating and promoting voluntary exchange, capitalism is actually a great promoter of human freedom, especially for traditionally marginalized groups.** In this chapter, we’ll explore:

  * Why racial or any other form of discrimination is incompatible with a free market;
  * Why a principled opposition to discrimination requires one to oppose both equal opportunity employment laws favored by the political left and right-to-work laws favored by the political right.



(Shortform note: Friedman’s opposition to equal employment opportunity laws reflects what was once mainstream opinion, particularly among economic conservatives at the time of C _apitalism and Freedom_ ’s publication in 1962. Many today will find this view offensive, arguing that the repeal of such laws would cause direct harm to people of color and provide further support for systemic racism. We recognize these concerns and, in this summary, merely present for the reader Friedman’s arguments as they appeared in the original text.)

### The Irrationality of Discrimination

It is a great irony that traditionally marginalized groups are disproportionately drawn to anti-capitalist politics, viewing free markets as instruments of oppression. Yet it has historically been the very _introduction_ of free markets that has removed the shackles of oppression from such groups.

For example, because of their religion, Jews were usually severely restricted in their economic activities during the Middle Ages. But the rise of capitalism and contract arrangements in economic life created a strong incentive for Christians to work with Jews, because the religious status of one’s business partner became subordinate to the potential for profit.

**Free markets enable individuals to advance on the basis of their talent and productivity, not skin color, gender, religion, or other irrelevant characteristics.** This is not to say, of course, that people in a free-market society don’t practice discrimination—experience plainly shows that they do.

But their decision to do so is irrational and against their economic interests. If a white restaurateur, acting on her racism, refuses to serve black customers, hire black staff, or purchase supplies from black wholesalers, she is harming her own interests by limiting her range of options and restricting potential revenue from black customers who might otherwise be happy to spend their money in her establishment.

**In a capitalist society, the entrepreneur benefits from choice and competition**. Our restaurateur is limiting her options and, as a result, will face higher labor and overhead costs—while limiting herself to fewer customers. Capitalism thus explicitly punishes segregation and rewards egalitarianism.

### Equal Employment Opportunity Laws

**Those on the political left tend to favor equal employment opportunity laws, enacted to solve the problem of discrimination in hiring**. But such laws, while undoubtedly well-intentioned, clearly violate the economic freedoms of employers and employees.

The bedrock principle of a free-market economy is that individuals ought to be able to enter into voluntary contracts with one another. But equal opportunity employment laws might mandate that a minority candidate be hired regardless of whether or not the employer believes they are a proper fit for the position.

This in and of itself violates the employer’s freedom of contract rights. It could also have harmful consequences for their business. For example, if a department store in a community where there is strong hostility to black people is compelled by equal opportunity laws to hire a black employee, it might trigger a negative reaction from customers. The store could lose business and suffer damages as a result.

**Once the government violates the principle of freedom of contract, any number of abuses becomes possible.** If the government can negate freedom of contract by _denying_ the right of employers to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or any other individual characteristic, it could also theoretically negate freedom of contract by _mandating_ that private employers engage in such discrimination.

To combat discriminatory practices by employers, it is far better to change the attitudes of individuals and convince them that prejudice is wrong and self-destructive than it is to use the coercive power of the state.

### Open Shop Laws

But the political left is not solely guilty when it comes to impeding freedom of contract in the name of preventing discrimination. For their part, conservatives tend to favor state “right-to-work” or “open shop” laws. These are laws that prohibit employment contracts from requiring all employees to be members of a labor union. But if workers wish to bargain collectively with their employers and the employers agree to such terms in a contract, that is solely the business of the two parties.

**So-called free-market capitalists who support anti-union legislation of this kind are favoring the use of government power to inhibit freedom of contract.** There is, however, a danger that labor unions may grow so powerful as to constitute a monopoly within the labor market, thereby infringing the economic freedom of employers.

In such a scenario, the government must have the political will to employ anti-trust legislation against _unions_ , just as it has against _businesses_. We will explore monopolies and their consequences on economic freedom in greater detail in the next chapter.
