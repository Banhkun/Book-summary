## Chapters 3-4: The Money Supply and Monetary Policy

In the last chapter, we talked about the role of government in curbing monopolies and regulating neighborhood effects. As we saw, the public sector has a role to play in these aspects of economic activity, because the free market would be unable to do them (or do them efficiently).

But free-market principles also allow for some other, limited functions of government. One of these is the issuance of currency and the regulation of the money supply. In this chapter, we’ll analyze how governments manage the domestic money supply through central banks. We’ll also explore how governments balance their currencies against those of other nations—and the implications of these activities for economic freedom.

### The Trouble With Commodity Standards

We’ve already seen how**large concentrations of government power tend to threaten individual liberty because of the collective, coercive nature of government itself.** Because money is so central to the billions of daily individual transactions that power a market economy, therefore, capitalists tend to favor a reduced role for the public sector in monetary policy.

This aversion to central control of the money supply is why a commodity standard—a system in which money is directly tied to the amount of some physical commodity (usually gold or silver) held in reserve—has historically been attractive to capitalists; it limits the amount of human involvement in monetary policy. After all, if the amount of money in circulation is in direct proportion to the amount of gold or silver held in reserve, then the ability of government bureaucrats to meddle with the money supply is greatly reduced.

But, in reality, such systems have proved unworkable. Digging metal commodities out of the ground requires great effort and expense, and there is a finite amount of it. Thus, if we could only use gold coins to conduct daily transactions, there would never be enough currency on hand to meet demand.

Therefore, most economies evolved to have private individuals and financial institutions issue paper money that could serve as a substitute for gold and would be redeemable in gold if presented to the issuer. From there, it naturally followed that governments would issue their own paper money and begin to regulate the currency so as to prevent fraud.

**Over time, people simply came to accept paper money as valuable in and of itself, independent of its convertibility to gold.** As long as the government guarantees that official paper currency can be used as legal tender, it has value. Therefore, some amount of government involvement in the issuance of money is inevitable.

### Central Banks, Central Control

Because governments must play some role in the regulation of the money supply in a modern economy, central banks like the Bank of England in the UK or the Federal Reserve System in the US have emerged to take on this core function. **Central banks are publicly chartered financial institutions that have the power to increase or decrease the supply and circulation of money in an economy** , primarily through their control of interest rates.

When the United States Federal Reserve System (usually referred to as “the Fed”) believes that the money supply is too low (as in cases of deflation, or falling prices), it purchases US Treasury securities from large private banks. These purchases give the banks new reserves of cash that they can use to issue loans to other banks, infusing new liquidity into the system and enabling interest rates to drop throughout the economy.

By contrast, when the Fed believes that the money supply is too _high_(as in cases of inflation, or rising prices), it _sells_ US Treasury securities to major banks, taking money out of circulation and enabling interest rates to _rise_ throughout the economy.

These activities are meant to ensure that the banking system has the liquidity it needs to conduct business, as well as provide price stability throughout the economy. Nevertheless, **control of interest rates vests a great deal of power in government and represents the most consequential intervention by the public sector into the market.** This power can be extremely dangerous if placed in the wrong hands.

### The Federal Reserve and the Great Depression

**The onset of the Great Depression provides an excellent demonstration of the potential for the government to misuse its power over the economy.** In this case, the Fed utterly failed to prevent the United States from falling into the Great Depression during the critical period from 1930-31.

Although most Americans believe that the famous Wall Street Crash of 1929 (known as “Black Monday”) caused the Depression, this is a misreading of history. The crash, while dramatic, was not nearly a large enough shock to the system to produce the catastrophic collapse in aggregate demand and cascading bank failures that marked those early years of the Depression.

It is particularly important to look at the Fed’s failure to rescue the banking system in those critical early years.

#### Anatomy of a Bank Run

A bank run is when depositors (such as individuals, businesses, and even other banks) demand to withdraw their funds from a bank all at the same time, usually in response to fears that the financial system as a whole is on the verge of collapse.

Unfortunately, these fears can become self-fulfilling prophecies. Banks do not hold cash in reserves equal to their deposits. When you deposit $100 in the bank, the bank might keep $5 on hand as reserves. The remaining $95 is loaned out at interest to borrowers—this is how banks make a profit. The system is known as the fractional-reserve system.

Because of this, banks face enormous pressure to satisfy depositors’ demands during a bank run. Under pressure, they will begin calling in loans that they’ve made to _other_ banks, adding further strain to the system. If left unchecked, the contagion can spread throughout the financial system and lead to total collapse.

This is where a central bank plays a critical role as a lender of last resort, through its ability to reduce interest rates, pump liquidity into the system, and ensure that banks are able to meet demands for withdrawals. If a central bank acts quickly, correctly, and decisively, it can inspire confidence in the banking system and stop demands for withdrawals from getting out of hand.

#### The Fed’s Failure to Act

**Unfortunately, the Fed failed catastrophically in this role in the run-up to the Depression.** November 1930 saw the beginning of a series of disastrous bank runs in the US. This was the moment when the Fed should have acted decisively to cut interest rates, buy Treasury bonds, and pump liquidity into the system.

But instead, the Fed simply did nothing, apparently not believing that the situation merited any intervention. In fact, the Fed’s account books from the time show that it actually _tightened_ the money supply, making credit scarcer at the worst possible time.

The unwillingness to act led to the worst two-year period of economic contraction in US history. While some downturn was likely inevitable, the Fed could have averted the worst of its effects through aggressive monetary policy. Its failures turned a mild slump in the business cycle into a full-blown economic disaster of historic proportions that saw the US money supply contract by one-third.

### Rules for Monetary Policy

This history of the Fed’s failure to perform during its most critical test—indeed, the very type of

situation it was created to address—demonstrates **the danger of concentrating too much economic power in the hands of a few central bankers.**

Although we’ve established that some level of government involvement in the management and implementation of monetary policy is unavoidable, it is not without risks. The Fed is a highly centralized system that leaves day-to-day management of crucial economic policy in the hands of powerful bureaucrats, without meaningful oversight from elected officials.

**These officials have broad discretion to manage the supply of money as the situation may dictate, without reference to any particular overriding rule or general principle**. While this may provide the Fed with a high degree of flexibility, it also leaves the door open for bad decisions with wide-ranging consequences, based solely on the misguided judgment of the handful of bureaucrats making key decisions.

Moreover, the Fed is charged with a dual mandate of achieving both price stability and full employment. These mandates are in competition with one another, as employment and inflation tend to have an inverse relationship. While the Fed’s actions do have some effect on both, the effect is indirect and often difficult to predict. Fed officials cannot reliably use the mandate to achieve either price stability or full employment as a guide to their day-to-day actions.

The Fed should instead operate strictly according to rules about governing the money supply and set reasonable targets for its growth. Although it is impossible to say with certainty, a good rate of growth would be between 3 and 5 percent per month. This would make the Fed’s actions stable and predictable, while limiting the institution solely to the performance of those functions over which it has more or less direct control—namely, control of the money supply.

### Foreign Exchange

**Governments also play a significant role in revaluing or devaluing _their_ currencies relative to those of _other_ countries. **Both a strong dollar (one that has a high exchange rate relative to other currencies) and a weak dollar (one that has a low exchange rate relative to other currencies) have different advantages for different players in the economy.

A strong currency benefits importers of raw materials from abroad and consumers of foreign goods, because it enables them to purchase pounds sterling or yen or euros with fewer dollars, in turn enabling them to purchase more goods and services denominated in those currencies. A weak currency, on the other hand, benefits exporters, because it enables them to sell American goods and services cheaper in foreign markets, giving them a competitive advantage.

Because of these advantages and disadvantages of currency valuations, countries used to frequently try to manipulate the value of their currencies relative to others in order to benefit some sector of their domestic market. Unsurprisingly, political lobbying and influence peddling (not free-market principles) were central to this process, with special interests pressuring governments and central bank officials to adopt monetary policies that would benefit them.

#### The Bretton Woods System

This was the state of affairs until the introduction of the Bretton Woods System in 1944. The Bretton Woods system pegged the value of the US dollar to gold at $35 per ounce of gold.**** In turn, the other parties to the Bretton Woods agreement had to peg _their_ currencies to the US dollar in fixed ratios, with only minor diversions permitted.

**The purpose of this arrangement was to create a stable monetary system that would more easily facilitate international transactions by maintaining parity and predictable exchange rates between currencies**. It was also designed to prevent countries from engaging in competitive cycles of devaluing their currencies. It was the international monetary system in place in 1962, when _Capitalism and Freedom_ was published.

Unfortunately, to make this whole system work, the US had to constantly maintain adequate reserves of gold and dollars in order to be able to convert dollars to gold (and vice versa) at the specified price, whenever the need arose. This meant that **the United States had to impose heavy-handed controls over capital flows in and out of the country and restrict the freedom of individuals to conduct ordinary business transactions.**

For example, the aforementioned convertibility of the US dollar to gold only applied to _foreign central banks’_ holdings of US dollars. To maintain adequate gold stocks, the US government forbade US citizens from exchanging their dollars for gold, holding stocks of gold (except for artistic or limited industrial purposes), or writing private contracts that specified payment in gold.

To prevent _dollars_ from flowing out of the country, the government mandated that foreign countries spend their American foreign aid dollars in the United States; prevented families from joining members of the military serving abroad (knowing that they would spend their dollars outside the US); and strictly limited the quantities of foreign goods that Americans could bring into the country without paying a duty.

**All of these measures represented a direct affront to the most core principles of economic freedom.** In a free society, competent individuals should face no restrictions on their ability to conduct transactions and make contracts.

#### Floating Currency

Instead of this elaborate and carefully managed system of international currency pegging, **countries should be free to let their currencies simply “float”—i.e., let the free market determine the value of currencies relative to one another.**

Skeptics of free-floating exchange rates once worried that such a system would lead to wild fluctuations in the relative value of currencies. But this fear was not grounded in reality. After all, the United States and other countries with market economies had free price systems for the buying and selling of ordinary domestic goods and services—it was not as if the government mandated prices for televisions or automobiles.

This did not lead to unpredictable price swings in these markets, because prices of goods and services are fundamentally a reflection of broader underlying economic conditions and policies. As long as this macroeconomic structure remained the same, price changes would be slow and modest. There was no reason to believe that the market for currency would behave differently.

The inflows and outflows of currency would always balance out under such a system—the seller of dollars would need to find a buyer willing to pay her in the equivalent value of foreign currency. Losses of domestic currency would by definition be offset by gains in foreign currency reserves.

This system would enable the United States to abandon all capital controls (including the guarantee to purchase gold and foreign currencies at guaranteed rates), end restrictions on transactions between private firms and individuals, and expand the zone of free trade. Absent major structural changes, this free-floating currency system would produce stable and predictable currency valuations—without cumbersome and intrusive government meddling.

(Shortform note: Since the original publication of _Capitalism and Freedom_ in 1962, Friedman’s vision for the international monetary system has more or less come true. Most major industrialized economies, including the United States, Japan, and the EU, have adopted free-floating currencies and have abandoned any attempts to peg them to either a commodity like gold or another currency.)
