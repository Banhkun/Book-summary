## Chapter 2: Monopolies and Neighborhood Effects

**Governments are always coercive.** Even in democratic societies, governments operate on the principle of majority rule. Those in the minority must, by definition, yield to the will of those in the majority.

Because of their collective nature and their need to serve the masses, governments cannot satisfy individual needs—instead, they must demand conformity. After all, you cannot have national legislation tailored to suit your individual needs (if anything, national legislation is more likely to work _against_ your individual interests, a topic we’ll explore in greater detail later in the summary).

**This is in contrast to how markets operate.** **By their very nature, free markets serve the individual customer on a voluntary basis**. As a buyer, you are free to choose another seller who offers you a fairer price or a better good.

Of course, this is not to say that there is _no_ role for government in a capitalist society. Even those committed to free-market principles accept the idea that there are some societal functions that the market is unable to perform, such as national defense, domestic security, and the enforcement of property rights. In this chapter, we’ll look beyond these basic functions to examine two of government’s most important responsibilities—curbing monopolies and regulating the neighborhood effects of economic activity.

### The Danger of Monopolies

**A monopoly occurs when a market for a particular good or service has only one seller.** Often, these are technical monopolies, where the production of a particular good or service is dependent on access to an expensive or complex technology that only one firm possesses.

Because they make it impossible for buyers to find an alternative seller, markets dominated by monopolies cannot be considered free. Nevertheless, there are some markets that naturally lend themselves to the formation of monopolies, usually those that involve large startup costs or complex proprietary technology. In the economic history of the United States, railroads and telephones started out as monopolies.

**Because monopolies pose a threat to economic freedom, it is a legitimate exercise of government power to limit them or break them up.** Thus, a capitalist ought to be in favor of economic regulations like the Sherman Antitrust Act. It is important, however, that governments wield this power on an equitable basis—if large businesses are to be broken up by the Justice Department through antitrust laws, monopolistic unions that control the supply of labor in a given market must also be subject to the same laws.

#### Three Forms of Monopoly

There are three forms of monopoly:

  * Unregulated private monopolies, in which a private firm has cornered the market and is allowed to operate unfettered;
  * Regulated private monopolies, in which the government acts to eliminate competition in an essential market, like municipal power or water, often by subsidizing the sole authorized supplier (keeping the price of the good artificially low for the public); and 
  * Public monopolies, in which the government itself acts as the sole manufacturer and seller of a good or service.



All three forms involve the elimination of competition, and are therefore harmful to economic freedom. But, all things being equal, regulated private monopolies and public monopolies are usually the most harmful. **Regulated private monopolies and public monopolies use the coercive power of the _state_ to enforce anti-competitive practices**. Competition is literally illegal in such cases.

For example, the Interstate Commerce Commission (originally created to _curb_ the monopolistic power of private railroads) effectively became a regulated monopoly power that _protected_ those private firms and isolated them from competition. Similarly, public monopolies like the US Postal Service can take advantage of the fact that they are publicly subsidized in order to undercut potential private competition.

A private monopoly, by contrast, does not derive its power from a legal mandate. Therefore, particularly as new technologies emerge, the possibility exists that new players will emerge in the market that can challenge the power of the monopoly. We’ll return to monopolies in greater detail in Chapter 8.

### Negative and Positive Neighborhood Effects

Governments also have a responsibility to promote positive neighborhood effects and prevent negative neighborhood effects.

**Negative neighborhood effects (also known as externalities) arise when one individual’s economic activity imposes a cost on another individual for which the former is unable to compensate the latter.**

The classic example is of a private company polluting a community water source. The individuals whose water is poisoned have no practical way to avoid participating in this forced “transaction” or of receiving compensation for the costs they’ve incurred outside of government action (either through legislation or lawsuit). Therefore, government regulation of negative externalities (in this case anti-pollution laws) is appropriate and consistent with the preservation of economic freedom.

**Positive neighborhood effects, meanwhile, arise when some individual economic activity confers _benefits_ upon individuals whom it is extremely difficult to charge for their receipt of such benefits**. A good example is local parks. People who regularly walk through such parks, have views of them from their homes, or just happen to pass by them can reasonably be said to receive a benefit from them.

But because the benefits of these local parks are so widely dispersed and difficult to assign a true “value” to, it would be infeasible and inefficient for a _private_ owner of such a park to charge fees to _everyone_ who derives enjoyment from them. Therefore, the public sector can more efficiently provide goods like local parks that confer widespread positive neighborhood effects.

The same cannot be said, however, of _national_ parks like Yellowstone or Yosemite. These parks have few entrance points, are in remote locations, attract visitors from all over the country, and host visitors for long periods of time. It is much easier, therefore, to determine precisely who is benefitting from them.

In a capitalist society, therefore, there is no reason for goods like national parks—which provide discrete benefits to a relative handful of people—to be publicly subsidized by taxpayers, the great majority of whom will never use them. Instead, private operators should run such parks and charge fees only to those who choose to use them.
