## 1-Page Summary

_Capitalism and Freedom_ is Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman’s classic 1962 treatise on economic freedom. Friedman argues that **a society cannot maintain liberal democracy and representative institutions without a robust commitment to free-market capitalism.** For capitalism to function best, it must be as free of government interference as possible.

Today, it is hard to overstate the extent to which **Friedman’s once-controversial ideas have triumphed**. Over the past 40 years, governments across the Western Hemisphere have reoriented their economic strategies toward more market-based solutions, including reducing marginal tax rates, all but eliminating tariffs, privatizing public monopolies, and even introducing choice and competition in public education. While reasonable people can disagree about the effects of Friedman’s ideas in the real world, no one can deny their influence.

In this summary, we’ll explore:

  * How economic freedom is essential to political freedom;
  * Why the government has a responsibility to protect economic freedom by breaking up monopolies, providing those services that the private sector cannot, and prudently managing the money supply;
  * How the government often harms economic freedom through aggressive deficit spending, the creation of public monopolies, excessive professional licensure, and a poorly designed tax and welfare system.



### The Necessity of Economic Freedom

**Economic freedom is an essential component of total freedom** —the ability of an individual to pursue her own happiness and fulfillment without any external impediments, provided that she does not infringe on the freedom of others. Any form of coercion is an assault on freedom.

**Economic freedom is vital to _political_ freedom. **A society simply cannot have political freedom without the ability of individual buyers and sellers in a marketplace to engage in voluntary transactions that satisfy their needs. There has never been a successful example of a society that joined state control of the economy (in the form of socialism or communism) with political liberty.

**Political power is dangerous, because it can be easily concentrated and centralized in the hands of the few.** Economic power, however, works differently. In a well-functioning capitalist society, millions of individual buyers and sellers make decisions about which goods and services they require to satisfy their needs. As long as there are no monopolies, buyers are free to choose their sellers, sellers to choose their buyers, and workers to choose their employers. Free markets are inherently _decentralized_ in nature, thus maximizing individual freedom and choice.

### The Proper Role of Government

Despite the threat of government power, even those most committed to free-market principles must accept the idea that there are _some_ societal functions that the market is unable to perform, such as national defense, domestic security, and the enforcement of property rights. These functions are crucial to the preservation of economic liberty, and can only be performed by the

public sector. Beyond these basic duties, governments also have a responsibility to:

  * Curb the power of monopolies; and
  * Provide those essential public services that confer broad-based social benefits and could not be efficiently provided by the private sector 



#### Curbing Monopolies

One of the government’s most important responsibilities is to curb the power of monopolies.

A monopoly occurs when a market for a particular good or service has only one seller. Because they make it impossible for buyers to find an alternative seller, markets dominated by monopolies cannot be considered free.

**Because monopolies pose a threat to economic freedom, it is a legitimate exercise of government power to limit them or break them up.**

##### Three Forms of Monopoly

There are three forms of monopoly:

  * Unregulated private monopolies, in which a private firm has cornered the market and is allowed to operate unfettered;
  * Regulated private monopolies, in which the government acts to eliminate competition in an essential market, like municipal power or water, often by subsidizing the sole authorized supplier (keeping the price of the good artificially low for the public); and 
  * Public monopolies, in which the government itself acts as the sole manufacturer and seller of a good or service.



All three forms involve the elimination of competition, and are therefore harmful to economic freedom. But, all things being equal, unregulated private monopolies are usually the least harmful. **Regulated private monopolies and public monopolies use the coercive power of the _state_ to enforce anti-competitive practices**. Competition is literally illegal in such cases.

Monopolies and near-monopolies benefit from poorly designed features of the US tax code. For example, corporate, capital gains, and dividend taxes all disincentivize shareholders from putting corporate profits toward new investments. Because investors face a tax penalty when they sell stock or collect a dividend, it is often a better option to simply plow money back into an existing large company by purchasing more shares, thus increasing the stock price for shareholders. The effect is to protect large incumbent businesses by giving them the lion’s share of available capital, even when they have little productive use for it.

#### Neighborhood Effects

Governments also have a responsibility to provide those services that have strong neighborhood effects. **Neighborhood effects arise when some individual economic activity confers benefits upon individuals whom it is extremely difficult to charge for their receipt of such benefits**.

A good example is local parks. People who regularly walk through such parks, have views of them from their homes, or just happen to pass by them can reasonably be said to receive a benefit from them. But because the benefits of these local parks are so widely dispersed and difficult to assign a true “value” to, it would be infeasible and inefficient for a _private_ owner of such a park to charge fees to _everyone_ who derives enjoyment from them. Therefore, the public sector can more efficiently provide goods like local parks that confer widespread positive neighborhood effects.

#### Monetary Policy and Regulation of the Money Supply

Free-market principles also allow for some other, limited functions of government. One of these is the issuance of currency and the regulation of the money supply.

Commodity standards based on metals like gold or silver systems have proven unworkable due to their limited supply. Most economies therefore evolved to have governments issue paper money to facilitate transactions. As long as the government guarantees that official paper currency can be used as legal tender, it has value.

#### The Federal Reserve System

**Central banks are government-chartered financial institutions that have the power to increase or decrease the supply and circulation of money in an economy, primarily through their control of interest rates.** The American central bank is the United States Federal Reserve System (usually referred to as “the Fed”).

The Fed’s activities are meant to ensure that the banking system has the liquidity it needs to conduct business, as well as provide price stability throughout the economy. Nevertheless, **control of interest rates vests a great deal of power in government and represents the most consequential intervention by the public sector into the market.**

##### The Federal Reserve and the Great Depression

In light of this power, it is particularly important to look at the Fed’s failure to rescue the banking system in the critical early years of the Great Depression. As depositors began to worry about broader economic conditions in November 1930, they began to pull their money out of banks _en masse_. Banks struggled to meet these demands, beginning a series of disastrous bank runs. _This_ was the moment when the Fed should have acted decisively to cut interest rates and pump liquidity into the system.

But instead, the Fed simply did nothing. The unwillingness to act led to the worst two-year period of economic contraction in US history.

#### Foreign Exchange

**Governments also play a significant role in revaluing or devaluing _their_ currencies relative to those of _other_ countries. **Both a strong dollar (one that has a high exchange rate relative to other currencies) and a weak dollar (one that has a low exchange rate relative to other currencies) have different advantages for different players in the economy.

A strong currency benefits importers of raw materials from abroad and consumers of foreign goods, because it enables them to purchase pounds sterling or yen or euros with fewer dollars, in turn enabling them to purchase more goods and services denominated in those currencies. A weak currency, on the other hand, benefits exporters, because it enables them to sell American goods and services cheaper in foreign markets, giving them a competitive advantage.

Systems that peg the value of a currency to a commodity (like gold) or to _another_ currency tend to be harmful to economic freedom, because they require the government**** to impose heavy-handed controls over capital flows in and out of the country and restrict the freedom of individuals to conduct ordinary business transactions (because they have to maintain adequate stocks of gold or foreign currency to keep the ratios stable).

**In a free society, competent individuals should face no restrictions on their ability to conduct transactions and make contracts.**

##### Floating Currency

Instead of this elaborate and carefully managed system of international currency pegging, **countries should be free to let their currencies simply “float”—i.e., let the free market determine the value of currencies relative to one another.**

The inflows and outflows of currency would always balance out under such a system—the seller of dollars would need to find a buyer willing to pay her in the equivalent value of foreign currency. Losses of domestic currency would by definition be offset by gains in foreign currency reserves.

### Against Keynesian Fiscal Policy

Monetary policy has a significant impact on economic freedom. But so does _fiscal_ policy—how (and how much) the government chooses to tax and spend. **Following the Great Depression, there was a groundswell of public support for aggressive fiscal policy on the part of the federal government.** The public wanted the government to offset the collapse in private spending with large, deficit-financed spending from the federal government (that is, increases in spending _without_ offsetting tax increases).

The intellectual underpinning of this policy was the Keynesian school of economics. Named for the British economist John Maynard Keynes, Keynesianism argued that government spending could make up for the shortfall in consumer spending during an economic downturn.

**The fiscal multiplier effect is a lynchpin of Keynesian economics.** According to this principle, when the government spends money, it creates new spending power in the economy above and beyond the original government expenditure, because it stimulates several rounds of private spending that otherwise would not have occurred. When Individual A receives money from the government, she spends it at a business owned by Individual B, which then becomes her income, which she will in turn spend to contribute to someone else’s income, and so on.

#### Borrowing Funds, Diverting Spending

If the government uses its fiscal power to publicly subsidize some service that you once paid for with your own private spending (like access to a beach), then in theory, it has freed you up to spend that money on something else.

But since you had been freely spending your money to get access to the beach, it is reasonable to assume that you placed a higher _value_ on that use of your money than you did on alternative uses. Since you are now getting that access for “free,” you are unlikely to increase your spending on other goods or services above and beyond what you were already spending, because you don’t value those other goods and services as highly.

To finance new expenditures, the government is likely borrowing the money from investors and issuing bonds to them. This does _not_ increase the total stock of money in the private sector—it merely moves it from one party (the purchaser of government bonds) to another (the ultimate recipient of government spending). Under most economic conditions, those investors _would_ have spent the money they used to purchase bonds on some other set of goods and services in the private sector. **The borrowing in and of itself, then, only diverts and offsets spending that would have occurred anyway.**

### Restriction of Choice

We’ve already seen that there are services that the government provides that are intended to confer broad benefits to society. Yet many of these government efforts end up harming economic liberty by unfairly inhibiting freedom of contract or establishing public monopolies that deprive individuals of market choices they would otherwise have. Although its efforts are often well-intended, the ways in which the government provides many of its services restrict the freedom of individual buyers and sellers to enter into contracts of voluntary exchange.

#### Government and Education

**One sector where the government plays a nearly monopolistic role is in the financing and administration of education**. Education has strong neighborhood effects, as it benefits society to have a population that is literate, civic minded, and adequately prepared to take on the responsibilities of citizenship. **But while the _financing_ of education through public money can be justified on the basis of neighborhood effects, its _administration_ cannot be. **

Parents are legally mandated to send their children to the school for which they are zoned, even if the quality of education at that school is known to be poor or if they dislike the content being taught. If they had a choice in where to educate their children (as they do in nearly all other markets), parents might choose to send their children to other schools, where the content and quality of education is more in line with their preferences.

While parents technically do have the option of moving to a different school district or sending their children to private school, the costs of doing so are so prohibitively expensive as to not represent a genuine “choice.”

##### Vouchers and School Choice

One solution to this problem is to decouple the public _financing_ of education from the public _administration_ of schools. **Instead of paying taxes and having no choice in the matter of where to send their children to school, parents should instead receive a voucher from the government.**

This voucher would be redeemable for educational services up to a certain amount for each child, provided that they are spent on approved education providers that meet certain minimum standards. Beyond that minimum requirement, parents would be free to spend their vouchers on whatever educational option they deem to be best for their children.

#### Equal Employment Opportunity Laws

**The bedrock principle of a free-market economy is that individuals ought to be able to enter into voluntary contracts with one another.** But equal opportunity employment laws, which are intended to prevent discrimination against members of minority groups, constitute a dangerous violation of freedom of contract. For example, such laws might mandate that a minority candidate be hired regardless of whether or not the employer believes they are a proper fit for the position.

This in and of itself violates the employer’s freedom of contract rights. Once the government violates the principle of freedom of contract, any number of abuses becomes possible.**** If the government can negate freedom of contract by _denying_ the right of employers to discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or any other individual characteristic, it could also theoretically negate freedom of contract by _mandating_ that private employers engage in such discrimination.

#### Licensing Restrictions

Another way in which governments restrict choice is through professional licensure. For example, professional licensure often functions as a means by which**existing practitioners in a field limit competition—at the expense of consumers.**

A license is a permit from a legal authority to engage in some specific economic activity. Licenses are backed up by force of law—if you don’t have the license, you cannot practice the trade, and will be punished if you attempt to do so.

**Professional licensure serves to protect incumbent practitioners in the field by making it difficult and/or expensive for newcomers to enter the profession.** By keeping the number of professionals in a given field low, licensure enables incumbents to charge higher prices for their services.

### Inequality and Redistribution

**One of the cornerstones of a society based upon voluntary exchange is the right to keep what you earn.** After all, what you earn in the market is a product of the productive capacity of your own labor and capital. The fairest and most efficient way to allocate resources in a system of voluntary exchange is through payment according to product. Your compensation is a direct result of the value you create in the economy through your labor (the work you perform for which you are paid in wages and tips) and your capital (the productive assets you own, like land or machinery).

**Forced redistribution schemes are inherently unjust.** There is no moral justification for a majority to compel a minority to hand over its property—whether it’s a gang of armed robbers telling you to hand over the cash in your wallet or a majority of voters passing legislation to legally confiscate wealth from the so-called “1 percent.”

Unfortunately, some of the government’s most grave threats to economic liberty come cloaked in the language of equality, fairness, and economic justice. Below, we’ll explore some of the worst public manifestations of this.

#### Against Progressive Income Tax

To combat the alleged dangers of income inequality, most industrialized countries have established systems of progressive taxation.**** Under such a system, the marginal rate of taxation increases the more one earns. Thus, your income from $0-$49,000 might be taxed at 12 percent, your income from $50,000-$99,999 might be taxed at 25 percent, and so on.

**One problem with progressive taxation is that it increases _pre-tax_ income inequality**. If high earners know that their top marginal tax rate is going to be high, lucrative jobs become less attractive than they would otherwise be. The only way to compensate for this is to make these kinds of jobs even _more_ well-paid—thereby increasing pre-tax inequality.

**Progressive tax codes are also nearly always more complex than alternatives.** They contain all sorts of loopholes and deductions that tax certain kinds of income (like capital gains) at different rates than other kinds of income (like standard wages and tips). This creates a strong incentive for wealthy people to devote inordinate resources to devising complex and wasteful tax-avoidance schemes.

#### The Flat Tax

**A flat tax is more efficient and equitable than a progressive tax.** Under a flat tax, everyone would pay the same rate, regardless of income level or income type. A flat tax plan would also broaden the definition of “income,” taxing more _types_ of income than the present system does, while closing loopholes and special-interest exemptions.

Because the rates would be uniform and all types of income would be equally subject to taxation, there would be far less incentive for individuals and businesses to waste resources on tax avoidance schemes.

#### Anti-Poverty Programs

Progressive taxation is not the only policy by which the government attempts to redistribute income and alleviate poverty. Through a range of programs, including the provision of public housing, the establishment of federal and state minimum wages, and social insurance (most notably Social Security in the United States), public authorities have attempted—nearly always with the best of intentions—to raise the standard of living of the worst-off members of society.

But **these anti-poverty programs injure economic freedom by confiscating property from one segment of the population to give it to another, enable the growth of large and increasingly unaccountable government bureaucracies, and paternalistically presume that the government knows what’s best for the people rather than the people themselves.**

#### Social Security

Perhaps the most famous redistributive program in the United States is Social Security. Social Security is a government pension system that pays benefits primarily to elderly and disabled citizens. It is financed by payroll taxes collected on people during the course of their working lives. As a compulsory program, no one has the option of _not_ paying into Social Security. Taxpayers are forced to hand over their money to purchase a product that they might very well have elected not to purchase if they had been given free use of their own money.

#### Negative Income Tax

Alleviating poverty does benefit society broadly. But the problem arises when**anti-poverty measures require large and expensive bureaucracies to maintain them.** To get around these traditional defects of such programs, governments should adopt a negative income tax.

By providing proportional subsidies for people who fall below a certain income threshold, a **negative income tax would redistribute income, but on a far more equitable and transparent basis than traditional tax-and-transfer programs.** It would effectively guarantee a certain basic income for everyone. It would also be more efficient than the current patchwork of welfare programs, most of which are targeted to specific groups (like veterans, widows, the elderly, and so on). The narrow and targeted nature of such benefits programs requires an expensive bureaucracy to maintain and administer them.

### In Defense of Capitalism

**Capitalism has proven itself to be history’s most effective system for alleviating poverty and raising the standard of living for the vast majority of the human population.** Supporters of economic and political freedom must resist every attempt—even by the most well-intentioned idealists—to impose central control over systems of voluntary exchange. Increased government control over our lives would ultimately lead to the creation of a less free and less prosperous society. We must always remember that concentrated power is dangerous, regardless of the intentions of those wielding it.
