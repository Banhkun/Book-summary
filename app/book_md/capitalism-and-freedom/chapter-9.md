## Chapter 9: Licensing Restrictions

Governments trample on economic liberty in a variety of ways. We’ve already seen how public monetary, fiscal, and educational policies hamper the proper functioning of free markets based on voluntary exchange.

In this chapter, we’ll explore another aspect of state interference with capitalism—professional licensure. Specifically, we’ll look at how **licensing regimes use public safety as a justification to protect (and enrich) existing practitioners at the expense of consumers.**

### Occupational Licensing: Eliminating Choice for Practitioners and Consumers

A license is a permit from a legal authority to engage in some specific economic activity. Licenses are backed up by force of law—if you don’t have the license, you cannot practice the trade and will be punished if you attempt to do so.

An astonishing range of professions in the United States require practitioners to obtain some sort of license in order to practice legally. Depending on the locality, every occupation from medicine to hairdressing to dog grooming mandates the acquisition of a license.

We encounter licensed professionals so frequently that we seldom question the wisdom or justice of such licensing requirements. We generally assume that they exist to protect the public from incompetent or unqualified practitioners. But while this may be the stated purpose of such licensing regimes, this is rarely their effect.

**Professional licensure serves to protect incumbent practitioners in the field by making it difficult and/or expensive for newcomers to enter the profession.** One must often receive specialized training, complete apprenticeships, pass examinations, and receive the approval of a licensing board (not coincidentally led by incumbent professionals in the field) in order to obtain the license.

All of these entail significant commitments of time, money, and energy. Facing such hurdles, many would-be professionals give up and choose to enter a different line of work. **By keeping the number of professionals in a given field low, licensure enables incumbents to charge higher prices for their services.**

This is why licensing systems are so harmful to economic freedom. They deprive people of the right to use their talent and initiative in the field of their choosing, while robbing consumers of the range of choices that would otherwise be available to them.

Even the “public safety” rationale is insulting, as it paternalistically assumes that consumers lack the intelligence to make informed decisions about whom to pay for professional services. Far from being agents of public welfare, licensing boards are really the modern-day equivalent of medieval guilds—powerful trade associations that use their political clout to monopolize the sale of a good in a particular area and restricted entry into the trade.

#### Irrelevant Criteria

**Many of the criteria used to screen candidates for licensed practice have little relevance to public safety or best practices within the field.** At the time of _Capitalism and Freedom_ ’s publication in 1962, anti-communist hysteria induced many licensing boards to require candidates to swear that they were not, nor had they ever been, members of the Communist Party of the United States.

These boards required even veterinarians and barbers to take such oaths, even though the threat of communist subversion from such quarters was ridiculously low. Whatever one’s opinion of communism (and an evangelist for capitalism like Milton Friedman certainly had a low opinion of it), it had nothing to do with one’s ability to practice medicine on animals or cut hair.

Similarly, during the Great Depression, professional associations of doctors (chiefly the American Medical Association) pressured state governments to make it more difficult for foreign doctors to practice medicine in America. This was simple protectionism—domestic doctors feared that competition from medical professionals fleeing fascism in Germany, Italy, and Spain would give consumers too much choice.

But there was little basis for this other than naked self-interest. The human body is the same in every country. Although training may differ slightly from country to country, a doctor’s nationality in and of itself should not be a barrier to practicing medicine wherever she chooses to.

### Medical Licensing and the AMA

Although such licensing requirements for medicine are clearly arbitrary, it is true that medical practice presents a more compelling case for stringent professional licensure than other professions. After all, we surely wish to be protected from incompetent and unqualified doctors. But while there is a stronger rationale for medical licensing than there is for something like cosmetology, medical licensure still imposes a cost.

**The largest and most powerful association of medical professionals in the United States is the American Medical Association (AMA).** For decades, the AMA has exerted a dominant and near-monopolistic control over the practice of medicine in America, specifically through its control of the supply of incoming doctors. The AMA works closely with state legislatures to create high barriers to entry for medical students looking to break into the profession.

One way they do this is through controlling medical schools. All US states require that doctors obtain a license to practice in the state. A universal requirement of such licenses is that the doctor must have graduated from a credentialed medical school. But the _only_ credentialed medical schools in every state are those approved by the AMA.

#### Controlling the Doctor Supply, Lowering Quality of Care

The typical rationale for such restrictions is that they ensure that physicians are of the highest quality. But it is not clear that medical licensing succeeds even on these grounds.

**If you are unable to access a doctor or afford to see one because of the limited supply, you might have your medical needs go untreated.** Licensing regimes might guarantee high quality of care for those who can access it; but by severely reducing the _quantity_ of care available to the general population, they harm overall health outcomes. Quantity cannot be separated from _quality_.

Furthermore, many components of what is legally defined as medical practice are actually capable of being performed by technicians and other non-doctors. Thus doctors end up spending an inordinate amount of time engaging in aspects of medicine that could be more efficiently and cheaply handled by others—further reducing the quality of care for everyone.

**It would be better to loosen restrictions on who can become a doctor and let more physicians enter the field. This would increase the supply of doctors and lower costs and barriers to access for patients.** There is a variety of quality in every market—we pay more for high-quality organic foods than we do for canned or freeze-dried foods. There’s no reason that the market for medical services should function any differently. After all, we don’t demand that every car be a Rolls-Royce, because then only the wealthy elite would be able to afford automobiles.
