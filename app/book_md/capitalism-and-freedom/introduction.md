## Introduction

_Capitalism and Freedom_ is Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman’s classic 1962 treatise on economic freedom. Friedman argues that **a society cannot maintain liberal democracy and representative institutions without a robust commitment to free-market capitalism.** For capitalism to function best, it must be as free of government interference as possible.

Although these ideas have become mainstream in western policy and intellectual circles in the nearly 60 years since the publication of _Capitalism and Freedom_ , they were highly controversial—even fringe—at the time. In that era, the Keynesian economic policy consensus dominated the postwar United States, advocating for a robust and activist role for government in the management of the economy and the redistribution of incomes.

Today, however, it is hard to overstate the extent to which **Friedman’s once-controversial ideas have triumphed**. Over the past 40 years, governments across the Western Hemisphere have reoriented their economic strategies toward more market-based solutions, including reducing marginal tax rates, all but eliminating tariffs, privatizing public monopolies, and even introducing choice and competition in public education. While reasonable people can disagree about the effects of Friedman’s ideas in the real world, no one can deny their influence.

In this summary, we will explore:

  * The inseparable connection between economic and political freedom;
  * The role of government in protecting free markets by curbing monopolies and providing those few services that cannot be provided more effectively by the private sector; 
  * How government mismanagement of both monetary and fiscal policy has led to economic calamity and the distortion of the free market;
  * How public schooling, while beneficial, tends to limit the choices families have in deciding where to educate their children; and
  * How public monopolies, occupational licensure, progressive taxation, anti-poverty programs, and other trappings of the modern welfare state only serve to exacerbate the problems they are designed to solve.
