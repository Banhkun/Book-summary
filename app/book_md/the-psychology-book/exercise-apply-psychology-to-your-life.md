## Exercise: Apply Psychology to Your Life

In this exercise, you’ll consider how you might apply your new understanding of psychological concepts to your daily life.

* * *

What’s one theory from this guide that seems relevant to your life? For example, if you’re a parent, you may have found Piaget’s stages of cognitive development informative; or if you’re interested in criminal justice, you may have been intrigued by the concept of false memory syndrome.

In what way does this theory change your perspective or current understanding of this aspect of your life? For instance, you might reconsider how much weight to give to your memories now that you understand they can be distorted.

What is one change to your life or behavior you can make to utilize this new understanding? For instance, as a parent, you might limit the amount of violent TV your child watches to reduce the chances of them modeling that behavior.

What else would you like to know about this concept that could guide your future research?
