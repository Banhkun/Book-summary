## Exercise: Work With Your Leadership Strengths and Weaknesses

Determine which leadership roles you naturally gravitate toward and which roles you need more support in. Remember, Covey describes four key leadership roles:

  * **The Auditor** (in charge of processes, goals, and lining up dreams with realities)
  * **The Navigator** (in charge of listening, synthesizing different views, and plotting a course forward)
  * **The Advocate** (in charge of promoting independence among team members)
  * **The Captain** (in charge of understanding and communicating the big picture and setting an example for others)



* * *

Which of these roles are you most drawn to? Why?

Which role least resonates with you? Why?

What can you do to practice that role so you feel more comfortable executing it? (For example, if you chose the Navigator role, how can you become better at listening? Would the talking stick technique help, and how could you start implementing it?)
