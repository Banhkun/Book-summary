## Exercise: Open Up Tough Conversations

As a leader, you need to be willing to address tough emotional issues with your team members and open up a conversation about them.

* * *

What’s an awkward or difficult emotional topic that you think the people in your organization need to talk about? (Think: loneliness in the military, burnout among teachers, doubt within a worship community).

Why do you think that this topic is so difficult to talk about in the context of your organization? (For example, talking about loneliness is hard in a military setting where people are expected to be tough and self-reliant).

How might you open up this conversation to your organization’s members? (It might be most effective to name the “easy” emotions being used, and then present the difficult emotion that you think is at the core.)
