## Exercise: Practice Giving Clear Feedback

Being clear in your feedback about your expectations and intentions is essential to avoiding more problems down the line.

* * *

Describe a recent situation where you gave unclear feedback that resulted in unfair frustration with a team member.

Why do you think you resorted to unclear feedback? (Were you trying to be polite, or afraid that the recipient would become emotional?)

How could you have been more clear in your feedback with them?
