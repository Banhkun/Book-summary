## 1-Page Summary

Should leaders allow themselves—or their employees—to be vulnerable? Many organizations say no. But in _Dare to Lead_ , researcher Brené Brown argues that**courageous leaders who allow vulnerability—in themselves and in others—are essential to thriving work cultures**. In this guide, you’ll learn the four skills you must practice in order to lead courageously—facing vulnerability, choosing and practicing values, building trust, and developing failure resilience—and how using these skills effectively can help your team overcome difficult situations and encourage creativity and innovation. Along the way, you’ll learn suggestions from other experts on the best ways to practice these skills.

### Skill #1: Face Vulnerability

According to Brown, the first skill you must practice in order to become a courageous leader is to **face vulnerability**. She explains this is a vital skill because you can only build an innovative, creative work culture if your team feels comfortable failing and taking risks.

In this section, we’ll first define vulnerability: What exactly is it, and why is it essential that we understand it well? Then, we’ll name the benefits of facing vulnerability.

#### What Is Vulnerability?

Brown defines vulnerability as**exposure to the risk of failure or emotional harm.** However, she argues, most people have three main misconceptions about vulnerability—which leads them to avoid it.

**Misconception #1: Being vulnerable means you’re weak.** As Brown notes, people often view their refusal to acknowledge vulnerable feelings as a courageous act. However, she argues that it signals the opposite: They’re _not brave enough****_ to engage with their vulnerability. Rather, Brown contends, feeling vulnerable is a sign that you were courageous enough to approach—not avoid—exposure to risk and uncertainty.

> **The Difference Between Vulnerability and Weakness**
> 
> In her earlier book, _The Power of Vulnerability_ , Brown explains that many people who are in a position where showing weakness can be harmful—like executives—mistakenly associate weakness with vulnerability and so believe they can’t be vulnerable. But in _Daring Greatly_ , Brown elaborates further on the difference between vulnerability and weakness, explaining that Merriam-Webster defines vulnerability as “open to attack or damage,” while weakness is “the inability to withstand attack or wounding.” In other words, being vulnerable means that you’re open to harm but not totally defenseless. Moreover, she presents studies that prove that acknowledging your vulnerability makes you stronger: If you don’t acknowledge your vulnerability, you’re not prepared to protect yourself.

**Misconception #2: You have to trust someone in order to be vulnerable with them.** Brown contends that this misconception explains why people refuse to be vulnerable with people they don’t know well. However, Brown argues that vulnerability and trust happen _simultaneously_ , in a constant exchange of small moments; neither comes before the other. As Brown explains, when someone reaches out to you and you choose to engage with and respond to their vulnerability (instead of ignoring it), you earn their trust and the right to be vulnerable with them in turn.

(Shortform note: While Brown argues that vulnerability and trust happen _simultaneously_ , _Start With Why_ author Simon Sinek argues that trust comes _before_ vulnerability: In the workplace, employees must trust their leaders before they feel vulnerable enough to take risks. So how, as a leader, can you get your employees to trust you? Sinek explains that trust is based on shared beliefs: We believe that someone who shares our beliefs is more likely to have our backs and not take advantage of us. So you can earn your employees’ trust by showing them that you share their values.)

**Misconception #3: Being vulnerable means you have to share _everything_. **Brown clarifies that courageous leaders practice vulnerability with _limits_ and don’t overshare personal feelings or information with their team. Instead, they talk openly about the emotions surrounding uncertain but work-relevant situations—like a new product launch.

(Shortform note: As a leader, how can you effectively create a boundary on what you will—or won’t—share with your team? Try creating SMART boundaries: Your boundaries should be **S** pecific, **M** utable—in other words, flexible based on the situation, **A** bout You—not about what others do near you, **R** easonable, and **T** alked Through—in other words, you communicate them and compromise on them if necessary.)

#### The Benefits of Facing Vulnerability

Now that you understand what vulnerability is, we’ll discuss the benefits of productively engaging with it—and teaching your team members the value of doing so. Brown names three benefits of facing vulnerability: It helps you have tough conversations, discourages defensive behaviors, and helps you understand and overcome shame.

##### Benefit #1: Facing Vulnerability Helps You Have Tough Conversations

As Brown notes, leaders must sometimes have tough conversations that have uncertain outcomes or demand emotional exposure from either party. However, she argues that **being vulnerable enough to _clearly say what you mean_ will help you make honest, productive connections**.

(Shortform note: Clearly saying what you mean may not help you make positive connections in all cultures. In _The Culture Map_ , cultural expert Erin Meyer explains that, while the United States prizes direct negative feedback, many other cultures traditionally provide negative feedback indirectly—like by couching their message with positive affirmations—and so may perceive direct negative feedback as harsh and cruel. To avoid this, Meyer recommends that Americans working in other cultures be transparent about how they normally provide feedback so that their employees can adjust their expectations accordingly.)

Being vulnerable also prevents two issues that can arise from unclear language. First, Brown explains that **using unclear language may put your team in situations where they’re unfairly held accountable for expectations they don’t clearly understand**. Brown explains that if you’re uncomfortable with vulnerability, you may struggle to be honest and instead say a polite half-truth to avoid discomfort. However, this lack of honesty hurts your team members, especially if you’re providing feedback: The recipient receives no indication that they need to improve, yet they’re held accountable for their lack of improvement. But when you use clear language, your team knows exactly what is expected of them.

(Shortform note: In _Principles_ , hedge fund founder Ray Dalio recommends practicing “extreme honesty” to help your organization make better decisions. This means that everybody in your organization commits to revealing their thoughts instead of putting a filter on or hiding them. In such an environment, you don’t have to worry about hurting other people. This allows you to give truthful feedback on someone’s foolish decision _before_ they follow through on it so that you can prevent its negative consequences.)

Second, Brown explains that **if your team uses unclear language, it may hinder your ability to help them.** As Brown notes, people who struggle to be vulnerable may avoid talking about their true emotions; instead, they’ll name “easy” but inaccurate emotions so they can talk about their feelings without full emotional exposure. But if you don’t know _exactly_ what your team member is feeling, you won’t appropriately connect to or solve the root of their problem; in contrast, understanding their feelings allows you to provide the best possible solution.

For example, you might respond to your team member saying “I’m stressed” by giving them a few days off. But if it turns out that your team member is actually scared of being fired, your solution may amplify their fears because they worry that you don’t need them at the company. But if you had made them comfortable enough to say “I’m scared,” you could have eased their fears by discussing how they’re indispensable to the company.

(Shortform note: Your employees may also struggle to tell you _exactly_ what they’re feeling—in other words, to give you feedback on their work environment—because they’re afraid of offending you or hurting their careers. In _No Rules Rules_ , Erin Meyer and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings recommend making it easier for employees to give you feedback by including “feedback” as an agenda item in one-on-one meetings.)

##### Benefit #2: Facing Vulnerability Discourages Defensive Behaviors

Another benefit of facing vulnerability, Brown argues, is that it discourages defensive behaviors.

Brown explains that **unless you encourage your employees to face their vulnerability, they’ll naturally adopt defensive behaviors** , which are behaviors that protect them from experiencing any negative emotions. But these behaviors, Brown argues, usually stifle innovation and creativity.

The defensive behaviors Brown names include the following:

  * Perfectionism, which helps you avoid the shame and embarrassment of making a mistake but prevents you from contributing imperfect, innovative ideas
  * Criticism, which shifts negative attention onto someone else but makes other teammates uncomfortable sharing their ideas



> **Other Ways People Respond to Negative Emotions**
> 
> In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , life coach Tony Robbins also suggests that people who face negative emotions may respond by trying to avoid them—which is what both perfectionists and critics do.
> 
> However, Robbins adds two more unhealthy behaviors people resort to when they face negative emotions: First, they may go into denial and try to dissociate from the emotion. Second, they may internalize the emotion and turn it into part of their identity. For example, instead of trying to avoid the shame of making a mistake by becoming a perfectionist, they might instead try to develop a reputation as the lovable goof who’s constantly messing up at work—which would stifle innovation by forcing your team to spend time fixing this employee’s mistakes.

To combat these behaviors, Brown recommends **creating a work culture where team members are comfortable facing vulnerability and understand that risk and failure are both tolerated and useful.** She names three specific steps for doing so.

  1. **Stop rewarding defensive behaviors**. You could be doing this consciously, like when you commend a team member for _never_ making a mistake, or unconsciously, like if you allow someone to criticize without following up with their own idea. 
  2. **Open up honest conversations with team members acting defensively.** Clearly name the behavior, question the emotional source of it, and suggest how they can improve. 
  3. **Recognize team members who try to be more vulnerable.** Present their efforts —such as asking questions and asking for help or taking responsibility for their mistakes—as an example for other team members to follow. 



> **Why Demonstrating Vulnerability Matters**
> 
> In _How Will You Measure Your Life?_ , business consultant Clayton Christensen elaborates on why it’s essential for leaders to _demonstrate_ that they value vulnerability instead of merely _saying_ that they do. Christensen explains that a company culture is its employees’ instinctive sense of the company’s priorities and processes, which they learn over time by seeing how the company works toward its priorities. So if a leader defines a culture but doesn’t embody or enforce it, the company will evolve a different culture based on the priorities and processes that the employees actually _see_.
> 
> As such, by refusing to reward defensive behaviors, talking with team members acting defensively instead of yelling at them, and rewarding vulnerability, you _prove_ to your employees that you value vulnerability and are not just paying lip service to it. This teaches them that they can feel more comfortable feeling and acting vulnerably in return—instead of resorting to defensive behaviors.

##### Benefit #3: Facing Vulnerability Helps You Understand and Overcome Shame

The final benefit of facing vulnerability, Brown argues, is that it helps you understand and overcome shame—the feeling that you’re a flawed person who’s not worthy of connection or belonging. This matters for leaders, according to Brown, because shame drives toxic behaviors—like bullying at work.

(Shortform note: _How_ does shame drive toxic behaviors like bullying? Brown doesn’t specify in this book, but she does present research on it elsewhere: She argues that people bully others in an effort to hide their own feelings of shame.)

Brown explains that to overcome shame, you must _talk through it_. As a leader, you can support your team members in this process by **encouraging them to discuss their struggles with you, and responding to these struggles with empathy**. By doing so, you’ll demonstrate to team members how they can practice empathy among themselves. Moreover, your team members will be more likely to take risks in the future if they know they’ll be supported if they struggle.

(Shortform note: Why does expressing empathy help people overcome shame? Although Brown doesn’t explain this in _Dare to Lead_ , she does present research on this elsewhere: Brown explains that practicing empathy—in other words, connecting with someone—proves that they are worthy of connection and thus reduces their shame, or their feeling that they’re _not_ worthy of connection.)

To effectively practice empathy, Brown notes, you must understand that empathy is a _connection_ with the emotions tied to someone’s struggle or failure—not just an attempt to make things better. So when your team struggles, focus on being nonjudgmental, understanding the emotions of the other person, and opening up the opportunity to talk about the feelings surrounding the experience. For example, after a team member has a tough presentation, you can respond with empathy by saying, “I’m really sorry for how that presentation went. I know it can be embarrassing. Do you want to talk about it?”

(Shortform note: Brown’s recommendations for practicing empathy reflects the three types of empathy described by psychologists Daniel Goleman and Paul Ekman. Being nonjudgmental indicates _cognitive_ empathy—your ability to understand others’ perspectives. Understanding others’ emotions is the definition of _emotional_ empathy. And asking about others’ feelings indicates _compassionate_ empathy—the _actions_ you take based on the empathy that you feel towards others. Even though compassionate empathy usually is an attempt to make things better, it still counts as empathy because you’re acting based on your understanding of others’ emotions and not disregarding them totally.)

### Skill #2: Choose and Practice Your Values

You now know why it’s important to face vulnerability—but _how_ do you actually develop the courage to do so? Brown contends that this develops partly from the second skill of courageous leadership: choosing and practicing your values. In this section, we’ll first discuss the importance of leading with grounded confidence and why practicing your values is essential to that. Then, we’ll discuss how to choose and practice these values in your organization—especially when giving feedback.

#### Leading With Grounded Confidence: Practicing Values, Curiosity, and Self-Awareness

Brown contends that, when faced with vulnerable moments or tough decisions, brave leaders depend on “grounded confidence” for the courage to face their vulnerability instead of hiding behind defensive behaviors. Brown defines “grounded confidence” as confidence rooted in strong values, self-awareness, and curiosity; it’s based on a proven ability to face your vulnerability rather than a contention that you probably could.

(Shortform note: Brown’s description of “grounded confidence” is nearly identical to the definition of confidence described in _The Confidence Code_ by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman. They argue that confidence is a strong belief that you can perform a skill because you’ve already proven that you can do it—although they also add that this belief is _so_ strong that it drives you to perform the skill in question.)

Brown argues that grounded confidence has two components. The first is to approach your work with curiosity; in other words, _wonder_ what might happen instead of _panicking_ about an uncertain outcome _._ With this approach, you’ll take the time to examine problems and possible solutions, instead of racing for an answer and missing valuable learning opportunities.

(Shortform note: In _Essentialism_ , author Greg McKeown suggests that in order to rationally evaluate all your options, you must have the following: a separate space to explore your options, time to think about why your decision matters, imagination to increase the number of creative connections you might make, a good night’s sleep so that you can perform at your optimum level, and clear selective criteria so you know _how_ to decide which option is best.)

The second component of grounded confidence, according to Brown, is continually practicing your values and self-awareness. She argues that if you act in accordance with your values in everyday situations, you will also do so in moments of vulnerability because it’s become second nature. Brown admits that these moments of vulnerability will never be _easy_ , but with well-practiced values—and the self-awareness to recognize and refute the temptation to resort to defensive behaviors—you’ll have the confidence to face these moments, knowing fully that you’ll make it to the other side.

(Shortform note: Practicing the second component of grounded confidence may also improve your self-esteem, according to self-esteem __ expert Nathaniel Branden. In _The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem_ , he argues that you can improve your self-esteem by recognizing and acting on every reality that affects your life and by regularly acting in accordance with your values—both of which you do each time you recognize that you’re tempted to resort to defensive behaviors and choose to live by your values instead.)

#### How to Practice Your Values

Now that you know _why_ you should practice your values, we’ll discuss _how_ to practice them.

The first step, according to Brown, is to have your organization **choose no more than _two_ core values** that employees can depend on to guide tough decisions. If you have too many values, Brown explains, they become meaningless and too nebulous to be actionable. Imagine that you say, “We care about quality, collaboration, sustainability, balance, and knowledge.” These are all worthy values, but there are so many, so it’s hard to know which one should be driving behaviors and major decisions.

The second step, according to Brown, is to **translate these values into behaviors that can be taught, practiced, and evaluated.** These behaviors will provide clear guidelines of how you expect your team members—and yourself—to work together, make decisions, and show up to their work. For example, say that your company decides on _balance_ and _knowledge_ as their two core values. The balance value might translate into a “no work emails on the weekend” policy, and the knowledge value might translate to an expectation that everyone comes to the weekly marketing meeting with a question or a new tool or skill to share.

> **Other Ways to Choose and Practice Your Values**
> 
> Like Brown, _Traction_ author Gino Wickman**** also argues that having core values will help guide your company through difficult situations. However, he presents different ways of choosing and practicing them.
> 
> Notably, Wickman argues that you should have three to seven core values—not just two—and recommends a four-step process for choosing them:
> 
>   1. Think of three people in your company who stand out as star performers. 
> 

>   1. List the characteristics these people embody. 
> 

>   1. Combine similar values and narrow the list. 
> 

>   1. Pick out the values that seem most important, reflect on them for a month, then finalize them.
> 

> 
> What do you do once you’ve chosen these values? Instead of translating them into behavioral guidelines, as Brown suggests, Wickman recommends communicating your values to your employees by presenting them with stories and examples of people in your company applying that value. Additionally, Wickman suggests hiring people who’ve already exhibited those values because they’ll likely fit in better with your company culture. To do so, Wickman recommends explaining your values to candidates in the interview process and asking them how they’ve applied them in their previous work.

##### How Strong Values Support the Feedback Process

According to Brown, practicing your values is especially important when giving and receiving feedback—a vulnerable process that often prompts defensive behaviors. When giving feedback,__ focusing on your values can help you approach the conversation in alignment with them. For example, having the core value of _teamwork_ might push you to work together with your feedback recipient to come up with solutions.

Brown adds that when receiving feedback _,_ focusing on your values can help you channel your emotions productively, toward insight and learning, rather than defensively. You can do this by entering the conversation with a value-supporting mantra or behavior, such as “Paying attention will make me a better teammate” (teamwork), or “I will ask questions and fully understand” (curiosity).

(Shortform note: In _Thanks for the Feedback_ , Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen**** present an alternative way to ensure that you receive and respond to feedback productively: Understand your triggers, or the knee-jerk responses that cause you to dismiss or get angry about feedback. Understanding these responses, they explain, will help you gain control over them. For example, you may negatively respond to feedback because your colleague—and not your boss—is giving it to you, even though she’s making a valid point. But if you understand that feedback from this specific colleague triggers you, you can separate your frustrations about _who_ is giving you the feedback from your receptivity to the _content_ of the feedback.)

### Skill #3: Build Trust and Connection

Brown contends that the third skill of courageous leadership is building trust and connection. In this section, we'll first discuss why trust matters and why people shy away from discussing it. Then, we’ll discuss how you can increase trust within your organization.

Brown explains that **trust is essential to organizations: It allows people to feel comfortable trying new ideas and relying on others.** However, Brown argues that we often don’t trust our colleagues—but we don’t talk about this to avoid offending our colleagues by calling them untrustworthy.

(Shortform note: Other researchers agree with Brown that trust is essential to organizations. Specifically, they contend that you must have _two types of trust_ : competence trust, or a belief that your colleagues will do good work, and interpersonal trust, or a belief that others are doing their best. But what if a colleague doesn’t extend these types of trust to you? Instead of becoming offended, remember that trust is not an either/or proposition. In _Crucial Conversations_ , the authors argue that trust can evolve and is specific to the situation—so just because someone distrusts you in some circumstance doesn’t mean they distrust you in _all_ circumstances.)

#### How to Talk About Trust

To make the conversation about trust less emotional, Brown recommends that you **reframe the discussion** : Talk about _trustworthy_ _behaviors_ instead of the general sense of trust you have in someone. By doing so, you break down the nebulous concept of trust into actionable behaviors that you—and your team—can work on to improve trust. For example, if you say, “I don’t trust you with this project,” your team member may grow angry. But if you say, “I want to discuss some reliability issues when it comes to meeting deadlines,” your team member understands exactly _why_ you have lower trust in them and how they might improve.

What, exactly, are trustworthy behaviors? Brown explains that these are behaviors you perform in everyday situations—not grand gestures. Namely, behaving in a trustworthy manner means that you set and respect limits, stick to your commitments, take responsibility for your mistakes, keep confidences, and generally assume that others are trying their best.

> **Why Trustworthy Behaviors Work**
> 
> If you can build trust by practicing specific behaviors, you may assume that trust is something that behaves logically: For example, if a company presents data that proves that they’re doing something right, you automatically trust them. However, in _Start With Why_ , Sinek explains that trust is a gut feeling that can’t be rationalized because it’s located in the limbic brain—our emotional center. This explains why we trust certain companies even when things go wrong but mistrust other companies that do everything right. But in this case, why would practicing trustworthy behaviors help build trust?
> 
> As Brown notes, you can earn people’s trust by showing them that you share their values and beliefs. So it’s possible that the trustworthy behaviors Brown recommends build trust _because_ they’re all behaviors that demonstrate your values. Setting and respecting limits implies that you value boundaries, sticking to your commitments and keeping confidences imply that you value integrity, taking responsibility implies that you value accountability, and assuming the best in others implies optimism.

Brown emphasizes that assuming that others are trying their best is particularly important, as it can reveal how your leadership might be causing untrustworthy behaviors. As Brown notes, if someone falls short on a task, it’s easy to assume the worst—like that they don’t care. But if you assume that they were trying their best, it prompts you to examine how _you_ may have failed as a leader: For example, perhaps you gave unclear guidelines. When you change your actions according to what you learn—like by providing clearer guidelines—it rebuilds trust on both ends: You are able to restore your trust in your team member’s abilities, while they learn that they can trust you not to give them tasks that they can’t accomplish.

(Shortform note: What should you do if someone falls short on a task, and it turns out that it _is_ their responsibility—not yours? In _Crucial Conversations_ , the authors recommend that you try to rebuild trust incrementally: Start by trying to trust them in the moment, allowing yourself not to trust them in all circumstances. Say you’ve lost trust in your colleague because he missed an important deadline. You should start trying to rebuild trust by trusting that he’s working when he says he is; it’s OK to not trust him to turn in his next project on time.)

### Skill #4: Develop Failure Resilience

Brown contends that the fourth skill of courageous leadership is developing your team’s _failure resilience_ —the ability to recover and move on quickly after something goes wrong. **This is an essential skill for leaders to teach because people are more likely to take risks and try new ideas if they’re confident that they can recover from any setback.**

Brown recommends that you teach failure resilience from the very beginning of the onboarding process, in order to normalize failure and demonstrate that team members will be supported, not shamed, when (not if) it happens. Otherwise, you’ll waste time fixing the defensive behaviors that arise from the fear of failure, like the perfectionism we discussed previously.

> **How to Make Employees Feel Safe From the Beginning**
> 
> In _The Culture Code_ , Daniel Coyle also contends that to make an employee safe enough to fail, you should start early in her journey with the company because the sooner she feels safe with your company, the sooner she can behave productively—instead of engaging in unproductive, defensive behaviors.
> 
> Coyle defines the behaviors and actions that create a supportive environment in the office as “belonging cues” and suggests three things to do on an employee’s first day. First, show interest in her excitement; you’ll show her that you value her as an individual and help her feel connected to others. Second, show her how she might be promoted so that she can see what kind of future she has with the organization. Third, express that you value openness, transparency, and feedback to signal that she can speak up without fear of being fired.

According to Brown, failure resilience has two main components: recognizing your emotional response to failure and working through the story you create about failure.

#### Step 1: Recognize Your Emotional Response

Brown explains that while you don’t need to know exactly _what_ you’re feeling in response to a failure or setback, you need to acknowledge that your emotions were triggered in some way. By following this step, you go from _feeling_ to _thinking_ —instead of leaping directly to problematic defensive behavior.

#### Step 2: Work Through Your Initial Story

Brown explains that when you encounter failure, you naturally create a story to explain what happened and why. But since this “initial story” is based on incomplete information and your own insecurities, it tends to include connections that may or may not be true.

To work through the story productively, you need to question its different components to separate facts from assumptions and insecurities. Ask yourself: What do I _actually_ know about the situation? What am I assuming about the other people in the situation? What feelings are driving my reaction?

Then, talk through your story aloud with the people involved. The phrase, “The story I'm telling myself…” is especially useful in these conversations—it lets you express your feelings and invite the other person to share their side of the story. Approaching the story this way either shows you the illogical leaps your story made or opens up an honest conversation about her thoughts.

For example, say you present an idea in a meeting and your colleague Anne glances at another colleague before rejecting your idea. Your initial story might be, “Anne looked at Cheryl before saying no. That must mean they’ve been talking about me and think my ideas are stupid and not worth their time.” But by reviewing this story, you realize that you only know that Anne looked at Cheryl and she rejected your idea.

Once you understand these feelings, you speak to Anne, saying, “When I brought up that idea, you looked at Cheryl before you said no. The story I’m telling myself is that you two have been discussing my ideas outside the meeting and don’t think they’re worth your time.” Then, Anne might simply say, “No, I was looking at the clock behind Cheryl because I had a deadline that day that I was behind on,” which would bring you great relief.

> **How to Talk About Failure: What Other Authors Say**
> 
> The _Crucial Conversations_ authors would likely characterize any conversation about failure as a “crucial conversation,” which they define as a discussion characterized by high stakes, differing opinions, and strong emotions. Their process for having such a discussion is similar to Brown’s, but they have additional suggestions that may help you work through failure even more productively.
> 
> Like Brown, the authors contend that in order to prevent yourself from engaging in problematic defensive behaviors, you must acknowledge that your emotions were triggered and re-examine the initial story that you created. They add that to do so effectively, you must understand that your emotions are not created by others; rather _you create your emotions_. They also provide more actionable strategies for separating facts from assumptions in your initial story: For example, they recommend watching for emotionally charged terms—for example, “she scowled at me” might sound like a fact, but “scowled” is a word that expresses judgment.
> 
> Then they, like Brown, recommend speaking with the people involved, and they present an acronym for helping you do so: STATE. **S** hare your facts, starting with the least controversial. **T** ell your story, explaining what you’re beginning to conclude. **A** sk for others’ paths, encouraging others to tell their facts and stories. **T** alk tentatively, stating your story as opinion, not fact. **E** ncourage testing; in other words, proactively seek opposing views to test your theory against additional information.

##### Question Initial Stories in Turbulent Times

Brown adds that **it’s especially important to lead your team in questioning and talking through their initial stories in times of change or uncertainty in your organization** , when rumors are prevalent. People tend to believe their stories and retell them as truth, breeding insecurity and anxiety. Just think how easy it is for “There will probably be massive layoffs at the end of the summer, I can feel it” to become twisted into, “There _will_ be massive layoffs in August.”

Brown explains that you can stop these stories by offering as much information about the situation as possible and speaking to your team with transparency to separate fact from imagination— _before_ rumors abound. Addressing your team’s stories now _will_ take some extra time, but it’ll also save you from wasting your time on fixing defensive behaviors down the road.

> **How to Talk to Your Teams About Their Initial Stories When Working Remotely**
> 
> If you’re working in a virtual or hybrid team during a time of uncertainty in your organization, don’t try to discuss your team members’ initial stories via email or chat; talk to them live. Experts argue that easily accessible leaders are key to promoting transparency on (partly) remote teams: Your in-person and remote**** employees should both have equal opportunity to ask you questions, and making people email you adds a barrier to entry that’s not present when you’re talking in person. Additionally, having this conversation via video chat improves the chances that you’ll notice that something is wrong even if your team member isn’t explicit about her concerns: The vast majority of our communication comes from factors other than the words we speak, like our gestures.
