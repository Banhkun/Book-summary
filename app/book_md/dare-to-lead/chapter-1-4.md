## Chapter 1.4: Accepting Shame & Showing Empathy

Many defensive behaviors in the workplace are, at their core, about avoiding the threat of _shame_ —the feeling that something you’ve done (or not done), a goal you haven’t achieved, or an ideal you didn’t measure up to makes you a flawed person unworthy of connection, love, or belonging.

Shame touches your core, telling you that you deserve failure, are deeply alone, and that your bad actions are not just behaviors, but who you inherently are. It’s sometimes grouped with other negative emotions such as guilt, humiliation, and embarrassment, which are usually short-lived and relatively superficial. However, it’s important to understand how shame differs from these emotions—it’s much more painful and frightening, and therefore much more powerful.

**Shame is not the same as guilt.** Guilt happens when you act against your values, giving you the feeling that you’ve _done_ something bad. It may be uncomfortable, but it’s usually a valuable learning experience that reminds you of your values, and prompts an apology or behavioral changes. Shame, on the other hand, is the feeling that you _are_ bad and usually doesn’t reveal any sort of learning experience—instead of making changes, you believe that you’re inherently a bad person, incapable of doing better.

**Shame is not the same as humiliation.** Humiliation is short-lived and externalized—you don’t feel bad about yourself, but rather about how you’ve been treated in a situation. Shame, on the other hand, is deep-rooted and internalized—you feel bad because you believe _you_ are the problem. Imagine you were publicly chastised for missing a deadline. Humiliation would look like, “I didn’t deserve to be called out in front of everyone.” Shame, however, would look like, “I was called out because I am a failure.” Humiliation doesn’t usually feel deserved, but shame always does.

**Shame is not the same as embarrassment.** Embarrassment is a fleeting emotion that you know is universal. Usually, like falling down the stairs in middle school, it can even be funny in the future. Shame, however, is very lonely—you believe you’re the only person to have experienced it.

Brave leaders recognize the particular power of shame and how easily it drives emotional reactivity, more than any other negative emotion. **You can stay ahead of the effects of shame in your work culture by teaching your team how to face the vulnerability of shame and work through it.**

**Building Shame Resilience**

Unfortunately, it’s not possible for innovative cultures to completely resist shame, as it’s a natural byproduct of risk and failure. It’s possible, however, to build _shame resilience_ —the process of feeling, understanding, and overcoming shame. **Shame resilience is an essential skill in brave leadership—normalizing and encouraging discussion around shame allows you to consciously work through it and learn from it, instead of letting it unconsciously manifest as defensive, unproductive behaviors.**

There are four components to shame resilience: 1) recognizing shame, 2) seeing the big picture, 3) connecting with others, and 4) talking about shame.

  * **Recognizing shame** is simply being able to recognize your physical symptoms of shame. Shame presents physically in different ways for everyone—maybe you have heart palpitations and clenched fists, or have a sudden, urgent need to go for a walk around the block. This first step of recognizing when your physical reaction to shame appears is important because it signals you to check in with yourself and make sure you’re not unconsciously resorting to defensive behaviors. 
  * **Seeing the big picture** is recognizing that shame is universal. Part of shame’s power lies in its loneliness, so you can fight against it by thinking about how universal the feeling of shame is, even if the experiences that cause it look very different. For example, shame can have various causes such as having your opinion dismissed by more senior people in a meeting; yelling at your children; or having friends invest in your new business, then closing a year later. 
  * **Connecting with others and talking openly about shame** go hand in hand—recall that building trusting connections and sharing vulnerability are an exchange. If you don’t take part in this exchange, instead choosing to ignore your shame and think you’re the only person who suffers from it, you’ll feed into shame’s power to make you feel unworthy of connection or belonging. Open up about your experience with someone you trust and whose opinion you value—such as a mentor, a spouse, or a colleague—and express what you need in support from them. Talking about your experience, learning about their similar experience, and getting the support you need gives you the strength to move forward from your shame, knowing that you’re not alone in it.



> **How Brave Leaders Let Someone Go**
> 
> A brave leader acknowledges that the process of letting someone go often comes with a great deal of shame, and tries to diminish the shame of the experience as much as possible. There are several ways that you can accomplish this:
> 
>   * **Be as clear as possible when you are delivering the news.** Recall that polite half-truths only serve to make _you_ more comfortable. Your employee deserves a clear explanation of why they’re being let go.
> 
>   * **Think about ways that you can make this a more dignified process for them, and ask for their input where appropriate.** Can they resign instead? Would they prefer that you make the announcement, or tell their colleagues themselves? Giving them a say in the process—showing them they’re worthy of making decisions _with_ you—helps alleviate the feelings of unworthiness and disconnection that often come with layoffs.
> 
> 

> 
> Done well, this conversation grants your employee a dignified exit, and it can keep their feelings of shame to a minimum. However, it’s very easy for leaders to derail this conversation in several ways. When letting an employee go, be careful not to engage in the following behaviors:
> 
>   * Becoming defensive: Once you’ve made the decision that you feel is right, just _be_ with it. Defending and over-explaining your decision undermines your confidence in it.
> 
>   * Lacking courage: Due to the vulnerability of the conversation, it’s possible your employee (or you) will become emotional. It’s tempting to avoid this by rushing through the conversation, or by avoiding negative, but honest feedback. Brave leaders give the conversation the space and honesty it deserves, no matter how uncomfortable it may be.
> 
>   * Not putting in the extra effort: Creating a kinder firing process might demand extra time and energy (or money, if you’re offering a severance package), but it’s worth it to keep your team member’s shame to a minimum and demonstrate to your organization that they can always expect dignity from you.

### Combat Shame With Empathy

If someone practicing shame resilience reaches out to you to talk about shame, it’s important to know how to respond with supportive _empathy_. This skill is crucial in innovative cultures, because people are more willing to take risks and show vulnerability when they know that they’ll be supported through their struggles.

Effective empathy is _not_ “making things better.” Rather, empathy is seeing the perspective of someone else, and connecting to their emotions about a tough experience. Since you’re connecting to their emotions—not to the experience itself—it doesn’t matter if you’ve gone through the same struggle or not. You just need to have felt the same emotions at some point in your life.

This connection with someone else’s emotions makes empathy a vulnerable choice, because you must connect with those same emotions in yourself, and speak to the person from that place. As can be expected with shame, the emotions you’ll have to call on are painful ones, such as fear, loneliness, or disappointment. It’s incredibly tempting to avoid the potential pain of empathy by spouting off advice or making an attempt to “fix” everything simply—you can resist this temptation by practicing your _empathy skills_ so that you can show up with courage when you need to.

#### The Five Skills That Create Empathy

Brave leadership depends on _five empathy skills_ to respond to the vulnerability of shame effectively: 1) taking the perspective of others, 2) being nonjudgmental, 3) understanding the other person’s feelings, 4) articulating your understanding of those feelings, and 5) being mindful.

##### Skill #1: Taking the perspective of others

The first empathy skill is listening to and honoring the perspective and experience of the person speaking to you. In listening to them, your goal is not to _see_ their perspective of the experience—this would require shedding your own background and experiences and taking on their background and experiences. Of course, this isn’t possible. **Rather, your goal is to _honor_ their perspective, which means asking questions and understanding that their __ perspective is their __ truth, and may differ from your __ perspective and your __ truth.**

Including and valuing diverse perspectives is necessary to fully understanding who someone is, and seeing how you can successfully connect with their emotions and serve their needs. This step also paves the way for the type of collaboration that spurs innovation and creativity. For example, while working on a new marketing strategy with a team member who has a very different background from you, he might contradict your ideas and say, “Based on my experience, this strategy won’t work with the audience we’re targeting.” While you can’t view the issue from his perspective, you _can_ engage with his vulnerable choice to push back, and ask him why he thinks that, what his experience taught him, and what his approach would be.

##### Skill #2: Being nonjudgmental

The second empathy skill is being nonjudgmental when someone opens up about their struggle. This is fairly common sense—judgment doesn’t help people open up and name their fears. It only serves to shame them _more_ and causes them to shut down. However, judgmental moments still happen, usually when we feel most vulnerable to our own shame, and try to soothe it with a sense of superiority.

You can diminish your judgmental moments—and increase people’s willingness to reach out to you—by recognizing and examining them. Finding your shame triggers and working through them helps diminish their power and opens up a more receptive, non-judgmental mindset.

##### Skill #3: Understanding the other person’s feelings and Skill #4: Articulating your understanding of their feelings

When responding to the shame of someone’s struggle, it’s important to practice the third and fourth empathy skills in tandem in order to have a meaningful conversation about it. Most people have great difficulty articulating their feelings accurately, which makes it difficult to work through the emotions of an experience. You need to work with them to land on the exact emotion that you should be connecting with.

You can do this by listening to their experience, and then telling them what you are hearing and understanding to check if you’re on the same emotional page. It’s very possible you won’t get the emotion exactly right on your first try—just think of the subtle differences between anger and disappointment, sadness and frustration, shame and guilt. It can be difficult to suggest an emotion, because getting it wrong and having to try again might feel like you’re screwing up empathy. But to the other person, it demonstrates that you’re trying your best to understand and connect.

In a conversation with a team member, you might put this skill into practice after a tough meeting. You could say, “I’m really sorry for how that presentation went. I know it can be embarrassing. Do you want to talk about it?” This demonstrates that you’re open to talking about the struggle, and are trying to find the right emotion (embarrassment) to connect with. Your team member might respond, “I’m more frustrated than embarrassed. Based on Lisa’s feedback last week, I expected it to go well. I could have made the necessary changes if I’d received more honest feedback.” Knowing that you should connect with _frustration_ opens up a more meaningful conversation that demonstrates to your team member that you care about working through her particular struggle together.

##### Skill #5: Being mindful

The last empathy skill is being mindful of how you’re engaging with your own emotions so that they don’t prevent you from effectively connecting with the other person’s. Call on them, but be careful not to suppress them or exaggerate them.

If you suppress your emotions, you can’t connect with those emotions in yourself and in the other person, which derails the possibility of meaningful conversation. If you exaggerate your emotions, you’ll become swept up in the negativity of the moment—you can’t support the other person through the emotions if you’re stuck in them yourself.

Even while practicing these five skills, empathy is difficult—everyone’s empathy needs are different, and there’s always the possibility that you will do or say the wrong thing. It’s important to remember that it’s okay to do or say the wrong thing. If you are trying your best to connect, you’ll notice quickly if you mess up and can easily get back on track. Genuine attempts at empathy are evident—even when they don’t go exactly right, the other person will feel supported by your intent.

#### How Empathy Can Miss the Mark

On the other hand, if you are not truly connected and engaged with the other person’s experience and the vulnerability they’re showing you, it’s obvious and makes people feel unsupported. Be aware of the six ways you might fall into practicing “false empathy:” 1) sympathy, 2) negative reactivity, 3) disappointment, 4) scolding and blame, 5) making it better, and 6) comparative suffering.

  1. **Sympathy** is when you feel on someone’s behalf, not _with_ them. This makes them feel alone and disconnected—having someone feel sorry for them signals that their emotions have been noticed, yet they’re being left to untangle them alone.


  * Your team member has a presentation that doesn’t go well. Instead of practicing empathy by asking if she wants to talk about it, you practice sympathy by simply saying, “It stinks that your presentation went badly, sorry.”


  1. **Negative reactivity** is when someone tells you their experience and you overreact, telling them how ashamed you’d feel in their place**.** Suddenly _they_ feel like they should be helping _you_ feel better. Not only are you not supporting them, but you’re _taking their support._


  * Your team member says, “I just had a presentation and couldn’t answer half the questions I was asked.” You respond, “That’s awful! I would die.” Now your colleague feels like she needs to reassure you: “Well, it wasn’t so bad...I came up with good answers to the other questions.”


  1. **Disappointment** happens when someone tells you their experience, and you react by expressing disappointment in them. This makes them feel even more shame, and it tells them that they can’t discuss the experience with you, because they’ve let you down in some way.


  * A team member says, “My presentation went so much worse than I was expecting. There were so many questions I couldn’t answer.” You respond, “That’s not like you! I’d never expect that you’d be underprepared for something so important.” 


  1. **Scolding and blame** happen when someone tells you their experience, and you scold them or find someone to blame. You do this to avoid negative emotions—shifting them onto a culprit instead of engaging with them. 


  * Your team member with the tough presentation reaches out and you say, “How could you be underprepared? You _knew_ how important this was!” Or, “Who was asking tough questions? I’ll go to _his_ meetings and ask impossible questions!” 


  1. **Making it better** is when someone tells you their experience and you throw feel-good phrases at them to avoid engaging with their difficult emotions.


  * Your team member with the tough presentation reaches out and you respond, “I bet your answers to the questions were great! I’m sure they loved it but just weren’t showing it.”


  1. **Comparative suffering** is when someone tells you their experience and you try to make them feel better by one-upping them. This invalidates their feelings and makes their shame into a competition. 


  * Your team member with the tough presentation reaches out and you respond, “You think that’s bad? Once I showed up for a presentation and realized that I’d left my laptop with my entire PowerPoint at home.”
