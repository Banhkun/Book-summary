## 1-Page Summary

What makes love last? According to the authors of _Eight Dates_ , the secret to a long and loving relationship is to make time to learn about your partner and to stay curious. _Eight Dates_ is a resource for building a stronger relationship with your partner by committing to always learning about who they are and who they're becoming, starting with eight powerful dates.

_Eight Dates_ is co-authored by couples John Gottman and Julie Schwartz Gottman, and Doug Abrams and Rachel Carlton Abrams. John Gottman and Julie Schwartz Gottman are best known for their work as founders of The Gottman Institute, a research and therapy center focused on strengthening relationships and preventing divorce. Their research inspired them to develop The Gottman Method, a widely used approach to relationship counseling. The couple has written multiple books together, including _The Love Prescription_ , _10 Lessons to Transform Your Marriage_ , and _And Baby Makes Three. _

Rachel Carlton Abrams, a physician and the author of _BodyWise_ , is best known for her work in integrative women’s health and sexuality. Her husband, Douglas Abrams, is an author, editor, and founder of the literacy agency Idea Architects; he has co-authored several books with notable personalities, including _The Book of Joy_ , written in collaboration with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and _The Book of Hope_ , written with Jane Goodall.

In this guide, we’ll explain why curiosity is so important in the work of building a strong relationship. Then we’ll outline the eight conversations (or dates) you can use as a starting point in that journey. We’ll also compare the authors’ recommendations with those of other relationship experts, including Amir Levine and Rachel Heller (_Attached_), Esther Perel (_Mating in Captivity_), and Gary Chapman (_The 5 Love Languages_).

### The Secret to a Long and Loving Relationship: Never Stop Dating

There's no magic equation of compatibility that guarantees that you and your partner will stay together. However, the authors argue that there's a tried and true way to make sure your relationship grows stronger over time. **Relationships last when both people support the evolution and growth of their partner** , as individuals and as a couple. The authors argue that to support each other’s growth, you and your partner need to set aside time to continue learning about each other through intentional conversation and open-ended questions.

(Shortform note: Inherent in the authors’ discussion of how to make romantic relationships last is the assumption that people want to stay in long-term relationships. However, according to some experts, not all long-term relationships are healthy, and many people find themselves stuck in emotionally or physically abusive relationships. In _Why Does He Do That?_ , Lundy Bancroft defines abuse as controlling, angry, and violent behavior committed by someone against their partner. If you or someone you know is in an abusive relationship, The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence offers a comprehensive list of resources.)

While there are many ways to learn about your partner, the authors advocate for the power of a weekly date night. They define a date as a designated time that you get together with your partner to connect, talk, and learn more about one another (watching Netflix on the couch together doesn’t count).

(Shortform note: A 2012 survey by the National Marriage Project revealed that couples who prioritized a weekly date night were about 3.5 times more likely to describe themselves as feeling “very happy” than couples who had less-than-weekly date nights. Studies suggest that date nights strengthen relationships by improving communication, introducing novelty, lowering stress, and increasing feelings of romantic attraction and commitment.)

#### Prioritize Date Night

When your life is busy with work, family, and daily logistics, date nights often feel like a luxury. According to the authors, the most common barriers couples cite are money, child care, and time.

If money feels like a barrier, remember that **date nights don’t need to be expensive**. The authors suggest getting creative and brainstorming free and low-cost date options, like meeting up at a cafe, taking a walk in a park, or even snuggling up on the couch at home. You just need a place where you’re able to focus on each other.

(Shortform note: If you can’t think of any cheap dates, there are endless lists available online. For example, _Marie Claire_ published a list of 70 cheap date ideas for couples on a budget. The list includes ideas like exploring neighborhood garage sales, visiting an animal shelter, and building a blanket fort at home. While there are numerous options, some of the suggestions, like binge-watching a show or visiting an arcade, don't necessarily fall under the authors’ definition of a date night, which they say must include intentional conversation that allows you to learn about your partner.)

If you have children, you can **explore out-of-the-box and inexpensive child care options**. For example, find a group of families willing to take turns babysitting each other’s kids, ask a trusted friend or family member to babysit, or just have a date night at home after the kids are in bed.

(Shortform note: Child care is becoming increasingly unaffordable for families as child care costs continue to rise. One survey found that during the Covid-19 pandemic, the cost of nannies rose by about 20% while babysitting and daycare costs increased by 5% to 15%. According to the US Department of Health and Human Services, affordable child care should cost no more than 7% of a household's income. However, a survey conducted by Care.com found that 51% of participants allocate over 20% of their household income to child care expenses, and an additional 72% of the respondents spend 10% or more of their income on child care.)

Finally, the authors acknowledge that many people already feel like there aren’t enough hours in the day. But the authors emphasize that **people make time for the things that matter most to them**. So if your relationship is on that list, they strongly suggest prioritizing a weekly date night no matter what.

(Shortform note: Making time for your partner is a powerful way of expressing love. Quality time, like a weekly date, is one of the love languages discussed by Gary Chapman in _The 5 Love Languages_. Chapman’s definition of quality time closely aligns with the authors’ definition of a date—intentional and focused communication without outside distractions. However, while Chapman contends that everyone has their own preferred love language, the authors of _Eight Dates_ argue that everyone, regardless of their preferred love language, benefits from quality time spent in the form of a weekly date night.)

#### Listen With Curiosity

Once you’ve set aside time for date night, **make sure you use this time to learn more about your partner**. The authors argue that learning more about your partner will depend on your ability to listen effectively. The goal of listening should be to better understand the other person.

> **The Three Levels of Listening**
> 
> The goal of listening is to learn more about your partner. In _Co-Active Coaching_ , the authors outline three levels of listening, the last of which is the most effective in promoting understanding and emotional intimacy.
> 
> **The first level of listening is internal listening.** At this level, the listener is focused on their own thoughts and feelings. They aren't fully present or engaged with the speaker and may be distracted or preoccupied.
> 
> **The second level of listening is focused listening.** At this level, the listener is fully present and engaged with the speaker. They're actively listening, paying attention to both verbal and nonverbal cues, and asking questions for clarification.
> 
> **The third, and most effective level of listening, is global listening.** At this level, the listener is fully present and engaged with the speaker on multiple levels. They aren't only listening to the words being spoken but also to the emotions, values, and intentions behind them.

Here are some strategies you can use to make sure you're listening to learn:

**Pay attention.** First, put away your phone and other distractions. Stay present in the conversation. Then fully listen to what your partner is saying without judgment. (Shortform note: Paying attention might require more than just putting your cell phone away. Research suggests just having your cell phone visible can reduce the quality of your social interactions even if you never touch it. The presence of a cell phone in the room can inhibit the development of interpersonal closeness and trust and reduce feelings of empathy between conversational partners. So if you want to really pay attention, consider putting your cell phone out of sight in a bag or another room.)

**Remain curious.** If you don’t understand something, ask more questions. (Shortform note: As you're asking follow-up questions, focus on open-ended questions that don’t have a simple yes or no answer. Open-ended questions begin with phrases like “How did it feel when…” or “Tell me more about…” These types of questions prompt the person to share more information, thoughts, and feelings and will lead to richer and more nuanced conversations.)

**Reflect back what you hear your partner say.** Repeating back what you hear lets your partner know that you understood them correctly. (Shortform note: This strategy, known as reflective listening, has two purposes. First, it allows you, as the listener, to clarify and restate what someone is saying to make sure you understood correctly. Second, it allows the speaker to address any misunderstanding and miscommunication and to add on to what they said if necessary.)

**Stay connected.** If the conversation gets tense or challenging, find other ways to connect. Express empathy for your partner’s experience and stay connected with physical touch.

(Shortform note: Researchers have found that showing physical affection during conflict can help couples manage disagreements more effectively because it reduces stress, increases empathy, and makes partners feel closer. In one study, couples who held hands during a tense discussion not only reported feeling less stress during the conversation, but they also engaged in more constructive conflict behaviors. However, for couples struggling with serious ongoing issues, physical touch can also be interpreted negatively, particularly if it’s seen as a tool of control or manipulation.)

### The Eight Essential Conversations

After committing to make time to learn more about your partner on a weekly date night, where do you start and what should you talk about?

The authors outline eight conversations that they say every couple must have; topics range from sex to finances to personal aspirations. These eight conversations won't only lay a strong foundation for your relationship—they’ll also allow you to address common sources of conflict.

(Shortform note: In their discussion of the eight dates, the authors focus on how conversations can strengthen relationships, but dates don’t necessarily have to revolve around conversation to have a positive impact on a relationship. Studies have shown that exploring new or exciting activities together can also promote closeness and personal growth.)

The authors structure these conversations as eight possible dates, outlining the purpose of the date and offering suggestions on where to go and questions to guide the conversation. In the following sections, we’ll explore the theme of each date, explain why it’s important, and provide a few date ideas to spark inspiration.

#### Date One: Trust

Trust is foundational to a long-lasting relationship. The authors define trust as the conviction that your partner values you and will be there to support you. The goal of this date is to understand your partner’s beliefs about trust and discuss how you can deepen trust in your relationship.

(Shortform note: Esther Perel, author of _Mating in Captivity_ , defines trust differently—as a confident engagement with the unknown. Perel argues that trust isn't necessarily about the belief that your partner will always be there or take care of you, but the confidence that when you and your partner make a mistake or cause harm to one another, you’ll come back together, heal, and move forward. Because of this, she explains that taking risks is one of the best ways for couples to build trust because it allows you to be vulnerable with your partner and creates opportunities for deeper intimacy and shared experiences.)

There are a number of ways you can build—or break—trust in your relationship. The authors argue you can build trust by being vulnerable with your partner, remaining faithful, addressing conflict, offering compassion, and expressing gratitude for your partner. You break trust when you fail to show affection, follow through, tell the truth, or be available when your partner needs you.

(Shortform date: In _Crucial Conversations_ , the authors argue that trust isn't an either/or proposition where trust either exists or it doesn’t. They suggest that trust is often specific to a situation; you trust someone in some circumstances but not in others. For example, you may trust your partner’s commitment to your relationship, but not their ability to responsibly handle finances.)

Use the following questions to help guide your conversation:

  * What did you learn about trust growing up? How do you define trust now?
  * Where do we agree on issues of trust? Where do we disagree?
  * How can we strengthen trust in our relationship? What do you need from me?



> **Understanding Your Relationship to Trust**
> 
> As you discuss trust with your partner, it’s helpful to first have an understanding of your own relationship to trust. In _Attached_ , authors Amir Levine and Rachel Heller explain that your relationship to trust depends on your attachment style.
> 
> Trust is established in early childhood through a process called **secure attachment**. When caregivers consistently respond to a child's needs and provide a safe and nurturing environment, the child develops a secure attachment style, which involves a positive expectation that others will be responsive and trustworthy.
> 
> In contrast, when caregivers are inconsistent or unresponsive, a child may develop an **insecure attachment style** , which can lead to difficulty trusting others. This can manifest in adulthood as challenges forming close relationships, fear of rejection or abandonment, or a tendency to rely on others excessively for emotional support.
> 
> Attachment theory also highlights the role of attachment figures in building and maintaining trust in adult relationships. When people have a secure attachment style, they're more likely to trust their partners and feel secure in their relationship. However, when people have an insecure attachment style, they may struggle with trust issues in their relationships, particularly when their partners don't respond to their emotional needs in a consistent and caring manner.

#### Date Two: Disagreements

The next date is about disagreements. The authors emphasize that **disagreements in a relationship are normal**. In fact, when you know how to manage disagreements effectively, it can even strengthen your relationship. The goal of this date is to learn how your partner manages disagreements and how you can manage disagreements more effectively as a couple.

(Shortform note: Not only do all couples fight, but common sources of conflict also cut across multiple cultures. For example, a study of over 2,000 married couples from Britain, China, Russia, Turkey, and the US found that couples were most likely to fight about the division of household tasks, finances, parenting, and physical intimacy.)

The authors differentiate between two types of problems that cause tension in a relationship. The first type of problem are those that can be resolved. These are often surface-level problems about what to eat for dinner or who should walk the dog. They’re only about the topic at hand and don’t hide any bigger underlying issues. The second type of problem are ones that will never be resolved (what the authors call “perpetual problems”). These problems are rooted in core differences between you and your partner based on your values or life experiences. Research has shown that most conflicts fall into this second category.

(Shortform note: Both types of problems are worth addressing. Failing to deal with conflict will cause resentment to build up over time. According to some psychologists, harboring resentment, also called gunnysacking, is one of the main relationship killers. If you don’t address the issues in your “gunny sack,” your resentment can explode into an emotional outburst that causes lasting damage to your relationship.)

Regardless of the type of disagreement you’re having, the key to a healthy relationship isn't avoiding conflicts but resolving them effectively, meaning you approach each disagreement as an opportunity to increase your understanding of the other person—not as an opportunity to win.

> **How to Diffuse Conflict**
> 
> Levine and Heller (_Attached_) outline four communication strategies you can use to handle everyday conflicts and disagreements in a way that will bring you closer.
> 
> **Show genuine concern for the other person’s feelings.** Remember that a disagreement between partners isn't a zero-sum game where one person wins and the other loses. Your happiness and your partner’s happiness are tied up together, so when both partners feel validated, both partners win.
> 
> **Keep the argument centered on the present issue.** Don’t get sidetracked or expand the argument to include other issues. Avoid a full-blown venting session, and just address one conflict at a time.
> 
> **Be willing to take part in the discussion.** Don’t disengage or withdraw.**** Both partners need to be willing to address the issue head-on so that it can be resolved in a mutually satisfactory way, even if it means some arguing along the way.
> 
> **Openly communicate your needs and feelings _._** No matter how long you’ve been with your partner, you can’t expect them to be a mind reader. Tell them what you need and want clearly and directly.

Use the following questions to help guide your conversation:

  * What did you learn about conflict or managing conflict growing up? How have you navigated conflict in the past?
  * What are your beliefs about anger? What do you need when you're feeling angry?
  * How would you like to manage conflict differently in the future?



> **How Your Relationship to Conflict Forms**
> 
> To successfully discuss conflict with your partner, it’s helpful to have an understanding of your own relationship to conflict.
> 
> A number of studies have found that the ways in which a child’s family of origin responds to conflict can influence how the developing child will behave toward conflict. For example, if a child witnesses their parents expressing hostile remarks to one another or if one parent continually avoids any discussion regarding disagreements, the child may engage in similar conflict strategies in their relationships as they age.
> 
> People’s relationship to conflict may also vary depending on their cultural background. In _The Culture Map_ , Erin Meyer identifies two types of orientations to conflict: open disagreement and disagreement-avoidant. She argues that people raised in (typically Western) open disagreement cultures are more likely to view disagreement as productive and positive and be willing to disagree openly, but people raised in (typically Eastern) disagreement-avoidant cultures are more likely to believe that openly disagreeing with someone might harm the relationship.)

#### Date Three: Sex

The authors argue that **a healthy sex life is important to the long-term health of your relationship**. However, they emphasize that there isn't one definition of a healthy sex life. It will look different for every couple, and it will look different at different points in your life. For example, you might have more sex when you first start dating or less sex if one partner is sick. In the end, a healthy sex life is whatever feels good for both you and your significant other. The goal of this date is to learn more about what turns your partner on and to discuss how to keep your relationship passionate.

(Shortform note: Sex isn't necessarily a part of every long-term healthy relationship. A 2022 study found that many people who self-identify as asexual are happily coupled in thriving relationships. However, there is limited research on the subject and researchers emphasized the need for further exploration of diverse relationship models.)

The authors explain that **a healthy sex life depends on honest conversation**. Sex and intimacy are particularly sensitive topics for most people, which is why a lot of couples don’t talk regularly about their sex life or sexual desires. However, research suggests that couples that talk regularly about sex have better sex more often.

(Shortform note: Communication about sex is especially important for women. A study of heterosexual couples found that more communication about sex led to a greater frequency of orgasms for female partners and increased sexual satisfaction for both partners.)

The authors offer a few tips for talking about sex with your partner. First, make sure you’re _not_ doing it right before, during, or after sex. Since it’s a delicate topic, bringing it up in the moment is a recipe for disaster. Second, don’t underestimate the power of humor. Sex doesn’t have to be serious, so don’t be afraid to bring some lightness to the conversation.

(Shortform note: It can be helpful to think about your sexual desires before jumping into a conversation with your partner. But everyone has a different relationship to their own sexuality, and you might not know what you like or want when it comes to sex. To start reflecting on your sexual preferences, think about what you fantasize about when you masturbate or if there's anything you’re curious about that isn’t a part of your current sexual routine. You can also explore online quizzes that analyze anything from your sexual personality to your undiscovered kinks.)

Use the following questions to help guide your conversation:

  * What do you like?
  * When and how do you like to initiate sex?
  * What can I do to improve our sex life?



(Shortform note: If you have a history of sexual trauma, this date can be an opportunity to share this with your partner if you haven’t already. However, therapists and psychologists emphasize there's no timeline or obligation for when and how you discuss sexual trauma with people in your life. They recommend seeking advice from mental health professionals before discussing your history of sexual trauma with your significant other.)

#### Date Four: Finances

**Money is another frequent source of conflict in any relationship.** The authors explain that having explicit conversations about your individual and collective finances will help you get to know your partner better and more effectively anticipate and navigate areas of conflict related to money. The goal of this date is to better understand your and your partner’s relationship to money and discuss how to build a healthy financial future together.

(Shortform note**:** One expert explains that conflict about money often stems from financial imbalance, or differences in earning and/or spending, in a couple. Financial imbalance isn't inherently bad but can lead to a variety of conflicts, including feelings of guilt or resentment. Other issues that may arise include feelings of inadequacy if one partner is the primary earner or there's a significant income difference between partners, an imbalance of power if one partner makes all the important financial decisions, or financial infidelity if one partner misleads the other about their finances, causing problems by undermining trust.)

**Our relationship to money is complex, often rooted in our upbringing and deeply held values**. Therefore, conflicts around money are rarely about specific spending or saving habits—they’re more often about the emotional significance we attribute to those behaviors. The goal of this date is to dig into each partner’s relationship to money.

(Shortform note: We begin to form a relationship with money at a young age. A University of Michigan study found that children as young as five had clear emotional responses to spending and saving money that impacted real-life spending behaviors. However, researchers found that children’s attitudes toward money weren't necessarily reflective of their parents’.)

When beginning a conversation about your finances, start by asking questions to better understand what money means to you and your partner. For example, money might mean stability and safety for one person, but it might mean freedom and spontaneity for another. Avoid making sweeping generalizations about your or your partner’s relationship to money. It’s unhelpful to categorize one person as the cheapskate and another as the spendthrift. The key is to find the balance between the joyful opportunities and the solid foundation money can provide.

(Shortform note: One financial psychologist describes our attitudes toward money as “money scripts''—unconscious beliefs about money developed in childhood that drive adult financial decision-making. Three categories of money scripts can be particularly damaging—money avoidance, money status, and money worship. These belief patterns can predict poor financial choices and are linked to lower net worth, reduced income, and higher debt. The good news is that money scripts can be interrupted and changed. If you recognize that you have an unhealthy relationship to money, speak to a financial planner to identify and transform your money scripts.)

Use the following questions to help guide your conversation:

  * What did you learn about money growing up?
  * What makes you anxious when it comes to money?
  * What do you hope for your (and our) financial future?



(Shortform note: You can take this conversation a step further by creating a family budget that aligns with your mutually agreed-upon vision for your financial future. Many financial blogs offer step-by-step advice on how to create a budget as a couple, including easy-to-use templates to get you started.)

#### Date Five: Family

The authors argue that **different visions and definitions of family can be a dealbreaker in a relationship**. The goal of this date is to understand what family looks like for you and your partner. Every person defines family differently, so it’s important to make sure you and your partner are on the same page before entering into a long-term commitment. Specifically, if you don't have children, talk about whether you want to be parents.

(Shortform note: This date focuses on couples who haven't yet made the decision to have kids. If you already have children, you can use this date to talk about how you co-parent—what’s working and what isn’t. Consider discussing your different parenting styles or any house rules and routines that need to be changed or updated, or just take time to discuss how your family is doing and any challenges you're facing right now as a parent.)

Use the following prompt to guide your conversation:

  * Describe your dream family.



If you're planning on having children, ask yourself:

  * What challenges can we anticipate when we bring kids into our family?
  * How do you imagine me as a parent? Where do you think I’ll thrive as a parent?
  * What qualities of ours do we hope to instill in our children?



If you aren't planning on having kids, ask yourself:

  * What does being a family mean for you?
  * Who's your community? How do you want to strengthen the relationships with those in your community?



(Shortform note: As you discuss the decision to have children, it’s important to acknowledge that women face more societal pressure than men to have children. Even though many women choose not to have children, motherhood is still strongly associated with adult femininity. A study of nearly 1,200 American women found that child-free women who choose to remain childless feel more social pressure to become mothers than other women. However, they tend to feel less distress about not having kids than women who are childless due to infertility or other reasons.)

Whether or not children are in your definition of family, the authors argue that the most important relationship should always be with your partner because the couple is the foundation of a family, and the other people in your life will be best served if you prioritize that relationship.

> **Is Your Romantic Partnership Really Your Most Important Relationship?**
> 
> Throughout the book, the authors emphasize the importance of a monogamous romantic relationship. However, some people argue that placing so much emphasis on romantic relationships actually minimizes people’s social support networks.
> 
> For example, in an article published in _The Atlantic_ , Mandy Len Catron makes the case that marriage actually weakens social ties and leads to increased isolation. Single people, she argues, are far more connected to the world around them. The American ideology of marriage assumes that the work of caring for someone falls primarily to one person, but without the preeminence of marriage, care and support could be redistributed across networks of extended family, neighbors, and friends. Catron advocates for expanding our sense of what love looks like beyond the insular institution of marriage to benefit from a diverse network of close and loving relationships.

#### Date Six: Play

The next date is about playfulness. The authors believe that **having fun is key to a happy, thriving relationship**. The goal of this date is to find out what you like to do for fun and what your partner likes to do for fun and to explore how you can have fun together.

> **What Does Fun Look Like?**
> 
> _The Power of Fun _author Catherine Price argues that __“true fun” occurs when playfulness, connection, and flow coincide.
> 
> She defines playfulness as the state of doing something for its own sake without seeking any specific outcome or reward; connection as the feeling of sharing a unique experience with another person or entity, leading to a sense of closeness; and flow as the mental state of being fully engaged in a present-moment task, where one becomes so absorbed that time seems to pass quickly and is forgotten.
> 
> She explains that while the experience of any one of these factors is bound to elicit a range of positive emotions, only the combined experience of all three will give you the feeling of lightness, freedom, and energy that characterizes “true fun.”

Humans are built to play. Play not only improves the mental health of individuals, but it strengthens relationships, building trust and closeness between you and your partner. However, it’s still common for people to sacrifice fun when they’re faced with other responsibilities.

(Shortform note: Not only are humans built to play, but it’s crucial to the way we learn. Play helps children develop cognitive skills such as memory recall, problem-solving, decision-making, information processing, and language development. And while we often discuss the importance of play for children, play is equally important for adults. Engaging in playful activities has been shown to reduce stress, boost creativity, and enhance social connections. In fact, some studies have found that adults who engage in play have higher job satisfaction and are more productive.)

Use the following questions to guide your conversation:

  * What's the most fun you've ever had? Share a personal experience and an experience you’ve shared with your partner.
  * What’s on your bucket list?
  * What can we do to make our relationship more fun?



> **How to Find Your Fun**
> 
> According to Price (_The Power of Fun_), the social pressure to be productive and successful, coupled with the constant stimulation of technology and social media, has led many people to prioritize work and productivity over leisure activities and fun.
> 
> If you (or your partner) are struggling to tap into what fun means to you, Price recommends trying the following exercises.
> 
>   * **Keep a "Fun Journal":** This involves writing down activities that you enjoy doing and how they make you feel. Over time, patterns may emerge that can help you identify your True Fun.
> 
>   * **Reflect on your childhood:** Think back to activities that you enjoyed as a child, and consider how you might incorporate those activities into your adult life.
> 
>   * **Pay attention to your emotions:** Notice which activities make you feel energized, happy, and fulfilled. These are likely to be the activities that align with your True Fun.
> 
>   * **Try new things:** Experiment with different activities and hobbies, even if they seem outside of your comfort zone. This can help you discover new interests and passions.
> 
> 

> 
> She argues that by engaging in these exercises and reflecting on your experiences, you may
> 
> be able to identify your True Fun and incorporate more of these activities into your life. She also offers a number of resources on her website.

#### Date Seven: Change

According to the authors, people change over time. In a relationship, **it’s important to support your partner’s evolution** , even if it’s different than you expected. Conflict will often arise as you or your partner changes, but individual change can strengthen and deepen a relationship when both partners take it as an opportunity to better understand the other person. The purpose of this date is to acknowledge how you and your partner have changed in your relationship and to discuss shared traditions that will keep you connected as you continue to change in the future.

(Shortform note: While there's widespread consensus that personality changes over time, research has shown some personality traits remain relatively stable throughout a person's life, while others change significantly. For example, some studies have found that people tend to become more emotionally stable as they age. Also, personality traits that are more specific and negative, such as anxiety or anger, are more likely to change over time than broader and more positive traits like extraversion or conscientiousness.)

**Given that change is inevitable, it can be helpful to have shared traditions** (or rituals of connection) that ground you and your partner in your relationship. Maybe that's drinking coffee together in bed every morning, keeping Sabbath on Saturdays, or planning a trip every year for your anniversary. Regardless of what your traditions are, establishing these kinds of touchpoints can keep you grounded and close through life’s ups and downs.

(Shortform note: Creating shared traditions not only provides stability in the midst of change but also creates a sense of belonging and closeness in your relationship. If you want to explore new traditions to introduce into your relationship, go through this list of 27 ideas, which includes forming a family book club and going on a weekly family walk.)

Use the following questions to guide your conversations:

  * Describe ways in which you’ve grown that you’re most proud of.
  * How do you prioritize your personal growth? How can I support you?
  * What traditions are important for us to establish even as our relationship continues to grow and change?



(Shortform note: The authors’ conversation about change is focused on sharing your vision of personal growth, not providing suggestions for how you want your partner to change. In _The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work_ , John Gottman explains that you can’t force change on another person. People are only able to change if they feel accepted and appreciated. Therefore, he recommends that instead of criticizing your partner, focus on what you appreciate about them, and try to understand their perspective. Work to embrace and celebrate each other's unique qualities instead of focusing on what you wish was different.)

#### Date Eight: Aspirations

According to the authors, couples grow together, but each person also has personal aspirations. Couples who are able to affirm and support each other’s long-term goals are more likely to have a long-lasting relationship. This date is about sharing your greatest aspirations with your partner and learning about their aspirations so that you can better support each other as you pursue your dreams.

(Shortform note: When you lose sight of your own goals and aspirations, you run the risk of becoming too deeply enmeshed with your partner, or codependent. In _Codependent No More_ , Melody Beattie defines codependency as a pattern of behavior in a relationship in which one person becomes obsessed with another and loses sight of themselves. Interdependence, on the other hand, offers a healthy middle ground between total self-sufficiency and total dependency that will allow you to sustain a mutually beneficial relationship.)

**Everyone has goals and aspirations that deserve to be pursued**. Affirming the goals and aspirations of your partner is a deep expression of love, even when you know that these goals will inevitably require compromise.

(Shortform note: Words of Affirmation is one of the love languages outlined in Chapman’s _The 5 Love Languages. _For people whose primary love language is Words of Affirmation, supportive and complementary language makes them feel the most loved. Chapman explains that encouragement is one of the key dialects within this love language. By telling someone you believe in them, as the authors of _Eight Dates_ suggest, you can make them feel more motivated and courageous, helping them meet their full potential.)

Use the following questions to guide your conversation:

  * Do you have any aspirations you've let go of that you regret?
  * Describe an aspiration that's important to you. Why is it important? What would it feel like if you fulfilled this goal?
  * What do you need from me to pursue your greatest aspiration?



(Shortform note: As you consider your own aspirations, there are two types of aspirations you can discuss: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic aspirations are those that are inherently rewarding and personally fulfilling, such as pursuing personal growth, cultivating meaningful relationships, or contributing to society. Examples include learning a new language or volunteering regularly in your community. Extrinsic aspirations are those that are driven by external rewards, like getting a promotion or owning a house. Both are valid and worthy of pursuit, although extrinsic motivations have the potential to stem from social pressure.)

### A Lifelong Journey

The authors emphasize that these eight dates are just the start of the long journey of getting to know your partner. It’s impossible to ever know everything about another person, and that's the wonderful thing about being in a long-term, committed relationship. There will always be more to learn, as long as you prioritize your partner and stay curious.

(Shortform note: To help you continue learning about your partner, The Gottman Institute offers a free relationship app called the Gottman Card Decks. The app includes open-ended questions, guided conversations, and other tools to help you continue to learn about your partner through any stage of a relationship.)
