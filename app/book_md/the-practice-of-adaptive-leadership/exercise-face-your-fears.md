## Exercise: Face Your Fears

Fear is one of the reasons people don’t pursue adaptive change.

* * *

Describe a recent opportunity for adaptive change that you didn’t pursue.

Why didn’t you pursue it? Were any of the reasons fear-related?

What were all the possible outcomes of pursuing the change?

If you got the same opportunity again, would you take it? Why or why not?
