## Exercise: Accept Your Part

Whenever your organization faces an adaptive challenge, youâ€™re part of the problem.

* * *

Describe an adaptive challenge your organization is currently facing.

How are you exacerbating the problem? (For example, if the challenge is that your organization lacks transparency, you might be keeping things to yourself.)

How could you fix your part in exacerbating the challenge?

How could you demonstrate your fix and lead by example?
