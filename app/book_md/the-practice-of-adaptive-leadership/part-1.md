## Part 1: What Is Adaptive Leadership? | Chapter 1: Backgrounder

**When your organization is facing changing conditions or never-before-seen challenges, the only way to survive is to adapt.** In _The Practice of Adaptive Leadership_ , three leadership experts—Ronald A. Heifetz, Alexander Grashow, and Marty Linsky—explain how to lead your organization through the difficult, uncomfortable, and sometimes dangerous process of adaptation.

In Part 1 of this summary, you’ll learn what adaptive leadership is and the kinds of challenges it can help address. Next, in Part 2, you’ll assess your organization’s current capacity for adaptation and learn to diagnose challenges. Then, in Part 3, you’ll learn some tips and tricks for addressing these challenges. Finally, in Part 4, you’ll learn how to build an adaptive company culture.

(Shortform note: We’ve rearranged the book’s content for concision and clarity.)

### What Are Adaptive Leadership and Adaptive Challenges?

**“Adaptive leadership” is marshaling people to tackle problems with unknown solutions and thrive while doing so.**(Both the people and the organization should thrive, and for an organization, thriving generally includes having good customer service, high morale, high profit, and satisfied stakeholders.)

  * (Shortform example: When a sales company expanded into a new region, adaptive leaders marshaled people to figure out what sales processes—or what completely new procedures—would work best in the new region’s market.)



**These problems with unknown solutions are called “adaptive challenges.”** The only way to solve them is for the people in organizations to learn and change. (Challenges with known solutions are called “technical problems” and can be solved using existing workflows and expertise.)

We’ll look at the following four facets of adaptive challenges in the rest of the chapter:

  1. Their qualities
  2. The key activities involved in facing them
  3. What will motivate you to address them
  4. Four tips for addressing them with adaptive leadership



#### The Qualities of Adaptive Challenges

Adaptive challenges have the following qualities:

**Quality #1: They include an _element_ of loss. **Like biological adaptation, some things have to be left behind for things to change, but much will still be retained.

  * (Shortform biological example: A white moth might evolve into a brown one (the moth loses a color it may have liked), but not into a unicorn (the moth’s core being is retained)).
  * (Shortform business example: A struggling advertising firm might need to drop some existing clients to free up resources to take on new, more profitable clients. However, the firm doesn’t have to drop _all_ its existing clients, change its staff, or change its industry.)



**Quality #2: They include a human element.** Problems are created by people, so everyone involved with the challenge will need to change.

  * (Shortform example: If a call center’s adaptive challenge is customer dissatisfaction because the existing phone system keeps dropping calls, the people who use the phones will have to adapt in order to solve the problem, perhaps by learning to use a new phone system.)



**Quality #3: They generate resistance.** Some people will resist any sort of change because they fear the loss that comes with it—even the most seemingly dysfunctional workplace is working for some of the people in it. Others will agree that change is necessary but won’t agree on the best way to tackle the challenge. Even formal authority may not be enough to overcome this resistance.

  * For example, if your adaptive challenge is to reduce staff turnover, you might ask a manager to give her desirable clients to up-and-coming salespeople to motivate them and encourage them to stick around. The up-and-coming people likely won’t resist, but the manager might, because she lost her favorite clients and her work is now harder.



**Quality #4: They require spending time in the “productive zone of disequilibrium”** —a zone in which a problem puts enough stress on people to motivate them to act, but not _so_ much stress that they’re overwhelmed and can’t do anything at all.

  * (Shortform example: If one of your competitors is growing quickly, but to stay ahead you would have to do something you don’t want to—say, scrap a legacy project and develop something new—it will be most comfortable to ignore the threat and do nothing. It will be most chaotic to abandon everything you’re currently doing and start from scratch. The productive zone of disequilibrium is somewhere in between.)



**Quality #5: They take a long time to solve and require experimentation and iteration.** Since there’s no known solution, you’re going to have to try different things, and inevitably, not everything you try will work.

  * For example, at a company experiencing high turnover, a manager might try increasing bonuses to encourage people to stay. However, achieving high bonuses makes employees more attractive to other companies, which could actually increase turnover.



#### The Key Activities of Facing Adaptive Challenges

There are three key activities to engage in to understand adaptive challenges: observing, interpreting, and intervening. You’ll need to do all of them multiple times—as you interpret your observations, you may make new observations, and after intervening, you’ll need to observe the results to decide on your next intervention.

##### Activity #1: Observation

**Observation is assessing the circumstances surrounding the challenge, and the challenge itself, as objectively as possible.** To do that:

**1\. Get as much information as you can from all available sources.** Research, talk to people, and pay attention to your surroundings.

**2\. Get some distance from the challenge.** When you’re deeply involved in a situation, it’s difficult to see things that aren’t right in front of you, so step away and try to see the whole picture.

  * For example, in a meeting, you might sit in the back and take notes on what happens rather than participating.



We’ll look at observation in more detail in Part 2.

##### Activity #2: Interpretation

**Interpretation is attaching meaning to what you’ve observed** — _describing_ events rather than simply _reciting_ them.

Your brain will interpret things (such as adaptive problems) unconsciously, and often in a biased way. When you mentally write a story to explain what you’re seeing, you, like most people, will include details and facts that support your favorite interpretation, and leave out ones that don’t. Typically, your favorite interpretation will be one that shows you in a good light and justifies your behavior. As a result, you may misinterpret adaptive problems and your own role in them.

  * For example, two people might observe the same thing in a meeting—a quiet, African American woman is regularly interrupted while speaking. One person might interpret this as the group being prejudiced and devaluing the woman’s opinion. Another person (perhaps one of the people who interrupted her) might interpret this as her being soft-spoken.



To regain some control of your brain and its interpreting tendencies and ensure that you interpret situations as objectively as possible:

**1\. Question the accuracy of your interpretation** —acknowledge that interpretations are made up of assumptions. When you and others observe the same events, consider their versions of the story.

**2\. Come up with as many interpretations as possible.** The more angles and perspectives you can see a situation from, the more complete your picture of it will be.

**3\. Try to hold more than one interpretation in your mind simultaneously.** This will allow you to stay open to new information: You’ll be open to information about _multiple_ interpretations, not just one.

We’ll look more at interpretation in Part 3.

##### Activity #3: Intervention

**Intervention is coming up with a plan of action to address your challenge, based on your interpretation of its causes and intricacies.** We’ll look more at interventions (also called change initiatives) in Part 3.

#### Adaptive Leadership Is Dangerous

Since adaptive problems don’t have known solutions, **you won’t be able to fix them by following pre-existing directions of the people who give you authority.** Therefore, adaptive leadership is dangerous—by nature, it involves challenging the expectations of the very people who gave you power.

  * For example, if a company hired you to run a department, they’ll want you to follow their directions and run the department in the way they expect. They’ll expect you to stay within your scope of authority and defer to them, even if running the company in the way they expect isn’t effective. Thus, changing your leadership style to face an adaptive challenge may upset your superiors.



### Practice Adaptive Leadership to Achieve a Purpose

Since adaptive leadership will make people resist you and potentially jeopardize your job, it’s only worth practicing when it will help you or your organization achieve a compelling purpose.

**Purposes are the causes that bring value, happiness, or meaning to you or your organization.** You and your organization probably have many purposes, all of which are important, but one of them is most important (called the “orienting purpose”). Once you know this purpose, you can use it to guide daily decisions, time and resource allocation, and risk assessment.

To determine what your or your organization’s orienting purpose is:

**1\. Assess actions rather than words.** What you do is a better indication of what you most value than what you say. If your words and actions don’t match up, contemplate the dissonance.

  * (Shortform example: If your organization claims to value the environment but allocates most of its donation budget to human rights charities, the organization probably values human rights most.)



**2\. Consider what you or your organization are willing to take risks to do.**

  * For example, Max had a good job on the East Coast, but his girlfriend lived on the West Coast. He took the risk of moving to be with her, which demonstrated that he valued his relationship over his career at that moment.



**3\. Ask yourself or your organization what you’re _ultimately_ trying to do.** This will give you an abstract, high-level purpose that you work backward from to figure out your more concrete orienting purpose. Whenever you contemplate taking an action, ask yourself if it will further your high-level purpose, and if it does, it’s a clue to what your specific, orienting purpose might be.

  * (Shortform example: If your ultimate goal is to “save the planet,” ask yourself what action you could take to do that—perhaps you might start a company that builds electric cars, and your purpose becomes to sell a lot of electric cars.)



**Trying to hold multiple orienting purposes or compromise your purposes usually doesn’t work** —if you try to achieve too many purposes, you’ll run thin and won’t achieve any of them.

  * For example, when Marty was the editor of a newspaper, many of the writers wrote critical articles about a real estate developer. The developer was one of Marty’s friends, and he told Marty that he had to shut down the articles or they couldn’t be friends anymore. Instead of choosing between the conflicting purposes of journalistic integrity and friendship, Marty tried editing the articles to make them less critical. He lost face as the editor and his friend dropped him anyway.



**Though you and your organization can’t hold multiple orienting purposes at once, your orienting purpose _can_ change. **You can also delegate purposes to others temporarily if needed.

  * For example, there may be moments when your family requires your attention and you need to focus on them instead of your work.



### Four Tips for Practicing Adaptive Leadership

Now that we've learned some background info about adaptive challenges and how to lead adaptively, we're almost ready to move on to discussing diagnosing and treating adaptive challenges. However, before we do, here are some tips to keep in mind throughout the process.

**Tip #1: Get help from a partner or a team.** This is for two reasons: It’s less lonely, and it’s easier for people to resist or stop a single person (you) than a group.

There are three reasons people try to lead alone even though it’s a bad idea:

  1. **Their opponents isolate them.** For example, an opponent might tell you how brave you are to be striking out alone, manipulating your positive feelings around courage to keep you isolated.
  2. **Their friends let them be the guinea pig and only follow once it’s safe.** (Shortform example: Your allies might hold off publicly supporting one of your interventions until they know that their bosses don’t oppose it.)
  3. **Their passion gives them tunnel vision.** For example, you might believe so strongly in your cause that you under-communicate, thinking the same things that are obvious to you are obvious to everyone.



**Tip #2: Practice every time the opportunity arises.** Anytime you get a chance to practice adaptive leadership, whether that’s in your personal or professional life, take it so that you’re regularly learning. Don’t let the opportunity pass because you’re “too busy,” or for any other excuse. Even if this only makes you spend 5% more time practicing, that’s enough to make a significant difference to your skill level.

**Tip #3: Reflect before acting.** It’s very common to want to take action to solve an adaptive challenge right away. Leaders are often under pressure and have been trained to address problems quickly, so they’re predisposed to cut diagnosis and observation short and move straight to intervention. However, this is a mistake: Adaptive challenges take time to even fully understand, never mind address effectively. Before acting, consider the risks, whether they’re worth it, and whether you’re the right person to lead.

If you hold a high position, you can hold back prematurely starting the intervention stage yourself. If you don’t hold a high position, you’ll have to use some of the following non-confrontational techniques (lest you be accused of negativity or blocking progress) to slow down the people above you:

  * Veto action indirectly by withholding your support.
  * Schedule extra time into meetings so that you have extra time to address adaptive challenges.
  * Add to the list of people whose permission must be sought before an action is taken.
  * See through cover-up arguments (such as scapegoating) and take time to determine the real cause of conflict (such as values).
  * Ask questions instead of giving orders, and spend time discussing the answers.



**Tip #4: Embrace adapting yourself.** When you’re a leader, to get through a particular challenge, you’ll need to change yourself. This is difficult because, as noted, all changes involve loss, and, in a leader’s case, the loss can include abandoning deeply held values.

  * (Shortform example: Angela requires her employees to wear formal attire but she’s losing people to other companies that are more casual. If Andrea agrees to change the dress code to retain people, she has to give up the value of formal attire, which for her goes much deeper than appearance—for her, formal attire stands for professionalism and dependability.)



### Reflection Questions and Exercises

Throughout this summary, there are reflection questions and exercises that encourage you to think about how the material applies to your life and organization. Some of this work you can do alone, and some of it you’ll have to do with your team or other people.

Here are the exercises for this section:

  * Brainstorm 10 interpretations of why you hold your current position. Include stories that reflect both well and poorly on you. For example, one possible reason you’re in your current position is that you’re too scared to leave.
  * Write several different versions of a story explaining an adaptive challenge your organization is tackling. The first version of the story should be from your point of view. The other versions should be how you imagine other people in the organization would see the situation, including your boss, colleagues, subordinates, and opposers. What would each group think of the other group’s interpretations of the challenge?
  * Whom do you know who seems to be aware of her orienting purpose and live her life according to it? What about her makes her purposeful? How does being around her affect you and others?
  * Write your life’s purpose in a single sentence.
  * Write the purpose that motivates you to lead adaptive change at your organization.
  * With your team, work through the following steps:
    * Write down your 10 most important organizational purposes in any order.
    * Rewrite them in priority order, the most important at the top (keep in mind the feelings of those whose purposes don’t make the top of the list).
    * Cross off the bottom five purposes (most people are only driven by the top few).
    * Beside each of the remaining purposes, write down what you’ve done to further them over the last 21 days.
    * Note whether each of the actions was reactive or proactive (tag them with an “R” or “P”).
    * Write some things that you _could_ do to further the purposes but haven’t yet.
    * Consider everything you wrote down. What will you try doing over the next few weeks to further the purposes?
    * How will you know when you’ve achieved these purposes?
