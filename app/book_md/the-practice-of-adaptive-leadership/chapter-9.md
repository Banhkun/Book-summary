## Chapter 9: Maintain Purpose

In the previous chapter, we looked at how to design and launch interventions to address adaptive problems. Some of these interventions will inevitably fail, since addressing adaptive challenges is a long, experimental process. At points, you might be tempted to give up. In the next few chapters of this part, **we’ll look at how to maintain the momentum of adaptive change, starting with maintaining your sense of purpose** (remember that purpose is a useful motivator for adaptive change).

There are five techniques to stay true to your and your organization's orienting purpose as you navigate adaptive change:

### Technique #1: Regularly Remind Yourself of Your Purpose

It’s common for everyday life to get in the way of your purpose, but when you put your purpose on the back burner, your life starts to lose meaning. Here are some ways to keep your purpose at the forefront of your mind:

**1\. Use a physical object to symbolize your purpose.** Choose something you see every day, and for extra accountability, something that’s public, so people will check in with you about your progress.

  * (Shortform example: If your purpose is to keep your family safe and healthy, you might put a picture of your children in your wallet.)



**2\. Add purpose reminders to existing rituals.** You already have rituals in your personal and professional life that you do regularly—if you can imbue them with purpose, you’ll encourage yourself to connect with it regularly.

  * For example, if holding a staff meeting every Tuesday morning is a ritual for your organization, you might add an extra five minutes to the agenda to discuss purpose.



**3\. Start new rituals.** You can design a ritual entirely around a purpose.

  * For example, when Alexander’s purpose was to get physically stronger, he created a ritual in which every time he saw a TV ad for a health product, he did push-ups.



### Technique #2: Reconcile Organizational Purposes

Everyone in your organization holds purposes, and they may not all be the same. Figuring out how these purposes all fit together will prevent them from conflicting with each other as you tackle adaptive change.

Reconciling purposes can be uncomfortable—giving ground feels disloyal to the purpose—but your only other choices are to keep quiet about your purpose (and make no change) or leave the organization for one that shares the same purpose.

Here are the steps to reconciling purposes:

**1\. Determine other people’s purposes.** To do this, consider the organization from their perspective—what are their priorities?

**2\. Share your purposes concretely and specifically.** Observe how everyone else reacts.

**3\. Reconcile.** Tweak your purpose so it better matches up with everyone else’s. (This isn’t abandoning what you stand for; it’s a way of getting things done). You might:

  * **Move in a more roundabout way towards your purpose.** For example, a car company’s environment manager’s purpose is to develop an emissions-free vehicle. She may have to additionally embrace the purpose of profit so that the company can stay open long enough to develop her dream vehicle.
  * **Sacrifice parts of your purpose.** For example, Alexander and his wife have different ideas on how to best parent. Alexander has had to stop some of the practices that conflict with his wife’s.
  * **Frame your purpose in a new way to appeal to those who are skeptical or oppose you.** For example, if your purpose is to reform the healthcare system, when you present your ideas to conservatives, tell them about how the reform will save money (versus the moral argument you might use on liberals).



### Technique #3: Reflect on Ethics

The third technique is to consider how far you’re willing to go to achieve your purpose, because pursuing your purpose can lead to ethical dilemmas. For example, if the most effective intervention is to do something morally questionable, should you do it?

There’s no formula to determine the ethical benefits and costs when choosing a course of action—you have to decide for yourself. Consider the following two factors when making your decision:

**1\. Scope of harm to others.** As we’ve learned, adaptive change inevitably creates a loss for certain parties. Consider how much harm you’re prepared to do in the name of your purpose.

  * For example, Abraham Lincoln knew that people would die in the Civil War, but his purpose of saving the union was worth it to him.



**2\. Scope of harm to yourself.** When you sacrifice a value or loyalty, you’ll damage your self-image. Consider how much harm you’ll wreck on yourself if you do things that feel wrong.

  * For example, if one of your values is “theft is immoral,” but your children are starving, you might be willing to violate that value in the service of your purpose of protecting your children. If the circumstances _aren’t_ so dire and you steal food, you might feel bad about yourself.



Re-evaluate the costs and benefits _every time_ your purpose brings up an ethics conundrum because if you unilaterally decide the ends _always_ justify the means, you’ll do more harm than you need to.

### Technique #4: Hold Both Purpose _and_ Ambition

The fourth technique for maintaining your momentum during adaptive change is to embrace your ambitions _and_ your purpose to authentically be your whole self.

You might feel embarrassed about your purpose (some industries paint purpose-servers as “do-gooders”) or guilty about your ambitions (some industries frown on the selfishness required in ambition). Don’t let these feelings limit you—**there’s no reason you can’t serve _both_ your ambition _and_ a purpose that goes beyond yourself. **Sometimes there will be moments of conflict (for example, you need to work late one night so can’t spend time with your family) but for the most part, you can have both.

### Technique #5: Avoid Pitfalls

The last technique to maintain your purpose is to watch out for traps. There are four pitfalls to avoid when it comes to serving your purpose:

**1\. Single-mindedness.** When you get so committed to your purpose that you can’t see beyond it, you start to become insensitive to opposition and compromise, which could ultimately doom your purpose.

  * For example, when the Clintons proposed radical healthcare reform, they were so single-minded about it that they couldn’t see that it would never pass. Instead of amending it to make it less threatening, they stuck to their initial proposal, and it didn’t go through.



**2\. Martyrdom.** Being “killed” (fired, in a professional context) for your purpose might be something you’re willing to risk if you’re truly committed to it. However, martyrdom doesn’t further your purpose—once you’re out of the way, people can forget about you and your purpose, and it’ll never be realized.

**3\. Self-righteousness.** If you're so vocal about your purpose and its rightness that you annoy people, they can become resistant to it for three reasons:

  1. They like to oppose things. 
  2. They've had bad experiences with self-righteous authority in the past.
  3. They can’t take any ownership of the purpose because you have it all. 



**4\. Overemphasis.** People will get tired of talking about the purpose if you bring it up too often. Only remind them of it when it’s relevant.

### Reflection Questions and Exercises

  * Reflect on the last quarter and think about when you felt in sync with your orienting purpose. What were the circumstances? How can you re-create those circumstances (or create a symbol or ritual inspired by them) to feel close to your purpose on a more regular basis?
  * Whose support do you need to achieve your purpose? What are their purposes, and do any of them have anything in common with yours?
  * If it gained you necessary allies, what parts of your purpose would you give up?
  * Reflect on a time that you chose to prioritize your values over an action that would serve your purpose, and vice versa. What insight does this give you about how to tackle an adaptive challenge you’re currently facing?
  * Do the following exercise:
    * At the top of a blank piece of paper, write your purpose. (Shortform example: Your purpose might be to raise money for a charity.)
    * Write a list of all the actions you’re taking now to serve that purpose. (Shortform example: You might hold a bake sale.)
    * Write a list of all the extreme actions you _could_ be taking to serve that purpose, but aren’t. (Shortform example: You might aggressively canvas door-to-door, being so pushy that you bully people into donating money.)
    * Write a list of actions that fall in between the actions on the previous two lists. (Shortform example: You might politely cold call potential donors.)
    * Put the lists away for a little while and then look at them again later. Do any of the actions in the last list seem doable now? Do any of the actions from the extreme list seem doable, in extreme situations?
  * Interview 10 people who share the same purpose as you and ask them what actions they’ve taken to serve the purpose, and how far they’d be prepared to go.
  * How do you choose how to make trade-offs between passions and ambitions? Tell your factions about your ambitions and passions. Tell the groups that you think would be most supportive of each first. Don’t be apologetic about any of them.
  * Which of the pitfalls listed above are you and others at your organization most likely to fall into?
