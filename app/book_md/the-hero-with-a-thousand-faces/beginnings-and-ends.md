## Beginnings and Ends

Mythology is more than just a common set of story structures that are shared across cultures. **The myths of the ancients also point us to our place in the cosmos, our role in the great movement of the universe**. Just as the monomyth we’ve explored shows the death, birth, and transformation of the _individual_ in the form of the hero, so does mythology show the workings of _all_ time and space—the origin story of the universe, and the means by which it will be destroyed and rebuilt. This is the cosmogonic cycle.

**The cosmogonic cycle can be seen as a macrocosm of the cycle of waking and sleep that all humans experience**. First is the state of unconscious deep sleep (the primordial beginnings before the creation of time and space); then there is the conscious waking state (the living, breathing world as we know it); and finally, we have the return to the unconscious (the destruction or end of the world as we know it). We repeat this cycle for all of our days on earth, just as the cosmogonic cycle turns over and over.

The cosmogonic cycle often shows a world without end, the universal round. In a version of this cycle told among the Aztecs of pre-Columbian Mexico, each of the four elements—water, earth, air, and fire—in their turn marked the end of an age of the world: the age of water ended in a flood (flood-myths are a common feature of mythological tradition); the age of earth culminated in an earthquake; the age of air finished with destruction by wind, or hurricane; and the (present) age of fire would be brought to an end by flames.

#### The Spoked Wheel of the Jains

The Jains of the Indian subcontinent believe in a particularly demonstrative example of the cosmogonic cycle. **They see time as an endless cycle, represented by a wheel with twelve spokes**. Each spoke represents an age, and the spokes are divided into two sets of six. The first set is called the descending series, during which each age gets progressively worse, with the first age of pure happiness yielding gradually (over millions of years) to the succeeding ages, during which vice and sorrow become slowly mixed in and men and women become physically smaller, live shorter lives, and have declining moral values. The second set is the ascending series, during which the opposite occurs—in each succeeding age during this cycle, happiness gradually increases, people live longer, and they become more virtuous. The wheel spins and the cycle repeats endlessly.

#### The Four Ages of the Hindu Cycle

The Hindus believe in a similar cycle of time. The first age is marked by a long period of bliss, lasting 4,800 divine years (a divine year is equal to 360 human years). In the second age, virtue is diminished—this period lasts 3,600 divine years. The third age has virtue and vice in equal proportions, and lasts 2,400 divine years. The fourth age (which Hindus believe we are living through) is one of mounting evil, lasting 1,200 divine years. Once this age ends, there will be a doomsday of fire and flood that will cleanse the earth. After a period of nothingness and void that will last for the whole length of the four ages, the cycle will begin again.

### Creation Myths

**All cultures have their creation myths—the stories that tell us how the earth was formed, how we came to be here, and what we are meant to do with our existence**. As with the heroic cycle, there are endless variations of the creation myth, but there are common elements throughout.

The universe is an emanation of some sort of divine will from a supreme creative entity. The creator first establishes the frame of the universe, the setting in which all subsequent action will take place. Next, the creator puts living creatures into the frame—often, **these creatures have the capacity for self-reproduction or contain within them both the male and female aspects** (like Adam, as we’ve seen, in the Book of Genesis).

The Maori people of New Zealand have their variation on this theme. According to their legend, in the beginning, there were two elements—Te Tumu (the male) and Te Papa (the female). The universe was an egg that contained both. When the egg burst, it created three layers of existence, one on top of the other. Te Mumu and Te Papa were at the lowest level, where they created birds, plants, and fish. After several failed attempts, they also created the first perfectly formed man, Hoatu. Eventually, the lowest level of existence became overcrowded, so the humans burrowed their way into the next two levels, taking with them plants and animals, so that man came to inhabit three dwellings. This idea of the cosmic egg is seen in many other mythological traditions, including Japan, Finland, Egypt, and Greece.

**After the creation of the initial being, there is the great division, the creation of many from one.** Sometimes, the creator actively supervises this process and directly implements the ordering of the universe. In other myths, living beings themselves direct the shaping of the world. The latter scenario usually entails a harsher, more arduous unfolding of events than the former. Often, the created being will need to war with or even slay their creator-parents in order to begin shaping the world, as in the Greek story of the Olympians overthrowing the Titans, or in the Babylonian myth of the sun-god Marduk slaying Tiamat, the terrifying personification of chaos and the abyss. In yet another Maori legend, the cosmic parents (Rangi, the Sky, and Mother Earth) lay so closely on top of one another that the children are unable to be born and escape Mother Earth’s belly. The children conspire to separate their parents, vaulting the Sky up high while pressing nurturing Mother Earth down to the ground.

**Undeveloped folk-myths from non-literate cultures often radically simplify the highly symbolic and suggestive content of the classical creation stories**. The Blackfeet of Montana attribute creation to the figure of Old Man, who simply creates the landscape and all the creatures within it in the course of his wanderings. He creates a woman and a child out of clay, who ask him whether they will eventually die or if they shall live forever. The woman decides to throw a stone into a river—if it floats, they will have eternal life; if it sinks, they will die. When the stone sinks, Old Man declares that humanity has made its choice and will be mortal.

Other folk-myths describe a god walking upon the earth and, in so doing, carving out the world’s rivers and mountains; oxen carving out the lakes with their horns; and a bird dropping the primordial egg into the sea, which births the original man, woman, and child. These tales contain thematic echoes of the great origin myths, but are much simplified and highly literal in comparison.

### The Mother of the World

**The father-creator hero passes into earthly existence through the medium of a virgin, female figure—the mother of the world**.

In Finnish mythology, the virgin daughter floats for centuries in the primordial sea, before a storm awakens life within her and causes her to become pregnant with a son, Vàinàmoinen. She floats for 700 years, unable to give birth. In this state, however, she begins the work of creation, establishing all the physical features of the world through her body. But her son remains unborn, growing into middle age, despairing of his gloomy, dark, and cramped conditions. He escapes his mother’s womb and pours out into the primordial ocean—the act of his birth is thus his own hero’s journey; he is born a hero. He then wanders through the sea for years until he plants his feet on the ground that his mother created.

**This mother-figure often gives birth to the world-savior at a time when the world is rife with disaster**. The hero is thus a being who will once again represent the divine on earth and lead the world to redemption. The mother of the world leads a life of purity (symbolized by her status as a virgin) and is uncorrupted by the sin and error of the world around her. The most famous such literary figure (to western audiences) is the Virgin Mary, who was told by an angel of God that her fate was to carry Jesus Christ the Savior in her womb through immaculate conception.

The virgin mother concept has wide currency in other mythic traditions. Early Christian missionaries were often surprised to see how easily their non-Christian converts accepted the premise of the Virgin Mary. These converts had little trouble accepting Mary’s virginity because they had their own virgin mother stories. For example, among the indigenous people of what is now Colombia in South America (where 16th-century Spanish Catholic missionaries were active), there was a belief that the sun impregnated a local girl who would then give birth to the rays of the sun, while remaining a virgin.

### Culture Heroes

Eventually, there comes a point where the gods and heroes of mythology must yield to actual historical figures. A step removed from origin stories about the creation of the cosmos, we are now dealing with the phenomenon of **culture heroes—the founders who appear at the beginning of a culture’s legendary past.** Rather than creating the universe, these figures create cultures.

Such figures are shrouded in mystery and their historicity is much-debated by historians, archaeologists, and anthropologists. Often, these are the kings whom legend tells us were themselves gods or demi-gods and used their divine status to create the great cities and kingdoms that we recognize and see today.

**The human hero is the creator of order, a monster-slayer who kills the demons that still lurk in the darkness** , holdovers from a more ancient, mythic time. The legends of the culture hero symbolize the transformation of the world out of a chaotic past and into an ordered and well-governed present. The beasts that the hero slays represent the entanglements of former times. It is also the symbolic slaying of the most noxious aspects of the father at the hands of the son (although this figure is sometimes a cruel uncle or usurper, to water down the vivid themes of patricide). In this, we see the heroic theme of transformation coming forth once again.

The Native American Blackfoot tribe tells of Kut-o-yis, who slaughtered the cruel bears and snakes that were tormenting the country (slaying one bear and one snake, each of which was about to become a mother). He then liberated his people from the belly of a sucker-fish and then cunningly defeated a series of evil hags who had been luring people to their deaths.

A story touching on similar themes is the medieval French tale of Saint Martha, who, at the behest of her people, ventures into a forest where a fearsome dragon lives. She finds the creature in the act of eating a man and immediately sprinkles holy water on it while brandishing her crucifix. The monster is pacified and gently emerges from the forest, led by Saint Martha. When they reach the village, the peasants kill the creature with stones and clubs.

In the Chinese tradition, there is the figure of Fu Hsi, the “Heavenly Emperor,” who reigned during the early third millennium BCE. He taught the Chinese people to fish, hunt, and raise domestic animals. He was also born of immaculate conception, with the body of a serpent, human arms, and the head of an ox. **Such founding figures perform superhuman work, establishing human civilizations and laying the foundation for the world as we recognize it today.**

Eventually, the world no longer needs the culture hero either. Society has been established to a sufficient degree so that now, ordinary men and women can take up the burden of sustaining civilization. **The first of this kind is an emperor or king in human form who hereafter stands as the model of good political leadership for the kingdom**. This is exemplified by the Chinese figure of Huang Ti, who reigned a few centuries after Fu Hsi. He ascended to the throne at the age of 11 and ruled for over a century, during which the Chinese state enjoyed a golden age of peace and prosperity. He introduced mathematics, shipbuilding, woodworking, money, music, and private property.

#### Return and Exile

These human culture heroes often have a miraculous childhood (despite frequently being born to lowly status) and are endowed with powers from the moment of their birth. **Their herohood is predestined, not achieved**. They have some special connection to the world of the supernatural, either through dreams or premonitions, and their story is often one of ignominious exile and glorious return. After a childhood where they overcome extraordinary obstacles, they rise out of obscurity and reveal their true character. This is essentially the theme of crucifixion, followed by resurrection.

Sargon of Akkad (founder of the Mesopotamian Akkadian Empire and an undisputed historical figure from around 2300 BCE) was, as his legend tells us, born to an obscure mother and an unknown father. After being set adrift in the Euphrates River on a basket of bulrushes, he was discovered by a shepherd and bestowed with great favor by the goddess Ishtar. This divine blessing, this endorsement from the gods was what enabled him to found the world’s first empire.

Similar origin stories of great historical figures abound, from Chandragupta, the founder of the fourth century BCE Maurya empire in India; to the early medieval pope, Gregory the Great; to the first Holy Roman Emperor, Charlemagne.

### The Lover

**The freedom and glory that the hero wins by defeating the monster is often represented in the form of a beautiful woman**. This theme shows up through many different stock characters of legend, myth, and fairy tale—the bride abducted by an overweening father (like Princess Budur), the virgin rescued from the unworthy lover. In the triumphant hero-cycles, she reigns side-by-side with the hero as world monarch. This is often shown through an arduous journey that the hero must go through before he can take the maiden to the pleasures of the marital bed.

We see this theme in the Irish legend of Cuchulainn. A glorious and beautiful youth, Cuchulainn is the nephew of Conchobar the king. The barons of the kingdom become worried that Cuchulainn will tempt their wives into infidelity with him, so they conspire to find him a wife of his own. Cuchulainn himself ventures out and finds a beautiful maiden, Emer. Her jealous father Forgall the Wily sends Cuchulainn off to learn supernatural arts from the warrior-woman Scathach, thinking that Cuchulainn will never return. His journey to the distant island where Scathach lives is arduous, but he makes it, thanks to some supernatural aid. After his training, he earns knowledge of the supernatural, marriage with the daughter of Scathach (without having to pay the traditional bride-price), the power of clairvoyance, and even sexual relations with the warrior-woman herself.

When Cuchulainn returns to the realm of Forgall, he finds the jealous father still set against him. But, having successfully come through his hero’s journey, Cuchulainn is now able to simply take Emer and marry her at the court of his uncle the king. He has claimed his prize, received his bounty.

### Death and Departure

At last, **the time comes for the death and departure of the hero.** The hero enters his period of sleep, from which he will awaken only at man’s hour of need. Alternatively, the hero walks among ordinary people, but in a concealed form.

In the Old Testament, the spectre of Death reveals himself to Abraham, telling Abraham that he wears the sins of men as a crown upon his head. But the grim visage of Death is no match for Abraham’s righteousness, and Abraham’s soul does not depart from him. Instead, God lifts Abraham’s soul up into Paradise, where he shall be free of want and worry for all time.

The Aztecs told the story of Quetzalcoatl, ruler of the ancient city of Tollan at the height of its power and prosperity. He and his people, however, are eventually defeated by the Aztecs, who wield stronger magic. Quetzalcoatl burns his dwellings and bounties behind him as he flees. Looking back at his ruined city, he weeps, and his tears erode through a rock. He passes through the countryside, creating place-names and physical features of the landscape as he goes, until he departs on a raft of serpents, bund for Tlapâllan, his original home. He has been exiled forever, a hero banished.

### The Final Crossing

The hero’s journey lives on in the rituals surrounding death, during which the living make preparations for the departed to journey safely through to the land of the dead. **Like the hero, the deceased is journeying back to the primordial state of divine knowledge and union with the creator.**

There is an early example of this idea in the Coffin Texts of Ancient Egypt, in which the dead man proclaims himself to be joined to God, declaring, “I am Atum, I who was alone; I am Re at his first appearance. I am the Great God, self-generator, Who fashioned his names, lord of gods, Whom none approaches among the gods. I was yesterday, I know tomorrow.” The Egyptian _Book of the Dead_ was entombed with the deceased to guide the soul through the perils it would face as it made its way to the afterlife, complete with spells to ward off evil spirits and special incantations to compel the god of the dead, Osiris, to open the gates.

**Of course, the ability to make this journey successfully depends upon the quality and character of the life lived by the deceased.** The soul’s journey is its own hero’s journey in microcosm, beset with dangers, hardships, and setbacks. These are time-honored elements of the world’s mythic traditions.

The Aztecs prepared the body for its transition and provided it with water and other materials to aid it in the great journey it was about to undertake and overcome the obstacles it would surely face.
