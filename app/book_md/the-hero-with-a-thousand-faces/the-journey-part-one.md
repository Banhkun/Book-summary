## The Journey, Part One: Separation

With this introduction in place, we’ll discuss each major stage of the monomyth in the hero’s journey.

### The Call to Adventure

In the first part of the monomyth, we meet our hero, our “man of destiny,” and witness their call to adventure. The call to adventure can come about through chance, even a mistake or blunder, which introduces the hero to a hidden world of possibility, guided by mysterious forces which the hero will come to understand through the course of their journey.

**A frequent device employed in mythology is that of the herald or conjurer** , the (often unlikely) figure who reveals the hero’s destiny and spurs them to action. The herald represents our subconscious, wherein all of our darkest fears are hidden. They are forcing us to confront things that we do not want to. As such, **the herald is frequently a grotesque or unpleasant-looking figure, like a frog or a beast** , or otherwise some veiled, mysterious, or unknown figure.

The hero is fascinated by the arrival of the herald. The herald represents the first conscious manifestation of the world of the subconscious. The world which the hero has known suddenly becomes devoid of value or interest—mimicking the universal experience of growing out of childhood and into the trials and adventures of our adult lives.

Sometimes the herald will reveal that the hero’s ultimate fate is to die, but in other cases the hero might be called upon to live for some higher purpose or reveal for humankind some grand religious awakening. In psychological terms, the hero is summoned to an awakening of the self, in which they will come face-to-face with their most suppressed fears and desires. But **the journey will always represent a symbolic death and rebirth of the hero** (and in some religious founding myths, like the famous crucifixion and resurrection of Christ, a _literal_ death and rebirth). The hero has outgrown their old ideals and consciousness—these must be shed so that **a new awakening can occur and a new threshold can be crossed.**

#### King Arthur and the Hart

In Arthurian legend, King Arthur encounters a great hart (an archaic Old English term for a deer) in the forest. He gives chase to the animal, vigorously riding his horse until it dies from exhaustion. Arthur then comes to a fountain, where he sets down his dead horse and becomes lost in deep thought.

While he’s sitting at the forest fountain, he hears what sounds like dozens of hounds coming toward him. But, it is not hounds—instead, it is some strange beast, the likes of which the King had never seen before. The noise of 30 hounds barking and snarling emanate from its stomach, although there is no noise while the beast drinks at the fountain. Arthur marvels at this sight: **this is his herald, his signal to begin his quest.**

#### The Arapaho Girl and the Porcupine

We also see the herald motif in a myth from the Arapaho, a Native American people who lived in what is now Colorado and Wyoming. One day, an Arapaho girl sees a porcupine near a tree. Seeking its quills, she tries to attack it, but it runs away, scurrying up the tree. The girl chases the porcupine up to the very top of the tree, but when she reaches the top, the tree lengthens and the porcupine keeps climbing up, out of her reach.

Her friends beg her to come down to safety, but it is too late—the girl is on her quest now, under the influence of the porcupine. She continues to chase the porcupine, high up into the clouds, becoming barely visible to the onlookers below. **The chase of the porcupine is the girl’s first step on her adventure.**

#### Future Buddha and the Old Man

If we revisit the story of the Buddha,**we see one of the world’s most famous calls to action**. The young prince Gautama Sakyamuni (Future Buddha) has been shielded from all knowledge of age, sickness, and death since the time of his birth—the father wants his son to assume the duties of the kingdom and not to be distracted by lofty spiritual or philosophical ideas. He wants the prince’s mind to be squarely on the concerns and experiences of the physical world, even granting him three palaces and thousands of concubines to keep his focus on secular matters.

The gods realize that the time has now come for the Future Buddha to begin his enlightenment, so they decide to send him a sign. One day, the prince ventures out and encounters the gods in the form of a decrepit old man, something he’d never been allowed to see before. He returns home, distraught after learning that everyone and everything that lives must eventually grow old. He has the same reaction upon seeing the gods in the form of a sick man one day and a dead man the next. Each time, the king increases the security around his son, trying to censor what he sees.

Finally, one day, the prince sees a well-dressed monk, created and placed there by the gods. The prince’s charioteer tells him that this is someone who has retired from the world. The prince is intrigued by the idea of following this man’s example. Thus, the seeds have been planted for **the prince’s spiritual journey and his ultimate transformation—his death and rebirth as the Future Buddha.**

### Initial Reluctance

**A common feature of the monomyth is the hero’s refusal of the call** , an initial reluctance to follow the steps of their destiny. In folk tales and myths across the world and throughout history, this refusal amounts to a selfish impulse to give up one’s narrow, immediate interests in the pursuit of spiritual awakening or even the salvation of the universe. In psychoanalytic terms,**the refusal represents the clinging to infantile needs for security**. Thus, the mother and father are the figures preventing true growth and transformation as the ego fails to develop and embrace the world outside the nursery.

The refusal can have grave consequences, both for the hero and for the wider world.

  * In _One Thousand and One Nights,_ a collection of medieval folk tales from the Middle East, a Persian city is turned to stone by the wrath of Allah—**punishment for the refusal of the people of the city to heed the call of God.**
  * In the Book of Exodus, Lot’s wife is turned into a pillar of salt for looking back on the burning cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which she had been commanded by God not to do. 
  * There is the medieval European legend of the Wandering Jew, cursed to walk the earth until Christ’s return, as penance for having taunted mankind’s redeemer on the way to his crucifixion.



But there is hope for our reluctant heroes. While some of them, like those we’ve mentioned above, are bound to their fate, others are not. Not everyone who hesitates is forever beyond salvation or has lost their opportunity to fulfill their destiny.

#### Prince Kamar al-Zaman and Princess Budur

This concept is well illustrated in the _Arabian Nights_ tale of Prince Kamar al-Zaman and Princess Budur. In it, the prince has rejected his father’s demands that he take a wife, citing **his desire to commit his life to Allah and avoid the pleasures (and sins) of the flesh.**

The sultan is advised to broach the subject with his son in the presence of a great council of state, the rationale being that the prince will surely be goaded into accepting marriage under these conditions of immense social pressure. But Kamar al-Zaman again refuses his father and insults him in front of his great ministers and viziers. Enraged, Kamar al-Zaman’s father has him imprisoned in a decrepit tower, where he is to reflect upon the injury and shame he has brought upon his family.

Simultaneously, in distant China, Princess Budur—the beautiful daughter of the emperor—is similarly refusing marriage to all suitors her father presents to her. She even threatens to kill herself with a sword if he brings up the subject of matrimony again. Like the sultan, the emperor locks his daughter up and appoints ten old women to guard her. He then sends messengers to all the kingdoms of Asia, telling the rulers that Princess Budur has gone mad.

**Both the hero and the heroine have taken the negative path and refused the call of destiny.** They are a predestined match, but it will take a miracle to bring them together.

### Otherworldly Help

Some heroes respond to the call immediately. They are then guided along the path of adventure by a supernatural helper**,** as part of their first steps along the hero-journey. This helper is the personification of destiny. Often,**this figure takes the form of an old man or old woman, like the fairy godmother, wizard, shepherd, smith, or woodsman figures of European fairy tales**. But it can also take on other forms, like that of the Virgin Mary in many Christian saints legends from the Middle Ages. In the ancient mythology of Egypt and Greece, this figure was the boatman or ferryman, the conductor of souls to the afterworld—Thoth in Egyptian lore and Hermes-Mercury in Greek legend.

**The supernatural helper is a benign, guiding figure** who protects the hero and steers them along to meet their destiny. They exist to comfort the hero and assure them that, though the way may be unsure and frightening (as all of our journeys through life will be at one time or another) they will endure and come through their adventure stronger than when they initially set out.

In the mythology of the American Indians of the southwestern United States, there is Spider Woman, a grandmotherly figure. Spider Woman assists the Twin War Gods of the Navajo in their quest to reach their father, the Sun. She warns them that they must pass four places of danger and that their father may be hostile when they reach him (the theme of unconscious desire for the mother and hatred for the father is a common one across the world’s folklore and mythology). Spider Woman gives the Twin Gods an amulet and teaches them a magical formula that will negate their enemies’ anger.

#### Maymunah

**We see the supernatural aid theme as we return to the story of Kamar al-Zaman and Budur**. A shape-shifting figure named Maymunah crawls out of an old well in the tower where Kamar al-Zaman has been locked up by the sultan (the well symbolizes the unconscious and Maymunah the flowing up of unconscious thoughts into the realm of the conscious).

Finding the prince sleeping, she is awed by his physical beauty. Flying away, Maymunah encounters another supernatural being called Dahnash, who declares that _he_ has just returned from China, where _he_ has laid eyes on the most beautiful woman in the world—none other than Princess Budur. The two spirits argue about which royal youth is fairer. Each of them brings the other to their preferred candidate’s resting-place, but they cannot decide who is more beautiful unless they see them lying side-by-side.

**Thus, these two otherworldly helpers begin the process of uniting the two fated youths** , without either the prince or princess exerting any conscious will. The helpers are moving the hand of destiny.

### Guardians at the Threshold

With this aid and guidance in hand, the hero sets off on their adventure until they come to a point where they are further away from the world of comfort and familiarity than they have ever been before. Ahead of them lies the danger of the unknown. On an individual level, **this aspect of the heroic monomyth parallels the dangers and uncertainties of growing out of childhood and away from the protection of one’s parents**.

**It is at this point that the hero meets the guardian of the threshold** , who stands between the worlds of the known and the unknown. This guardian is often a fearsome and monstrous figure, who represents our fears of leaving our comfort zone and stepping out into the world beyond. The hero must overcome this obstacle, just as **we all must overcome our fears of the unknown if we are to thrive and grow as human beings in the great adventure of life**. Only those with competence and courage can overcome the danger.

The Greek god Pan is perhaps the best-known of this type of border guard. He instilled a wild, irrational fear into those who dared to cross into his realm (this is where the word “panic” comes from). To some, Pan would frighten his victims to death. But to those who paid him proper respect and homage, Pan would bestow bounty and wisdom.

#### Sticky-Hair

A myth from India illustrates the threshold guardian story element. Returning from his military training to the city of his father, Prince Five-Weapons comes to the edge of a great forest, which he is warned not to enter. He is told by local villagers that an ogre named Sticky-Hair, who kills every man he sees, resides within.

The prince ignores these warnings and enters the forest where, sure enough, he encounters the ogre. He vows to slay the beast using his newly learned military skills and his five weapons. But the prince finds that each of the weapons merely sticks to the ogre’s hair (hence the name) when he hurls them. The prince then assaults the ogre with his bare hands and feet, only to find these, too, getting stuck in the ogre’s hair. The ogre is impressed by the prince’s bravery and asks him why he seems to lack any fear of death.

Prince Five-Weapons heartily replies that he has a thunderbolt within his belly as his final weapon—if the ogre eats him, both will perish. This thunderbolt is, in fact, the Weapon of Knowledge and the prince is none other than the Future Buddha in an earlier incarnation. The ogre is persuaded and decides to let him go. **The monster has become self-denying—the first step on the path to enlightenment.**

### Swallowed into the Unknown

Next comes one of the most potent symbols of the hero’s death and rebirth—the common motif of the hero being inside the belly of the whale. **This belly symbolizes the womb (also a temple); the darkness within represents death; and the hero’s emergence parallels the act of birth (or rebirth).**

As we mentioned above, the hero-story is always one of self-annihilation. **This obliteration of the hero’s old form and the transformation into something new** is akin to the act of a worshiper entering a temple. When we enter a sacred space—whether church, mosque, Shinto shrine, or pagan grove—we are leaving the confines of the familiar world and undergoing our own metamorphosis. Like the threshold guardians of mythology, entrances to ancient places of worship were often marked by fearsome images of gargoyles, dragons, lions, and bulls.

The Greek hero Heracles sees the city of Troy being sacked by a monster that had been sent by the angry god of the sea, Poseidon. The king ties his daughter to the sea rocks as a sacrificial offering, hoping to appease the angry deity. Heracles agrees to rescue the girl and dives into the monster’s gaping mouth. He is digested, and manages to kill the beast by hacking his way out and emerging from the belly.

Other swallowing-and-reemerging motifs occur in mythological traditions across the world. The Irish hero Finn MacCool is swallowed by a monster known as a _peist_ ; in the German fairy tale of Red Ridinghood, the heroine is devoured by a wolf; on the other side of the world, in Polynesia, Maui is consumed by his great-great-grandmother.

#### Self-Sacrifice

**These legends are also closely tied to themes of self-sacrifice and torment of the flesh**. The hero must sometimes destroy their own flesh in order to renew the world. The motif is probably most famous to Western readers from the story of the suffering of Christ on the cross. It also occurs frequently in other religious and mythological traditions, where they are killed, dismembered, and have their bodies scattered.

The ancient Egyptian hero-god Osiris is drowned in the Nile by his evil brother Set. When Osiris comes back from the dead, Set kills him again, this time dismembering the body into 14 pieces and scattering them all over Egypt.
