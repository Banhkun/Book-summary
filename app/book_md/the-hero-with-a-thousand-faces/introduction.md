## Introduction

_The Hero With a Thousand Faces_ is an exploration of the power of myth and storytelling, from the ancient world to modern times, and spanning every human culture across the world. **All peoples, and indeed, all individuals, make sense of the world they live in and grapple with the experience of living by telling stories**. Myths are the foundation of all human physical and intellectual pursuits, be they religious, economic, social, or cultural, because these myths**** tell us who we are and what destinies we are here to fulfill.

### The Composite Hero

The heroes of mythology, whether it’s King Arthur, Odysseus, the Buddha, the Chinese emperor Huang Ti, or Moses, share similar characteristics.

**They are often figures who have unique talents or gifts and hold an exalted position within their society** —they are renowned scholars, warriors, or kings. But the opposite can also be true: the archetypal, or composite hero can also start out as**an obscure figure of humble origins, on the fringes of society**. But whether they start out as prince or pauper, they set out on their journey to address some sort of need, to fill some kind of spiritual void. In simple romance tales or fairy tales, this can be nothing more than obtaining a golden ring or the hand of the fair princess, while in myths with deeper theological undertones (like the story of Christ), the hero sets out to redeem and renew the spiritual life of the entire world and save it from falling into ruin.

When the hero returns with their newly obtained powers (earned through great physical and spiritual trial), we see that**this spark of divinity was within the hero the whole time** —but it could only be discovered through the journey. We see this in tales where the hero is revealed to have been “the king's son,” and is now ready to assert his powers for the good of the kingdom. This speaks to the inherently introspective nature of the hero’s journey: **the hero symbolizes the godly potential within all of us.**

### The Mythological Template

Although the settings and plots of myths vary widely across time and space, from the Homeric poems of ancient Greece to the enlightenment of the Buddha in India to the Christian story of the birth and resurrection of Christ, they all share a certain core set of themes, a standard template. **This template is the mythological adventure of the hero** —someone who sets out on a journey, often with the help of a sage guide and allies along the way, overcomes obstacles, and achieves some sort of transformation which he or she then shares with the world. This can either be the sharing of a literal bounty (bringing abundance and prosperity back to a hungry and impoverished community) or a deeper, more **spiritual redemption of a wayward and fallen people.**

The point in space and time where divine wisdom is imparted to the physical world is known as the World Navel. It is the center of the universe, the spot from which all life grows: **it is the portal between our world and the world of the divine**. It is represented in a variety of ways across religious and mythological traditions and throughout time—it is Rome in Catholicism, Mecca in Islam, or the Immovable Spot in the Buddha legend—but the idea is always the same.

This transformation of the hero comes from tapping into a source of deep spiritual wisdom, which is often revealed to have been within the soul or psyche of the hero from the beginning. Thus, **the archetypal hero’s journey involves a spiritual awakening, an attainment of some piece of the gods**. We see this, for example, in the story of Prometheus, who ascended to heaven and stole fire from the gods, which he then imparted to the world. We also see this in the myth of Jason, who sailed through the Clashing Rocks and defeated a dragon to obtain the Golden Fleece, which enabled him to win back his throne from a usurper.

The essential feature, the basic common denominator of mythology, is the _monomyth._ It is the core structure of the myths, the journey that all heroes must undergo. It involves **three rites of passage—separation, initiation, return.** From the myths of the ancient Egyptians and the medieval Arthurian legend to the folk-tales of the native Maoris of New Zealand, the pattern of the hero’s journey usually follows this cycle: a separation from the world he or she has always known (embarking on the quest), gaining some spiritual or other-worldly power, and a return in which they share the boon of the new power with humanity.

Let’s discuss two examples of myths to illustrate the pattern.

#### The Struggle of the Buddha

In the story of the Struggle of the Buddha, the founding story of Buddhism, we see all three elements of the monomyth. **First, we see separation**. The prince Gautama Sakyamuni (also known as Siddartha Gautama and the Future Buddha) escapes his ancestral home and cuts off his royal locks. He assumes the costume of a monk, wandering through the world and living a life of extreme austerity and asceticism. During this time, he transcends to the eight stages of meditation.

**Next, we witness initiation**. One day, he tosses an empty bowl into a river, and sees that the bowl flows _upstream_. This is the signal that his time of ultimate enlightenment is near at hand. He journeys to the Tree of Enlightenment, where he meets Kama-Mara, the god of love and death. Kama-Mara attempts to dislodge him from the tree, deploying all manner of fearsome monsters and deities at Gautama. But in repelling all of Mara’s onslaughts, the Future Buddha acquires knowledge of his previous existences, the power of omniscience, and a divine understanding of the chain of causation. He becomes Buddha, “The Enlightened One.”

**Finally, we see return**. After this victory, Buddha initially despairs of being able to communicate his message. But the god Brahma dissuades him from this pessimism and urges him to teach gods and men the path of enlightenment. Thus, Buddha returns to the cities and the hustle and bustle of the world from which he had originally come to share the gift of his knowledge and wisdom with the world.

#### The Legend of Moses

The cycle also shows itself in a story more familiar to Western audiences, that of Moses in the Old Testament. After the Exodus from Egypt, Moses leads the Israelites through the wilderness of Sinai (departure). Moses ascends Mount Sinai to receive the Tables of the Law from God, who commands Moses to share them with the Israelites, the chosen people (initiation).

When Moses returns to share the word of God with the people, God shakes the bounds of the world, unleashing fire, earthquake, storm, and hail. God appears from all directions, to demonstrate His all-knowing, all-seeing power. The crowd gathers to see the spectacle, but there is room for all—God is one with the people Israel (return).

### The Psychoanalyst as Modern Mystic

In ancient times, soothsayers, storytellers, and mystics helped people and societies make sense of the world they inhabited and of major life events by creating allegories and myths. These stories represented the conscious expression of unconscious fears and desires. Thus, myths were the outward manifestations of inner conflicts and desires, with**the storyteller bridging the gap between the conscious and the unconscious.**

In modern times, this role is played by the psychoanalyst. By analyzing and interpreting our dreams, psychoanalysts help give meaning and structure to our unspoken fears and desires and, in the process, help us gain a deeper—and more spiritual—understanding of ourselves, our world, and our relationship to our fellow human beings and the cosmos.

The journey of the mythological hero, the passage through trial and the entering of a new realm of consciousness, is nothing if not a grand act of introspection.**The hero touches the metaphorical (sometimes literal) face of God and is so transformed**. Likewise, when we open ourselves up on the therapist’s couch, we are going into the furthest corners of the mind—we are, in effect, undergoing our own hero’s journey. In this way,**the power of mythology stretches its reach over the millennia and into our own time and place.**
