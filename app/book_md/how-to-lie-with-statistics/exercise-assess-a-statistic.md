## Exercise: Assess a Statistic

There are five questions to ask when you encounter a statistic to assess its legitimacy.

* * *

Consider this statistic published by a company selling blue wallpaper: “According to a survey of parents conducted by our company, an average of 97.68% of infants cry when in a room with green-colored wallpaper. Therefore, most infants hate living in homes with green wallpaper.” What is the original source of this stat? How might this affect its reliability?

How was the data that produced the stat collected? (For example, did interviewers poll people, was an online survey advertised on social media, and so on?) Can you think of any reason people who participated might have given untrue answers?

What missing information may be relevant to interpreting the statistic?

Could any of the words surrounding the statistic have more complicated meanings than what’s in the dictionary? What could they also mean?

Does the figure seem right? (For example, does it contradict common sense or have any obvious fact-checking errors?) Why or why not?
