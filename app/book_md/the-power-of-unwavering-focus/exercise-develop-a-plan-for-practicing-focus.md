## Exercise: Develop a Plan for Practicing Focus

Dandapani argues that mastering focus requires a long-term commitment to practice. This exercise will provide an opportunity to create your plan for practicing focus.

* * *

Write down five activities that you have to do every day. Then put an asterisk next to one that youâ€™d like to use to practice focusing every day.

Dandapani says that you must track your progress to keep yourself accountable when practicing focus. Come up with a strategy for tracking your progress and write it down. For example, you could mark your activities on a calendar and then score yourself at the end of every week.
