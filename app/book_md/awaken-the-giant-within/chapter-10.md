## Chapter 10: Change Your Mindset With a Mental Challenge

**It’s time to put what you’ve learned in this summary so far to use with a 10-day mental challenge that will help you adopt empowering mental habits to transform your life in a positive way.** Creating the life you want requires that you don’t just achieve your goals _sometimes_ , but that you reach your goals _consistently_ —and the way to do that is by adopting new, positive habits. After all, your _current_ mental and behavioral habits created the life you have now, which you’re unsatisfied with. Therefore, improving your life will require you to change some of those habits. Even if certain habits helped you succeed in the past, they need to evolve with you on your path to higher levels of success.

The 10-day mental challenge aims to help you:

  1. Become aware of your habitual negative thought patterns. Only when you’re aware of them can you begin to dismantle them. 
  2. Condition your brain to find new, empowering thoughts to replace the old, disempowering ones. This includes learning to focus on solutions instead of problems.
  3. Enjoy a boost of confidence from the immediate improvements in your life. When you start to feel the success of taking control of your life through new, positive habits, you’ll be inspired to continue. 
  4. Establish new standards, habits, and expectations that will continually improve your life. For example, you’ll learn to enjoy and appreciate the process of addressing and resolving problems, with the understanding that challenges you face are valuable and serve a purpose to guide you toward a better life. Learning to take pleasure in this process will enable you to enjoy life since challenges are inevitable, and if you allow them to frustrate you then you’ll always be upset. 



First, let’s go over the rules of the challenge. Then, we’ll discuss common obstacles to making these mental shifts. Finally, we’ll explore some tips for success.

### Create New Habits With the 10-Day Mental Challenge

This mental challenge is a mental and emotional cleanse that will kick start your positive life transformation by training you to be disciplined with your focus, thoughts, and emotions. The rules are:

  1. **Begin each day with the Morning Power Questions** listed in Chapter 6, and end each day with the Evening Power Questions (as a reminder, these are short sets of questions you should ask yourself each day to reinforce an empowered pattern of thinking). Additionally, when you face challenges, immediately ask yourself the problem-solving questions from that chapter, including “What’s good about this problem?” and “What still needs improvement?”
  2. **Don’t allow yourself to indulge in any disempowering thoughts** , emotions, words, questions, or metaphors for 10 consecutive days. If you notice yourself indulging in a disempowering thought or emotion—or focusing on a problem instead of the solution—change your focus and move on; don’t berate yourself for slipping. However, if you continue to dwell on the negative for more than one or two minutes, restart the challenge the following morning. Even if you’re on Day 9, you must start over if you break this rule.



Anytime you experience disempowering thoughts or emotions, immediately change your state using any of the strategies we’ve discussed, such as:

  * Changing your focus 
  * Changing your physiology
  * Asking yourself a different question about the situation
  * Using the six steps of NAC
  * Using empowering vocabulary and metaphors



Be cautious not to _ignore_ your problems—rather, the goal is to embody a more empowered state, which will make you more effective at _addressing_ the problems. A good rule of thumb (not just during the mental challenge) is to **spend no more than 10 percent of your time thinking about problems, and to spend at least 90 percent of your time focused on solutions and empowering thoughts.** Above all, don’t let small things upset you—and remember that nearly every problem you encounter is small in the grand scheme of things.

#### Overcome Bad Habits

When you start the mental challenge, **you may be surprised to discover just how many negative and disempowering thoughts you routinely have.** People often allow these kinds of thoughts to persist because:

  1. They believe dwelling on the negative can be helpful. For example, people often focus on a problem and its worst-case outcome because they believe that this will push them to take action.
  2. They’re too lazy to make the changes necessary to create the life they want. 
  3. They’re afraid of change and uncertainty, and so they remain in the familiarity and mediocrity of their present, negative circumstances.
  4. Their habits keep them stuck in disempowering patterns. 



However, these negative thought patterns are not conducive to problem-solving and action-taking, and they’re likely to paralyze you instead of motivating you.

This mental challenge will push you beyond laziness, fear, and the force of your habits to create transformative, enduring change in your life. You’ll establish a habit of remaining in an empowered state by using positive words and focusing on solutions.

#### Set Yourself Up for Success

Only take on this challenge if you’re absolutely committed to carrying it through to completion. **This challenge is difficult, and if you commit to it, you must commit to the discipline it requires** to break out of the habits and fear that have been dictating your thoughts up to this point. Increase your chance of success in the challenge by:

  * Telling people around you that you’re committing to this challenge, and asking that they keep you accountable
  * Enlisting a friend to do the challenge with you, so that you can keep each other accountable
  * Journaling about your experiences each day during the challenge, including the obstacles you face and the ways you overcome them
  * Adopting a habit of reading something insightful and nourishing each day
