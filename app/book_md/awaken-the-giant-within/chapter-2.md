## Chapter 2: Overcome Harmful Neuro-Associations

Given the importance of decisions in taking control of our lives, why do we often decide _not_ to do things that we know would benefit us? Why do we snack on chips when we know fruit is better for us? Why do we put off working on our resumes even though we constantly complain about our jobs?

The answer lies in our pain and pleasure associations. **The driving force behind all of our decisions—and, thus, our actions—is the motivation to _avoid pain_ and _seek pleasure_.** For instance, when we indulge in a junk-food habit, it’s because we gain pleasure from munching on salty snacks, and we associate pain with eating veggies instead. There are different forms of pain (such as inconvenience and humiliation) and pleasure (such as ecstasy and comfort). Generally, _fear of pain_ or loss is a stronger motivator than the _desire for pleasure_ or gain—in other words, you’ll continue to eat junk food if your love of chips isn’t as strong as your aversion to healthy food.

In this chapter, we’ll discuss the ways that **pain and pleasure associations like this can prevent you from reaching your goals and living the life you want.** First, let’s look at what, exactly, these associations are and how they form.

### Trace Your Pain and Pleasure Associations Back to Your Brain

How do we come to associate certain things with pain and other things with pleasure? It all starts in your brain: **Every time you experience a positive or negative emotion, your brain links the emotion with other aspects of the experience, creating a “neuro-association.”**

Your brain’s billions of neurons (brain cells) take in sensory information and work together to process that sensory data. In this process, your neurons communicate by sending signals to each other via neural pathways, which are physical connections in your brain. Those neural pathways create neuro-associations by linking your emotions and sensations from a particular experience. As a result, your future thoughts about that activity or subject automatically trigger the same emotion (unless you recondition yourself, which we’ll explain in the next chapter). For example, if you go to a new restaurant with a group of friends and enjoy a great evening out, you’re likely to associate positive feelings with that restaurant in the future—even if your enjoyment had more to do with your friends’ company than the food or service.

Furthermore, **the more you repeat the same or similar experiences, the stronger those neural pathways and neuro-associations become—and the more automatic and habitual that behavior becomes.** When it comes to pain and pleasure associations, the habitualized behavior is your response to a particular stimulus (such as feeling happy when you think about the restaurant you and your friends visited).

In other contexts, deeply embedded neural pathways allow you to perform habitual tasks without thinking about each step. (Shortform example: Strong neural pathways allow you to drive a car without consciously thinking about it. The first time you drive, you have to think about each action, from how much pressure you’re putting on the gas pedal to how often you’re checking your rearview mirror. After you’ve been driving a while and the relevant neural pathways are reinforced, all of those actions become second nature.)

Since they’re based on experiences, your neuro-associations, and the behaviors that they trigger, are entirely unique to you. For example, while you may associate pleasure and joy with the song “Jack and Diane” because it evokes happy memories of your mom singing along to it in the car, your friend could associate the same song with painful heartbreak because it was playing on the radio when her high school sweetheart dumped her. Your distinct associations will then prompt you and your friend to behave differently when each of you hears or thinks about the song.

### Beware of Neuro-Associations That Reinforce Negative Behaviors

As we’ve noted, neuro-associations help you to habitualize your behaviors, which, on one hand, can be a tremendous benefit when those associations and behaviors are _empowering_. On the other hand,**your neuro-associations can also reinforce and form habits of _disempowering_ behaviors.** Let’s take a look at the various ways in which neuro-associations can cause problems by:

  * Influencing poor decision-making due to pain and pleasure associations
  * Causing self-sabotaging behavior due to mixed associations (having both positive _and_ negative associations with the same thing)
  * Creating bad habits by embedding poor behavior in neural pathways
  * Causing disempowering behavior due to mistakes in your brain’s formation of associations



#### Recognize How Your Neuro-Associations Cause Poor Decision-Making

Not only do your pain and pleasure neuro-associations influence all of your decisions—by motivating you to avoid pain and seek pleasure—but they are also strong enough to withstand any logic that contradicts them. This means that **your associations can drive you to engage in self-destructive behavior and poor decision-making against logic and your better judgment.** Furthermore, since neuro-associations are subconscious, you often can’t figure out _why_ you keep acting illogically.

For example, if you watched your parents live lavishly off credit—and you never saw them deal with any negative consequences from the habit—you may associate credit with happiness and luxury. This association may, without you even realizing it, cause you to rely heavily on your credit card as you seek the pleasure you derive from using it, despite any advice and information from your financial advisor.

Ultimately, if you don’t understand the power of pain and pleasure associations to motivate your every action, including your decisions, **you can’t take control over your behavior, and you end up perpetually _reacting_ to things around you instead of _acting_ of your own will.**

#### Understand That Mixed Neuro-Associations Cause Self-Sabotaging Behaviors

Sometimes the problem isn’t _one_ disempowering neuro-association but rather a harmful _combination_ of mixed associations—as in, you associate both pain and pleasure with the same thing. **When your brain gets these mixed signals, it becomes confused and can trigger self-sabotaging behaviors that are partially driven by positive associations and partially by negative ones.** For example, many people have mixed associations about money:

  * On the positive side, they associate money with security, luxury, control, and the ability to help people.
  * On the negative side, they associate money with greed, complacency, shallowness, and fear of being judged or manipulated by others. 



If you have mixed associations with money, your positive neuro-associations with money may motivate you to increase your income by picking up a side job. At the same time, your negative neuro-associations may sabotage your efforts by making you reluctant to follow through and actually pick up shifts at your side gig.

#### Know That Bad Habits Are Wired Into Your Brain

As we talked about, your neuro-associations can subconsciously influence your _active decision-making_. Additionally, **you can develop neural pathways that turn a negative emotion or action into a habit, causing you to engage in that behavior _without even thinking_ about it. **This is why willpower alone is inadequate to make lasting change, because it does not eliminate the neuro-associations driving your behavior.

Although it’s difficult to fight against the force of that habit to implement a more positive behavior, it is possible. We’ll explain in detail how to recondition these bad habits in the next chapter. A positive note: Research shows that when you stop indulging in a frequent behavior, the neural pathway actually weakens, reducing its power over you.

#### Be Aware That Your Brain Can Make Mistakes When Creating Neuro-Associations

We’ve talked about several ways your neuro-associations can cause problems, but sometimes the root of the issue is that the neuro-association itself is inaccurate. **Your brain can make mistakes when it interprets your experiences, creating _false_ associations that reinforce bad behavior or impede positive behavior.**

When you experience significant pain or pleasure, your brain looks for a cause of this feeling based on these criteria:

  1. **Is there something _unique_ or unusual about the circumstances** that brought on the pain or pleasure?
  2. **What was happening _at the same time_** that the pain or pleasure occurred? If the two things happened simultaneously, it’s likely that one caused the other. 
  3. **Does the unique, simultaneous thing happen _consistently_ with the feeling of pain or pleasure?** If your brain detects a recurring pattern, then it will conclude that it has found the cause of your emotion. 



Although these criteria are fairly logical, they’re not fool-proof: Your brain can easily falsely generalize how consistently a potential cause is linked to the emotion. (Shortform example: If you get a stomach ache after eating cheese two or three times, your brain may assume that the cheese is the cause, when it could be merely a coincidence.) Given how powerful associations are in your decision-making and behavior, there’s a real danger that **false neuro-associations can lower your quality of life because they cause you to act based on wrong information.** This is why it’s critical to your growth and success that you evaluate and question your associations.
