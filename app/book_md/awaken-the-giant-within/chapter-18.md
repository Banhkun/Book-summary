## Chapter 18: Day 3: Master Your Relationship

Today, you’ll practice mastering your relationship—specifically, your romantic or domestic relationship—because **relationships are not only essential to your well-being, but they are also powerful forces in influencing your beliefs, values, and character.** Furthermore, you’ll enjoy the successful and empowered life you’re creating even more if you have someone to share it with.

In this chapter, we’ll explain _how_ to maintain a healthy relationship, and then you’ll have a chance to put that knowledge to use with today’s assignment.

### Abide by the Six Keys to Healthy Relationships

Before explaining today’s exercise, let’s discuss the six keys to maintaining a healthy, long-lasting relationship:

**Key #1: Communicate Your Rules**

Minimize conflict in your relationship by discovering the other person’s values and rules. As we discussed in Part 2, any time you’re upset with someone, it’s because you feel that they have broken your rules—even if you never _articulated_ those rules. So, take time to share your rules and to find out about your partner’s rules, and agree to both make an effort to meet each other’s rules.

**Key #2: Focus on Giving**

Focus on what you can _give_ in your relationship, not what you can _gain_ from it. Many people mistakenly enter into relationships in hopes that they will find the missing key to their happiness. However, this approach hurts the relationship along with your chances of finding happiness within it.

**Key #3: Don’t Let Problems Fester**

Address problems in your relationship early, before they grow into larger issues. The most powerful antidote to problems is early, frequent communication. Explain your rules, use Transformational Vocabulary, and interrupt your pattern when you get into arguments that devolve into senseless bickering.

If you don’t address problems when they’re small, they can evolve into harmful patterns as they go through these four stages:

  1. **Resistance** : It’s common to reach a point in your relationship when you feel bothered by something that your partner says or does. At this stage, it’s critical to let your partner know how you’re feeling in order to prevent your feelings from graduating to the next stage. 
  2. **Resentment** : If you haven’t addressed your feelings of resistance, they compound and turn into resentment, which causes you to feel angry with your partner for the things they say or do. Resentment impedes intimacy by creating an emotional barrier that only grows unless you address it. 
  3. **Rejection** : If you allow your resentment to build, you soon start looking for ways to reject your partner. You find opportunities to attack your partner and you think that everything they do is annoying. At this point, you begin to separate yourself physically as well as emotionally. 
  4. **Repression** : To cope with the pain of your disintegrating relationship, you eventually repress your feelings and disconnect. Although this eliminates your pain, it also kills the passion and love in your relationship. At this point, your partner essentially becomes your roommate. 



**Key #4: Prioritize Your Relationship**

Make your relationship one of your top priorities. Relationships require consistent effort to remain healthy, and they suffer if they’re neglected for too long. Don’t allow your relationship to run on autopilot while you attend to the pressures of daily life.

**Key #5: Focus on Your Relationship’s Future, Not Its End**

Focus each day on improving your relationship, and avoid dwelling on your fear that the relationship could one day end. If you focus on the relationship’s potential demise, you’ll unconsciously move in that direction by adopting self-sabotaging behaviors. Furthermore, never threaten to leave unless you’re truly considering breaking up. Raising the threat of leaving puts both your and your partner’s focus on a potential breakup rather than a resolution.

**Key #6: Consistently Reinforce Your Positive Emotions**

Reinforce your feelings of love, intimacy, attraction, and appreciation for your partner every day. Remind yourself of the reasons you’re with this person. Ask yourself how you got so lucky to share your life with this person. To maintain your spark and prevent stagnation, constantly look for ways to surprise and share special moments with your partner.

### Assignment: Commit to Nurturing Your Relationship

Abiding by the six keys above will help you maintain a healthy relationship, and today’s exercise kickstarts and supports those efforts:

  1. Talk to your partner about what each of you values most in a relationship, and share each of your rules for those values. 
  2. **Commit to prioritizing the health of your relationship over winning arguments.** Remember this especially when you get caught up in the heat of an argument and you feel the urge to prove that you’re right and your partner’s wrong. When you catch yourself doing this, disrupt your pattern, stop the discussion, and resume it after you’ve cooled off. 
  3. Brainstorm with your partner to come up with a pattern disruption that you’ll both use when you either or both of you become really upset. Use something strange or funny so that, when you deploy it in the middle of an argument, it will make you smile and ease the tension, even if just for a moment. 
  4. **When you notice yourself feeling resistance toward your partner, immediately communicate your feelings.** Use Transformational Vocabulary to ease the intensity of your feelings. 
  5. Prioritize regular date nights every one to two weeks, and take turns planning imaginative, romantic dates. 
  6. Share at least one three-minute kiss each day.
