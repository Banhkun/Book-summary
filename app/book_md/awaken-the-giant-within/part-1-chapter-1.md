## Part 1 | Chapter 1: Harness Your Power to Create the Life You Want

Just about everyone has dreamed of the life they want. However, most people become so bogged down with daily obligations and routines that they eventually stop pursuing their dreams and give up any hope of meaningfully shaping their destinies.

Life coach and self-help guru Tony Robbins wants to restore your dreams and give you the tools to achieve them. He believes **you have the power to create your destiny by mastering your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.** In this summary, through empowering insights and exercises to help you put the principles to practice, you’ll gain the tools to optimize every aspect of your life, from your relationships to your finances.

The principles and practices in the coming chapters can produce meaningful changes in your life—and they often require only small adjustments, such as swapping out just one word in your vocabulary, or changing one belief that’s holding you back. These are the “leverage points” in your life, where minimal effort can create transformational results. While many people fail to reach their dreams because they divide their attention and effort among too many things, you’ll be on your way to success as you learn to identify these leverage points and direct all of your energy and resources toward mastering them.

Robbins’s own success is proof that his methods work: In less than 10 years, he went from working as a janitor, being broke, feeling lonely, and being overweight to becoming a motivational speaker and drawing crowds of thousands of people. His transformation began when he started reflecting on how he could take control of his life immediately, learn more about improving his quality of life, and share that knowledge with others. Since then, his advice has helped people facing all kinds of challenges—from drug addiction to the threat of divorce.

In four parts, this summary will teach you the principles and practices to transform your life and the world around you:

  1. In Part 1, you’ll acquire the tools to take control of your thoughts and emotions, which dictate your behavior and shape your life.
  2. In Part 2, you’ll learn how to leverage the tools from Part 1 to control your Master System, which determines how you interpret and react to life. 
  3. In Part 3, you’ll kickstart your life transformation with a seven-day challenge. 
  4. In Part 4, you’ll learn how to apply the self-improvement skills you’ve learned to benefit those around you.



In the following chapters of Part 1,**we’ll talk about the elements that are key to creating change** , **and how to alter these elements to unlock positive changes in your life.** Specifically, we’ll discuss:

  * How decisions shape your life
  * How subconscious associations (called neuro-associations) dictate how you experience and react to situations and events 
  * How to change your neuro-associations to improve your life
  * How your beliefs influence your thoughts and behaviors
  * How to use your body and your focus to control your mental-emotional-physiological state, so that you can always feel the way you want
  * How to control your focus in an empowering way through the questions you ask yourself and the words and metaphors you habitually use
  * How to interpret your emotions and use them to inform positive change in your life
  * How to set and pursue goals that inspire you 
  * How to kickstart your life transformation with a 10-day mental challenge



(Shortform note: For improved clarity, we have reorganized some information from the book.)

Since this book is all about making positive changes in your life, we’ll start by discussing the principles of change and recommending a lifelong, incremental approach to improving your life. Later in this chapter, we’ll talk about how to implement these changes through decision-making.

### Apply the Principles of Change

Before we discuss _how_ to create change, first acknowledge that _you need to_ make some strategic changes. **Your current thoughts and behaviors have produced the life you have now, so you can’t expect to get different results as long as you continue to follow the same patterns.** Whether you’re an individual looking to improve your life, the head of a company seeking to make the organization successful, or a government leader trying to raise your country’s international profile, the basic principles of change are the same:

  1. **Raise your standards.** The standards you set dictate your aspirations, your expectations of yourself, and what you’re willing to tolerate. This book will help you identify what your current standards are and determine what they _need_ to be to create your ideal life. 
  2. **Believe in yourself.** No matter how much you raise your standards, you won’t reap the benefits if you don’t _believe_ that you can reach them. Your beliefs dictate what you can and can’t do, and what’s possible and impossible. If you believe you can do something, then you will find a way to do it—you’ll dig deep, push ahead, and reach your standards. This book will help you identify your current beliefs, determine which beliefs are helping you, and change the beliefs that are holding you back. 
  3. **Adopt new strategies.** Your strategies for achieving your goals determine how efficiently and effectively you meet your high standards. While you’ll likely develop some of your own strategies, this book will also provide some tried-and-tested approaches. One of the most effective strategies is to find a mentor who’s achieved what you’re striving to do and use their knowledge and experiences as a foundation for your own journey. 



#### Make Small, Consistent Changes

Throughout this summary, you’ll be learning insights and tools that will empower you to change your life. While this is exciting and liberating, it can also be overwhelming. Rather than trying to do everything at once, **commit to constant and never-ending improvement**(CANI!™).

The key to CANI! is to consistently take actions to make small improvements. On one side of the spectrum, this prevents you from trying to take on too much at once—on the other end of the spectrum, it prevents you from stagnating. **Over time, these incremental improvements compound to produce incredible results.**

CANI! can even change the way you look at failure. Committing to CANI! means constantly looking for ways to improve yourself and your life, and a failure in some area of your life provides valuable feedback that your current approach isn’t working. This creates a critical experience and an opportunity to improve by altering your flawed approach.

Although in this summary you’ll gain a lot of knowledge about how to take control of your life _now_ , **you’ll also encounter opportunities to improve yourself throughout life. Your ultimate success depends on your long-term commitment to CANI!—** in your personal life, finances, health, relationships, work, and spirituality.

To reinforce your commitment to CANI!, ask yourself these three questions each night:

  1. What did you learn today? Learning is essential to personal growth and improvement. Once you establish a habit of reviewing what you’ve learned, you’ll start actively looking for learning opportunities. 
  2. What did you enjoy? Consistently improving yourself will continually increase your enjoyment of life. 
  3. How did you make a contribution or improvement? Contributing to the well-being of others not only improves their lives but also makes you a better person. Acknowledge your achievement when you give back to others or make improvements in your own life. 



### Shape Your Destiny Through Decisions

The first step in taking control of your life is deciding to make a change. **When you make a decision about what you want, you’re making a commitment to do anything necessary to bring that vision to fruition.** This is the Ultimate Success Formula:

  1. Decide what you want to accomplish.
  2. Take steps to achieve it.
  3. Assess how effective your approach is.
  4. Alter your strategy until you reach your goal.



Decision-making is like a muscle—you have to use it and strengthen it. Follow these steps to keep this muscle in tip-top shape and harness the transformative power of decisions:

  1. **Remember the power of decisions.** Each decision—no matter how small—sets into motion a series of actions and events that ultimately shape your life. The best part is that you can make a decision anytime, so when you feel helpless or overwhelmed, remember that you can make a decision to change something. 
  2. **Know that making swift decisions and actioning them is hard, but necessary.** Make your decision wisely, but don’t mull over it endlessly; if you think about it for too long, you’re likely to lose your conviction and sway more easily even after you’ve made the decision. Be clear about the action that will flow from your decision, and immediately take a first step toward manifesting it. 
  3. **Make a lot of decisions.** Strengthen your decision-making muscle by using it often. Start right now with decisions you’ve avoided making. Once you get started, you’ll feel liberated and energized, which will inspire you to make even more decisions. 
  4. **Learn from your successful _and_ failed decisions. **Instead of allowing failures to deter you from moving forward, consider them lessons in better future decision-making. 
  5. **Commit to your decisions, but be flexible in your strategies.** When you make a decision, you’re committing to a _destination_ , but the _route_ you take can change. You may find that you only know one route when you make the decision, but, over time, you discover a better way to get there. Keep your mind open to different approaches. 
  6. **Enjoy your decision-making power.** Decisions are powerful and empowering. They can be difficult, and sometimes they don’t turn out the way you expect, but making decisions is essential to shaping your destiny. 



#### Take Control of Your Destiny With Three Key Decisions

No matter your circumstances, there are three critical decisions that you make constantly—whether or not you realize it—which impact what you notice, how you feel, what you do, and who you become. **Controlling these three decisions is the first step in controlling your life and your destiny:**

  1. Decide what you focus on.
  2. Decide what certain things mean to you. 
  3. Decide what you’re doing to produce the results you want. 



If you’re not living the life you want, change the way you’re making these three decisions moment-to-moment.

(Your brain actually has a Master System for decision-making, which determines what you do, how you feel, and how you shape your life. In Part 2, we’ll explore the five elements of this system and explain how to optimize each one to create the life you want.)

#### Don’t Avoid Decisions

Although the road to change begins with a _decision_ , many people never take this first step because they believe their lives are shaped by their _circumstances_. These people ride along the river of life without making any active decisions to change course. They go wherever the current of life takes them, and they end up feeling out of control. Robbins calls this state of living **Niagara Syndrome.**

When you suffer from Niagara Syndrome, you spend all your energy trying not to let the current crash you into rocks, and you have no resources left to make proactive plans for your future. You may not even realize you’re being pulled along until you’re about to go over the edge of a waterfall—and by then, it’s too late to fight the current.

There are a number of reasons why people develop Niagara Syndrome and avoid making decisions:

**1) They’ve made so few real decisions in life that they struggle to make even simple choices** , such as what to have for dinner. This is a symptom of weak decision-making muscles: Avoiding some decisions creates a snowball effect that causes people to avoid even more decisions. As with any other muscle weakness, the solution to this problem is to practice by making decisions at every opportunity.

**2) They’re afraid of making the wrong decision.** Mistakes and failures are inevitable—instead of lamenting them or trying to avoid them through indecision, learn from them. Failures lead to experiences, which build good judgment and lay the groundwork for successful future decisions. When you face failures in the short term, persist and keep your focus on the long-term goal.

As you build your decision-making muscles and learn to embrace mistakes, instead of viewing challenges as _potential failures_ , you’ll see them as _opportunities_ to make critical decisions.

**3) They think about decisions loosely, instead of seeing them as commitments.** As a result, when they think they’re making a decision, they’re really only making a casual resolution. When you make a true decision, you cut yourself off from any other possibility. For example, when an alcoholic decides to be sober, she doesn’t consider having even one drink. That commitment gives you clarity and focus, which are empowering.

**4) They don’t know how they’ll achieve what they’ve decided to do** , so they avoid commitment.**** When you make a decision, don’t worry about the _how_. Trust that, if you’re truly committed to your decision, you’ll find a way to manifest it.

Even if you avoid making decisions for any of these reasons, your inaction is actually a decision in itself:**Namely, the decision to take a passive role in shaping your life and allow external factors to dictate your actions.** Don’t fall into this trap: Instead, take an active role in your life and make decisions that will take you where you want to be.
