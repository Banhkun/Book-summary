## Chapter 14: Build Your Beliefs With References

In addition to your values and rules, your references are a critical aspect of your Master System. Recall from Part 1 that your references hold up your beliefs because they are experiences or imaginings that serve as evidence to _support_ your beliefs.

**The way in which you select, interpret, and organize your references determines whether they’ll empower or disempower you.** For example, one cancer survivor can use the painful experiences of undergoing treatment and feeling isolated from healthy family and friends as proof that life is difficult and unfair. Alternatively, another cancer survivor can draw on references of her friends’ and family’s love and support and her eventual remission to support the belief that life is miraculous and full of second chances.

**To improve your life, select and organize your references in empowering ways, which will support empowering beliefs and behaviors.** In this chapter, we’ll explain:

  * That there are different types of references, and that some are well-suited to support certain types of beliefs
  * How to expand your library of empowering references



### Understand the Different Types of References

Let’s look at the different types of references and how you can use each to empower you:

**Lived experiences are powerful references because you have the memory of feeling the pain or pleasure that came with each experience.** Since life is full of ups and downs, you probably have experiences that could support either an empowering or disempowering belief in any situation—you just need to choose carefully. For example, if you flubbed a presentation at work, you may find memories of times when you’ve made mistakes and fallen short in the past, which would support a belief that you are consistently incompetent. Alternatively, you could choose to empower yourself through references of all the times you excelled at work and in other areas of your life, which support a belief that you are highly competent and merely had a misstep today.

**Your imagination is a critical source of empowering references because it’s not limited by what’s _already happened_ , but rather makes what _could happen_ possible.** Gather references from things that you imagine so vividly that it feels like it actually happened or that it could happen, and use these to support empowering beliefs about what _could_ be. For example, athletes often visualize themselves successfully running plays, scoring points, and winning games—all of which helps them to make those visions a reality when it’s game time.

**Use other people’s experiences as references.** Books, poems, movies, television, podcasts, seminars, and other media can provide references you may not have encountered or considered on your own. For example, if you want to make a career change late in life, learning about how someone else close to your age successfully made this shift could provide a reference to support your belief that you can do it. Alternatively, you can use other people’s experiences as “contrasting references” to put things into perspective in your own life. On one hand, you can view the tragedies that befall so many people—and the inspiring ways they rise above them—as proof that your problems are minor and manageable by comparison. On the other hand, you can use other people’s incredible achievements as contrasting references that push you to strive for more.

**Use faith as a reference when you don’t have any firsthand experiences that are pertinent, you don’t know of anyone else’s experiences that you could use, and you can’t even imagine what a positive future might look like.** For example, if you’re coping with a tragedy and you can’t seem to find any silver lining, choose to believe that there _must_ be something positive that simply isn’t apparent yet. Faith can be the reference holding up that belief.

#### Build a Library of Empowering References

Clearly, there are plenty of references already available to you—but you can **create even more ammo for your empowering beliefs by pursuing experiences that expand your references.** For example, you may have plenty of experiences that provide references supporting your belief that you are intelligent, but few references supporting a belief that you’re physically strong. Fortify this belief by trying new experiences that prove your physical strength: Start working with a physical trainer or join a recreational sports league.

**Then, be aware of how you’re organizing your references to ensure you use them in an empowering way.** For example, if you just finished a tough session with your trainer, you could organize the experience in one of two ways:

  1. You could focus only on this workout, placing the emphasis on your struggle. This may create the disempowering reference that supports the belief of exercise being hard and uncomfortable.
  2. You could focus on your overall progress, placing the emphasis on your strength. The exercise you struggled through today may have been something you couldn’t even attempt a few months ago. This will create an empowering reference to support the belief that your workouts are making a difference, so the struggle is worth it.



### Apply It: Grow Your References

As we’ve discussed, you need a broad foundation of references to support your empowering beliefs. **Take stock of some of your references, and brainstorm how you could expand your library of references** :

  1. Write down five experiences that you feel significantly shaped your life. These experiences are examples of your references. 
  2. For each experience, write a sentence or two about how it impacted you. If the experience has had a negative impact on you, take time now to think of how you could organize this reference in an empowering way.
  3. Write down two or three references you could add to your library to help you achieve the life you want. Come up with these by working backward: Envision your compelling future, think of the beliefs you’d need to have to reach that future, and then brainstorm references that would support those beliefs. 
  4. Write down two or three references you would _like_ to add, though they might not be absolutely _necessary_. For example, you could take an improv class to get references for being spontaneous and pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone. 
  5. Review the references you want to add, and assign a timeline for acquiring each one.
