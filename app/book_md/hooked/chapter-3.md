## Chapter 3: Action

After the trigger, the user needs to perform the desired action.

**To initiate action in a habit, doing must be easier than thinking**. An action has three requirements:

  * Sufficient motivation
  * Sufficient ability
  * A trigger to activate the behavior



Consider how you behave when you hear your phone vibrate. The trigger is there, but you might not have the motivation (it’s the end of the day and you want to shut the world out). Or if the phone is buried at the bottom of your bag, you have insufficient ability to get the phone. And if the phone is muted, you have no trigger to activate the behavior.

### Motivation to Take Action

Motivation is the “energy for action.” **All humans are motivated to:**

  * Seek pleasure and avoid pain
  * Seek hope and avoid fear
  * Seek social acceptance and avoid rejection



Advertising commonly employs these desires.

  * Obama’s 2008 campaign posters inspired hope, and publicly belonging to the movement incurred a feeling of social acceptance.
  * Sexual imagery is used often, from Victoria’s Secret to Carl’s Jr. (though the target market needs to associate sex as a motivator, like teenage boys).
  * Budweiser rarely advertises the beer, instead showing men bro-ing out, associating the beer with good times. Coca-Cola is similar, showing friends and families having a good time.
  * Using negative emotions as cautionary tales also works, invoking pain, fear, and rejection _if you don’t buy this product_.



### Ability to Take Action

**Ability is the capacity to do a behavior.**

Make the process to use your product as simple as possible. Lay out the steps the customer takes to get the job done. Then **remove steps until you reach the _simplest possible process_.**

Web technology inexorably moves toward making activities easier. The lower-friction products are usually the ones that win.

  * In content generation, consider how the web was largely read-only, consisting of professional media companies.
  * Then the development of Blogger and Xanga let amateur writers publish easily, without knowledge of content management systems or servers and without going through a traditional media company.
  * Then with the advent of easy publishing tools like Twitter and Pinterest, the friction to write and create new media shrank even further.



Though critics once decried Twitter’s 140-character limitation, what they missed was how this constraint lowered the barrier for participation, prompting many more to engage. (Shortform note: similarly, Snapchat’s ephemeral messaging lowers the barrier for messaging, compared to a permanent high-quality medium like Instagram.)

Said Ev Williams of Twitter, “Take a human desire, preferably one that has been around for a really long time...identify that desire and use modern technology to take out steps.”

### How to Simplify Your Action

Behavioral scientist B. J. Fogg describes **six factors that influence a task’s difficulty:**

  * Time
  * Money
  * Physical effort
  * Mental effort
  * Social deviance
  * Non-routine - “how much the action matches or disrupts existing routines.”



(Shortform note: some of the largest web companies have reduced one or more of these factors by multiples, or even orders of magnitude:

  * Compared to calling 50 separate friends or sending mass emails, Facebook reduces time and effort to broadcast your personal news. It also became socially acceptable to broadcast good personal news on Facebook, when at one point it might have been considered socially gauche.
  * Compared to hailing a cab or driving, Uber reduces the time, money, physical effort, and mental effort considerably.
  * Compared to shopping in physical stores, Amazon reduces the first 4 considerably, and also matches existing routines of shopping.



Furthermore, each of these roughly matched routines that people had previously done - Uber fit people’s prior habits behavior of getting into strangers’ cars, and Amazon fit user’s behaviors of shopping in physical stores.)

**Identify which factor is most impeding your users.** Is the mental effort needed to use your product too high? Is the user in a social context where the behavior is inappropriate? Is the behavior so different from normal routine that it’s offputting?

Here are examples of tactics to reduce frictions:

  * Log in with Facebook, rather than type in email and password
  * Share a page with an embedded Tweet button, rather than go to Twitter.com and copy text over
  * Google’s homepage is simple and clear. The search has auto-suggest, spelling correction, and instant search results, reducing mental effort and time to get results.
  * The iPhone has the camera button on the homescreen, reducing the friction to taking photos.
  * Pinterest has infinite scroll, reducing the physical effort needed to view more content.
  * Change your landing page or homepage to direct users to the action you want them to take. 
    * Twitter changed from a search form to creating an account or downloading the app.



Should you start with increasing ability or motivation? The author argues, “**always start with increasing ability**.” Motivating users is hard - users don’t read text, and they have deeply ingrained behaviors. **Reducing the effort to perform an action gets them to the reward more quickly.**

### Shortcuts to Increase Motivation

Cognitive biases affect all of us, causing things to see things as quite not objective. You can use cognitive biases and heuristics in your favor to increase motivation:

  * **Scarcity effect** \- the less of something there is, the more valuable it seems.
    * In an experiment, people were shown two jars with different numbers of cookies - one jar had 8, and the other had 2. They were identical cookies. People valued the cookies in the jar with 2 more highly.
    * Amazon shows “only 9 left in stock.”
    * Flights show “only 5 seats left at this price.”
  * **Framing effect** \- the context around something changes its perception.
    * Price affects your experience of wine.
    * Violin master Joshua Bell played in a DC subway station. He was summarily ignored, because the context of the subway station made the idea of a virtuoso playing there improbable.
  * **Anchoring** \- people over-weigh the first piece of info they receive.
    * A starting price in negotiation often forms the centroid of movements. A higher number offered first will stretch the final negotiation price higher.
    * When asked to estimate a number product, those who see 1x2x3x4x5 estimate lower numbers than those who see 5x4x3x2x1
  * **Endowed progress** \- you complete more progress when you feel you have already made some progress.
    * For punch cards, customers were given a card with 10 slots and 2 already punched in showed an 82% higher completion rate than customers given a blank card with 8 slots.
    * LinkedIn shows a progress meter in completing the profile - even when just joining, the bar is somewhat filled in/
