## Introduction

Modern technology has us addicted to its use. Cognitive psychologists define habits as **“automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues,”** and app/tech product usage clearly qualifies in many cases.

Companies that are better at building usage habits are at a clear economic advantage. **When hooked, users return to a product without expensive marketing** \- they return on their own volition, spurred by internal triggers rather than external prompting. People who feel lonely automatically open Facebook. Employees who want to procrastinate automatically open their email. Better access, data, and speed are making things more addictive.

The _Hooked_ model of habit formation consists of 4 steps that form a sequence in a loop:

![hooked-loop.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/hooked-loop.png)

  1. A **trigger** prompts the behavior. 
     * Triggers can be external or internal. External triggers come from outside a person’s thinking (e.g. phone notifications or seeing an advertisement). Internal triggers are internal drives (e.g. relieving boredom or loneliness).
     * For products, behaviors often begin with external triggers. Then, as the habit forms, the behavior becomes associated with internal triggers.
  2. The trigger prompts an **action** , which is a behavior done in anticipation of a reward.
     * An action is more likely when there is motivation to do it, and when it is easier to do.
  3. The action delivers a **variable reward**.
     * Predictable rewards don’t cause cravings. You don’t crave turning on your faucet since you know what happens every time.
     * In contrast, variable rewards prompt more intense dopamine hits and push the user to desire the next hit.
  4. In completing the action, the user **invests** in the product, improving her future experience and increasing the likelihood of completing another loop in the future.
     * Investments include inviting friends, storing data, building a reputation, and learning to use features.



One step of the loop essentially forms one user session. The user returns when prompted by a trigger (external or internal). Over time, the user associates her problem with the solution, and whenever the problem appears, she will automatically seek the solution out of habit.

We’ll be breaking down each of the steps in a chapter.
