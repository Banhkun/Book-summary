## Exercise: Create Your Triggers

Think about your user’s pain points to create the best product.

* * *

Write 3 internal triggers that could remind your user to take action with your product. Write them this way: “every time the user [internal trigger], she [first action].”

What is the user doing right before using your product?

Given this, what are the best places and times to send an external trigger?

Think of 3 external triggers you could use. Then think of 3 outlandish external triggers (e.g. brain implants, electric shocks).
