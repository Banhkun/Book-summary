## Exercise: Evaluate Your Small Talk Skills

Small talk is a skill anyone can developâ€”but most of us find at least some aspect of it difficult. Use this exercise to evaluate your current small talk skills and identify the areas in which you could use some help.

* * *

How would you rate your comfort level or skill with small talk on a scale of 1-10? Explain your rating.

What aspect of small talk do you find the most challenging, and why? (Aspects include: approaching someone and introducing yourself, starting a conversation, finding topics to discuss, talking about yourself, listening well, exiting the conversation, and avoiding conversational blunders.)
