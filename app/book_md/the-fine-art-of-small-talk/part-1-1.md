## Part 1.1: The Four Steps to a Successful Conversation, Steps 1-2

Now that you understand the value of small talk and your responsibility to participate actively in conversations, in this part, we’ll delve into Fine’s four-step guide to a successful conversation. This chapter will cover the first two steps: how to make a connection with another person and how to start a conversation.

### Step 1: Make a Connection

The first step of conversation is making an initial connection with another person. Let’s explore how to choose a partner, introduce yourself, and learn their name. We’ll also discuss two niche cases of connection: how to break into a group and how to interrupt an ongoing conversation.

#### Choose a Partner and Introduce Yourself

Before you can start a conversation, you have to find someone to have that conversation _with._ When choosing someone to talk to, Fine recommends the following two-step process:

**1\. Scan the room and find someone who’s on their own** , who’s not engaged in a conversation or an activity, and who makes eye contact with you.

(Shortform note: There are far more signals that someone doesn’t want to talk than Fine lists: Leave people alone if they’re wearing headphones, reading, crossing their arms or showing other “closed” body language, or if they turn away from you when you look at them.)

**2\. When you make eye contact, smile at the person.** Fine explains that this shows the other party you’re interested in them and immediately establishes a rapport. When you smile at someone, their natural response is to smile back; right off the bat, the two of you share a positive feeling.

(Shortform note: Fine’s principle assumes that the other person will smile back; but what if they _don’t_? Is trying to connect then a lost cause? Probably: Research indicates that a genuine smile communicates a desire to engage cooperatively and altruistically. We can reverse this to imply that someone who _doesn’t_ genuinely smile back doesn’t want to cooperate and converse with you.)

##### How to Introduce Yourself and Learn Their Name

Once you’ve chosen a conversational partner and established rapport through a smile, walk up to them, Fine suggests, **make eye contact, smile again, and shake their hand.**

(Shortform note: Fine suggests handshaking because, in Western society, it’s the polite thing to do—but you don’t _have_ to do it. In fact, many people choose not to for hygiene reasons: Doctors have argued for years that handshaking is unhygienic. Furthermore, according to the CDC, 69% of men admit that they don’t always wash their hands after using the bathroom, making shaking those hands an unpleasant prospect. If you don’t want to shake hands, the Harvard Business Review recommends you communicate warmth, friendliness, and respect in another way, such as by offering a small bow.)

Say, “Hi. My name is…” **Then, stay focused as the other person returns the introduction. Remember their name** and use it immediately: For instance, say “Nice to meet you, Albert!” **If you miss a person’s name, Fine recommends asking them to repeat it.** Remember that everyone has the right to be called by their name, she notes, and that those with difficult names will appreciate it.

(Shortform note: It’s not just people with difficult names who’ll appreciate your efforts: According to Dale Carnegie, _everyone_ is thrilled when someone learns and uses their name. Carnegie argues that a person’s name is the most important word in any language to them—saying it is a subtle and welcome compliment. In contrast, forgetting a name or getting it wrong suggests you didn’t care enough to get it right. Use a person’s name often, he says, and respect it.)

Relatedly, when you meet someone whose name you’ve forgotten, Fine suggests asking for it right away. Don’t compound the awkwardness by being unable to introduce them in the future.

(Shortform note: A word of caution: People can be especially unforgiving of those who forget their names. If you follow Fine’s advice, don’t be surprised if the person whose name you have to ask for is annoyed at you.)

> **How to Remember Names**
> 
> Fine makes it clear that remembering someone’s name is a crucial part of conversing successfully, but doesn’t provide many strategies for name memorization. If you find remembering names exceptionally difficult, try the following tricks:
> 
>   * **As well as repeating the name immediately, pepper it into the conversation.** The more we use a name, the more likely we are to remember it. Further, say the name again before you leave; doing so aids retention.
> 
>   * **Find something unique about the person’s face** and focus on it when you say their name: The more context you can add to your memory of the name, the better. It’s easier to remember the name of “Andy with the big nose” or “Roxanne with the pointy red glasses,” than just “Andy” or “Roxanne.”
> 
>   * **Ask the person to spell their name** to drag out the amount of time you spend focused on it. Find out if it’s “Sarah with an H,” or “Sara with no H.”
> 
>   * **Create a mental imageassociating their name with a visual. **For example, imagine your new friend Holly standing under a Christmas tree, or put Einstein’s hair on Albert’s head. Memory champions—like Boris Konrad, who used this technique to memorize 195 names and faces in 15 minutes—say practice is all it takes to master this skill.

#### Join a Group or Ongoing Conversation

In some cases, your conversational goal may not be to speak one-on-one: You might want to break into a group or interrupt an ongoing conversation. The following sections are Fine’s supplementary tips for these specific situations.

##### How to Break Into a Group

Larger conversational groups can be intimidating to break into, but the author tells us it’s easier than it seems. Her process is as follows:

**1\. Stand slightly apart from the group and show interest in the current speaker:** Make eye contact, nod along, and so forth. Let the group notice you’re there and warm up to you.

(Shortform note: Before implementing this principle, take a moment to gauge the conversational atmosphere. It’s easiest to enter a conversation with a group when they’re chatting casually. Sometimes, a group will be deeply focused on a serious discussion, in which case it’s best to let them be.)

**2\. Ease into the group by demonstrating that you’ve been listening.** Either acknowledge the speaker or find a point of agreement. Don’t offer a conflicting view right away, Fine warns, or they’ll resent your intrusion.

(Shortform note: Fine explains _what_ to say, but doesn’t cover _how_ to say it—in a large group, it’s hard to get a word in because someone else is always ready to speak up. Here’s how to draw attention and create space for yourself: When the current speaker ends a sentence or thought, take a quick, sharp breath and lift one hand to about chest height as if you’re about to offer the group a pencil. Your intake of breath signals that you’re about to speak, and your gesture will draw everyone’s eyes—even the speaker will cede the floor.)

**3\. Wait for the group to actively include you.** Be patient and look for additional welcoming signs, like being asked for your opinion or the group shifting to physically include you, before you say too much more.

(Shortform note: Fine doesn’t discuss what to do if the group _doesn’t_ include you. If the conversation continues without anyone acknowledging your presence, don’t hover; it’s clear your intrusion is unwelcome. Back off and find another conversation to join.)

##### How to Interrupt an Ongoing Conversation

Sometimes, there’ll be a particular person you want or need to speak to, like the host of an event or the leader of a conference, and they’ll already be engaged in a conversation. In this case, Fine says, **don’t just stand around and wait to be noticed.** The other person’s conversation might be so interesting that they never notice you, and you’ll end up wasting time and feeling awkward.

(Shortform note: Another (arguably more severe) consequence of simply waiting around to be noticed is that it may give you a bad reputation. Awkward hoverers are often perceived as creepy lurkers, despite their best intentions.)

Instead of standing around, Fine recommends you **wait patiently for a break in the conversation and ask permission to intrude.** You might say, “excuse me, I’m Jane Smith—could I cut in for a moment?” In most cases, people will be too polite to deny you, and you’ll be left with two options:

**1\. Involve yourself right away.** Say what you want to say politely: Comment on the topic at hand, state your need, or ask your question.

(Shortform note: This particular tip is best applied in cases where you already know one or both conversationalists—it’s probably okay to intrude on a friend’s chat in this way. However, when you add yourself to, say, a business acquaintance or seminar leader’s conversation, you risk looking rude, domineering, or selfish if you try to immediately monopolize the floor. Therefore, if you’re interested in talking to a professional acquaintance or someone you don’t know well, implement Fine’s next suggestion instead of this one.)

**2\. Ask for an opportunity to connect with them later.** In this case, you’ve made your presence and interest known without being overly intrusive, and you’ve given the other person the luxury of choice. If they like, they can include you immediately—otherwise, they can come find you when they’re done.

(Shortform note: To further minimize the chances of your interruption seeming intrusive or rude, keep it short and be polite. State your need clearly and concisely, and let the other person get back to their conversation as efficiently as possible. Thank them for allowing the interruption and back off immediately.)

### Step 2: Start a Conversation

We’ve explored how to find a conversational partner and introduce yourself to them. Now that we’re ready to _have_ a conversation, let’s explore how to start one.

#### How to Break the Ice

The first step in starting a conversation, Fine explains, is to break the ice. According to Fine, it doesn’t matter much _what_ you say as an opener; in theory, you could say _anything_. **What matters is that you initiate the conversation and show _genuine interest_ in the other person’s answer.** Her recommendation, if you’re having trouble, is to open with a statement that uses the context of the situation, event, or venue, and then ask them a related question.

If you’re afraid to talk to someone because you fear you’ll have nothing in common, Fine suggests you **keep in mind that humans are more alike than they are different**. If you give other people a chance, she says, you’ll find you can connect with almost anyone.

(Shortform note: You may feel doubtful that Fine is correct here; surely, considering the diverse range of cultures and life practices that exist across the world (and even within countries), it’s optimistic to say we can connect with almost _anyone_? However, according to research, Fine is correct: The human experience, broadly speaking, is less diverse than it seems. In a study spanning 62 countries around the world, researchers found that our daily experiences are largely universal. For instance, we all care about our friends, want to love and be loved, and enjoy laughing, companionship, and cooperation.)

> **Easy Ways to Start Talking**
> 
> Sometimes, it’s hard to initiate a chat because you don’t know what to say—and hearing that you can talk about _anything_ as an icebreaker, as Fine suggests, may overwhelm you, as it gives you too broad a list of possibilities.
> 
> Fine does provide a specific list of icebreakers in her book, but most of them are business-focused or come too far out of the blue to be generally applicable—like, “I’m excited about our new mayor. How do you think her administration will differ from her predecessor’s?”
> 
> Instead, here are some go-to styles of opener you can use in most contexts, and an example of each:
> 
>   * **Commiserate:** “We’ve been waiting in line a long time, haven’t we? What brings you here today?”
> 
>   * **Notice something pleasant:** “I’m so glad I came out for this concert; wasn’t that guitar solo incredible?”
> 
>   * **Compliment someone:** “I really appreciated your presentation—the way you laid out the details made it easy to follow and understand.”
> 
>   * **Leverage commonality:** “I’m in marketing, too! How long have you been in the business?”
> 
>   * **Seek an opinion:** “I’ve been thinking about attending this workshop, would you recommend it?”
> 
>   * **Ask for easy help:** “Do you know when the food is supposed to arrive?”
> 
>   * **Help someone out:** “That printer looks heavy, can I give you a hand?”
> 
> 


##### Try Giving a Compliment

Compliments can serve as icebreakers, as well. According to Fine, **an authentic compliment establishes rapport; people enjoy being noticed and appreciated**. (Shortform note: Sometimes, we avoid giving compliments because we’re afraid of being awkward or creepy, but in most cases, we’re underestimating the positive impact of sharing them. Compliments are perhaps even more powerful than Fine suggests; they improve our mood and reduce our stress levels. They even activate the same reward circuit in our brains as receiving a financial reward.)

**Fine suggests three main categories of compliments to draw on:**

  1. **How they look:** Their fashion sense, accessories, or skillfully applied makeup
  2. **Things they own:** Their home or car, and anything on display, like photos and diplomas
  3. **The way they act:** How organized they are in meetings, how brave they were to change careers



> **Two Kinds of Compliment**
> 
> While Fine suggests that there are three types of compliment, others argue that there are two, much broader types: superficial and deep. Fine doesn’t mention these two categories, so here’s what they are, how they work, and how they correspond to Fine’s types of compliment:
> 
> **Superficial compliments, which are generally about “things” like objects and body parts, make great icebreakers.** You can compliment someone’s shirt, hairstyle, or other worldly possessions without knowing anything about them. Superficial compliments are nice to hear, but at our core, we prefer to be appreciated for who we _are_ , rather than what we _have_ , so their impact is limited.
> 
> **Examples of superficial compliments include,** “I love the way you’ve laid out your living room! It feels so airy and comforting; you must have put a lot of thought into it.” or, “Dude, nice shirt!”
> 
> Fine’s first two categories—compliments about the way people look or the things they own—are “superficial” compliments.
> 
> In contrast, **deep compliments, which are about behaviors, traits, or accomplishments, are difficult to give strangers.** They focus on the receiver’s personality or their skills and achievements—so until your conversational partner gives you something to praise, you can’t craft one. A genuine deep compliment can be powerfully touching and memorable, because you’re lauding the person, not just their possessions. In giving a deep compliment, you highlight something the other person can feel truly proud of; after all, a laudable achievement likely took hard, focused work.
> 
> **An example of a deep compliment is,** “I was impressed by your presentation; you’ve taught me why it’s critical that I dedicate my time to supporting the needs of my staff, and I appreciate the bravery it took to bring that to the board’s attention.”
> 
> Fine’s third category—compliments about the way people act—falls under the banner of “deep” compliments.
> 
> **In either case, when you give a compliment, follow these rules to maximize its impact:**
> 
>   * **Be honest;** don’t exaggerate, or you’ll seem disingenuous.
> 
>   * **Be specific** about which object, trait, or accomplishment you’re praising.
> 
>   * **Be descriptive;** clearly state what you like or find impressive about it and why.
> 
>   * **Be genuine;** deliver your compliment with warmth and conviction.
