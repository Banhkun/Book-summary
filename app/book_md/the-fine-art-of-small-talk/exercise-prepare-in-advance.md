## Exercise: Prepare in Advance

Think about how you can prepare for an upcoming social event or occasion in which you’ll be meeting new people.

* * *

Write down an event you’ll be attending soon where you’ll meet new people. Now, list two icebreaker questions you could ask someone based on the nature of the event.

What are two short anecdotes you could share about your recent experiences to keep the conversation flowing? (For example, you could mention funny things that have happened recently, exciting developments or opportunities in your life or career, or something you’ve been thinking a lot about.)

What’s a longer story you can tell a stranger that conveys something interesting about who you are, what you enjoy, or how you spend your time? (Remember: Focus on _why_ you do the things you do, rather than on _what_ it is you do.)

Now that you’re prepared, how do you feel about the prospect of attending the event? (For example, does being ready give you a feeling of confidence, safety, or stability?) Do you feel it’s worth preparing like this in the future? Explain your answers.
