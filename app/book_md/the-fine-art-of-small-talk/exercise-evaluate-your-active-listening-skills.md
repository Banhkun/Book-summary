## Exercise: Evaluate Your Active Listening Skills

Think about your active listening skills—in particular, how well you show your conversational partners that you’re interested in what they’re saying and that you understand them.

* * *

Think back to your most recent conversation and describe, broadly, who you spoke to and what you talked about. (It’s okay if the interaction was short or unimportant—active listening skills are always applicable!)

Now, note down whether or not you used any of the following positive visual cues during that conversation: acting as if there were no distractions, facing the speaker directly, maintaining eye contact, smiling, or nodding along.

Next, note down whether or not you used any of the following verbal cues: sounds of agreement or encouragement (“mhmm,” “yup,” “okay”), paraphrasing or repeating, or asking for clarification.

Finally, describe the mental component of your listening: Were you focused on and engaged with your partner’s words, or were you distracted and thinking of other things?

Look back at your answers. In which active listening category could you improve the most, and how might you improve? (For example, consider which visual and verbal cues you can add to your repertoire to help your conversational partners feel more heard, or what you can do to improve the mental component of your listening.)
