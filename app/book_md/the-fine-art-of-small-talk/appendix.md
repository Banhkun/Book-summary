## Appendix: How to Thrive in the Dating Scene

This chapter contains additional tips Fine includes for conversing at singles events and dating. Specifically, we’ll explore how to make a strong entrance at a singles event, how to make an initial connection with someone, how to ask them on a date, and how to make your date feel special.

### Singles Events: How to Make an Entrance

**Fine suggests you think of a singles event as a kind of networking opportunity.** Be kind and friendly to everyone, even those you don’t see as potential dates—they might become a close friend, a business connection, or the person who introduces you to the person you _do_ end up dating.

(Shortform note: While Fine’s recommendation that you remain open to friendships makes sense in the context of singles events, mixers, or life in general, that attitude won’t go far on a dating app. Indeed, the pervasive belief is that those who claim to be “open to friendship” or “just looking for friends” on dating apps are annoying time-wasters. In short, friendship just isn’t what people use these apps for.)

Whether the event involves speed-dating, a group adventure, or some other singles-focused social event, don’t forget why you’re there: **Your goal—everyone’s goal, according to Fine—is to make connections.**

(Shortform note: Knowing, from the start, that everyone’s on the same page as you at a dating event is reassuring. You’re allowed— _expected_ , even—to be interested in others, so your attempts to start conversations are far more likely to be appreciated. Further, singles events are typically planned for you, and—by nature—surround you with others who are interested in the same activities. That gives you something interesting to talk about with others who are almost certainly just as interested.)

**When you arrive at an event, Fine says, take the opportunity to make an impression.** Upon entering, she suggests you pause, allowing yourself to be framed somewhat dramatically in the doorway. Do this for just long enough to decide where you’re going.

(Shortform note: A maneuver like this can feel awkward, uncomfortable, or even mildly unhinged. Most of us don’t feel good about posing and posturing at the best of times—but it _does_ work, aesthetically speaking. We use framing in movies, tv shows, and photography because it draws the eye—and besides, if you need a second to decide where you’re going, why not spend that second mysteriously and alluringly drawing the eye?)

**Once you’ve done that, she says, enter the room and become invisible** —it’s likely everyone else is busy with a conversation, meal, or other task, so this is your chance to absorb the atmosphere. Get some food or a drink, wander around a bit, and see what people are up to. Collect information on the following:

  1. **What pops to mind as you look around?** Does the venue look nice, does anything catch your eye, and do people seem to be having a good time? (Shortform note: Remember: Your impressions of the venue, the general mood, and the organization of the event can make good icebreakers—sharing your impressions will give others the chance to share theirs, allowing you to spark a conversation.)
  2. **What are people doing?** Are most of them engaged, or are they just standing around? (Shortform note: Taking the temperature of the room and the people in it gives you useful information—both about the people and the event itself. Keep an eye out for attendees who seem uncomfortable, lonely, or lost—here’s your chance to be a hero to someone and to make a connection with someone who’s probably wondering if they really belong.)



### Connections: How to Make Them and Why They Matter

**Fine emphasizes that your goal when conversing with a date isn’t just to talk; it’s to connect.** As such, don’t plan your next question as your partner is answering your first—listen to them and think about their answer. Follow up by commenting on their response, prompting them to tell you more, or sharing something about yourself that’s connected to what they’ve just said.

(Shortform note: This formula builds connection by allowing both parties to seek commonality, explore shared interests, and learn about each other. The ask, listen, explore loop helps you find topics you can both enjoy discussing more deeply.)

Whenever your date doesn’t give you enough to follow up on, use one of your icebreakers—the questions you prepared by exploring the venue, researching the event, or reading their profile.

> **Acceptance Is the Root of Deep Connection**
> 
> For singles, connection is even more critical than Fine describes because the lack of it creates loneliness. **Often, loneliness in singles comes from the fact that nobody sees them being truly relaxed and “human** ”—their unfiltered “self” isn’t known, accepted, and loved, since they have nobody to share it with. They need to share the unpolished being that wakes up groggy when their alarm rings, and they need it to be as appreciated and valued as their clean, professional, and put-together facade.
> 
> Here’s how to use conversation to deepen a connection and increase the chances that someone gets to know your true, unfiltered self:
> 
>   * **Ask deep, personal, or emotional questions unapologetically** and answer them openly. Adopt the mindset that discussing emotional topics is normal and acceptable—bonding over such topics is what creates deeper connections. Be willing to show your partner they’re safe by being the first to be vulnerable.
> 
>   * **Encourage openness by refusing to judge anything about the other person.** The primary reason we avoid sharing with others is that we fear judgment and rejection. Many of us are so used to being attacked or put down when we share that we clam up at the slightest hint of disapproval. But when you intentionally judge _nothing_ , you give others the safety they need to share who they are at their deepest level.
> 
>   * **Accept without fixing or dismissing.** Understand that people share to connect—not to ask for help or seek opinions. If your partner says, “I don’t travel much because I’m afraid of flying,” she’s not asking you to point out that her fear is irrational or to explain how to get over it. Accept that fear, acknowledge that it’s real, and let her tell you what it’s like to live with it. That’s how you get to know more about her.
> 
>   * **Relate by sharing emotionally similar experiences**. This deepens the connection by showing your partner you understand them—and that you’re willing to join them in being vulnerable. It’s critical to relate to the _emotion_ connected to the topic, not its context. In the above example, the correct move is to share an irrational fear of your own—one that makes you feel the way she described feeling herself. The wrong move would be to discuss flying or travel in general.

### Dating: How to Ask Them Out

The purpose of dating, according to Fine, is to learn about each other, discover what it’s like to be around each other, and enjoy each other’s company. In short, you want to know if this is a person you’d enjoy spending some greater portion of your life with. As such, Fine says, **plan dates that maximize your ability to interact, converse, and connect.** Before you ask someone out, Fine recommends thinking of a few casual dates—activities you’d enjoy engaging in with a friend. Be prepared to provide the full details up front.

(Shortform note: When it comes to planning dates, Fine suggests you prioritize conversing and connecting. However, to _really_ help your partner to open up, it’s arguably more important to prioritize their feeling of safety and comfort. As such, don’t try to surprise your date: Always share the full details when you extend your invitation. Make sure the date is safe and casual; there shouldn’t be anything about the venue or activity that involves danger or threat. Further, be flexible—offering multiple date options allows you to work around your schedules, as well as the possibility that your partner may not be comfortable with your first suggestion. Finally, be understanding: The other person has every right to say “no,” and if you can’t accept that, you’re not ready to date.)

When you make the call to arrange the date, Fine says it’s important to remind your potential date of who you are: Refresh their memory of specific things that happened when you met, and tell them what you enjoyed about the time you spent together. Let them know you’d like to connect with them again, and then offer your date idea.

**Here’s an example conversation:**

  * Andrew: “Hi Julia, it’s Andrew; we met at the speed dating event at Barlowe’s last week.”
  * Julia: “Oh, hi Andrew, it’s nice to hear from you again!”
  * Andrew: “Julia, I really enjoyed hearing about your experience working for the Monterey Bay Aquarium; I’m still chuckling about what you said about penguins.. I was hoping we might get a chance to hang out again sometime soon.”
  * Julia: “That would be fun! I’ve been wanting to hear more about your volunteering at the raptor center..”
  * Andrew: “Well, would you be interested in joining me for a walk around Bowness Park on Saturday? There’s a little coffee shop there that makes really nice pastries. We could go, say, around ten?”
  * Julia: “That sounds great! I’ll text you on Friday afternoon and we can decide where to meet.”



(Shortform note: Fine’s advice here is arguably outdated as **phone etiquette has changed since this book was published in 2005.** Indeed, millennials—and those younger than them—often prefer to avoid phone calls at all costs, arguing that they’re a rude, inefficient, and time-wasting imposition. Therefore, it’s generally considered polite to schedule a call in advance by sending a text message, or to forgo a call entirely. Further, contrary to Fine’s recommendations, it’s best to get straight to the point in conversations like these—because your date can just scroll up to see your conversational history, there’s no need to reintroduce yourself.)

**If the other person turns you down, Fine says, don’t take it too personally** —whatever their reason, they don’t know you well enough to warrant your feeling insulted or unappealing.

(Shortform note: This advice is perhaps easier said than done—research shows that rejection is processed by the same areas of the brain that handle physical pain, and dating rejection can be particularly excruciating because it highlights our insecurities. In overcoming this pain, be gentle with yourself: Don’t compound your pain with shame, self-criticism, and anger. Give yourself time to let go, and pursue calming, centering activities that take your mind off the rejection—spending time outdoors in natural, untamed environments is particularly helpful. Finally, remember that rewards don’t come without risk—so don’t let one rejection keep you from risking another.)

**If you’re the one receiving the invitation, Fine asks that you be kind:** Empathize with the emotional effort the other person is making. If you’re turning them down, be firm and polite.

(Shortform note: It can be scary to reject a date, so it’s tempting to be indirect or “gentle.” However, experts say it’s critical to establish a clear boundary by leaving no ambiguity. Further, you’re not obligated to give a reason: “No, thank you,” is enough. Even if you want to be particularly nice, don’t lose the clarity: “No, thank you; I think you’re lovely, but I’m just not feeling any chemistry.”)

### Dating: How to Make Them Feel Special

Finally, Fine offers a few tips about how to conduct yourself during the date. First, she recommends, be patient: **A lifelong connection won’t be formed in a single date.** As before, your goal is to connect, learn about each other, and enjoy the time you share together, not to immediately figure out whether you want to spend the rest of your life with this person.

(Shortform note: While Fine is correct to suggest that you won’t know if someone is truly “right” for you on the first date, you will eventually need to answer this question. Fine doesn’t explain how to tell if someone’s right for you or not, so here’s what dating coaches and counselors suggest you look for in a partner: First, a good partner supports you without trying to change you. They encourage you to pursue your passions and dreams, and they treat you the same in public as they do in private. Further, a good partner listens and responds to you—they’re happy when you’re happy, and they comfort you when you’re sad. They don’t dismiss, ignore, or gloss over your emotions. Finally, a good partner fits into your life while still having boundaries—they’re comfortable telling you “no” or letting you know when you’ve hurt their feelings.)

With the goal of connection in mind, Fine says, **let go of your plans and expectations and just focus on your partner.** During a date, it’s natural to feel anxious, nervous, and uncomfortable—to worry about how you’re being perceived, whether you’re doing the right things, and so on. But you’re not dating yourself: You’re dating _them_. Listen to their stories, dig deeper into what they tell you, and only share your own experiences in moderation. In doing so, you create an opportunity for the other person to feel listened to, attractive, and interesting.

(Shortform note: In contrast to Fine’s advice, matchmaking team Kelleher International argues that you can’t focus entirely on your partner forever. A relationship requires balance, they explain, so ensure you’re communicating your own needs and desires with your partner. Give them a chance to listen to you, take care of you, and put _you_ first, too—you deserve their attention and accommodation as much as they deserve yours.)
