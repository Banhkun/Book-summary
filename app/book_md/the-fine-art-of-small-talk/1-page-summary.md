## 1-Page Summary

In _The Fine Art of Small Talk_ , Debra Fine explains the benefits of mastering small talk and teaches you to confidently converse with strangers. According to Fine, the opportunity for casual conversations crops up many times each day—with neighbors, kids, and coworkers, and at social events, business lunches, and even the local supermarket. When we avoid small talk, she explains, we minimize the number of deep conversations we get to have in these settings. **Furthermore, Fine says, we risk giving the impression that we’re cold, disinterested, or rude.**

(Shortform note: Fine's assertion that avoiding small talk can appear rude may seem a little unfair if you're shy: Shy people avoid conversation not because they're rude, but because they feel anxious or awkward. They want to connect, but they don't know how. Unfortunately, though, others may not realize that shyness fuels this behavior: They might just assume that you're rude or aloof. This is why it's so important for shy people who want to connect to get out of their comfort zones and try to overcome their shyness.)

In this guide, we’ll first examine what Fine considers to be a helpful mindset in learning to master small talk. Then, we’ll discuss Fine’s step-by-step guide to conversation, from opening to exit. Finally, we’ll explore Fine’s more detailed tips regarding advance preparation for conversation and conversational conduct.

### Fine’s Proactive Practice Mindset

Clearly, small talk is a valuable tool—but what if it doesn’t come naturally to you? The good news, according to Fine, is that anyone can learn to be a good conversationalist: It’s just a matter of practice and mindset.

(Shortform note: When you want to learn or improve, your mindset—as Fine notes—affects how successful you can be. In particular, you’ll want to adopt a “growth mindset,” rather than a “fixed mindset.” When you hold a growth mindset, you remain open to improvement: You accept the belief that there’s no limit to how far learning and practice will take you. In contrast, those with a fixed mindset believe they’re limited to the traits, intelligence, and potential they were born with.)

According to Fine, taking the following principles to heart as you practice small talk will give you the best chance of improving:

**1\. If you want something, Fine says, go get it.** If your goal is to meet new people, don’t just stand around alone or talk to people you already know. Instead, actively approach strangers.

(Shortform note: Why is being proactive so important? Stephen Covey, author of _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , explains it’s because initiative is key to adopting new behaviors—it’s how we exert control over our circumstances. Covey might say that if you’re bad at small talk, it’s time to stop just letting small talk happen to you. Instead, accept that you’re having trouble, take responsibility for improving, and actively make an effort to change.)

**2\. According to Fine, it’s your job to start the conversation.** The second most common fear in America is of starting conversations, particularly with strangers. Because this fear is so common, you’re unlikely to face rejection if you initiate conversation—in fact, your conversational partner is likely to be relieved that you made the effort.

(Shortform note: Contrary to Fine’s claim, America’s most common fears change year-to-year based on the circumstances we’re dealing with—a fear of conversing with strangers doesn’t usually make the top 10. At the time of _The Fine Art_ ’s publication, for example, it was often claimed that Americans’ number one fear was of public speaking, though fears of terrorist attacks sometimes polled higher. In 2021, the most common fears were of political corruption, the death of a loved one, or of a loved one contracting the coronavirus.)

**3\. It’s as much _your_ job to carry the conversation as it is your partner’s, Fine notes.** When you leave the hard work of maintaining conversation to someone else, you selfishly put your comfort ahead of theirs. Conversation is a two-player game, and you need to participate equally.

(Shortform note: Fine’s point that you have to learn to carry your weight echoes a common complaint that she implies, but doesn’t openly state: that too many people refuse to hold up their end of a conversation. If you want to be a better conversationalist, you must be willing to take charge and set the direction. Aim to do so multiple times in every encounter, to ensure you’re practicing this skill.)

### The Four Steps to a Successful Conversation

Now that you understand it’s your responsibility to participate actively in conversations, we’ll delve into Fine’s four-step guide to a successful conversation.

#### Step 1: Choose a Partner and Introduce Yourself

Before you can start a conversation, you have to find someone to have that conversation _with._ When choosing someone to talk to, Fine recommends the following two-step process:

**1\. Scan the room and find someone who’s on their own** , who’s not engaged in a conversation or an activity, and who makes eye contact with you.

(Shortform note: There are far more signals that someone doesn’t want to talk than Fine lists: Leave people alone if they’re wearing headphones, reading, crossing their arms or showing other “closed” body language, or if they turn away from you when you look at them.)

**2\. When you make eye contact, smile at the person.** Fine explains that this shows the other party you’re interested in them and immediately establishes a rapport. When you smile at someone, their natural response is to smile back; right off the bat, the two of you share a positive feeling.

(Shortform note: Fine’s principle assumes that the other person will smile back; but what if they _don’t_? Is trying to connect then a lost cause? Probably: Research indicates that a genuine smile communicates a desire to engage cooperatively and altruistically. We can reverse this to imply that someone who _doesn’t_ genuinely smile back doesn’t want to cooperate and converse with you.)

##### How to Introduce Yourself and Learn Their Name

Once you’ve chosen a conversational partner and established rapport through a smile, walk up to them, Fine suggests, **make eye contact, smile again and shake their hand.**

(Shortform note: Fine suggests handshaking because, in Western society, it’s the polite thing to do—but you don’t _have_ to do it. If you don’t want to shake hands, the Harvard Business Review recommends you communicate warmth, friendliness, and respect in another way, such as by offering a small bow.)

Say, “Hi. My name is…” **Then, stay focused as the other person returns the introduction. Remember their name** and use it immediately: For instance, say “Nice to meet you, Albert!” **If you miss a person’s name, Fine recommends asking them to repeat it.** Remember that everyone has the right to be called by their name, she notes, and that those with difficult names will appreciate it.

(Shortform note: It’s not just people with difficult names who’ll appreciate your efforts: According to Dale Carnegie, _everyone_ is thrilled when someone learns and uses their name. Carnegie argues that a person’s name is the most important word in any language to them—saying it is a subtle and welcome compliment. In contrast, forgetting a name or getting it wrong suggests you didn’t care enough to get it right. Use a person’s name often, he says, and respect it.)

#### Step 2: Start a Conversation

We’ve explored how to find a conversational partner and introduce yourself to them. Now that we’re ready to _have_ a conversation, let’s explore how to start one.

##### How to Break the Ice

The first step in starting a conversation, Fine explains, is to break the ice. According to Fine, it doesn’t matter much _what_ you say as an opener; in theory, you could say **_anything_. What matters is that you initiate the conversation and show _genuine interest_ in the other person’s answer.** Her recommendation, if you’re having trouble, is to open with a statement that uses the context of the situation, event, or venue, and then ask them a related question.

If you’re afraid to talk to someone because you fear you’ll have nothing in common, Fine suggests you **keep in mind that humans are more alike than they are different**. If you give other people a chance, she says, you’ll find you can connect with almost anyone.

(Shortform note: You may feel doubtful that Fine is correct here; surely, considering the diverse range of cultures and life practices that exist across the world (and even within countries), it’s optimistic to say we can connect with almost _anyone_? However, according to research, Fine is correct: The human experience, broadly speaking, is less diverse than it seems. In a study spanning 62 countries around the world, researchers found that our daily experiences are largely universal. For instance, we all care about our friends, want to love and be loved, and enjoy laughing, companionship, and cooperation.)

> **Easy Ways to Start Talking**
> 
> Sometimes, it’s hard to initiate a chat because you don’t know what to say—and hearing that you can talk about _anything_ as an icebreaker, as Fine suggests, may overwhelm you, as it gives you too broad a list of possibilities.
> 
> Fine does provide a specific list of icebreakers in her book, but most of them are business-focused or come too far out of the blue to be generally applicable—like, “I’m excited about our new mayor. How do you think her administration will differ from her predecessor’s?”
> 
> Instead, here are some go-to styles of opener you can use in most contexts, and an example of each:
> 
>   * **Commiserate:** “We’ve been waiting in line a long time, haven’t we? What brings you here today?”
> 
>   * **Notice something pleasant:** “I’m so glad I came out for this concert; wasn’t that guitar solo incredible?”
> 
>   * **Compliment someone:** “I really appreciated your presentation—the way you laid out the details made it easy to follow and understand.”
> 
>   * **Leverage commonality:** “I’m in marketing, too! How long have you been in the business?”
> 
>   * **Seek an opinion:** “I’ve been thinking about attending this workshop. Would you recommend it?”
> 
>   * **Ask for easy help:** “Do you know when the food is supposed to arrive?”
> 
>   * **Help someone out:** “That printer looks heavy. Can I give you a hand?”
> 
> 


#### Step 3: Keep the Conversation Going

Once you’ve gotten the conversation started, do your part to keep it flowing smoothly. Let’s explore two methods of prolonging conversation: asking open-ended questions that get people talking about themselves and using context clues to follow up on their answers.

##### How to Ask Open-Ended Questions

According to Fine, a conversation flows best when you create opportunities for your partner to share details you can explore more deeply. **Therefore, ask your conversational partner open-ended questions that demand more than a one-word answer.** Show interest and encourage them to talk about themselves: The more your partner gives you, Fine says, the more you’ll have to work with later. (Shortform note: You’ll see the value of open-ended questions more clearly in the upcoming section on following up on cues. For now, keep in mind that your goal is always to elicit more than a “yes” or “no.”)

**If your question elicits a one-word answer, ask another open-ended question.** For example:

  * Person A: “How was your vacation?”
  * Person B: “Great!”
  * Person A: “I’m glad to hear it! Did you do anything particularly exciting?”
  * Person B: “Well, my brother and I went water skiing at the lake. We…”



However, Fine includes a caveat to this recommendation: **Don’t push topics your partner doesn’t seem willing to engage in.** You’re not here to interrogate them: Let them decide how much they’re comfortable saying. If they give a short answer and then steer the conversation elsewhere, Fine recommends you respect that and join them in the direction they’ve chosen.

(Shortform note: This principle is crucial because it prevents you from _pressuring_ your partner to talk about certain things: Your conversation will go most smoothly if you give them space to control the topic. At this point, the conversation has only just started—and you want it to continue—so leave judgment, criticism, and interrogation behind.)

##### How to Follow Up on Cues With Additional Questions

Another way to keep conversations going is to follow up with additional open-ended questions. This is where Fine’s recommendation that you show interest in your partner’s answers yields fruit: **When you pay attention to their responses, you’ll notice interesting details you can use to deepen the conversation.**

You can choose follow-up questions based on any of the following:

**1\. Anything they’ve mentioned so far** —did anything about their previous answers intrigue or interest you? Did they seem particularly proud of anything they brought up? (Shortform note: In particular, dig into the things people mention that are _outside_ of their obligations. For instance, follow up on people’s hobbies, not their job. They’ll enjoy the conversation more if it’s focused on things they _want_ to do than things they _have_ to do.)

**2\. Things they’re wearing,** particularly those which denote group membership. (Shortform note: Why is this such a useful conversational tool? Because a person who wears a Rotary Club pin or a Seattle Seahawks cap to an event is usually doing so for a reason—they’re signaling a personal interest they like to think or talk about. When talking to younger people, keep an eye out for things like cell phone charms, keyrings, pins on their bag or jacket, or stickers on a water bottle.)

**3\. Their achievements, trophies, and ornaments** , especially those they display prominently. (Shortform note: This is particularly useful if you’re addressing someone whose achievements were recently announced (for instance, at a conference), but it’s just as helpful when you’re visiting someone’s home or office. People display what brings them happiness and pride—whether that’s a university diploma or a little figurine of a snail.)

**4\. The location or occasion.** (Shortform note: When all else fails, you can always ask someone what brings them here, who they know and how they met them, or how they’re feeling about the event.)

**5\. Their behavior, traits, or quirks**. (Shortform note: Fine suggests that the way someone speaks or writes can offer you opportunities for small talk—but be careful; it’s easy to offend someone this way. For example, don’t ask someone who seems to speak with a foreign accent “where are you really from?” Maybe they’re from the city you’re in and only picked up the accent from their parents.)

#### Step 4: End the Conversation

Eventually, no matter how engaging a conversation is, the time comes to move on. Furthermore, occasionally, a conversation isn’t engaging or enjoyable, and you might want to leave swiftly. In this final step, we’ll explore how to gracefully exit a conversation without burning any bridges.

##### How to Make Your Exit

Before you leave a conversation, Fine urges you to have a clear destination in mind and be honest about it. **Make it clear that the reason you need to leave is that there’s something you need to do.** For example, if your next goal is to get some food, speak to the event’s host, or make a call, courteously say so. When you’ve disengaged, do what you said you would: If your former conversational partner sees you doing something else, they’ll take it personally.

(Shortform note: Don’t worry if your reason for leaving isn’t very strong. Research shows that the word “because,” followed by a reason—even one that’s not compelling—leads to a much higher likelihood of acceptance of a situation. A Harvard psychologist, who had researchers try cutting in line to use the copy machine, discovered people were 34% more likely to allow the intrusion when the researchers said “because I need to make copies” than when they didn’t give a reason.)

Furthermore, Fine suggests that, when it’s time to leave, you thank your conversational partner for their expertise, their time, or the joy of conversing with them.**A genuine compliment or expression of gratitude leaves the other person feeling good about you and gives you an air of confidence and poise.**

(Shortform note: An additional important benefit of expressing gratitude at the end of a conversation is that it improves the likelihood of your conversational partner opting to stay connected with you long-term. Research shows that expressions of gratitude signal warmth, friendliness, and thoughtfulness—all of which contribute to a feeling in the recipient that the burgeoning relationship is worth investing in. For this reason, people you thank are more likely to give you their contact information or extend an invitation to spend time with them in future.)

Fine suggests that if you want to see the person again, you say so. Issue an invitation and don’t take it personally if you’re turned down.

(Shortform note: Fine doesn’t explain _how_ to extend an invitation, or when to do it—just that you should mention you’d like to. Keith Ferrazzi, author of _Never Eat Alone_ , gives more specific advice: He suggests following up on an initial contact between 12 and 24 hours later. When you do, he says, thank the person for their time or help, remind them of a part of your conversation—a joke they made, or a topic you agreed on—and suggest you meet again. You don’t have to set a time or invite them to anything specific right away—just express that you _want_ to meet again, and let them know you’ll be in contact soon to discuss the details.)

### The Mechanics of a Successful Conversation

Now that you understand the basic flow of a conversation, we’ll explore the additional conversational advice Fine provides. Specifically, we’ll explore how to prepare conversational topics in advance and how to listen actively and speak assertively.

#### How to Prepare in Advance

Sometimes, if a conversation is particularly important, you might want to prepare for it in advance. Let’s explore how to prepare conversational topics and personal anecdotes.

##### Prepare General Questions

When you anticipate talking to new people, Fine says, prepare specific questions in advance about the person (or people) you want to meet, the event, or the situation. You can use these questions to revitalize a flagging conversation by creating a new topic to follow up on.

**Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can prepare in advance:**

  * What’s your favorite way to relax after work?
  * What do you like about [open mic night, Amber’s parties, the Smithsonian]?
  * Have you ever been to [a protest, a seminar, a meetup] like this before?
  * Are you from around here? Are there any local events I should know about?



(Shortform note: It’s arguably crucial to prepare questions that show interest in people’s thoughts and opinions because it makes them feel good. When you really listen to people, they feel important, interesting, and valuable—as a result, they’ll be happy to talk more! This is partly why, as Dale Carnegie points out, you make friends much more easily by being interested in them than by trying to get them interested in _you_.)

##### Prepare Personal Anecdotes

**Even if you’ve prepared many questions about the other person, the author says, you’ll eventually have to talk about yourself.** You can share your feelings, your opinions about books, restaurants, and movies, or your memories of events and experiences. According to Fine, people will resent it if the conversation isn’t balanced, so you need to share as much as you receive. Furthermore, when you talk about yourself, you give others the opportunity to feel connected to you, give them a new topic to speak about, and allow them to share their own related experiences.

(Shortform note: In direct contrast to Fine’s advice, many experts suggest you avoid talking about yourself too much. When you don’t talk about yourself, they say, you listen better—you’re not busy thinking about what to say next. Furthermore, you ask more questions and pay more attention to the answers. To determine whether you need to talk about yourself less or more, ask yourself: Do you already talk about yourself in most conversations? If so, try _not_ talking about yourself for the next two days. If, however, you typically _avoid_ talking about yourself, follow Fine’s suggestions below and try to do so more often.)

#### How to Listen Actively

Another key to a great conversation, according to the author, is listening actively. **Fine describes active listening as an ongoing process in which you listen fully to the speaker’s message and validate their words by giving visual and verbal feedback.**

(Shortform note: To validate, in this case, means to support the speaker by showing them you understand and accept their message. In short, you’re letting them know you’ve not only _heard_ what they’re saying, but that you’ve taken it to heart. Note that you don’t have to agree with someone’s point to validate it; just don’t ignore, reject, or judge _them_ for sharing it.)

She also mentions a third component to active listening: engaging mentally and staying focused on the speaker.

In concert, the three components make you a better listener—you’ll make others feel heard, so they’ll actively seek you out for conversation, company, and support. Let’s look at each component in detail.

##### Give Your Partner Visual Cues

Fine explains that when you listen to someone, you should **use your body language to communicate your interest and engagement.** Here’s how:

**1.** **Act as if there were no distractions in the room.** Fine suggests you face your partner openly and directly and smile.

(Shortform note: Fine’s recommendation here may not always be advisable: Some people don’t appreciate physical directness. They may be anxious, have different physical boundaries, or prefer a more gentle, relaxed communication style. Allow others to set their own boundaries without taking offense.)

**2\. Nod, make eye contact, and stay focused on the speaker.** If you have trouble maintaining eye contact, Fine suggests you look at the space between their eyes instead of directly at them; your partner won’t be able to tell the difference.

(Shortform note: What Fine suggests regarding eye contact is generally applicable in the United States, but note that it may not be appropriate when you interact with people from different backgrounds. In some places, it’s considered aggressive to gaze constantly and directly into another’s eyes.)

**3\. Be aware of what your body language implies.** Don’t cross your arms and legs, place your hands on your hips, or rest your chin in your hand. Don’t fidget or keep your head down. Fine notes that these signs are typically interpreted as implying boredom, disinterest, disagreement, or hostility.

(Shortform note: Fine is arguably being a little unfair here since the examples she provides don’t necessarily communicate boredom or disinterest. You may actually fidget because you’re anxious, uncomfortable, or nervous. If you’re worried your fidgeting may be sending the wrong message, practice hiding those nerves. Furthermore, a therapist can help you practice body language that communicates the messages you want to send.)

##### Give Your Partner Verbal Cues

Verbal cues, Fine explains, add to the reassurance provided by visual cues. **Verbally indicating that you’re present and aware encourages your partner to keep speaking.**

Fine notes that you can use verbal cues to show you understand, agree, disagree, or want to hear more. For example, you can say: “Hmm, I see...” “What makes you feel that way?”

You can also use verbal cues to transition to another topic. For example, you can say: “That reminds me: I’ve heard that… What do you think about that?” or “Since you’re an engineer, I wonder if you could explain...”

(Shortform note: Like the visual cues we display through our body language, the purpose of verbal cues is to inform your partner that you’re still listening, that you’re still interested, and that you’d like them to continue speaking. In short, you’re giving encouragement and reassurance. If you have trouble seeing the value in this, imagine you’re describing your symptoms to a doctor and she just sits there, staring at you, until you finish. That would be disconcerting! Instead, you’d likely prefer if she nodded along, hummed thoughtfully, and occasionally asked elaborating questions, like, “..and how long has this been going on?”)

**One helpful verbal cue is to paraphrase and repeat,** the author suggests. This technique lets you clarify that you understood the other person correctly, or helps them recognize where you misunderstood what they were trying to say.

Here are some common ways to paraphrase and repeat:

  * “Wait, you mean he _actually said_ that he doesn’t care what you think?”
  * “So, it’s the _left_ outlet you want me to plug it into?”
  * “Sir, I just want to be sure: You’re asking me to order seven _thousand_ copies?”



(Shortform note: The goal of paraphrasing and repeating is not just to parrot in the way Fine describes—it’s also to ensure you understand what’s being said in the spirit in which it’s intended. You’re remembering the speaker’s points, asking about them, and clarifying your understanding **because it helps you connect with the speaker.** You’re giving them the comfort of _knowing_ they’re understood.)

##### The Mental Component of Listening

Finally, remember that giving visual and verbal cues that _suggest_ you’re listening isn’t enough: You have to actually listen, too. **Listening is your job in the conversation, Fine argues, and it isn’t optional.**

(Shortform note: It’s not easy to listen with your full attention, as Fine suggests. Research shows we think much faster than we speak—so when we’re just _listening_ to someone speak, our brains have plenty of time to get distracted. If you find your mind often wanders while others are meandering through a sentence, try keeping your brain engaged by focusing on _more_ than just the speaker’s words: Watch their body language—their face, eyes, posture, and tone of voice—can you tell how they feel about the topic? Weigh the evidence of their points; is the logic sound? Think ahead, and try to guess where the speaker’s thought is going. Finally, review the highlights of the conversation so far.)

#### How to Speak Assertively

Now that you know how to listen, let’s explore how Fine recommends you speak: not passively, but assertively. **According to Fine, the words and phrasing you use communicate a lot about your self-image.** She argues that when you use passive language, you imply that you’re unreliable, subservient, or incompetent.

Consider the following dialogue between April and her coworker, Jeff:

  * **April:** Hi Jeff, can I ask you a question? I wanted to ask if you’ll have those client reports for me soon.
  * **Jeff:** I’ll have to check with my boss, but I’ll try and get them to you this week.



There are a number of issues here. First, there’s no need for April to ask if she can ask a question; she comes across as if she’s bowing and scraping. When she does ask her question, it’s vague, and it doesn’t specify the urgency of her need.

Jeff, meanwhile, by using the phrase “have to,” implies that April’s request is an imposition that forces him to take on an additional burden. When he says he’ll “try,” he gives the impression that he’s uncertain about his ability to fulfill her request in the timeframe he specifies, and implies that he’s making room for himself to wriggle out of the commitment.

Meanwhile, Fine argues that speaking _assertively_ gives the impression that you know what you want and need. It also commands attention.

Consider the following dialogue, in which both parties are direct and assertive:

  * **April:** Hi Jeff, I need those client reports by next weekend. Can I expect them by the end of the week?
  * **Jeff:** I’ll get in touch with my boss and make sure you have them by Friday.



Here, April clearly communicates her need and the timeframe she’s expecting. She gets straight to the point. Jeff, too, is clear about his plan of action, letting April know what he’s doing and when she can expect her request to be fulfilled. Both parties come across as confident professionals who are sure of their needs and capabilities.

> **Aggressive, Passive, or Assertive?**
> 
> While Fine discusses the need to be assertive, she doesn’t cover why people may be reluctant to do so. **Often, people who avoid assertive language and act passively instead do so because they worry it makes them look aggressive—but that’s a misunderstanding.** You can be assertive without being aggressive.
> 
> Psychologists tell us that the difference between being aggressive, passive, or assertive is a matter of who you put first and how you communicate your needs.
> 
> **An aggressive person puts himself first.** He demands and enforces the fulfillment of his own needs and desires, often at the cost of the needs, desires, and boundaries of others. In many cases, an aggressive person uses threats, disrespect, or verbal abuse to get his way. He wants his client reports _now_ , and he doesn’t care whose day he ruins to get them.
> 
> In direct contrast, **a passive person puts everyone else first.** He allows the needs and desires of others to supersede his own, and doesn’t act to protect his boundaries. As a result, he often “ends up” in situations where he’s uncomfortable, unhappy, or unsatisfied. As Fine notes, passive people don’t make a strong impression; they belittle their own views, skills, and knowledge, seek the approval of others, and are constantly apologetic. A passive person would rather give up control over when he gets his client reports than step on anyone’s toes.
> 
> **Assertiveness is the middle ground between passiveness and aggressiveness.** An assertive person is respectful of both her own needs and those of the other party. She communicates her needs clearly, in whatever way is most effective; she doesn’t scream when it’s inappropriate and doesn’t bow when it’s unnecessary. She sets her own boundaries and defends them without violating the boundaries of others. In short, if she needs those client reports by Tuesday, she says so.
