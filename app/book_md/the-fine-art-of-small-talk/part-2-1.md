## Part 2.1: The Mechanics of a Successful Conversation

Now that you understand the basic flow of a conversation, in this part, we’ll explore the additional conversational advice Fine provides. In this chapter, we’ll discuss how to prepare conversational topics in advance and how to listen actively and speak assertively.

### How to Prepare in Advance

Sometimes, if a conversation is particularly important, you might want to prepare for it in advance. Let’s explore Fine’s two methods for doing this: staying focused by preparing and prioritizing an agenda, and preparing conversational topics and personal anecdotes in advance.

#### Identify Your Agenda and Stick to It

To keep small talk productive, Fine says to identify an agenda for the event you’re attending in advance and stick to it—for instance, you might have questions prepared and many people you want to meet. Keeping track of your progress towards completing your agenda helps you identify when it’s time to move on from a conversation and gives you the motivation to do it. Having an agenda also primes you with getaway lines; you have a reason to leave and you can share it.

(Shortform note: This recommendation may feel a bit too “formal” for some social situations: The word “agenda” has connotations of tracking work tasks, not the more casual activity of small talk with strangers. However, your agenda doesn’t have to be businesslike. For example, you can focus on collecting information about a specific topic, deepening your relationship with particular people, searching for personal opportunities like hobby groups, or simply having fun. In any case, when the conversation is no longer serving that purpose, you’ll know it’s time to move on.)

**Fine recommends verbalizing your agenda** —your conversational partners may be able to help you accomplish your goal. For example, you can say: “Gloria, I’m looking for a job in video production. Do you know anyone here who might be able to help me with that?” In social situations, you can ask: “Has anyone else recently moved here?”, “Is there a weekly neighborhood hiking club?”, or “Who’s hosting this event? Could you introduce me to them?”

(Shortform note: In this section, Fine focuses particularly on business and networking events—where everyone present has an agenda. Everyone there wants something from the others, so it’s not uncalled-for to ask for help. In such cases, expert networkers suggest you be direct and specific: Don’t say “it’d be great if you could introduce me to someone there,” when you can instead ask, “please connect me with their hiring manager.”)

#### Prepare Questions in Advance

When you anticipate talking to new people, Fine says, prepare specific questions in advance about the person (or people) you want to meet, the event, or the situation. You can use these questions to revitalize a flagging conversation by creating a new topic to follow up on.

**Here are some examples of the kinds of questions you can prepare in advance:**

  * What’s your favorite way to relax after work?
  * What do you like about [this open mic night, Amber’s parties, the Smithsonian]?
  * Have you ever been to [a protest, a seminar, a meetup] like this before?
  * Are you from around here? Are there any local events I should know about?



(Shortform note: It’s arguably crucial to prepare questions like these that show interest in people’s thoughts and opinions because it makes them feel good. When you really listen to people, they feel important, interesting, and valuable—as a result, they’ll be happy to talk more! This is partly why, as Dale Carnegie points out, you make friends much more easily by being interested in them than by trying to get them interested in _you_.)

##### Prepare to Reconnect

**If you’ll be talking to people you’ve met before but haven’t seen for a long time, Fine advises reviewing some of the specifics of your previous conversations.** What do you remember about the things they loved, enjoyed, and hoped for? Consider asking how these things have developed before you learn what’s new in their life.

(Shortform note: Reconnecting with an old friend or acquaintance can feel more stressful than Fine accounts for, as you might feel guilty for letting the connection lapse. However, experts suggest you put your expectations and tensions aside. Take the pressure away from your partner by opening the conversation yourself. Lead in gently: “Let me catch you up a bit on what’s been going on with me.” Share a good development or two, a struggle or difficulty that’s not too brutal, and something interesting that’s happened to you. In doing all three, you let the other person know you’re open to hearing the same from them. Smile and keep things light and easy. Above all, focus on making sure they’re comfortable—give them a judgment-free opportunity to share and reminisce.)

#### Prepare Personal Anecdotes

**Even if you’ve prepared many questions about the other person, the author says, you’ll eventually have to talk about yourself.** You can share your feelings, your opinions about books, restaurants, and movies, or your memories of events and experiences. According to Fine, people will feel resentful if the conversation isn’t balanced, so you need to share as much as you receive. Furthermore, when you talk about yourself, you give others the opportunity to feel connected to you, give them a new topic to speak about, and allow them to share their own related experiences.

(Shortform note: In direct contrast to Fine’s advice, many experts suggest you avoid talking about yourself too much. When you don’t talk about yourself, they say, you listen better—you’re not busy thinking about what to say next. Furthermore, you ask more questions and pay more attention to the answers. To determine whether you need to talk about yourself less or more, ask yourself: Do you already talk about yourself in most conversations? If so, try _not_ talking about yourself for the next two days. If, however, you typically _avoid_ talking about yourself, follow Fine’s suggestions below and try to do so more often.)

Don’t worry that your life isn’t interesting enough to talk about, or about coming across as conceited or self-centered. Fine explains that **every ordinary person has experienced something extraordinary;** the trick is to look back at your life and pick out the moments that were particularly funny, scary, exciting, or strange. These kinds of events make great conversation material, so prepare a story in advance.

(Shortform note: Fine doesn’t mention that it’s easiest to talk about yourself when you’re talking about what you enjoy doing. Start by making a list of activities that excite you or make you happy. Go down the list and note any interesting, funny, or impressive things that happened in your pursuit of those activities. Did your love of gardening yield strange fruit? Has a camping trip gone amusingly awry? Were you deeply touched by your volunteer work?)

However, Fine warns,**only disclose information that’s comfortable and uncontroversial; keep it easy, positive, and light, and match the level of intimacy shared by the other person.** Creating friendships is a process of building trust and intimacy over time—revealing your deepest struggles to total strangers will put them off.

(Shortform note: Similarly, avoid criticizing yourself in front of others. For example, don’t say: “I’m kind of stupid,” or, “I’m really awkward,” or, “I’m not good at...” Not only do you tell others to see and treat you that way—as a person who’s stupid, awkward, incapable, and so on—but you also make them uncomfortable. You put pressure on them to comfort or reassure you, or challenge your negativity. People are looking to make friends, not be your therapist.)

> **How to Talk About Yourself**
> 
> Like Fine, Julie Zhuo—author of _The Making of a Manager_ —says that talking about yourself without being obnoxious is a skill. If you have trouble telling your story, consider Zhuo’s tips:
> 
>   * **Pay attention to how others respond to you.** If you notice a spark in your listener’s eye when you mention where you’re from, don’t just blaze past it; connect with them, and find out why it intrigues them!
> 
>   * **Realize that nobody can tell your story as well as you can.** Nobody understands your passions, your struggles, and your motivations as well as you do, so take charge of your own narrative. It’s nice when others talk about you, but they can only tell a thin slice of your tale.
> 
>   * **Center your stories on “whys.”** It can be tempting to describe, in detail, _what_ you’ve done with your life. It’s an easy way to speak at length, but what makes your story unique—and intriguing—is _why_ you did what you did. If you left your hometown, engaged in a particular career, or made a certain choice, talk about _why_.
> 
>   * **Don’t hide what’s great about you for the sake of humility.** If an impressive detail about your story naturally emerges from the telling, don’t suppress that. If you’re the VP of Marketing, saying “I’m in sales” doesn’t do you any favors—nor is it the whole truth.
> 
>   * **Find authentic, interesting answers to the questions you’re asked most often.** For instance, instead of answering a question like “what do you do?” with a short, factual statement, try an anecdote. Consider whether you might have a memory that encapsulates your experience in an interesting way. It’s one thing to say “I’m a plumber,” but chances are you’ve got a few stories about tricky plumbing jobs to tell—so tell one!
> 
>   * **Don’t hold back: Share your story.** Whoever you are, you’ve got a story that’s yours alone, and it deserves to be heard. Give others a chance to hear and understand you, and to celebrate, commiserate, learn, and connect with you. You’ll find you’re not alone.

### How to Listen Actively and Speak Assertively

Two more keys to a great conversation, according to the author, are listening actively and speaking assertively. As such, in this section, we’ll explain how to master both.

#### Listen Actively

**Fine describes active listening as an ongoing process in which you listen fully to the speaker’s message and validate their words by giving visual and verbal feedback.**

(Shortform note: To validate, in this case, means to support the speaker by showing them you understand and accept their message. In short, you’re letting them know you’ve not only _heard_ what they’re saying, but that you’ve taken it to heart. Note that you don’t have to agree with someone’s point to validate it; just don’t ignore, reject, or judge _them_ for sharing it.)

She also mentions a third component to active listening: engaging mentally and staying focused on the speaker.

In concert, the three components make you a better listener—you’ll make others feel heard, so they’ll actively seek you out for conversation, company, and support. Let’s look at each component in detail.

##### Give Your Partner Visual Cues

According to Fine, body language accounts for most of the social meaning of a situation. Pay attention to both yours and your partner’s: **Use _your_ body language to communicate your interest and engagement.** Watch _theirs_ to help you recognize when it’s time to change the subject or say goodbye (for instance, because their body language indicates they’re bored).

(Shortform note: Note that the signals _others_ send with their body language aren’t always as legible as Fine implies. It’s easy to misinterpret someone else’s posture, for example, or read a signal where none is actually sent. For example, some people doodle or scribble while listening because doing so helps them focus, but you could misinterpret that behavior as a sign of their disinterest. As such, if you’re not receiving the messages or response you expect, don’t assume the connection is doomed or that one of you is doing something wrong. When in doubt, ask how the other person is feeling.)

When you converse, Fine recommends you **act as if there were no distractions in the room.** Face your partner openly and directly, and smile.

(Shortform note: Fine’s recommendation here may not always be advisable: Some people don’t appreciate physical directness. They may be anxious, have different physical boundaries, or prefer a more gentle, relaxed communication style. Allow others to set their own boundaries without taking offense.)

**Nod, make eye contact, and stay focused on the speaker.** If you have trouble maintaining eye contact, Fine suggests you look at the space between their eyes instead of directly at them; your partner won’t be able to tell the difference.

(Shortform note: What Fine suggests regarding eye contact is generally applicable in the United States, but note that it may not be appropriate when you interact with people from different backgrounds. In some places, it’s considered aggressive to gaze constantly and directly into another’s eyes.)

**Be aware of what your body language implies.** Don’t cross your arms and legs, place your hands on your hips, or rest your chin in your hand. Don’t fidget or keep your head down. Fine notes that these signs are typically interpreted as implying boredom, disinterest, disagreement, or hostility.

(Shortform note: Fine is arguably being a little unfair here, since the examples she provides don’t necessarily communicate boredom or disinterest. You may actually fidget because you’re anxious, uncomfortable, or nervous. If you’re worried your fidgeting may be sending the wrong message, practice hiding those nerves. Furthermore, a therapist can help you practice body language that communicates the messages you want to send.)

##### Give Your Partner Verbal Cues

Verbal cues, Fine explains, add to the reassurance provided by visual cues. **Verbally indicating that you’re present and aware encourages your partner to keep speaking.**

Fine notes that you can use verbal cues to show you understand, agree, disagree, or want to hear more. For example, you can say: “Hmm, I see...” “What makes you feel that way?”

You can also use verbal cues to transition to another topic. For example, you can say: “That reminds me: I’ve heard that… What do you think about that?” or “Since you’re an engineer, I wonder if you could explain...”

(Shortform note: Like the visual cues we display through our body language, the purpose of verbal cues is to inform your partner that you’re still listening, that you’re still interested, and that you’d like them to continue speaking. In short, you’re giving encouragement and reassurance. If you have trouble seeing the value in this, imagine you’re describing your symptoms to a doctor and she just sits there, staring at you, until you finish. That would be disconcerting! Instead, you’d likely prefer if she nodded along, hummed thoughtfully, and occasionally asked elaborating questions, like, “..and how long has this been going on?”)

**One helpful verbal cue is to paraphrase and repeat,** the author suggests. This technique lets you clarify that you understood the other person correctly, or helps them recognize where you misunderstood what they were trying to say.

Here are some common ways to paraphrase and repeat:

  * “Wait, you mean he _actually said_ that he doesn’t care what you think?”
  * “So, it’s the _left_ outlet you want me to plug it into?”
  * “Sir, I just want to be sure: You’re asking me to order seven _thousand_ copies?”



(Shortform note: The goal of paraphrasing and repeating is not just to parrot in the way Fine describes—it’s also to ensure you understand what’s being said in the spirit in which it’s intended. You’re remembering the speaker’s points, asking about them, and clarifying your understanding **because it helps you connect with the speaker.** You’re giving them the comfort of _knowing_ they’re understood.)

##### The Mental Component of Listening

Finally, remember that giving visual and verbal cues that _suggest_ you’re listening isn’t enough: You have to actually listen, too. **Listening is your job in the conversation, Fine argues, and it isn’t optional.**

(Shortform note: It’s not easy to listen with your full attention, as Fine suggests. Research shows we think much faster than we speak—so when we’re just _listening_ to someone speak, our brains have plenty of time to get distracted. If you find your mind often wanders while others are meandering through a sentence, try keeping your brain engaged by focusing on _more_ than just the speaker’s words: Watch their body language—their face, eyes, posture, and tone of voice—can you tell how they feel about the topic? Weigh the evidence of their points; is the logic sound? Think ahead and try to guess where the speaker’s thought is going. Finally, review the highlights of the conversation so far.)

> **Mastering Active Listening**
> 
> Fine’s suggestions for how to listen actively apply to any situation in which you want a speaker to feel heard, respected, and encouraged. **In some contexts, however, a great listener can do more—she can cooperatively aid the speaker in finding or describing his point.** In fact, researchers suggest that a master of active listening is like a trampoline, clarifying and supporting the ideas that speakers bounce off her. She creates a nonjudgmental space and aims to help the speaker express his thoughts fully—this attitude allows both parties to expand their worldview and learn something new.
> 
> **To achieve this, a master listener asks constructive questions that help lead the speaker to new insights or challenge his assumptions.** She creates a two-way dialogue by making suggestions, both giving and receiving feedback. Instead of just letting her partner express what he’s thinking, she can help him to realize what he’s really trying to say.
> 
> Therefore, when listening actively, ensure you’re offering a safe environment to your conversational partner: **As a listener, it’s not your goal to judge his character, behavior, or values.** Instead, give him space to openly express himself, and don’t argue. If he shares feelings and concerns with you, validate that; let him know his feelings are understandable, relatable, and logical. When the speaker feels safe and understood, he can stop holding back and speak openly.
> 
> Furthermore, as your conversational partner shares his thoughts and ideas with you, show him how those ideas look from your own perspective. **Try to come to a deeper mutual understanding of the topic by combining what each of you knows** , without hijacking the conversation.

#### Speak Assertively

Now that you know how to listen, let’s explore how Fine recommends you speak: not passively, but assertively. **According to Fine, the words and phrasing you use communicate a lot about your self-image.** She argues that when you use passive language, you imply that you’re unreliable, subservient, or incompetent.

Consider the following dialogue between April and her coworker, Jeff:

  * **April:** Hi Jeff, can I ask you a question? I wanted to ask if you’ll have those client reports for me soon.
  * **Jeff:** I’ll have to check with my boss, but I’ll try and get them to you this week.



There are a number of issues here. First, there’s no need for April to ask if she can ask a question; she comes across as if she’s bowing and scraping. When she does ask her question, it’s vague, and it doesn’t specify the urgency of her need.

Jeff, meanwhile, by using the phrase “have to,” implies that April’s request is an imposition that forces him to take on an additional burden. When he says he’ll “try,” he gives the impression that he’s uncertain about his ability to fulfill her request in the timeframe he specifies, and implies that he’s making room for himself to wriggle out of the commitment.

Meanwhile, Fine argues that speaking _assertively_ gives the impression that you know what you want and need. It also commands attention.

Consider the following dialogue, in which both parties are direct and assertive:

  * **April:** Hi Jeff, I need those client reports by next weekend. Can I expect them by the end of the week?
  * **Jeff:** I’ll get in touch with my boss and make sure you have them by Friday.



Here, April clearly communicates her need and the timeframe she’s expecting. She gets straight to the point. Jeff, too, is clear about his plan of action, letting April know what he’s doing and when she can expect her request to be fulfilled. Both parties come across as confident professionals who are sure of their needs and capabilities.

> **Aggressive, Passive, or Assertive?**
> 
> While Fine discusses the need to be assertive, she doesn’t cover why people may be reluctant to do so. **Often, people who avoid assertive language and act passively instead do so because they worry it makes them look aggressive—but that’s a misunderstanding.** You can be assertive without being aggressive.
> 
> Psychologists tell us that the difference between being aggressive, passive, or assertive is a matter of who you put first and how you communicate your needs.
> 
> **An aggressive person puts himself first.** He demands and enforces the fulfillment of his own needs and desires, often at the cost of the needs, desires, and boundaries of others. In many cases, an aggressive person uses threats, disrespect, or verbal abuse to get his way. He wants his client reports _now_ , and he doesn’t care whose day he ruins to get them.
> 
> In direct contrast, **a passive person puts everyone else first.** He allows the needs and desires of others to supersede his own and doesn’t act to protect his boundaries. As a result, he often “ends up” in situations where he’s uncomfortable, unhappy, or unsatisfied. As Fine notes, passive people don’t make a strong impression; they belittle their own views, skills, and knowledge, seek the approval of others, and are constantly apologetic. A passive person would rather give up control over when he gets his client reports than step on anyone’s toes.
> 
> **Assertiveness is the middle ground between passiveness and aggressiveness.** An assertive person is respectful of both her own needs and those of the other party. She communicates her needs clearly, in whatever way is most effective; she doesn’t scream when it’s inappropriate and doesn’t bow when it’s unnecessary. She sets her own boundaries and defends them without violating the boundaries of others. In short, if she needs those client reports by Tuesday, she says so. If there’s a problem preventing that, she’ll adjust—but everyone involved knows what her needs, goals, and expectations are.
