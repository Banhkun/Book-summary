## Exercise: Rescue a Conversation

Sometimes, despite our best efforts, a conversation just fizzles out. In this exercise, you’ll consider what you could have done to rescue or lengthen a conversation that ended earlier than you wanted.

* * *

Recall a recent conversation that fizzled out or trailed off. Who were you talking to, where were you, and what was the conversation (broadly speaking) about?

List three things you remember your conversational partner saying that you could have followed up on. For each one, write a follow-up question you could have asked to dig more deeply into the topic. (For example: You could have asked for additional information, found out how they felt or thought about something, or learned how or why they got involved in a situation they mentioned.)

Now, list at least three things that stood out to you about the location or situation you were in, the person’s appearance or possessions, or their behaviors and quirks. For each one, write a question you could have asked to learn more about them, their history, or their thoughts and feelings in the moment.

Think back and consider your responses to the questions your conversational partner asked you. Note down a short or one-word answer you gave when you could have responded with more detail. Now, write out a more detailed answer that could have invited further discussion on the subject.
