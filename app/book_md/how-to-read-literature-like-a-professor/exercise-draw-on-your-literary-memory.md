## Exercise: Draw on Your Literary Memory

When you read a novel or watch a film, you want to keep your eyes open for any references to or adaptations of the sacred texts. Practice looking for intertextual references of Shakespeare’s classics.

In the musical film _West Side Story_ , two New York City street gangs are in conflict. The Jets are led by Riff after Tony leaves the gang, and The Sharks are led by Bernardo. One night, Tony and Bernardo’s sister, Maria, meet at a dance and fall in love. Both The Sharks and The Jets are furious, and the conflict reaches a boiling point. Just before Tony and Maria are able to run away together, Tony is shot and killed. Maria holds him in her arms as he dies. The tragedy of Tony’s death is enough to end the conflict between the rival gangs.

This is a musical adaptation of one of Shakespeare’s classic plays. Write down which one you think it might be.

If you thought of _Romeo and Juliet_ , you were right! Now that you know it’s the story of _Romeo and Juliet_ translated into 1950’s New York, think about the similarities and differences in the plotline. Write your thoughts below.

Think of one of your favorite books or movies. Can you find thematic or narrative allusions to any sacred texts within the story? What are the similarities and differences?

How does that allusion deepen the meaning of your favorite book or movie? What might the similarities and differences between your favorite work and the sacred text illuminate?
