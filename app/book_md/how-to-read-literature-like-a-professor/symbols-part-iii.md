## Symbols Part III: Actions as Symbols

For most readers, recognizing objects as symbols comes easy, but it can be quite difficult to understand that **actions can act as symbols, too**.

Authors choose the actions that happen in a narrative carefully—each action must serve the plot in a novel, but some will also illuminate larger themes.

### Violence

Violence is prevalent in literature, but it is important to know that **acts of violence are always a symbol for some greater kind of suffering**. The range of possibilities for what that suffering might be is too large to generalize. The answer might be psychological, spiritual, historical, social, or political.

  * The exception to this rule is mystery novels. In a mystery, the murder is clear-cut because the complexities lie in the uncovering of the truth. 



In literary violence, **the complexities lie in the significance or thematic meaning of the violence itself**.

There are two kinds of violence in literature:

  1. A specific harm that characters inflict on each other or themselves
  2. General harm that is caused by the author as part of the narrative



The only real difference between these two kinds of literary violence is that **in the second type, there is no guilty party other than the author**. Even an “accidental” act of violence in a novel has been carefully planned by the author, with a specific purpose in mind.

Whether violence is inflicted by a character within the story or the author crafting the story, the reader should look carefully at what the violence might signify beyond the specific harm done to the specific character.

#### Go Down, Moses

William Faulkner’s _Go Down, Moses_ is a great example of violence as metaphor in literature. In it, character Ike McCaslin finds out that his grandfather had a daughter by one of his slaves, Eunice. Years later, completely blind to the wrongness of his actions, the grandfather also gets his daughter Tomasina pregnant. Eunice responds by killing herself.

As a reader, of course, we see Eunice’s violence toward herself as a literal act of personal despair. But Faulkner also challenges us to see it as a powerful metaphor for the lack of humanity in slavery. Eunice has no control over her own life or the life she brings into the world. The only choice she is given is the choice to die.

The title _Go Down, Moses_ helps the reader grasp this metaphor. In the Bible, Moses is asked to “go down” and “set my people free” from Egypt. In the story, no one appears to go down and set Eunice free. Therefore, she has to set herself free in the only way she’s able.

### Sex

In literature, sex and sexuality are used symbolically in two different ways:

  1. Encoded sex: The author uses symbolic imagery to imply sex in a scene, but the reader never sees the sexual act take place. 
  2. Explicit sex: The author uses a sex scene to symbolize a larger theme in the story. 



#### Encoded Sex

**Sex is often disguised in literature** and in film. At first, the primary reason for sexual symbolism was censorship. Artists were not allowed to depict sex on the page or on screen, so they had to find other ways of getting the point across.

  * Example: In the film _North by Northwest_ , Cary Grant kills the villain and saves Eva Saint from falling off a rock cliff. The scene then cuts to a sleeping compartment on a train, where Grant is pulling Saint up into the bed. The next shot, which ends the film, is of a train entering a tunnel. This is an example of sexual symbolism. 



Once Freud published _The Interpretation of Dreams_ in 1900, literature began to change. Suddenly, writers began to realize that they could encode sex into their work. And readers learned that sex might be encoded into their reading, as well.

  * Example: In Ann Beattie’s “Janice,” a young woman named Andrea has an affair. Her lover buys her a bowl, which she begins to obsess over. For some reason, she will not allow her husband to put his keys in her bowl. This is an example of a sexually coded image. Andrea’s bowl represents her identity as a sexual woman. It was gifted to her by a lover. Now, Andrea can’t allow her husband’s keys to enter her bowl. Keys, too, are a common sexual symbol for male sexuality, especially when associated with a lock. 



Even in our age of explicit sexuality, **readers should be on the lookout for images and scenes that evoke sex and sexuality** , even in things as common as keys in a bowl.

#### Explicit Sex

Censorship ended in the United States in 1959. Less than a century later, most sexual writing has become either cliché or pornographic. **So authors only include sex scenes in a novel as a literary device, when they are trying to illuminate other themes** , as well.

When analyzing a sex scene, you really can’t go wrong. Just like in life, sex can mean many things and have many consequences, such as

  * Passion
  * Submission
  * Rebellion
  * Resignation
  * Domination
  * Enlightenment
  * Childbearing



##### Examples:

In John Fowle’s _The French Lieutenant’s Woman_ , the character Charles is a young man who is about to enter into an arranged marriage, which he dreads. One night, he finds himself in the hotel room of a woman named Sarah, who is not his intended. He carries her to the bed and “ninety seconds” later, they have made love. For Charles, Sarah is not just a woman, she is all the possibilities that he is giving up in life by getting married. Charles is only given a short chance to explore those options, literally and metaphorically.

In Henry Miller’s novels, there are a lot of explicit sexual scenes. Miller uses these sex scenes to celebrate his freedom from censorship and claim his freedom as a writer.

In Vladimir Nabokov’s _Lolita_ , the small amount of explicit sex in the novel is predatory and evil. However, Nabokov manages to engage the reader’s sympathy just enough to implicate us in the act. The sex scene is a mirror of the narrative—an exploration of the reader’s philosophical tolerance.

In Edna O’Brien’s novels, sex is a political act. Sex gives her female characters the chance to throw off the religious and societal restrictions that have repressed them.

In order to read like a professor, you have to be able to **look beyond the sex and draw conclusions about how the themes of the novel could be represented there**.
