## Your Turn to Read Like a Professor

On your own time, read the story “The Garden Party” by Katherine Mansfield.

(Shortform note: You can find the story online for free here.)

When you’ve finished the story, answer the questions below. Read carefully and practice all of the strategies for interpretation that you’ve learned from this book. Write or type your answers to stay accountable, and don’t look at any other sources for help.

  1. What does the story signify? That is, what do you interpret as the story’s meaning?
  2. Why do you think that? What elements of the story gave you that interpretation? 



Once you’ve answered the questions for yourself, compare your own answers with some of these other interpretations:

  * The story is about the indifference of the family in the story to the working class living down the hill. 
  * The story is about the young girl’s guilt over having a party while others mourn, and the indifference of the upper class to the struggle of others. 
  * The story uses the metaphor of birds and flight as a means of showing the family as insulated from the lower class. One character is described as a butterfly and the party guests are described as birds. The family home is similar to an aerie up high on the hill. Throughout the story, the main character is trying her wings and gaining some independence, but ultimately chooses to stay in her lofty moral high ground. 



If your responses were anything like these interpretations, you should give yourself a good grade. Here is another, more in-depth interpretation of the story:

When Laura goes down the hill to visit the house of the dead man, she has actually gone into Hades. Laura is a representation of the mythical character Persephone.

That makes Mrs. Sheridan, Laura’s mother, a representation of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture and fertility. The proof? Throughout the story, Mrs. Sheridan has a fascination with flowers and her children.

Laura’s adventure down the hill mirrors Persephone’s trip to Hades in many ways:

  * When Laura crosses the broad road at the bottom of the hill, it is reminiscent of crossing the River Styx into Hades.
  * Hades has a three-headed dog at the gate, and Laura meets a dog at the gate in front of the dead man’s house. 
  * The Golden Bough, which is the admission ticket into Hades in the myth, is replaced by the gold daisies on Laura’s hat. 
  * In the myth, Persephone comes across a woman named Sibyl, who has a cave full of written oracles. In Mansfield’s story, Laura meets an old woman who has newspapers at her feet. 
  * Laura’s brother, Laurie, is a representation of Hermes from the myth. In the myth, Hermes escorts Persephone out of Hades in a chariot. In this story, Laurie comes to pick up Laura from the dead man’s house. 
  * Theme: The myth of Persephone is about a young woman acquiring knowledge of death. The same could certainly be said about “The Garden Party.”



If you didn’t make any of these associations in your reading of the story, that’s okay. If you understood the story in terms of what actually transpired in the plot, you have still gotten something out of it. You managed to come to your own conclusions, and that is the first step of reading intelligently.
