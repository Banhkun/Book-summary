## Exercise: Conduct an Acceleration Audit

Gathering more information about your company’s current acceleration processes may inspire you to create new and more effective approaches. Perhaps, for example, you have some questions or concerns about how training is conducted. Use this exercise to evaluate whether there is room for improvement moving forward.

* * *

Choose to focus on one acceleration process that you believe is failing within your company. Identify three individuals involved in that process and write five questions below that you can ask them to better understand the history of that approach, how it’s currently being implemented, and how it could be improved.

Armed with answers to your questions, consider whether you have any new proposals for implementing changes in the acceleration process reviewed. Write any such proposals in the box below. Be sure to explain how the proposal is informed and supported by insight gleaned from your interviews.
