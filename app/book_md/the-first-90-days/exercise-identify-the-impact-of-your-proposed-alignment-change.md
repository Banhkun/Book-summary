## Exercise: Identify the Impact of Your Proposed Alignment Change

Any change to your company’s strategic direction, structure, processes, or skills will have a wide spectrum of implications. Use this exercise to identify potentially undesirable consequences of a particular proposed change.

* * *

Using the box below, create “if/then” statements to help understand the broader consequences of trying to achieve alignment in a particular manner. For example, maybe you are seeking to create greater alignment between the company’s strategic direction and skills by hiring a new team of app developers. Work through the natural logic of such a choice. “If we hire more app developers, then we will need a bigger budget. If we need a bigger budget, we may have to siphon off funds from the marketing team. If we siphon off funds from the marketing team, the VP of Marketing will likely build a blocking alliance against the project” and so on. Write out these statements below to more effectively anticipate the impact of any given alignment change.
