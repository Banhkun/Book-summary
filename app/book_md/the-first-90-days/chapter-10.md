## Chapter 10: Accelerate Everyone

**Independent research has shown that the nine principles reviewed thus far can help decrease the time for you to reach the break-even point by up to 40%.** But not only do you benefit from investing in a smooth transition into your new role, so does your company. A successful leadership transition can help businesses by speeding up project implementation and creating competitive advantages. But a poor leadership transition can cost a company millions of dollars and substantially slow growth. For that reason, implement the tenth principle for success in your first 90 days:**help develop strong acceleration (or transition) systems that can be implemented not only at the top leadership levels but across all team members.** Indeed, you can use the 90 day model described here to transition employees at all levels and improve teamwork, relationships, and outputs.

Consider these key design principles for implementing a successful acceleration model:

#### Focus on the Crucial Transitions

All companies are undergoing many transitions simultaneously. **Take a step back and identify where acceleration is most needed and where it would most benefit the company.** Gather data about transition frequencies such as where and when there will be movement in the company such as onboardings, inboardings, promotions, or lateral changes.

One way to organize this information is to create a “transition heat map” which identifies all movement, where it’s happening, what kind it is, and the level it’s happening at. This can be done by identifying each unit and the types of transitions that might affect it. Then, use four common transition categories (onboarding, promotion, geographic moves, lateral moves) and indicate whether such transitions are likely to be of high, medium, or low intensity in a given group. Use this map to identify and plan for acceleration priorities.

#### Change Failing Processes

Your company may already be engaged in certain practices that undermine the goal of an effective acceleration process. Identify and target those failures, which may include:

  * Poor expectation setting as a result of ineffective communication and information sharing with and between leaders 
  * Not accounting for STARS when hiring/promoting 
  * Pushing for too much too soon from leaders who don’t yet know how to manage risks in their new roles
  * Leaving leaders to their own devices by using a sink or swim method
  * Promoting based on past performance alone, without considering capacity for growth in the new role
  * Using training programs that are ineffectual, poorly timed, or non existent
  * Overemphasizing technical skills during hiring at the expense of considering a prospective employee’s cultural fit within the company
  * Poor succession planning which spreads people too thin during transition as they try to navigate multiple roles simultaneously
  * Not connecting new leaders with key stakeholders who can help inform goals and next steps. 



**Evaluate the Efficacy of Current Acceleration Processes**

**The following questions will help you gain a more sophisticated understanding of how your company is currently executing support during transitions** :

  * What acceleration processes are currently in place and how well are they working?
  * What materials or tools are currently being used (such as coaching or self-guided materials)? What are the costs and benefits of those materials? 
  * Is the current approach piecemeal or haphazard across certain areas (such as onboarding or promotions)? Or is there a common vision and model being implemented throughout the company?
  * Are important stakeholders playing needed support roles during transition?
  * Is HR currently structured to support transitions through its systems and processes for information sharing? If not, what resources do they need to do so?



#### Create a “Common Core Model”

**A “common core model” means that consistent framing, tools, and visions are used for all transitions within the company.** Such an approach gives employees the language and knowledge they need to understand the essential transition concepts discussed earlier in this book (e.g., understanding the STARS stages, planning conversations with your boss, securing alliances, and so on).

#### Consider Timing

**Be deliberate about what type of support to deliver and at what point in the transition such support would be most effective.** Early on, for example, the emphasis may be on supporting accelerated technical, cultural, and political learning. Later support, however, may be oriented to broader topics such as strategic vision and securing early wins. If support for all of the above is offered simultaneously, it may be too overwhelming. Similarly, if the support is not offered at the proper time, it may be ignored because it does not feel pertinent to the current transition stage. Remember too that the preparation for a new job begins well before the first day of work. Consider, therefore, what resources (e.g., access to data, reports, coaching support, and so on) you can offer to new leaders before their official transition.

#### Build Structure into Your Processes

**Create structured tools to ensure that essential learning does not get lost in the shuffle.** This could take the form of preset coaching meetings, regular cohort events, and so on. Get coaches on board as early as possible so that they can be part of the diagnostic process and thus have insight into the pieces at play.

#### Customize as Needed

**Be aware of how different transition categories may demand specific kinds of support.** For example, promotions include their own challenges as individuals are likely building up new skill sets while simultaneously changing their relationships with others, including how they interact and exert authority. Support resources should therefore be focused on developing self awareness around these questions and outlining personal development plans. By contrast, onboarding to a new company will often mean culture shock, focused relationship building, and appropriately aligning expectations. Consider uniquely applicable resources for those challenges such as connecting new hires to key stakeholders as they get a lay of the land.

#### Prioritize Resources Appropriately

It’s important to**recognize that different investments of time and resources will be needed for different levels of leadership.** Executives curry such influence that they will often merit highly individualized transition resources through, for example, robust coaching support. And while it might not be feasible to provide those same tools to leaders at other levels, you may still be able to provide them with key tools such as virtual workshops or self-guided materials. Regardless of the leadership level involved, it’s essential to assess the costs and benefits of different tools and then deliberately match them to different roles to maximize your return on investment.

#### Approach Leadership Transitions as a Team

Although it’s common for an entity like human resources to be taking the lead with job transitions, other individuals such as bosses, peers, and direct reports can provide essential support. However, it’s important to clarify expectations for everyone involved and help each actor understand how they will also benefit from promoting a smooth onboarding process.

> **Transition coaching versus development coaching**
> 
> Your company may want to consider using professional coaching services as a resource for accelerating job transitions. Bear in mind, however, that the background and skills necessary for effective transition coaching are distinct from those seen in more common career development coaching. A transition coach will be helping a new hire evaluate not only his own competencies and goals but will also be assessing how they fit into the overall business framework of the new company or group. Additionally, a transition coach will focus on creating an actionable plan and strategy for success in the new hire as part of the greater group or business model, rather than focusing on the personal psychological or skill development of the one employee participating.

#### Integrate Your Talent Management Systems

**If recruitment and onboarding teams never work together or talk to each other, tensions and gaps are more likely to emerge.** For example, the onboarding team may have excellent tools in place to support new hires in learning about the company culture, but if the recruitment team is not considering cultural fit in the hiring process, those tools may go to waste. Accordingly, **communicating a shared vision across the hiring process is essential.** Similarly, recruiters may have invaluable information (such as assessment results, interview notes, and so on) to inform the onboarding team’s approach. Don’t let that be a missed opportunity by siloing them. Encourage recruiters to gather important transition information from step one and then share it throughout the acceleration process.
