## Introduction

Professional transitions, such as shifting locations, moving internally to a new unit, or accepting a promotion, are becoming more and more common, as most individuals will experience an average of 13.5 major transitions for 18.2 years of work, or one transition every 1.3 years. Such transitions present great opportunities and also many challenges as a new role allows you to start fresh and have a strong impact but also exposes you to new and heightened scrutiny**. Once opinions are formed about you, they’re hard to change.** So starting off on the right foot is key. That’s why this book focuses on your first 90 days in a new role.

Those first three months present an opportunity for you to effectively and efficiently move towards the “break-even point.” **The break-even point is the juncture at which you have given as much to a role or to a team as you have received from it.** Your company has chosen to invest resources in hiring, onboarding, and training you. Your goal will be to return that investment as effectively and efficiently as possible.

The best way to do so is by creating **virtuous cycles** early on which support you in developing the trust of your team and bosses, building respect for your judgment, and creating a foundation for ongoing success in your role. To support you in developing these virtuous cycles, this book will discuss ten key principles (one per chapter) to apply in your first 90 days of a new role, including:

  1. Preparing yourself effectively for the upcoming change 
  2. Accelerating your learning by being a sponge and also focusing energies on what is most important early on
  3. Matching your transition strategy to the unique needs of your company’s situation by diagnosing those needs properly
  4. Negotiating for success by effectively creating and communicating expectations with your boss and team 
  5. Securing early wins to build credibility, access the resources that you need, and create a virtuous cycle
  6. Achieving alignment by ensuring that the structures in place properly support your articulated strategy 
  7. Building your team by focusing on the fit and framework that will position you to achieve your goals 
  8. Creating alliances and coalitions to gain essential influence
  9. Managing your various personal and professional needs so that they transition in tandem
  10. Supporting the transitions of others because together you’ll sink or float



Throughout the book, we’ll also identify traps that you may face early on which can create **vicious cycles** and ultimately will undermine trust and credibility and create long-term barriers to accessing the resources and support that you need to achieve your goals. Examples of such traps include:

  * Being too attached to your previous approach to success. You are now in a new role and some things will have to change.
  * The “action imperative” or the temptation to engage in concrete action too quickly, before you have the foundation to do so well. We will come back to this term repeatedly. 
  * Aiming too high. Be realistic about your objectives early on so that you don’t create unworkable expectations.
  * Being too scattered. You’ll have a lot to learn about, but watch out for getting pulled in too many directions and losing a sense of cohesion within your role.
  * Swooping in with all of the answers. Of course, you want to impress your new team, but if you try and create change too quickly without sufficient time and information you risk creating resentment and frustration among those who have already been there.
  * Focusing on hard skills (such as technical abilities) at the expense of soft skills (such as developing community and evaluating the company culture and politics).
  * Neglecting horizontal relationships (peers and stakeholders) because you’re too eager to appease and impress within the vertical ones (bosses, supervisors).



Ultimately, all job transitions present unique opportunities as well as challenges. This book will position you to effectively access the former while efficiently fending off the latter.
