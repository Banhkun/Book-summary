## Exercise: Confronting Possible Areas of Weakness

Avoiding or shying away from your areas of weakness or growth will only come back to bite you later on as your new role demands more leadership and responsibility. However, by acknowledging these shortcomings head-on, you can fend-off the possibility of erecting your own roadblocks to success.

* * *

Focus on one personal weakness which might make the job transition difficult (refer back to the list of examples in Chapter 9 or identify one of your own). Recall a time when that personal difficulty previously manifested itself and write down the effects that it had on you and those around you.

What does that example tell you about how your suboptimal behavior might rear its head again in the future? Are there any steps you can take to avoid or recognize catalysts for that behavior before it results in negative consequences for your current job transition?
