## Exercise: Rate the Desirability of Your Early Win Project

Before you commit to an early win project, make sure itâ€™s the one that maximizes impact and progress towards your greater picture goals. Evaluate the relative strength of different possible early win projects by rating them using the questions below. The higher the score for a proposed early win, the better situated you may be to move forward with it.

* * *

How likely is it that this early win project will also support your longer-term goals? (Very likely to not likely at all). Why do you think that is true?

How likely is it that this early win project will also support needed behavioral or cultural change? (Very likely to not likely at all). What are some examples of such change that the project could support?

How strongly does this early win project align with the expectations articulated for my role? (Very strongly to not strongly at all). Which expectations align well?

How many of the needed resources for implementing this early win project do I already have access to or can I readily gain access to? (Most resources to very few resources). Write out examples of available resources, below.
