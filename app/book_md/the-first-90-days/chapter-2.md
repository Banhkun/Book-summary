## Chapter 2: Accelerate Your Learning

Now that you have started your new job, the second principle for setting yourself up for success in your first 90 days will be to **effectively and efficiently absorb as much information about the company as possible** so that you can incorporate it into your plans moving forward. Failing to set aside time to accommodate this essential learning process will likely undercut your credibility and your long-term success.

Consider, for example, Chris, who accepted a lateral move from an established software services company to a smaller struggling software developer. Upon starting in his role, Chris quickly decided that the new company’s systems were totally ineffectual and would require a complete revamp in line with how his prior company had set things up. His efforts to fundamentally alter the company’s structure, however, surprisingly resulted in a decrease rather than increase in productivity. Chris’s mistake was in assuming that what worked in one company would also work in another and in failing to allocate time to understanding why things had been done in a particular way and which positive aspects of the new company’s work might be worth holding onto.

In order to avoid these same missteps in your new position, commit to developing a robust learning process early on. First, beware of certain roadblocks that may thwart your learning, such as:

  * **Not setting aside time at the onset to clearly identify the most important questions that you need to ask.** It’s hard to prioritize the step of actually outlining a learning plan when you are overwhelmed by a fire hose of new tasks and information, but it will prove a worthy investment of time.
  * **Ignoring the history of the organization.** Before you enact sweeping changes, make sure you have a clear understanding of the undergirding rationale and bases for the current approach. Otherwise, you risk throwing out the good with the bad. 
  * **Moving too quickly.** Remember the action imperative from Chapter One? Your desire to make a mark early on can prevent you from taking the time to observe critical cultural and political components of the company that will inform your long-term success. 
  * **Being a know it all.** Don’t come in purporting to have all the answers before you have developed a clear understanding of the unique needs of your new role or new company. By bulldozing ahead without taking time to learn, you risk undermining possible sources of internal support who may be invested in the way things are currently done. 



Ultimately, it’s important to approach your learning process as an investment. **You are building a path for developing _actionable insights_ or knowledge that creates well-informed choices earlier on and establishes a foundation for reaching the break-even point more quickly. **Remember that to achieve that insight you will want to learn both (1) effectively (by thoughtfully evaluating what is most important to learn and focusing your efforts accordingly) and (2) efficiently (by homing in on the best resources and extracting insights with minimal outputs of time and energy).

### The Learning Agenda

**Start the learning process by drafting a “learning agenda” __ that will explicitly identify key questions to be answered and that will later inform your hypotheses for how to approach new plans of action.** What questions should be included on the agenda? Consider categorizing questions into buckets, including:

  * **The past** —How has performance been for the company up to this point? How have goals previously been identified, measured, and held to account? If performance has been good or poor, what are the root causes? When and how has change historically happened at your company? 
  * **The present** —How does the company define its vision? Who are the key players of competence and influence? What essential processes exist to get things done? Are there cultural or political landmines that could impede your efforts? What spaces might present the best opportunities for early wins?
  * **The future** —What are upcoming opportunities and challenges? How can the former be realized and the latter thwarted? Where do barriers exist and where do new capabilities need to be fostered? Are cultural or political changes needed or coming? 
  * **Technical considerations** —What do you still need to learn about certain technologies or systems?
  * **Interpersonal and cultural considerations** —Which relationships do you need to foster, and how can you learn about cultural norms that are at play?
  * **Political considerations** —What is the shadow organization (unspoken processes and alliances that influence outcomes) of your company and could it present any hurdles to your work? 



Now that you have created a robust and prioritized set of questions to be answered, let’s reflect on where to turn for answers. First, remember that both hard data (financial reports, industry reports, employee surveys, and so on) and soft data (perspectives about cultural and political considerations gleaned through interpersonal data gathering) will be essential for gaining insights.**To help you gather this data** , consider using the following:

**External resources** such as:

  * Customers (ask them how would they compare you to competitors, how they rank your customer service, and so on)
  * Suppliers (get their perspective on whether your internal systems are operating effectively)
  * Distributors (learn more about logistics, product movement, and competitor practices)
  * Outside analysts (engage them on their broad view of the market and industry and how your company fits in)



**Internal resources** such as:

  * Frontline R&D and operations (how are basic processes running and are they being supported by the rest of the company?)
  * Sales (what are relevant trends and market indicators as understood from customer interactions?)
  * Staff (what can you glean from heads of departments such as finance, legal, or human resources?)
  * Integrators (engage with project, plant, and product managers who see cross sections of the company and have good insight into hierarchies and internal politics)
  * Natural historians (old timers who understand the originations of the culture and mythologies of the company) 



### The Learning Plan

Now we know what to ask and whom to turn to. It may be tempting to dive right in, get meetings scheduled, or start perusing reports. But you want to engage with this process deliberately and efficiently. For this reason, it’s essential to create a “learning plan.” Distinct from the learning agenda, which articulated what you need to learn, **a learning plan creates a map for how you’ll approach your learning.** This plan involves an iterative process whereby you will:

1\. Gather data

2\. Analyze it

3\. Create and test hypotheses for how to incorporate this learning into your new role

4\. Repeat

We already discussed several ideas about possible resources for gathering data. But you want to approach those resources systematically to avoid getting skewed insights (for example, due to biases you develop from the first or last people you speak with) and to establish a consistent approach that efficiently maximizes your learning. Some possible structures to utilize in the data gathering process include:

  * **Meeting with all of your direct reports one-on-one and asking them a predetermined set of questions.** Sample topics may include: asking about what they perceive to be opportunities for growth/improvement within the company or soliciting feedback regarding what you should prioritize in your new role. Pay attention to how people respond. Who is assertive and who is hesitant? Who seems aware of other moving pieces and who is focused only on their own role? Then consider looping back in small groups to share take-aways and elicit reactions and responses. 
  * **Using the SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analytical framework for implementing your learning plan.** This can be an excellent diagnostic tool as you check-in with bosses and peers and cross reference understandings and perceptions about the status of the company. 
  * **Employing other tools** such as surveys (to evaluate levels of satisfaction and overall morale), focus groups, reviews of essential past decisions (what records and meeting minutes and memories exist to understand how those decisions were made?), or plant and market tours. 



### The First 30 Days

Now, let’s break this learning plan down into explicit stages and goals for implementation during the first 30 days:

**Before you begin your role:**

  * Learn as much as you can about strategy, structure, performance, and people
  * Gather hard data as is available
  * Engage with external observers such as predecessors, former employees, and business partners to gain another perspective about the culture and politics of your company
  * Meet with your boss for insight into soft data points
  * Start drafting an initial set of questions for your learning agenda and capture initial impressions by writing them down 



**Soon after starting:**

  * Review performance and personnel data as well as operating plans
  * Meet one-on-one with direct reports
  * Test strategic alignment from top down by asking folks in leadership what the company’s goals and strategy are and then tracking whether those permeate throughout other levels of the company
  * Invert the process and ask front-line employees about challenges and opportunities and see if leadership is aware
  * Update your questions and hypotheses about how to effectively make change
  * Review your initial findings with your boss



**By the end of the first month:**

  * Meet with your team to share findings from your assessments
  * Analyze key processes to gain insight into efficacy, quality, and consistency
  * Meet with integrators to understand the intersections and challenges to communication and cohesion, and speak with the company historians to gain insight on culture and politics
  * Update your questions and hypotheses again based on what you have learned
  * Meet with your boss to share additional insights and to discuss how they will inform next steps



By creating your learning agenda and your learning plan you are appropriately taking responsibility for the success of your transition. Remember, however, to also ask for help from bosses, peers, and direct reports throughout your learning process.
