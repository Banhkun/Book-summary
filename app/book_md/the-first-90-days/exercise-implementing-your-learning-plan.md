## Exercise: Implementing Your Learning Plan

Start off on the right foot by proactively developing insight into how your company is currently doing and use that insight to inform your goals for moving forward.

* * *

Interview three different external resources and three different internal resources about the status of your company using the SWOT framework. Jot down notes about how each resource categorizes the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of your company and highlight any areas where there is overlap while underlining answers that seem to be in tension with one another.

How does this information start to inform your understanding about some next best steps in your role?
