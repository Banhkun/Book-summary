## 1-Page Summary

Everybody knows what a story is. But few of us really understand why stories work or how they can make us better at communicating. In _Unleash the Power of Storytelling_ , Rob Biesenbach breaks a story down into its fundamental pieces to explain how **you can use storytelling to make your message more engaging and compelling**.

Great storytelling requires a complex balance of content, mechanics, and delivery. But if you take the time to get it right, you can tell a story that captivates listeners, affects their emotions, and persuades them to act (whether you’re pitching an idea, interviewing for a job, selling a product, or trying to get people behind a social cause).

Biesenbach is a speechwriter and strategist who built a second career as an actor. When he began taking acting classes at The Second City improv theater in Chicago, he realized that the tools that help actors convey emotions and messages onstage could also help his corporate clients communicate more effectively. In the book, he explains exactly how great storytelling and great acting are alike, and how you can use their shared techniques to your advantage.

In this guide, we’ll first look at what a story consists of and what pieces make it work. Then we’ll examine why stories have such power to move us, convince us, and get us to act. Finally, we’ll look at how you can **create a story that’s perfectly tuned to your audience** , matching the story you tell to the message you want them to receive.

We’ll also compare Biesenbach’s ideas to other popular theories about storytelling, and we’ll put his insights into the context of the research on how stories affect us. Though Biesenbach primarily talks about telling a story verbally, many of his strategies can also help you when you’re writing a story, so we’ll look at how his advice compares with storytelling advice from writers.

### What Is a Story?

We encounter stories every day, but few of us stop to think about how we’d define a story. A story is a narrative that draws its power from its fundamental structure, its delivery, and its ability to affect listeners down to the neural level. In this section, we’ll look at the ingredients that Biesenbach identifies as key to a story’s power to move and persuade its audience.

#### What Are the Essential Elements of a Story?

Biesenbach defines a story as an account of **a character who pursues a goal and encounters obstacles along the way**. A narrative that lacks one of these fundamental elements (character, goal, and obstacle) isn’t a story and won’t affect listeners like a story can. Because we’re familiar with stories that include a character, a goal, and obstacles, we expect these elements in a story and feel disappointed when those expectations aren’t met.

The character’s efforts in the face of obstacles drive the story forward. A relatable character—one who shares values or circumstances with your audience—makes an abstract brand, mission, or message more concrete. Every story needs a character who embodies the message and makes it more human to listeners.

For example, the knitwear brand babaà—which makes the cult-favorite cardigan a New Yorker writer spotted on “organic moms” across Instagram—tells a story about how it makes its sweaters with local materials and artisans. When the brand names the shepherds who tend its sheep and the knitters who run its factory, these people become characters in the story. They make the company feel more relatable because we can understand working in a family-run workshop or carrying on a traditional craft, even if we haven’t done those things ourselves.

> **How a Character Changes How We See Things**
> 
> Biesenbach’s definition of a story might surprise you if you think of a story as a plotline or a series of events, but he’s not alone in putting more emphasis on characters than plotlines when articulating what makes a story a story. In _Wired for Story_ , Lisa Cron offers her own definition: “A story is how what happens affects someone who is trying to achieve what turns out to be a difficult goal, and how he or she changes as a result.”
> 
> Cron explains that though we tend to think that a story is about events, it’s really about the character’s response to those events. In fact, she thinks that the external events of the story—like the obstacles that Biesenbach talks about—only matter insofar as they push the character into an internal struggle. During that struggle, the character realizes that something important is at stake—this relates to the goal that Biesenbach explains your character must have—and that they have to act.
> 
> You ask your listeners to follow along with what your character is doing and thinking to change what your listeners do and think. Cron believes that the entire purpose of a story is to change how your audience sees things. After all, once you change how they see things, the members of your audience are more likely to be willing to change how they do things.

#### What Makes a Story Engaging?

You can think of a character, a goal, and an obstacle as the basic requirements for a story. But even with those elements in place, not every story holds a listener’s attention. Biesenbach says**a good story needs some additional characteristics to make it engaging**.

##### An Emotional Appeal

First,**a good story appeals to the listener’s emotions**. An emotionally relevant story feels more compelling in the moment and remains more memorable later on. Biesenbach points to research findings that memories of emotional events tend to be stronger (and stick around longer) than memories of events that don’t have strong emotions attached. So we remember a story that engages our emotions—for example, one where we felt happy for the character’s success—more clearly than one that doesn’t.

(Shortform note: A growing body of research confirms that an emotional story engages us by activating a wide range of processes in the brain. Brain regions that process language, emotion, and complex information activate in response to stories, as do parts of the brain involved in prediction. The brain waves of the listener also synchronize with those of the storyteller. That might be why Will Storr, author of _The Science of Storytelling_ , says that storytelling is a way of “communicating with emotions rather than facts.” He explains that the most engaging stories appeal to emotions like hope and tap into narratives that people want to be a part of.)

##### An Accessible Theme

Next, **a good story has a theme that people relate to** : Even though listeners might have never experienced the situation you’re talking about, the story should call on a universally relatable experience to create common ground. For example, you don’t have to live in Brooklyn or own a bookstore to know what novelist Emma Straub is talking about when she says that she hopes her bookstore will appear on “children’s internal maps of their neighborhood.” Her story about opening Books Are Magic appeals to themes of community and belonging.

(Shortform note: Though Biesenbach is primarily talking about telling a story rather than writing one, writers tend to agree with his advice to find a theme that will resonate with your audience. In _On Writing Well_ , William Zinsser explains that you need to find humanity in your story: a shared experience or a deeper truth that lies beneath the specific situation. Zinsser thinks that humanity is why we read books about people who find themselves in circumstances we’ve never experienced ourselves: Their resilience in the face of challenges or their persistence in their search for meaning feels relatable to us.)

##### A Point of View

In addition to telling your listeners something about themselves, **a good story tells them something about you**. Biesenbach explains that by revealing something about who you are, the right story humanizes you. It illustrates how you see the world, communicates how you’re unique, and makes you memorable. For example, a childhood story about how you accidentally caused a neighborhood blackout could either reveal how your love of electrical engineering began or illustrate why you never do electrical work: It all depends on your point of view.

(Shortform note: Your point of view isn’t incidental to the story you tell: Experts agree that it’s a crucial part of how you tell the story and why you tell it. In _On the Origin of Stories_ , Brian Boyd argues that evolutionarily, fictional narratives serve the crucial purpose of helping us understand how other people experience the world. This helps us increase our capacity for empathy, a skill that’s necessary for cooperation and thus survival. Some social animals, like honeybees, even have a rudimentary form of narrative that helps them understand each other.)

##### An Appeal to Values

Finally, **a good story transcends its particular details to convey a larger message,** often about values you share with your listeners. People who feel involved in your story because of those shared values will remember that story. For example, a story about how your neighborhood banded together to replant a vegetable garden that was washed out in a storm will appeal to listeners who value collaboration, resilience, and mutual aid.

(Shortform note: A story that illuminates your values can connect those values to the actions you want people to take, which proves helpful when you want to convince people to get behind a cause. One public policy lecturer explains that in these situations, you can use a “public narrative” that combines three kinds of stories: a “story of self,” which explains how you were called to a given cause; a “story of us,” which illustrates your goals; and a “story of now,” which presents an urgent challenge to your community’s values. A public narrative draws on these stories to unite people behind actions they can take to uphold shared values in their community.)

Though many of us think we instinctively know how to tell a good story, **we often miss the mark**. Biesenbach says that much of the time, that happens because the story is missing one of its essential characteristics. He explains some of the ways that things tend to go wrong:

  * If a story doesn’t have **a character whom listeners care about** , it doesn’t feel like the problem you’re describing affects real people.
  * If a story lacks **strong conflict** (which comes from the tension between the character and the obstacle), it doesn’t hold the audience’s attention. 
  * If a story doesn’t have **high enough stakes** , the listener doesn’t feel motivated to learn how the character solves the problem. 
  * If a story is missing **clear cause and effect** , the chain of events sounds like a coincidence, which is less meaningful than causality.
  * If a story doesn’t have an **emotional core** , the audience doesn’t feel invested in it. 



> **Troubleshooting Your Plot With an Understanding of Situation vs. Story**
> 
> When a story goes wrong, it’s often because the storyteller has confused two fundamental (and fundamentally different) narrative elements: the situation and the story. Journalist Vivian Gornick made this now-famous distinction in _The Situation and the Story_. Gornick writes that every piece of literature has both a situation and a story.
> 
> The situation is the context, the circumstance, or the plot. The story is the emotional experience and the insight that drives the storyteller to explain the plot. You need both of them to create the engaging character, strong conflict, high stakes, clear causality, and emotional core that Biesenbach explains a story needs.
> 
> You can think of each of the scenarios he outlines above as involving a mistake in the situation, the story, or the relationship between them:
> 
>   * A character who isn’t relatable or isn’t engaging listeners is just going through the motions of the story, and the situation—the character’s internal experience—is either missing or is inadequately connected to the plotline.
> 
>   * A story that doesn’t have enough conflict or tension might have a perfectly crafted narrative arc (a story) but fail to connect the external events of the plot to the character’s internal struggle during their efforts to reach their goal (the situation).
> 
>   * A plotline that feels low-stakes might need more drama in its story—can you compress the timeline or start in the middle of the action?—or you might need to focus more on how the events of the story affect your character (the situation).
> 
>   * A narrative without a clear sense of cause and effect needs a tighter story: You can think of the events of the story as connected with the words “so then” rather than “and then” to naturally start to connect cause to effect.
> 
>   * A story without an emotional core doesn’t have a clear situation: Without an understanding of how the events in the story affect your character’s emotions, your listeners won’t feel strongly about the outcome of the plot.
> 
> 


#### What About the Beginning, Middle, and End?

We tend to think of a story as any narrative with a beginning, a middle, and an end, but Biesenbach thinks **that definition of a story is too simplistic**. He explains that certain things need to happen at each point in the structure to make a story: The structure of beginning, middle, and end on its own is just a series of events ordered from start to finish.

But by crafting each of these phases of your story with a specific purpose in mind, you can use that structure to ensure that you have all the essential pieces of a good story. Biesenbach explains how **you can map the essential elements of character, goal, and obstacles onto the familiar beginning-middle-end arc** :

  * At the beginning, set the scene, introduce your character, and set up an event that pushes your character into action to pursue their goal.
  * In the middle, show the character working to overcome the obstacles that stand between them and their goal. 
  * At the end, give the character (and the listener) a resolution: Either the character reaches their goal or they don’t. (Without a resolution, your story will feel anticlimactic, frustrate listeners, and leave them confused about your message.)



> **Updating the Idea of “Beginning, Middle, and End”**
> 
> Recent psychological research agrees with Biesenbach in that following a predetermined structure when you tell a story is less important than including specific processes in the story. Researchers analyzed around 60,000 narratives—ranging from novels to newspaper articles to TED talks—to see what they had in common. The analysis revealed three processes that the stories had in common: staging, plot progression, and narrative tension.
> 
>   * Staging, which typically happens at the beginning of the story, involves establishing the basic background for the story. Who are the characters and what are the relationships between them? When and where does the story take place?
> 
>   * Plot progression, which starts as soon as the scene is set at the beginning of the story and carries through to its climax, involves moving the story forward and illustrating not only what happens to the character but how they respond to those events.
> 
>   * Narrative tension plays a role throughout the story as the character struggles with the obstacles that the plot puts in their path: processing the situation, figuring out a solution, and building a new understanding of their world.
> 
> 

> 
> The researchers note that these three narrative processes should occur in all stories, regardless of the specific events or characters of the story. Thinking of your story in terms of staging, plot progression, and narrative tension can make it easier to visualize what you need to include than simply thinking in terms of “beginning, middle, and end.”

### Why (and How) Do Good Stories Affect Us?

When Biesenbach talks about the “power of storytelling,” he’s not just talking about a story’s capacity to engage or entertain. He’s also talking about how **a story can change people’s minds, affect their emotions, and persuade them to act**. Stories have this power because they affect us emotionally, physiologically, and intellectually.

In this section, we’ll look at the reasons that well-told stories affect our attention, perception, and emotions. We’ll also examine Biesenbach’s warning about how a story’s power to connect and engage us can be abused.

#### Nature Affects Our Perception of Stories, and Nurture Hones Our Attention to Them

Biesenbach contends that **stories affect us powerfully for two reasons:** stories are uniquely engaging to our brains’ processes of perception, and we’ve been socially trained to pay attention to stories. To explain how these two influences work, he explains them in terms of “nature” and “nurture” and shows how each can help you tell an engaging story.

The “nature” argument is that a good story captivates you because **your brain’s processes of perception are uniquely responsive to stories**. Biesenbach cites research that found that a compelling story causes the brain to release a hormone called oxytocin, which enhances our sense of empathy and motivates us to cooperate with others. Researchers have also discovered that listening to a story activates the same regions of the brain that come online when we personally experience the events described in the story.

(Shortform note: Not everyone agrees with the research that Biesenbach cites on oxytocin. Science writer Ed Yong (_I Contain Multitudes_) once characterized the hype around oxytocin as “dumb and dangerous,” explaining that this hormone has been linked to trust, cooperation, love, empathy, morality, and more. Yong argues that the evidence suggests otherwise, and how oxytocin actually affects the brain is probably a lot messier than the headlines indicate. When thinking about neuroscience, it’s also useful to keep in mind that most studies are very small. This means that many findings are statistically inconclusive: Conclusions that seem correct in a small sample size could be disproven in a study with a larger sample.)

The “nurture” argument is that **stories capture our attention because we learn what to expect from a story very early in life**. By early childhood, we’ve learned a set of basic expectations for what will happen in a story: There will be a setup, a climax, and a resolution. When these expectations aren’t met, we feel disappointed. (Think about what it feels like to listen to someone drone on telling an anticlimactic “story” with no conflict, no tension, and no satisfying resolution.)

> **Nature, Nurture, and Our Expectations for Stories**
> 
> Just as nature and nurture interact to make us particularly responsive to stories, we can understand nature and nurture as influences that shape our expectations for stories, too. For instance, Matthew Salesses, author of _Craft in the Real World_ , characterizes the “craft” of writing as a set of expectations that isn’t neutral. In his view, these expectations aren’t innate.
> 
> Instead, the rules that we think a story should follow correspond to cultural preferences and societal norms, and Western literature looks very different from Asian literature or African literature. For instance, Salesses says that Western critics often criticize African literature for its “flat” characters, or label Asian fiction as “plotless.” But these differences in characterization or narrative arise because stories address culturally specific expectations.
> 
> Some writers have criticized Salesses’s conception of literary norms as too simplistic. But his insight that storytelling entails engaging with your audience’s expectations can help storytellers consider whom they’re talking to and why they’re telling the story as they are.

#### We Engage Differently With Emotions Than With Facts

In addition to engaging our powers of perception and attention, **stories engage our emotions—and emotions are powerful.** Provoking an emotional reaction in your listeners can help you persuade them to see things from your point of view—and to take the action that you want them to take. That’s because we respond to emotions very differently than to facts. For example, researchers tested narratives about climate change and found that stories were much more effective than facts in getting people to decide to act.

To illustrate why it’s so important to tell a story that gets your listeners to feel as well as to think, Biesenbach explains what happened to a patient who developed a tumor in an area of the brain that helps regulate emotions. After the tumor damaged this part of the patient’s brain, he could no longer make decisions. The research suggests that when emotion is impaired, decision-making is compromised as well. **Without emotion, a story won’t push your listeners to act**.

(Shortform note: The patient Biesenbach mentions appears under the pseudonym “Elliot” in neuroscientist Antonio Damasio’s book _Descartes’ Error_. Elliot’s tumor occurred in the frontal lobe, the same part of the brain of interest in the famous case of Phineas Gage, a railroad worker who survived an accident that drove an iron rod through his head, only to have his personality completely change. From these two cases, Damasio hypothesizes that emotion and reason are interdependent and that one can’t function without the other. In that case, it makes sense that a good story should appeal to our logical brains and to our emotions.)

Though we think we make decisions by using reason and logic, **emotions often motivate or even determine our decisions**. If you want your story to motivate your listeners to make a decision, making sure that your story has a solid emotional core is just as important as making sure that you have all your facts straight.

(Shortform note: We do many things that aren’t rational, like relying on emotions instead of facts to make important decisions. Elizabeth Kolbert, author of _The Sixth Extinction_ , explains that researchers continue to learn about the limits of human reason. Research shows that we deny scientific facts, dismiss new evidence, disregard weaknesses in our own arguments, and find emotion more persuasive than evidence because of the ways the human brain has evolved.)

#### The Power of Story Is Often Abused

Because of the way they engage our perception, attention, and emotion, stories are powerful—so powerful that **people use stories to manipulate others**. Biesenbach says that when you tell a story, you should resolve to “do no harm,” but many people don’t make such a commitment. Sometimes, people mislead their listeners by focusing their attention on sensationalized anecdotes that contradict the evidence or telling stories that appeal to their audience’s fear or vanity.

We should be skeptical of the stories that other people tell. Incentives exist for people, including professional storytellers like marketers, journalists, and political pundits, to exaggerate the drama of a story or to push an overly simplified narrative. It’s wise to check the facts, especially if a story sounds overwhelmingly positive or overwhelmingly negative.

(Shortform note: Stories are powerful, but there’s an ethical line between using a story to make people want to listen to you and telling them a story that’s not based in reality. In _All Marketers Are Liars_ , Seth Godin draws a useful distinction between fibs and frauds. Fibs are stories that bend the truth in a way that benefits both you and your listener. But frauds are stories that deceive in a way that benefits only you and not your listener.)

> **How Stories Engage the Brain**
> 
> We know intuitively that stories grab our attention, but scientists say this happens because stories engage our brains more fully than other kinds of information**.** Psychologists explain that it feels so natural to think in stories because we do it all the time. This is the brain’s natural form of information processing, one that brings more regions of the brain online than when interacting with other kinds of information.
> 
> Similarly, neuroscientists have found that stories capture people’s attention and make it easier for them to process new information. Stories help our brains imagine social experiences that we’ve never been through ourselves. When we become emotionally engaged in a story, our brains become less likely to critically evaluate the “facts” in the story. That means that stories based on exaggerations or even outright falsehoods are just as engaging to the brain as those based on truth, and it helps explain how stories can be used to deceive people.

### How to Create and Tell a Great Story

After establishing what a good story is and why it’s so powerful, Biesenbach dedicates much of the book to explaining exactly how to create and tell stories. He explains that **this is a process that anyone can learn**.

In this section of the guide, we’ve divided Biesenbach’s strategies into two groups: strategies that can help you create a meaningful story and strategies that can help you deliver that story in an engaging manner.

#### Create a Story From Scratch

When you have a message to convey to an audience, it takes time to craft a story that’s perfectly suited for the job. Biesenbach outlines a process you can use to create a story that matches the audience you need to reach and the message you want to deliver.

##### Find Story Ideas

First, **start** **cultivating a collection of stories** that speak to your values and engage your areas of expertise. Coming up with a story in a pinch can feel difficult, so Biesenbach recommends noticing the stories that play out in your everyday life. It also helps to stay alert to stories in the books, journals, films, and other narratives you consume—you never know when you’ll run across a story that perfectly illustrates one of your core values. You can also interview people about their stories or plumb your own history for stories that relate to the message you want to convey, like calling on a childhood memory of building a treehouse to talk about collaboration.

(Shortform note: Looking for stories in your everyday life sounds great in theory but can prove challenging. In _Made to Stick_ , Chip Heath and Dan Heath agree with Biesenbach’s recommendation to stay on the lookout for great stories that speak to your work or your mission. Additionally, they recommend imagining that you’re wearing a set of core idea lenses that can help you look at everything from the perspective of the message you need to communicate.)

##### Consider Your Audience

Next, **think about your audience** and take an inventory of what you know about your listener. Without a specific listener in mind, you’ll have trouble crafting a story that accomplishes your goals. Consider who they are, what they want, what you have in common with them, and what they know about you or what you represent. Also identify what you’d like your audience to do after hearing your story—adopt your idea, purchase your product, get behind your cause—and any challenges that might stop them from doing so, such as limited time and resources or skepticism about your idea.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that you need to know your audience to craft a compelling story. Vanessa Chase Lockshin, author of _The Storytelling Nonprofit_ , writes that telling a story about your cause or organization will only work if you get to know the audience who will be listening to that story. She recommends going through a discovery process, including talking to real people, to learn who your audience really is. You can even construct a fictional audience member to make the details more concrete in your mind.)

##### Choose Your Character, Goal, Obstacles, and Resolution

Once you have a story and an audience in mind, take some time to **think** **about the character at the heart of your story**. Because your character should help you overcome the challenges or objections you anticipate your audience having, the character needs to be relatable to your listeners. Plus, the resolution of the story—where the character either does or doesn’t overcome the obstacles that block the path to the goal—should drive your message home.

For example, let’s say that you own an apple orchard and need to tell a story that convinces people to buy your apples—but they find apples boring. So when you talk about your grandfather, who planted the orchard, you could explain how he envisioned an orchard full of odd varieties of apples: not Honeycrisp, Gala, or Granny Smith, but Black Oxford, Pink Pearl, or Mountain Rose apples. He likely faced many obstacles: Maybe he had trouble sourcing saplings, dealt with a rare beetle infestation, or felt doubted by other farmers. But when your story reaches the resolution of an orchard full of apples, your listeners appreciate the vision and the care it took to establish and tend that apple orchard.

(Shortform note: It’s crucial to take time to choose the right character because you can’t separate story and character. In _How To Read Literature Like a Professor_ , Thomas C. Foster explains that the plot of a story is driven by the nature of the character. As a literature professor, Foster is talking about the character in the context of a book-length narrative. But he notes that to hold the audience’s attention, a character needs to grow or change—a useful insight for a story of any length. Without growth or change on the part of the character, the obstacles won’t feel challenging, the goal won’t feel worthy of the character’s pursuit, and the ending of the story won’t feel satisfying. The right character sets all of those pieces in motion.)

##### Structure and Focus Your Story

Once you’ve chosen a character and you know the basics of what will happen to him, you need to **craft the structure of your story**. Structure gives shape to the story so that it has conflict and draws the reader into the action. Stories can adopt many different structures, but Biesenbach suggests starting with a simple one that includes:

  * Normal state (the status quo)
  * Inciting incident (the event that upsets the status quo)
  * Turning point (the action the character takes to respond to the inciting event)
  * Conflict (the obstacles that complicate the character’s path)
  * Resolution (the conclusion, where the character either gets what they want or doesn’t, but in either case learns something)



> **Understanding Classic Story Structure**
> 
> Biesenbach’s basic story structure corresponds closely to a classic description of narrative structure. Freytag’s Pyramid, developed by novelist Gustav Freytag, describes a story in five key stages: Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, and Resolution.
> 
> In the Exposition, the writer builds the world of the story. In the Rising Action, the writer introduces the conflict. In the Climax, the conflict reaches its peak. In the Falling Action, the writer lays out the consequences of the conflict and its climax. In the Resolution, the writer shows how the character or the world is changed by the events of the story.
> 
> Of course, not every literary work follows Freytag’s Pyramid, and this might not be the right structure for every story you tell. However, this structure is worth understanding because it serves not only as an example of _what story structure is_ but _how structure functions_ as a conceptual framework for a story.
> 
> _Meander, Spiral, Explode _author Jane Alison notes that while Western literature adopted the convention of a causal arc—the movement from rising conflict to climax to resolution—fiction has taken very different shapes in other cultures. Chinese fiction, for instance, has long emphasized lyricism, pattern, repetition, and rhythm. One traditional East Asian structure called Kishōtenketsu de-emphasizes tension and instead highlights character development, with a four-act structure that includes an introduction, development, twist, and conclusion.

##### Use Emotion to Hook Your Audience

Then, when you’ve nailed down the structure, **evaluate how your story can tap into listeners’ emotions**. Much of a story’s power lies in its ability to make us feel something, and Biesenbach explains that you can use emotion to engage your audience in a few ways.

First, consider what motivates you: Focus less on “what” you do and more on “why” you do it to help center the story on things that matter. If you’re talking about a company or a product, identify the human element in the connections between colleagues or the ties between workers and their communities. You can also connect your story to the values that you and your audience share by emphasizing the importance of community, connecting the story to the values you share, or tapping into the history that unites the members of your audience.

For example, if you’re trying to get people behind an initiative to clean up a local park, you could focus less on the specific steps you’ll need to take and more on the reasons to take on the project in the first place (like preserving a public gathering space or ensuring the park continues to be a hospitable home for endangered birds). You can appeal to your audience’s sense of community by reminding them that all of you consider the neighborhood your home, and together you can take care of that home for everyone’s benefit.

Biesenbach notes that in some cases, it can work to highlight an emotionally resonant lesson in the struggles of a leader, historical figure, or athlete you look up to. (Just watch out for clichés.) And at points throughout your story, it’s OK to express your own emotions: When you talk about the people, memories, and values that you find meaningful, you reveal your own humanity.

(Shortform note: A story you feel passionate about can engage your audience—but only if you enable them to share in the emotions you feel. Essayist Rebecca Solnit cautions that when you tell a story that fires up your emotions, you need to stay conscious of not using up all of the emotion of the story by fixating on those feelings to the exclusion of all other perspectives. Especially when you feel strongly invested in the issue you’re communicating about, you have to leave room for your listeners to feel their own emotions about the story. Keep your focus on presenting a clear point of view, not only telling people how they should feel about an issue.)

##### Edit Your Story

Finally, it’s time to **edit your story**. Include only what’s necessary, or else extraneous details will detract from your message and mute the impact of your story. Biesenbach recommends that you stay on message, focusing on the point you want to make with the story and eliminating any details that don’t serve that point. It’s also a good idea to check that you’ve zoomed in on a single character and streamlined the cast of characters in the story as much as possible.

In order to establish a clear cause and effect, which helps the listener follow the logic of your story, make sure that your narrative has just one turning point. Eliminate any confusing twists and turns. Throughout the story, make sure that you’re using detail judiciously. A time and place can set the scene, and sensory details help make the events of the story more vivid, but you can simplify dates, round numbers, and eliminate proper nouns to sharpen the focus.

(Shortform note: Storytellers can learn something about the importance (and process) of editing from writers. Novelist Alexander Chee offers some advice that’s intended for writers but can also point you in the right direction when you’re preparing a verbal story. Chee recommends writing to the end of the story before making any cuts or edits. Then, revise your story on paper if you can. Or, refer to your printout and retype the entire story to see if a better arrangement occurs to you. Finally, redraft to add any missing pieces and cut anything redundant.)

#### Deliver Your Story

Creating the perfect story is one thing, but actually telling that story to an audience is another. Biesenbach believes that **it’s not just the mechanics of the story but also your delivery of that story that makes it powerful**. In fact, he considers the delivery of a story almost as important (though not quite) as its content. This makes sense to anyone who’s attended a meeting where someone presented dozens of slides without varying their tone of voice, which makes it difficult to engage with their message or remember any of it when the meeting ends.

Drawing on his experience as a speechwriter, strategist, and actor, Biesenbach explains how you can optimize the delivery of your story to keep your audience engaged. Most importantly, **he recommends treating storytelling as a performance**. Perhaps the most important way to do that is to practice your story ahead of time.

(Shortform note: “Practice makes perfect” because of how our brains respond to rehearsal. Scientists have found that each time you practice a physical motion, your brain continues to build myelin, or insulation, around the neurons your brain uses to perform that task. That extra insulation enables electrical signals to travel more quickly, so you get faster at recalling what you’re supposed to do and putting that action into motion. Connecting gestures or movements to your story as you practice it, or even simply pacing around the room while you rehearse, can get multiple areas of your brain involved and improve your recall and performance.)

Telling a story like a performer also means **staying present with your audience and staying connected to the details of the story**. Make your voice, expressions, and gestures animated, and keep your storytelling dynamic by varying the words you emphasize, the volume of your voice, and the speed at which you speak. You can also use your body to tell your story: Match your facial expressions to the emotions in the story, use your hands to reinforce what’s happening in the story, and move your body to mark the passage of time.

(Shortform note: We’ve been honing our ability to deliver a story for tens of thousands of years. Researchers think that storytelling evolved as a method of sharing information, coordinating social behavior, and promoting cooperation. In fact, evolutionary psychologists think that storytelling gave our ancestors a survival advantage during the Ice Age. Though our earliest ancestors didn’t have written language, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they memorized their stories verbatim. In fact, experts today recommend against memorizing your whole story, which takes the spontaneity out of it. Storytelling organization The Moth advises memorizing just the first and last lines to stay more engaged in your telling of the story in between.)

Finally, making the most of the delivery involves **choosing your language thoughtfully**. Use sensory words to make your language more vivid and precise, use metaphors to make abstract concepts concrete, and use comparisons to impart a sense of scale with large numbers (for example, researchers reported that an iceberg “twice the size of Manhattan” separated from Antarctica, which for most of us is easier to visualize than a “600-square-mile iceberg”).

(Shortform note: More isn’t always more when you’re adding description or detail to your story. In _On Writing_ , Stephen King suggests that you should aim to provide enough description to help your audience understand the world of your story, but not so much detail that your listeners won’t engage their imaginations to fill in some of it themselves.)

### How to Craft Stories for Specific Situations

Telling a great story requires the same elements and calls on the same skills regardless of where you tell the story, and most of Biesenbach’s advice applies pretty much anywhere you’d find yourself in front of an audience. But **in some situations, many of us could use more guidance**. In this section of the guide, we’ll explain Biesenbach’s advice for using stories when you give presentations, explain the story of your company, tell your own story, or give a toast or eulogy.

#### A Presentation

Biesenbach thinks that **stories have an important place in presentations** , whether you’re pitching an idea, introducing a product, or giving a lecture. A story can capture your audience’s attention before they know who you are or what you represent and can persuade them to take the action you want them to take.

When you give a presentation, Biesenbach recommends that you should start with a story, end with a story, and tell more stories in between (interspersed with a variety of types of information that communicate your message). Begin your presentation with a story that speaks to a problem your audience cares about—a story that sets up and reinforces the message of the presentation.

Include stories throughout the presentation as needed, making sure to vary the kinds of information that you’re presenting to your audience. (For Biesenbach, this tends to involve one story for each section of the presentation.)

End your presentation with a story that reinforces your message. Biesenbach explains that it can be particularly effective to tell a story that continues the story you told at the beginning of the presentation by adding a twist, appending a postscript, or telling it from another character’s point of view.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that stories make a presentation more effective. In _Talk Like TED_ , Carmine Gallo notes that listeners have an easier time understanding an idea if you use a story to tell them how it works in the real world. But not everyone agrees that you need a story at the beginning, middle, and end of a presentation. One design agency points out that when your entire presentation is built around a story, you only need that one story. But if you’re working on a presentation that’s about a bigger idea, then it makes sense to have two or three stories to provide examples throughout the presentation, perhaps at the beginning, middle, and end. You might even need more than three stories if you’re tackling a big question.)

#### A Company Origin Story

When you need to talk about your company and the work you do, **a great story plays a crucial role in holding your audience’s interest**. Biesenbach explains that businesses, nonprofits, and other organizations need an “origin story” that presents their history and purpose and humanizes the people behind the scenes. A story is more compelling and memorable than a dry corporate timeline, which typically just lists dates and milestones without a narrative arc to connect them.

(Shortform note: Not everyone thinks that a company’s origin story is the important one to tell. Writer John Hagel III thinks that a story is too self-contained because it has an ending. He suggests that in a corporate context, narratives should be about the customer, not the company, and advocates for creating a narrative where the resolution is dependent on the listener’s actions—which can create a compelling call to action.)

When you’re telling a corporate story, you need to **tailor the story to what the company can do for the audience**. Like any good story, this kind of story needs a relatable character and a clear theme. Biesenbach notes you should pick just one value proposition to focus on rather than trying to address everything the company does. Many company origin stories follow a familiar pattern, which you can adapt:

  * The founder encounters a problem. 
  * They make a discovery or invent a solution.
  * They turn their idea into a product or service. 
  * They grow their business. 
  * The business continues to operate on its original values.



(Shortform note: A company origin story can communicate a message to audiences inside and outside your organization. _Just Go With It_ author Mandy Gilbert explains that a company origin story can help a business attract both customers and talent. She recommends a few steps for crafting an origin story in a process that’s less focused on the chronology of the company than Biesenbach’s model. She advises that you start the story with the “aha” moment that kickstarted the company rather than the problem the founder encountered, be transparent about the mistakes you made along the way, and share your excitement with your audience.)

Company origin stories that follow Biesenbach’s template are everywhere, including behind some of your favorite products. For instance, here’s the story of Fender Guitars: In the 1940s, a radio repairman named Leo Fender saw that musicians needed an electric guitar that was more durable, more affordable, and easier to amplify than the archtop guitars they were playing at the time. In 1951, he introduced a solid-body guitar he called the Telecaster, which had a bright sound that made the guitar into a lead instrument. Inventions like the Precision Bass, Stratocaster, Jaguar, Jazzmaster, and Twin Reverb amplifiers followed. Each one was a new tool that changed how people make music, a mission that Fender still pursues today.

(Shortform note: A company origin story isn’t the only story that can help customers see value in your brand. In _Building a StoryBrand_ , Donald Miller outlines a seven-part formula for a marketing story, which casts a customer as the main character and tells a story about a product. The customer wants something and encounters a problem. The brand steps in with a plan to help and tells the customer how they can solve the problem. The negative outcome of not taking action becomes clear, and the positive outcome of following the plan is the happy ending.)

#### Your Own Story

When you interview for a job or introduce yourself to someone new, **you should frame your career as a story**. This makes it more memorable, reveals why you do what you do, and can even help explain an unconventional path if needed. Having a story is also useful when you’re facing a crisis or a decision and need help staying focused on your priorities.

Biesenbach cites the advice to find the “implicit narrative” of your life: Identify the values, character traits, and skills that have driven you through your most significant successes and challenges. Recall feedback that you’ve received from others, and articulate what you’ve enjoyed about your work.

(Shortform note: The “implicit narrative” is just one framework for using stories to think about the purpose you’re trying to fulfill in your career. In _Find Your Why_ , David Mead, Peter Docker, and Simon Sinek recommend having a “purpose discussion” to identify your core values and purpose. They recommend gathering stories and lessons from your life that are meaningful to you, noticing the themes of those stories, and then drafting a purpose statement to articulate the action that your purpose compels you to take and the impact you want that action to have.)

Biesenbach recommends **crafting your personal narrative with the same basic five-part structure he recommends for any story**. At the beginning of your story, you’re enjoying your status quo. Then, an inciting incident disrupts that status quo. Next, the story comes to a turning point, where you respond to the inciting incident. Conflict occurs as you face challenges. At the end, you reach a resolution.

(Shortform note: Biesenbach’s emphasis on the “inciting incident” is grounded in a long tradition of thinking (and writing) about stories. In _Story_ , Robert McKee explains that the inciting incident—the event that compels a character to action—functions as one of the key parts of a story’s structure. As you might notice in the change from “normal state” to “inciting incident” in Biesenbach’s structure above, the inciting incident throws the character out of their status quo and forces them to take action toward their goal. (Their goal might just be to return to the status quo!) The inciting incident poses a question—will the character reach their goal?—and later in the story, the climax or resolution answers that question.)

#### A Toast or Eulogy

**You can use a story to frame your thoughts when you need to make a toast, speak on a special occasion, or deliver a eulogy**. The sentiment you want to communicate can be more impactful in a story, and the momentum of a story can also help you get through an emotional moment.

When you know you’ll need to speak at an emotional moment, Biesenbach recommends practicing your story, bringing your notes with you, pausing if you lose your composure, and minimizing eye contact if it helps you get through the speech.

When composing a eulogy, Biesenbach recommends focusing on one character trait and telling a story that illustrates it. Then, you can explain the impact that that particular incident made on you. If you’re speaking about someone with whom you have a complicated relationship, focus on one thing that you find admirable about the person and speak honestly about it.

(Shortform note: If there’s one thing that writing advice on toasts and eulogies unanimously agrees on (other than the usefulness of telling a story), it’s the importance of specificity. Telling a story about someone who has passed away can help you write a eulogy that feels personal, truthful, specific, and memorable. In a toast honoring newlyweds or honorees at another special occasion, the right anecdote can illustrate the relationship you have with the honorees and relate their specific qualities to the context of the occasion.)
