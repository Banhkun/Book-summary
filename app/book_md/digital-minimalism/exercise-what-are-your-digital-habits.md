## Exercise: What Are Your Digital Habits?

Are you in the grip of a tech addiction?

* * *

How much time would you estimate you spend on your smartphone (or tablet or computer) per day?

If you can, check the settings on your device to find out your actual usage time. How does this compare with your estimate, and why do you think you were close or not?

Describe an example of how intermittent positive reinforcement or social approval is used by one of your favorite apps or websites.

How do you want to change your digital habits, if at all?
