## Exercise: Track Your Progress

The third OKR superpower is tracking your progress to stay accountable. Take time to figure out how you’ll measure and track progress toward your goals.

* * *

Write down one to three of your personal or professional goals for the week, month, or year.

How will you track progress toward these goals? What kinds of measurements will you use? How will your objective scoring system work?

If you find that some of your goals aren’t trackable, how could you revise them to make them more specific and measurable?
