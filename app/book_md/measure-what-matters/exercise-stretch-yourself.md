## Exercise: Stretch Yourself

Continually striving to achieve greater things is the fourth OKR superpower. Stretch yourself by creating your own ambitious goals.

* * *

Think of a time you set a big goal and achieved it. What attitudes and practical steps led to your success? What can you learn from the success?

Think of a time you set a big goal, and you failed to reach it. How comfortable were you with failure? How did you respond? How can you reframe the failure and learn from it?

Do you want your company to break into a new market, and does your company have some extra cash on hand? If so, what are the Big Hairy Audacious Goals that would transform your companyâ€™s offerings, and possibly even change the field?

What are your own Big Hairy Audacious Goals, the personal or professional objectives that seem almost impossible to achieve, but would motivate you and would drive your life or work forward?
