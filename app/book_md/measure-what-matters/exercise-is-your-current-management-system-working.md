## Exercise: Is Your Current Management System Working?

Doerr and Grove designed OKRs to be an improvement on traditional management systems. Whether or not you’re in a management position, examine the management system currently in place at your company and decide if the OKR system, or parts of it, could help your company function more efficiently.

* * *

What system of management is in place at your organization? What are its features? (For example, is there a clear goal-setting procedure in place? How often are the goals reviewed? Are they public?)

Do you know what objectives your boss expects you to meet this month? This year? If you’re a manager, how confident are you that your employees know what you expect of them? Why?

If you’re an employee, do you feel engaged and motivated at your job? Why or why not? If you’re a manager, do you think your employees feel engaged? How do you know?
