## Appendix: Checklist for Developing a Successful OKR System

Although the OKR system is relatively simple, it can be hard to implement in the beginning. Review these tips to make OKRs work for you:

  * **Tackle no more than 3-5 objectives** per cycle, and choose carefully (a cycle could be quarterly, monthly, or annually). Trying to work on more than 5 OKRs at one time dilutes your focus and spreads your resources too thin.
  * Similarly, **only assign 3-5 key results to each objective.** If you need more key results to reach an objective, that’s a sign the objective isn’t narrow enough or isn’t framed well.
  * **Make sure your key results are specific, comprehensive, and aligned.** Successfully completing your key results _must_ culminate in achieving your objective. In other words, if you complete all your key results but you still don’t meet your objective, you don’t have effective OKRs.
  * **Approach goal-setting from the bottom up.** Employees should consult with their managers to create at least half of their OKRs themselves (the other half may come from above, through the more traditional top-down approach). This increases employee engagement and ownership.
  * In the same vein, **don’t dictate others’ goals.** Collective agreement and engagement are crucial for the functioning of the OKR system.
  * **Continually reassess OKRs** , and if they’re no longer relevant, change or discard them, even in the middle of a cycle.
  * **Set high goals.** Your OKRs should be a mix of “committed OKRs,” objectives that _must_ be met for your company to function and thrive, and “aspirational OKRs,” objectives that make you feel a little uncomfortable because you’re unsure you can attain them. These kinds of OKRs stretch the entire company to achieve more than anyone thought possible, a key feature of innovative companies.
  * **Don’t base performance reviews or salaries on whether or not employees meet their OKRs.** The OKR system is meant to help everyone in the company be more focused and productive; no one should use it as a way to punish employees who aim high and fail.
  * Realize that **hitting on an effective OKR system takes time** , so be patient with yourself, your colleagues, and your administration.
