## Exercise: Align Your Goals with Your Company’s

Aligning your individual goals with your company’s goals is critical for your company’s long-term success. Reflect on how you can use communication and transparency to make your objectives more aligned.

* * *

Think of a time when you and a colleague or boss weren’t aligned. (Maybe you and a peer were unknowingly working on the same tasks, making the work redundant. Or maybe your boss had one set of expectations, and you had another.) What was the situation? How was it resolved?

How transparent are your goals? How transparent are the goals of your company? If your company lacks transparency, what steps can you take to increase it?

Write down one or two large projects you’re currently working on. How do these projects and their accompanying tasks directly connect to your company’s mission?

In addition to aligning your work with the company’s mission, are your goals and everyday tasks aligned with those of your colleagues, superiors, or direct reports? Where do you see potential areas of improvement? What steps can you take to be more aligned?
