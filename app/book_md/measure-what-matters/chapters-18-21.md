## Chapters 18-21: How to Build a Positive Culture

In Chapters 18, 19, and 20, we look at what a healthy company culture looks like, why it’s important, and how to build it with OKRs and CFRs.

#### What Is Culture and Why Is It Important?

Culture is a company’s beliefs and values, and the behaviors surrounding those beliefs and values. Most importantly, **culture is a shared sense of purpose.**

Research shows that companies with positive cultures outperform those without them. In one study, of the companies with healthy cultures, 96% received high scores for “systematic innovation” and 96% had “increased market share.”

This may be because employees understand their organization’s purpose and their purpose within the organization. When a company’s culture is cohesive and everyone knows its purpose, **employees can make decisions quickly and reliably.**

#### How Do OKRs and CFRs Contribute to a Positive Culture?

In one study, researchers found that “high-motivation cultures” depend on two elements: catalysts and nourishers.

**Catalysts** are elements of a company that support the work being done. These elements include goal setting, learning from failure, transparency, engaging in meaningful work, and freely sharing ideas. All of these elements are built into the OKR system.

**Nourishers** are elements of a company that support the interpersonal needs of employees. These elements include positive feedback, professional development, emotional support, psychological safety, and recognition. All of these elements are built into the CFR system.

In other words, OKRs are the catalysts of a positive workplace culture; CFRs are the nourishment that sustains it.

### Example #1 of Building a Positive Culture: Lumeris

Implementing OKRs successfully requires transparency and accountability. These traits can often foster a positive workplace culture, but **sometimes, a culture is too negative and distrusting for OKRs to work.** If that’s the case, you need to first focus on building the company’s culture. Once you’ve established the foundation of trust, you can then implement OKRs, and they’ll help further deepen trust and interdependence in your community.

Lumeris is a tech firm that provides expertise, services, and software to health care providers and patients. When Andrew Cole, then head of HR, arrived at Lumeris, the company had already been using OKRs for a few quarters. But Cole quickly realized that their use was superficial—at the end of the quarter, people would just adjust the numbers on the OKR platform and say they’d met their goals. There was no accountability or buy-in. Many people didn’t even _know_ their OKRs.

But the problem went beyond the way Lumeris used OKRs. The failed OKR system was the result of a negative workplace culture, which Cole needed to address before OKRs could be effective.

**Problem #1:** Executives had introduced OKRs in an attempt to merge the conflicting cultures of Lumeris (a risk-taking and transparent company) and their partner, health insurance company Essence (risk-averse and protective of their proprietary methods). As long as these two organizations remained separate entities, with two separate cultures, the OKR system couldn’t function successfully.

  * **Solution:** Lumeris incorporated Essence under its own umbrella.



**Problem #2:** Lumeris’s stated values included passion, teamwork, personal ownership, and accountability, but many of Lumeris’s top leaders were autocrats, uninterested in reinforcing these values. This created a gap between the company’s stated values and its behavior, which created distrust among employees.

  * **Solution:** Cole let the autocratic leaders go and hired ones who exemplified the company’s values.



**Problem #3:** Although Lumeris’s new leadership team told employees that they had the right—the obligation, even—to hold executives accountable for living Lumeris’s core values, employees initially declined to give feedback to leaders. They were afraid of being punished for speaking too bluntly.

  * **Solution:** Executives and HR leaders spoke to each employee personally to reiterate that they’d reward employees for upholding the culture’s values, collaborating, and being transparent and honest.



**Problem #4:** Many people in HR weren’t a good fit for the new culture Cole was trying to build. Many in middle management also weren’t on board with the new culture changes.

  * **Solution:** In less than 18 months, Cole and the executives replaced 85% of their HR staff. Then, they worked on retraining old managers and hiring new managers.



#### Reintroducing OKRs to Nurture and Sustain the Culture

With the company’s culture now providing a strong foundation, HR was finally ready to reintroduce OKRs. Cole required everybody in the company to be retrained in OKRs, then instituted a 60-day pilot run with 100 employees. The division’s senior vice president held his employees accountable by reading their OKRs closely and calling employees out when the OKRs didn’t make sense or the metrics were misaligned with the current data. This prompted employees to take their OKRs seriously.

At the end of the pilot, 98% was using the OKR system and 92% said they now understood what their managers expected of them.

##### Getting Buy-In by Focusing on Culture

As they rolled out OKRs with the entire 800-person staff, Cole and his HR team focused on questions that linked OKRs to the company’s culture and values. They discussed with managers and staff:

  * Why does our work matter? How does our work contribute to the company’s goals and values?
  * Why does transparency in a company matter? Why would you want peers from other divisions to know what your goals are?
  * Why does accountability matter? How can we both hold ourselves and others accountable while remaining respectful of others’ failings and forgiving of our own?
  * How can we help one another reach our objectives? How do we make a strong case for our objective so other teams are willing and excited to make it one of their own priorities and help us make it to the finish line?
  * How do we know when it’s time to revise an OKR, or time to scrap it altogether?



At the end of the quarter, 75% of employees were engaging with the OKR system and voluntary attrition was down.

### Example #2 of Building a Positive Culture: ONE Campaign

**OKRs can also help you establish a new culture** when you discover the failings of your current one.

After rockstar Bono established the ONE Campaign, an activist coalition, he discovered a problem in their culture: They were working _on_ Africa rather than _with_ Africa.

One of the organization’s objectives was to ease poverty and the ravages of AIDS in Africa. Bono and his ONE Campaign team felt they knew what Africans needed, but they collaborated not with African governments, but with governments in North America and Europe, the continents with the most money and power.

One day at a board meeting, John Doerr asked, “Who’s the client here?” When the board told him that the clients were the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world, Doerr asked if these people had a “seat at the table,” both metaphorically and literally. They didn’t. Their culture and goals were tainted by a messiah complex.

Bono and the ONE team used OKRs to change the organization’s culture:

**ONE Campaign OKR Example:**

**Objective:** Use the perspectives of Africans to guide ONE’s work, align ONE’s work with the priorities of Africans, and use ONE’s political capital to lobby for policy changes in Africa.

**Key Result #1:** Hire three African-based employees by April, and two African board members by July.

**Key Result #2:** Create an African Advisory Board.

**Key Result #3:** Develop relationships with 10-15 African thinkers and leaders who consult on ONE’s work.

**Key Result #4:** Take four trips to Africa during the year.

Once they started hiring African board members, the team realized that some of their priorities needed to shift. One new board member pointed out that corruption, which cheated developing countries of a trillion dollars annually, was currently a bigger problem than HIV/AIDS. Consequently, ONE shifted its objectives to lobbying for policies that increased transparency in governments and businesses.

As we’ve seen, the OKR system is adaptable. There’s no right or wrong way to use OKRs, and as your company grows, you’ll find the need to emphasize different elements of the system. For a new company, establishing priorities might be the game-changer you need. For more established companies, finding the right OKR cycle rhythm, be it quarterly or monthly, might be invaluable. **Find the elements of the OKR system that will be most beneficial for your company _today_ , and focus on those.** Make the system your own.

For more resources on implementing the OKR system, and for how OKRs compare to and can complement other systems you may already have in place (such as the Entrepreneurial Operating System or the Objectives, Goals, Strategies, and Measures system), visit the What Matters website.
