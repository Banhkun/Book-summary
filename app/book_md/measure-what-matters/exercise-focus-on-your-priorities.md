## Exercise: Focus on Your Priorities

The first OKR superpower involves figuring out your priorities and committing to them. Use these questions as a guide.

* * *

Whether or not you’re a manager, you can use the OKR tools to focus your goal-setting process. What will the length of your OKR cycle be? (Monthly? Quarterly?) What cloud-based tools will you use?

Who will be your “OKR shepherd”? If you’re an employee and your management team isn’t implementing the OKR system, who can you ask to keep you accountable for reaching your goals?

What’s your company’s mission, its primary purpose? If you’re not sure, why is that, and where could you find it? If you’re a manager, how can you better communicate the company’s purpose and goals to employees?

What’s the most important task you need to accomplish in the next three months, the next six months, and the next year?
