## Part 1 | Chapters 1-3: Introducing OKRs

In 1999, Google was a small startup with an ambitious goal: to make the internet relevant and accessible to everyone. Unfortunately, founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin had zero experience managing a company, and there were already 17 other search engines competing for market dominance. Page and Brin had to figure out how to break down their broad, ambitious mission into manageable, measurable pieces, and they had to do it quickly. Luckily, venture capitalist John Doerr, who had a 12% stake in the company, had just the tool: a management system he’d learned as an Intel employee in the ’70s.

**Doerr rechristened Intel’s process the “OKR management system** ,” and Doerr’s _Measure What Matters_ is a guide to implementing this system. As its name implies, the book helps you figure out what matters at your company and how to measure its success.

### What Are OKRs?

**OKR stands for Objectives and Key Results.** They help companies, teams, and individuals set, measure, and reflect on goals in a structured, meaningful way.

#### Objectives

**The objective is the goal, what the company, team, or individual aims to achieve.** In other words, the objective is the “what.”

Objectives:

  * State the overall goal or vision
  * Must be tangible, concrete, and objective
  * Must be action-oriented



Example: Hire new employees to meet the needs of the expanding organization.

#### Key Results

**Key results are benchmarks toward the objective.** In other words, key results are the “how,” the steps you need to take to meet your goal.

Key results:

  * State the measurable sub-goals that, if achieved, will collectively result in achieving the objective
  * Usually include numbers (revenue, market share, active users, growth, and so on)
  * Are time-bound (they include specific deadlines)
  * Are black-and-white—you either succeed in achieving a key result, or you don’t
  * Are relatively challenging. If a key result seems easy, it, or your objective, may not be ambitious enough



Example:

**Objective:** Hire new employees to meet the needs of the expanding organization.

**Key Result #1:** Meet with 3 candidates this month for the role of director of finance and hire 1.

**Key Result #2:** Meet with 5 candidates this quarter for the role of marketing manager and hire 1.

**Key Result #3:** Meet with 5 candidates this quarter for the role of product manager and hire 1.

Companies that use this system have OKRs at every tier: Top-line OKRs for the entire company, division OKRs, team OKRs, and individual OKRs. Everyone in the company creates OKRs, and everyone’s OKRs are visible to everyone else.

### Traditional Management Systems v. OKRs

Your company likely uses a traditional management system with the qualities listed below. Compare it to the OKR approach:

**Traditional Management Systems** | **OKRs**  
---|---  
Key question: What’s the goal?  | Key questions: What’s the goal, and how will we get there?   
Goals reviewed annually  | Goals reviewed quarterly or monthly   
Objectives are private  | Objectives are public (even those of the CEO)   
Alignment is top-down (objectives trickle down from the CEO to frontline employees)  | Alignment is top-down, bottom-up, _and_ horizontal   
Success of objectives is tied to compensation  | Success of objectives is (mostly) divorced from compensation   
System encourages risk-aversion  | System encourages risk-taking   
  
### How This Book Is Organized

**Part 1** of _Measure What Matters_ covers the basics of the OKR system and how real companies have used OKRs and tailored the process to meet their unique needs. The first three chapters introduce OKRs, and Chapters 4-14 cover the four “superpowers” of OKRs: focus, align, track, and stretch.

Doerr includes real-life accounts of how OKR superpowers play out in giants like Google, medium-sized companies like MyFitnessPal, and startups like Zume Pizza. These stories demonstrate the benefits of the OKR system, but they also reveal common mistakes in implementing OKRs. Therefore, they serve as both inspirational stories and cautionary tales.

**Part 2** of _Measure What Matters_ explores the importance of a positive workplace culture and OKRs’ counterpart, CFRs (Conversation, Feedback, Recognition). OKRs and CFRs complement each other, and both contribute to establishing a company culture in which employees are engaged, aligned, and excited about their work.

Whether your business is large or small, OKRs can help. Learn to implement the same management system used by Google, Intel, LinkedIn, Disney, Spotify, BMW, Twitter, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
