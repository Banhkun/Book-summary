## Chapters 7-9: Superpower #2—Align and Connect

Chapters 7, 8, and 9 cover **superpower #2, align and connect**.

**How to Implement OKRs for alignment:** Everyone in the company makes their own OKRs, and everyone’s OKRs are visible to everyone else. This provides the transparency needed for people to connect their goals with those of the company and their peers.

Research shows that highly-aligned companies are twice as likely as non-aligned or badly-aligned companies to be top performers.

For employees to align their goals with their company’s goals, they need to _know_ their company’s goals. This seems obvious, but, according to one study, **only 7% of employees actually know what their company’s overarching strategy is** and how they’re expected to contribute to its success. This is why the transparency of OKRs is so important.

### The Benefits of Transparency

In order for everyone’s goals to be aligned and contributing to the same ultimate objective, **everyone’s goals, and their progress toward those goals, need to be transparent.** The OKR system builds this necessary transparency into the process. CEOs can look at the goals of their executives, managers, and junior staff, and junior staff can (and should) look at the goals of their bosses and the CEO—everything is public.

Aside from alignment, there are other benefits of transparency:

#### Benefit #1: Transparency Increases Productivity and Engagement

Studies show that you’re more likely to achieve goals that you’ve made public, and OKRs are always public. Similarly, 92% of employees are more motivated to reach their goals at work if their progress is made visible to their colleagues, as it is in the OKR system.

#### Benefit #2: Transparency Fosters Collaboration

If your colleagues know your goals, and they know how much (or how little) progress you’ve made toward them, they have a better sense of how and when to help. This fosters support among peers and strengthens workplace morale.

Additionally, your goals might be similar to a colleague's, and, consequently, you might have resources, strategies, or information that could help your colleague reach her goals. You can’t know which of your resources could be useful to your peers if you don’t know what they’re working on.

#### Benefit #3: Transparency Reduces the Risk of Redundant, Overlapping Goals

In large companies, people often work on the same thing, and toward the same goal, without realizing it. Making sure everyone knows everyone else’s goals helps keep employees from performing redundant tasks and, consequently, saves the company time and money.

### Top-Down v. Bottom-Up Alignment

Generally, there are two approaches to alignment: top-down and bottom-up. In the **top-down approach** , directives start with the CEO and cascade down through the ranks to the junior employees. In the **bottom-up approach** , junior employees working on the frontlines, the people who often have the most access to customers and product issues, identify pressing needs and relay them up the chain of command to the CEO.

There are benefits to both systems, and the most effective companies are aligned in both directions. However, there are more problems with top-down alignment than with bottom-up alignment.

#### Problems with Top-Down Alignment

The benefit of a top-down goal-setting system is that it ensures everyone’s goals are aligned with the company’s vision. But there are five problems that outweigh this benefit:

##### Problem #1: Top-Down Systems Aren’t Efficient

Before the manager can set goals for his team, he has to wait for the department head to give him his own goals, and the department head has to wait for her own marching orders from the executive team. This process of goal-setting can take weeks, and with markets that are constantly changing, companies need to pivot quickly.

##### Problem #2: Top-Down Systems Aren’t Flexible

Related to Problem #1, top-down goals are hard to change mid-cycle if they’re not working. If a department head realizes that he needs to adjust his goal to meet the needs of changing circumstances, all the employees in tiers below him will have to scramble to revise their own goals to align with his. This kind of system isn’t sustainable.

##### Problem #3: Top-Down Systems Don’t Value the Insight of Frontline Employees

Often, **employees at the lowest tiers have the most interaction with the market, and they may be the first to know that a company’s strategy isn’t working.** A top-down system can marginalize these employees and make it difficult for them to communicate their concerns to those with the power to change things.

##### Problem #4: Top-Down Systems Don’t Connect People Horizontally

While these systems provide a clear path from the top of the organization to the bottom, they don’t connect people with employees from other departments. Consequently, the organization loses valuable opportunities to foster interdepartmental collaboration.

##### Problem #5: Top-Down Systems Fail to Motivate Employees

Because employees don’t have a say in developing their own goals, they take less responsibility for achieving them. You’re much more likely to reach a goal you set for yourself. Additionally, when employees don’t feel ownership over their goals, their bosses often find themselves micromanaging in order to get things done, and this keeps them from focusing on their own goals.

#### Benefits of Top-Down Alignment

Top-down alignment isn’t all bad. In fact, about half of employees’ OKRs should come from objectives established by top management. At its best, top-down alignment makes cascading goals clear. Below, the head coach’s _key results_ become the _objectives_ of the coaches working under him. This is an effective use of top-down alignment. In turn, each coach has his own specialized key results that support his objective.

##### Head Coach

**Objective:** Win the Super Bowl

**Key Result #1:** Offense gains at least 300 yards per game

**Key Result #2:** Defense allows no more than 17 points per game

**Key Result #3:** Special teams unit earns a ranking in the top 5 for coverage of punt returns

##### Offensive Coach

**Objective:** Offense gains at least 300 yards per game

**Key Result #1:** Achieve a rate of 60% pass completion

**Key Result #2:** Allow no more than 2 interceptions per game

**Key Result #3:** Hire a quarterback coach by the end of July

##### Defensive Coach

**Objective:** Defense allows no more than 17 points per game

**Key Result #1:** Allow no more than 100 rushing yards in one game

**Key Result #2:** Raise sacks to at least 3 per game

**Key Result #3:** Train the new cornerback by the end of August

##### Special Teams Coach

**Objective:** Special teams unit earns a ranking in the top 5 for coverage of punt returns

**Key Result #1:** Give up no more than 10 yards for each punt return

**Key Result #2:** Block at least 3 punts during the season

When objectives do come from the top, let employees give their input on the necessary key results. In the example above, the head coach might direct the special teams coach to make sure the special teams unit earns a top-5 ranking, but it’s up to the special teams coach to decide which key results will get them there.

#### Benefits of Bottom-Up Alignment

**The primary benefit of bottom-up alignment is efficiency.** Companies with tens of thousands of employees, like Google, can’t wait for instructions and OKRs to make their way down the chain of command. Innovation requires speed and flexibility, and bottom-up alignment fosters both of these qualities.

**The secondary benefit of bottom-up alignment is that it encourages a certain degree of freedom.** Because employees get to choose many of their own goals, they feel ownership over them, they’re more motivated to achieve them, and morale improves. This freedom also fosters innovation, which studies show flourishes when employees don’t feel constrained by their managers.

OKRs help bottom-up alignment function smoothly. Individuals and teams are responsible for setting their own OKRs and making sure that these goals help further the company’s objective. Individual and team OKRs are public, so if anyone’s OKRs aren’t aligned with the top-line OKRs, it’s obvious.

### Align and Connect—How to Do It

Use these general guidelines to help your team or organization stay aligned.

  * **Allow individuals to set roughly half of their own objectives and most of their key results.** People who choose their goals take more responsibility toward getting themselves there.
  * For the objectives that come from the top, you as the manager should **clearly demonstrate how the employee’s objective connects to the company’s top priorities.**
  * Use meetings to reiterate why certain OKRs are important.
  * Encourage cross-departmental OKRs for horizontal alignment. When different departments depend on one another to meet objectives, **make sure those dependencies are explicit.**



### Example 1 of Superpower #2: Align—MyFitnessPal

MyFitnessPal is an app that lets users track what they eat and how they exercise. When their staff grew to a team of ten, they needed a system for increasing employees’ alignment and productivity.

#### Kinks in the OKR System

Although the OKR system helped, it wasn’t a smooth transition:

**Problem #1:** Instead of creating organization-level OKRs first and then matching them to the employees in the best positions to achieve them, they created OKRs to fit each individual employee. Consequently, they had a bunch of distinct OKRs that weren’t aligned with an overarching goal.

**Problem #2:** When the team grew from ten to thirty people, productivity decreased. In an effort to speed progress, multiple engineers worked on the same project, but the strategy backfired: the leadership team spent much of its time finding ways to keep the engineers from overriding and negating each other’s work.

**Problem #3:** The engineering team was also confused by the competing demands of the various project managers. Often, the engineers didn’t know which projects or tasks to prioritize, so it usually came down to which project manager “yelled the loudest.” As the engineers switched back and forth between projects, their productivity tanked.

**Problem #4:** The marketing team failed to inform the engineering team of a key result that relied on their work. When the engineers found out about it, they saw this key result as just another demand on their time. The founders didn’t find out about the doomed OKR until the end of the quarter arrived and the OKR hadn’t been achieved.

#### Improving Alignment

Clearly, the MyFitnessPal teams needed to get on the same page. In order to increase alignment, leadership implemented frequent “integration meetings” during which everyone shared their goals, made it clear which other teams were needed to achieve those goals, and what exactly they needed from those teams. No one left the room until each project leader was satisfied that everyone was on-board with the proposed OKRs, that no one was overstretched, and that the objectives were realistic.

A common mistake leaders make when trying to improve alignment is confusing alignment with redundancy. Alignment does not mean that everyone works on the same thing; they’re just working toward the same goals. MyFitnessPal avoided this trap by ensuring that **every OKR was the responsibility of a single person.** No one could blame anyone else if an OKR failed. Even employees who were working on the same objective had different key results. It took the company a few quarters to work out the kinks, but they were left with a system of improved alignment and productivity.

### Example 2 of Superpower #2: Connect—Intuit

OKRs helped smooth Intuit’s transition from offering desktop software to offering cloud-based software, and they highlighted alignment issues that might have gone unnoticed otherwise.

The transparency of OKRs made it clear that the IT department was juggling competing demands: On the one hand, they had to solve the problems of current users, who were using the old software. On the other hand, the leadership team expected them to create a cloud-based system that would be sustainable in the future. The IT team’s daily work wasn’t aligned with the company’s priorities.

Once this alignment issue became clear, the CEO clarified the department’s priorities and gave them permission to let some of the day-to-day issues slide in favor of prioritizing long-term initiatives. Colleagues and managers were also more understanding when IT occasionally dropped the ball—**because their OKRs were transparent, everyone knew the goals and constraints of each team, so they understood why some tasks were given priority over others.**

Today, employees align their OKRs both vertically and horizontally, connecting about half of their OKRs to those of their superiors and half to those of their colleagues.

#### Global Value

OKRs have been especially valuable as Intuit becomes a global company with teams around the world. Whereas in the past, people working in satellites would wonder what goes on at headquarters, now, **everyone knows what everyone else is working on, even people on the other side of the world.**

Multiple studies show that employees do better work when they see how what they’re doing connects to their company’s high-level goals, but this connection can be particularly hard to make at remote sites. OKRs solve that problem. Now an employee in Bangalore can see how her OKRs align with those of the company’s mission.
