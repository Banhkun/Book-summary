## Part 1: The Benefits of Working With Less Information

Gladwell believes there are**two primary benefits of snap decisions:**

  * They’re quick
  * They’re unconscious



The value of speed is obvious in situations in which there’s no time to think things through. EMTs, firefighters, and police officers make snap decisions all the time. But even though we don’t realize it, we’re _all_ making snap decisions constantly, and we all find ourselves in situations where time is limited and we need to act quickly.

(Shortform note: Though fast decisions and snap decisions aren’t necessarily the same thing, making decisions quickly can give you the upper hand in business. For example, consumer research platform Attest proposes an equation for measuring decision-making effectiveness in which speed acts as a multiplier: Decision effectiveness = Decision Quality × Speed × Yield – Effort.)

### The Advantages of Deciding With the Unconscious Mind

In addition to being speedy, snap decisions are unconscious. The unconscious mind handles all the minor bits of information thrown at us every day. **This frees up the conscious mind to focus on problems that need our deliberate attention.**

#### How Snap Decisions Work in the Brain

Gladwell explains that scientists can see how much work the unconscious mind does by observing people with damage to their ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is one area of the brain involved in unconscious decisions.

As Gladwell points out, people with ventromedial damage can’t make snap judgments. Their unconscious minds don’t prioritize information for them, so they give equal weight to minor and major details when making a decision. People with ventromedial damage can spend hours sifting through options before making a trivial decision, such as when to schedule their next appointment.

(Shortform note: Not all researchers working with ventromedial patients have found the same thing. In fact, it seems more common for people with ventromedial damage to make decisions as quickly as controls but to be wildly inconsistent in their preferences. For example, in their choice of preferred foods, they might rate doughnuts as tastier than carrot sticks and carrot sticks as tastier than watermelon, but then say that watermelon is tastier than doughnuts.)

People with ventromedial damage also have trouble turning decisions into actions. They’re highly rational thinkers and don’t involve their emotions when making decisions. This seems like a good thing, as we’re often told to leave our emotions out of the decision-making process. But **we need an emotional push to get from decisions to actions.** Without emotions, we may intellectually know that something is bad for us, but we’ll keep doing it anyway.

> **The Role of Emotions in Decision-Making**
> 
> How does the emotional push in decision-making work? It seems that emotion, which manifests as physiological changes such as sweating or increased heart rate, changes our decisions without us being aware of it. To show this, neuroscientist Antonio Damasio and his team worked with patients who had ventromedial damage. They developed a gambling task (the “Iowa gambling task”) involving four different simulated decks of cards. Participants chose a deck to draw from each time, gaining or losing money when they turned the cards over. Two of the decks were “good” decks; that is, they rewarded the player more often than they punished the player. The other two were “bad” decks—the player was more likely to lose money when turning over cards in these decks.
> 
> People without ventromedial damage learned pretty fast (after 40 to 50 trials) to stick to the good decks. Even more impressively, they started showing physiological stress responses before choosing from the bad decks after as few as 10 draws. The people with ventromedial damage, in contrast, never defaulted to the good decks. They were more attracted to the decks that offered big rewards, even if that meant they would lose in the long term.
> 
> Damasio talks about the implications of this research in his book _Descartes’ Error_ , proposing that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex acts as a kind of junction where emotions, past behavior, and future behavior are processed together. This combined processing allows us to learn from our good or bad past decisions and behave differently in the future.

As Gladwell argues, working with less information means that you’re less likely to be distracted by irrelevant details. If you let your unconscious mind do its job without interfering too much, you get decisions that are clean, fast, and surprisingly accurate.

**Gladwell introduces the idea of “thin-slicing” to explain why our unconscious minds are so efficient at making snap judgments.** Thin-slicing is using a small segment of information (for example, a 10-second video) to make a quick decision. As evidence that it works, Gladwell describes a study by Nalini Ambady and Robert Rosenthal that looked at student evaluations of teachers. These researchers found no significant difference between the evaluations of students who had taken a whole semester-long class with the teacher and those who had watched a video of less than 30 seconds of the same teacher.

(Shortform note: Gladwell doesn’t attribute the term “thin-slicing” to anyone in particular, and he’s often credited with coining it. But the idea of taking “thin slices” of experience comes from a 1992 paper by Ambady and Rosenthal that reviewed research on how people interpret short segments of non-verbal behavior. They showed that people who made judgments about someone’s honesty and professional competence based on a 30-second video were just as accurate as those who watched a 5-minute video.)

> **Thin-Slicing Offers Insights into Human Behavior**
> 
> Research interest in thin-slicing has spread to many fields, including interpersonal relationships, clinical evaluations, parenting, and the legal system. There’s also considerable overlap with studies of body language—for example, researchers have found that we can accurately judge someone’s socioeconomic status based on thin slices of their body language. We do this by looking at the degree to which they show engagement with others: “Engagement cues,” such as nodding and smiling, tend to reflect low socioeconomic status, while people with higher socioeconomic status are more likely to show “disengagement cues” such as doodling. In general, you’ll be judged more positively on first impression if you make eye contact, avoid fidgeting, smile, and make open-handed gestures. A stiff posture, frowning, and looking down will lead people to judge you negatively.
> 
> Researchers are even trying to link how we appear in thin-slicing judgments to our genes. For example, one recent study found that people who are genetically predisposed to have more active oxytocin receptors are more likely to express prosocial behavior and positive body language (e.g., nodding their heads and smiling). This in turn makes people judge them more positively when thin-slicing.

### Thin-Slicing Example: Gottman’s “Love Lab”

Gladwell introduces psychologist John Gottman’s “love lab” as an analogy for what’s happening in our brains when we thin-slice. Since the 1980s, more than 3,000 married couples have taken part in Gottman’s research at the University of Washington. Gottman’s work suggests that **if you know how to “thin-slice” a marriage—that is, if you know which information is relevant and which isn’t—you can accurately predict the future of the marriage.**

Gottman and his colleagues videotape couples having a “meaningful interaction,” perhaps discussing a point of contention or talking about how they met. They also hook the subjects up to sensors that take physiological measurements.

(Shortform note: Some researchers have argued that Gottman’s sample sizes are too small to be meaningful, and that his studies don’t take into account false positives due to the low base rates of divorce. Others have questioned whether what Gottman does can be called “prediction” at all. He apparently makes his predictions after he already knows the outcomes of participants’ marriages, using technology to match the outcome with the noted patterns to create predictions in hindsight. Gottman has disputed this interpretation of his work on the Gottman Institute website.)

The way Gottman zeroes in on the most important pieces of information is similar to what our unconscious minds do when they thin-slice. **A well-trained unconscious mind lasers in on the most significant details and disregards the rest.** This is why thin-slicing allows for speedy decision-making, since it doesn’t involve processing a lot of information.

> **Do We Thin-Slice Potential Romantic Partners?**
> 
> Gottman thin-slices long-term relationships to gain insights into their history, but what about the thin-slicing that we engage in when screening potential new partners? Tinder wasn’t around when Gladwell wrote _Blink_ , but it’s a textbook example of making fast decisions based on very little information.
> 
> Researchers haven’t investigated thin-slicing behavior on Tinder, but they _have_ looked at what happens in speed dating sessions. Speed dating, which was invented in the late 1990s by Rabbi Yaacov Deyo to help connect Jewish singles in Los Angeles, is an ideal context for thin-slicing studies. For example, researchers found that female speed daters (in a heterosexual speed dating scenario) were faster than the males to notice negative qualities in their dates. In another study, researchers compared the qualities that people said they were looking for before the speed dates with the partners they actually chose to see again, finding that we’re not very good at identifying what we like in people until we meet them—perhaps a reason to give someone a chance if you’re sitting on the fence.

### How Gottman’s Work in the “Love Lab” Is Like Thin-Slicing

The “love lab” example doesn’t show thin-slicing at work, but serves as an analogy. Thin-slicing takes place in the unconscious mind. Conversely, Gottman and his researchers arrive at their predictions through a very deliberate, conscious method. They use a lot of data to make their predictions. They’re not guessing.

But Gottman’s love lab research provides a model for what’s happening in our brains when we thin-slice. **Our brains do a quick and unconscious version of what Gottman does when he consciously analyzes his data.**

According to Gladwell, Gottman’s work provides **two important takeaways** that help us understand how the unconscious mind works when it thin-slices:

#### #1. The Process of Thin-Slicing Identifies Patterns

There are patterns, or “signatures,” that the conscious mind doesn’t pick up. The unconscious mind makes decisions based on these patterns.

Predicting divorce involves identifying the patterns of unhealthy relationships. It wouldn’t take Gottman’s team long to identify what your relationship’s pattern is. Maybe you repeatedly ask for credit and your spouse repeatedly withholds it. Maybe whenever you and your partner have a disagreement, no matter how minor, your partner is stubborn and won’t attempt to see your point of view. If these types of interactions show up regularly in a span of 15 minutes, they probably reflect an underlying problem.

Like Gottman’s team, **the unconscious mind takes a thin slice of experience and quickly recognizes patterns in it.** It then makes an inference about a current situation based on the patterns of similar experiences in the past.

> **Professional Intuition Selectively Improves Our Snap Decisions**
> 
> When we use the love lab analogy for thin-slicing, we can immediately see why some snap decisions are better than others. If your unconscious mind has had enough experience in a particular area to build up an accurate, well-organized database, your snap decisions will draw on this database and are likely to be sound. But if you’re a novice in a particular area, your database will probably be small and not very accurate: a recipe for bad decisions.
> 
> Psychologist Gary Klein came to a similar conclusion in his work on the role of experience in rapid decision-making. Klein was interested in experienced firefighters, who have to make fast, potentially life-or-death decisions under pressure. He found that over time, these firefighters had built up an unconscious “prototype” of a typical building fire. When the prototype and the situation matched, their decisions were so rehearsed that they didn’t feel like decisions at all. But when the situation didn’t match the prototype, they got a “feeling” that something was wrong, which led to a different decision.
> 
> For example, one lead firefighter took his team into a burning house, and they started hosing down the place they thought the fire was coming from. But the water didn’t work. He also noticed that the house was unusually hot and that he couldn’t hear the usual roar of flames. Not knowing what was going on, he decided to evacuate his team from the house. Less than a minute later, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. This fire chief said he’d had a “sixth sense” about the need to evacuate—but Klein says that he made the call because his unconscious mind had noticed a mismatch with the prototype.
> 
> This work suggests that the quality of our snap decision-making is domain-specific. We wouldn’t, for example, expect a firefighter who makes exceptional snap decisions about burning buildings to be particularly good at analyzing marriages.

#### #2. Accurate Thin-Slicing Requires You to Select Information Well

Gladwell argues that the unconscious mind doesn’t need a lot of information to do its job.

To illustrate this, he discusses how Gottman’s researchers gave some of his three-minute clips to marriage counselors, psychology students, and marital researchers. Even though they were experts, they were only able to predict divorces about 54% of the time, which isn’t much better than chance. Why did they have so much trouble?

**Such a large amount of information is overwhelming.** When you narrow your focus to just four problematic emotions and attitudes (criticism, stonewalling, defensiveness, and contempt), you can disregard the other data points and still make an accurate prediction about the health of a marriage.

Gottman says that you can further narrow your focus to a single emotion, contempt, and still predict a marriage’s future pretty accurately. If you detect contempt in a three-minute clip, you don’t need to know anything else about a couple’s relationship to know if it’s in trouble. It is.

> **Why Is Contempt So Poisonous in Relationships?**
> 
> In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Daniel Goleman goes into more detail on Gottman’s work on contempt. Gottman found that in the short term, expressions of contempt caused stress in the other partner—for example, if one partner showed a facial expression of contempt, the other partner’s heart rate shot up. It’s not surprising, then, that in the long term contempt can be both physically and emotionally destructive. Gottman found that when husbands repeatedly showed contempt, their wives reported increases in a range of physical illnesses (including gastrointestinal infections, colds and flus, and infections). When wives repeatedly showed contempt, there was a good chance the marriage would end within the next four years.
> 
> There are also links between contempt and inter-partner physical violence. One explanation for the power of contempt to destroy relationships is that its social function is to exclude the other person from social networks in the long term (in contrast to anger, which can function in the short term to change other people’s behavior). In this view, anger is less damaging than contempt because it carries an expectation of reconciliation, whereas contempt is a more permanent emotional state.

Now that we have a better sense of what our brain does when it thin-slices, Gladwell directs us to a study that shows the accuracy of thin-slicing in judging people’s personalities.

### Judging a Person by Their College Dorm Room

Psychologist Samuel Gosling found that**our intuitive or snap judgments are surprisingly accurate when it comes to judging strangers**.

Gosling asked 80 college students to fill out the Big Five Inventory, a widely used questionnaire that measures five personality traits: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to new experiences. (Shortform note: You can take the Big Five Inventory test here to see how you stack up.)

Then Gosling asked the close friends of those 80 students to rank them on the Big Five. Unsurprisingly, the friends showed that they knew the subjects pretty well. Each friend had a “thick slice” of experience with the subject, having spent a lot of time with him or her, and could judge the subject’s personality accurately.

Finally, Gosling sent someone who had never met the subject into the subject’s dorm room for 15 minutes. Gosling asked the stranger to assess the subject according to the five personality traits just by looking at that person’s bedroom.

#### Results: We Can Thin-Slice Someone’s Bedroom

Gosling discovered that you can make a surprisingly accurate judgment about someone you’ve never met just by looking around his or her dorm room for 15 minutes. (Shortform note: Gosling went on to write a book titled _Snoop: What Your Stuff Says About You_. A spin-off BBC3 show called _Hot Property _has would-be daters inspect the bedrooms of three potential dates and choose one to go on a date with.)

Friends, as expected, were more accurate in rating extraversion and agreeableness. However, **strangers were more accurate in rating conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to new experiences.**

**Why? Bedrooms expose patterns. They give a peek into your private life that is revealing.** An unmade bed, posters on the wall, or a fluffy ottoman can tell you just as much about a person as meeting him or her, if not more.

**A bedroom without its occupant inside it contains well-selected information. It excludes distracting and irrelevant information.** Stereotypes triggered by a subject’s presence were absent. If you meet a quiet, econ major with glasses, you may never guess she’s a hardcore heavy metal fan. If you judge her by her vinyl and paraphernalia collection, you get a different picture. The people themselves weren’t there to get in the way. We can’t view ourselves objectively, so we often say confusing or contradictory things about ourselves to other people. By just looking at someone’s bedroom, we avoid this white noise.

To Gladwell, this demonstrates that **strangers who observe an extremely thin slice of a person’s life can make accurate judgments about that person’s personality.** As this example shows, sometimes, it’s better to have a limited amount of information rather than a lot, as long as that information makes use of a pattern from which to extrapolate to the whole.

> **The Size Instinct: The Problem With Having too Little Information**
> 
> As Gladwell notes, in many circumstances, copious amounts of information are more distracting than helpful.
> 
> On the other hand, as we’ll see in later chapters, going with less isn’t always better. If we rely too heavily on thin slices, we’re in danger of succumbing to the **_size instinct_ : the mistaken impulse to overestimate the importance of any single data point or incident, without putting it in the proper context.** The size instinct can severely distort our worldview and cause us to devote disproportionate attention (and resources) to small details and to the _symptoms_ of problems, rather than to large problems and their deeper root causes.
> 
> In _Factfulness_ , international health and development expert Hans Rosling illustrates how basing our decisions on a small amount of easily available information (the _size instinct_) might get in the way of properly understanding and solving a problem. He points out that according to raw figures, child mortality in Mozambique is extremely high. But if an aid organization starts building an expensive hospital on the basis of that figure alone, they’re missing the point: Most sick children in Mozambique won’t make it to the hospital in the first place
> 
> To avoid getting distracted by the size instinct, Rosling suggests that you break down and compare the numbers you’re presented with. For example, before deciding to build a hospital, an aid organization could seek a more detailed breakdown on the causes of child mortality and determine whether the mortality rate is increasing or decreasing over time.
