## Exercise: Inoculate Yourself Against Stress

Use this exercise to think about ways you can rehearse making good, quick decisions in stressful situations.

* * *

What stressful situation do you find yourself in frequently enough that it gets in the way of your success? (Maybe it’s giving presentations at work or attending job interviews.)

Think of a particular stressful situation that you’ll be facing in the next few months (perhaps a presentation, a job interview, or a performance). How can you give yourself opportunities to rehearse making good decisions under stress? (Can you record yourself, practice with a friend, ask an expert for feedback?)
