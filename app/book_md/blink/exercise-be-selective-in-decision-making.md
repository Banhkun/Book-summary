## Exercise: Be Selective in Decision-Making

Look to the past to see if you’ve based decisions on irrelevant information. Can you find ways to identify patterns and disregard the minor details when making decisions in the future?

* * *

Think of a time when you had to make a decision and were overwhelmed by all the factors you had to take into account. What was the situation? What were some of the deciding factors?

In hindsight, were all those factors relevant? Which factors may not have mattered as much as you thought at the time? (For instance, when you were choosing a college, did it really matter that College A had better sports teams than College B, when you didn’t play sports? Or was that just a distracting piece of information that looked relevant on your pros/cons list?)

How could you have been more selective in your decision-making process by focusing on the relevant patterns? What one or two factors would have pointed you in the right direction, even ignoring all the other factors? (Just brainstorm for now. You’ll gain more insight here as you explore later chapters.)
