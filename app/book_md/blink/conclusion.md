## Conclusion: The Lessons of Blink

_Blink_ ’s conclusion tells the story of trombone player Abbie Conant to highlight ways we can prompt ourselves to make better snap decisions.

#### Sensation Transference and Female Trombone Players

As Gladwell recounts, the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra invited Conant to audition in 1980, not realizing she was a woman. Conant played behind a screen during the first round of the audition. The director was floored by her talent until he found out she was a woman. The trombone was thought to be a “masculine” instrument, played in military marching bands. The director didn’t believe a woman could play it as well as a man.

The committee reluctantly allowed Conant to join the orchestra, but a year later demoted her to second trombone. **In a classic case of sensation transference, the same playing that had astounded them when they listened to her blind suddenly didn’t sound so good when they knew it was coming from a woman.**

Since then, many orchestras have instituted **safeguards against sensation transference** :

  * At auditions, musicians are identified by a number rather than a name.
  * Musicians audition behind a screen.
  * If any sound that could identify gender, such as a clearing of the throat or the sound of heels on an uncarpeted floor, comes from behind the screen, the musician leaves and is assigned a new number.
  * Audition decisions are made by committee rather than by a single conductor or director.



Since these safeguards have become common, **the number of women in major orchestras has increased fivefold.**

#### Lessons for Working With Snap Decisions

This and the book’s other examples demonstrate what Gladwell sees as the two primary lessons of _Blink_ :

**Lesson #1:** We depend on the power of our first impressions, forgetting that in addition to being powerful, they’re fragile. We need to acknowledge both the power and the corruptibility of our intuition, and take both seriously.

**Lesson #2:** When we realize how fragile our first impressions are, we can take steps to fortify them. We tend to believe that what happens in the blink of an eye is inevitable. However, we have unacknowledged control over our intuition. If we can control the environments in which we rely on snap judgments, we can also control those snap judgments.

> **Additional Advice on Fast Decision-Making**
> 
> Throughout the book, Gladwell suggests several ways we can make better snap decisions. We should limit the amount of information we consider, avoid rationalizing, and rehearse (particularly in stressful situations). We should also be aware of how unconscious biases—for example, the Warren Harding effect, sensation transference, and the mere exposure effect—get in the way of good snap decisions and do our best to counter these biases. To improve your decisions, you can also:
> 
>   * **Be aware of the effects of transient emotions on decision-making.** Daniel Goleman points out in _Emotional Intelligence _that when you’re in a good mood, you tend to make more optimistic decisions; when you’re feeling down, you make more pessimistic decisions. The effects of these decisions can continue long after the emotion has passed. For example, a classic 1974 study found that we often translate anxiety into sexual attraction: Men who had just crossed a rickety suspension bridge were more likely to call an attractive female interviewer than men who had crossed a sturdy wooden bridge.
> 
>   * **Consider the cognitive biases you’re bringing to a decision.** In _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ , Daniel Kahneman describes some common biases in human cognition that relate to our thinking about money. First, we tend to judge outcomes based on a fixed cognitive reference point that feels “neutral” (usually our current situation). Second, we evaluate our finances in relative terms rather than absolute ones (for example, a $100 increase feels much better if you start with $100 than if you start with $900). And third, while gains feel good, losses of the same amount feel disproportionately bad. Be careful of snap decisions that come from these biases, as they may lead you astray.
> 
>   * **Learn to distinguish when snap decisions are appropriate and when they’re not.** It’s often tempting to make a quick decision and be done with it, especially when you’re tired or stressed. But some decisions are more suited to a fast approach, while others benefit from a more considered one (as an extreme example, consider choosing which flavor muffin to buy with your morning coffee vs. deciding whether to ask someone to marry you). For muffin decisions, snap away. For marriage decisions, a more conscious process is usually desirable.
> 
>   * **Consider your approach to the decision-making process itself.** In _The Paradox of Choice_ , psychologist Barry Schwartz argues that there are two main ways that people approach making decisions: They either try to pick the very best option from a large range of options (“maximizers”), or they carry a set of criteria into a decision and choose the first option that acceptably satisfies the criteria (“satisficers”). Maximizing may seem like the best approach, but it turns out that compared to satisficers, maximizers are less happy and less satisfied with their lives, more depressed, and more prone to regret. If you’re a maximizer, consider test-driving the satisficer method.
