## Exercise: Develop Purpose in Your Workplace

Creating purpose in the workplace requires clarity, dedication, and focus. Start developing priorities and focusing your team towards the core principles of your organization.

* * *

Priorities are an essential part of developing purpose. What are the priorities of your organization? List and rank them, then explain your ranking.

Take a few moments to visualize an attainable goal that you want to achieve. Write it down.

Now think about your current situation. What do you need to change, or what actions do you need to complete, to reach your goal?

Next, take a minute to think about the obstacles that youâ€™ll face while trying to achieve that goal. List them.
