## Exercise: High-Proficiency Vs. High-Creativity: Which Is Right For You?

When developing activities and structures surrounding purpose, you must decide if you want to develop a high-proficiency or high-creativity work environment.

* * *

As a whole, which does your organization require? Is it universal or does it differ from team-to-team/project-to-project? Remember, high-proficiency environments are environments that avoid failure at all costs, while high-creativity environments are environments that embrace failure as part of the process.

What are some ways that you can begin to develop the appropriate high-purpose environment in your workplace? List them. Keep in mind the methods of development for each environment (high-proficiency = goals, repetition, and language; high-creativity = team interaction, creative freedom, and failure).
