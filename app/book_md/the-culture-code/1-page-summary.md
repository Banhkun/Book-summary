## 1-Page Summary

**Why do certain organizations become greater than the sum of their parts while other groups fall short?**

**The solution to this problem rests not in the intellect or experience of your team, but rather in their ability to work together as a unit.** Think of group culture like a machine. If all of the cogs are intricate but don’t operate with the other cogs, the machine won’t run. You’re left with an expensive, but useless piece of junk. On the other hand, if all of the cogs operate smoothly with one another, the machine runs efficiently—even if some of the cogs aren’t as developed as the others.

**Successful group cultures are built on the development of three foundational concepts: safety (_you belong here_), vulnerability (_you can take risks_), and purpose (_you are here for a reason_).**

### Safety: The Cornerstone of Interconnectivity

#### What Is Safety and Why Does It Matter?

**Key Attributes: A safe work culture creates an environment in which team members feel like valued members of the organization.** No one wants to feel like they’re not appreciated. Safety in the workplace lets team members feel like they belong in the group, are connected to other members of the organization, and are comfortable in their position.

**Benefit #1: When team members feel safe, they develop strong chemistry with one another.** Team members communicate efficiently, contribute new ideas regularly, and give their input energetically. This allows them to work as a cohesive unit.

**Benefit #2: When employees feel valued and supported in the workplace, they are willing to go above and beyond** , even if the problem at hand is not technically their responsibility. Rather than spending a significant amount of time and energy strategizing, teams dive into issues head-first. They’re even more willing to work after hours to resolve the issues.

**Benefit #3: Through a communal sense of belonging, employees develop and maintain interconnectivity even in times of tension.** Groups will experience highs and lows—that’s just a fact of life. If team members feel safe, they’ll stick together and acknowledge their shared humanity, even in the most volatile of times.

#### What Are the Consequences of an Unsafe Work Environment?

**Consequence #1: When an organization lacks safety, team members develop insecurity.** They consistently ask themselves: _Do I belong here? Is my work any good? Do other people want me here?_ When insecurity dictates behavior, team members struggle to connect.

**Consequence #2:** When team members begin to resent their environment, **negativity infects the workplace**. It spreads quickly between employees and disrupts productive workflow. When team members begin to collapse under the pressures of negativity, **they make mistakes.**

#### How Can You Develop Safety?

You can cultivate safety by using behaviors and actions known as **belonging cues.** These cues make team members feel **safe and comfortable** in the workplace and address three specific topics: **connection, future, and security:**

##### Connection

  * Connection cues allow team members to feel as though they are supported by the group while being valued as individuals. Connection cues include physical connection, active listening, and small courtesies.
  * To develop connection cues, **give your full energy and attention to the immediate conversation.** Show that you understand you are talking to a unique person, not a robot.



##### Future

  * Future cues let team members know that they have a future with the organization. Future cues include discussions about upward mobility, the use of model employees as examples of potential success, and conversations about long-term goals.
  * To develop future cues, **assure the individual that they have a future with you and/or the organization**. This puts their anxieties about the future at rest while giving them a goal to strive for.



##### Security

  * Security cues let team members know that they have permission to speak up without fear of losing their position. Security cues include the embrace of feedback, the valuation of team opinion, and the acknowledgment of strong work.
  * To develop security cues, **exaggerate your appreciation.** You can calm insecurity by reassuring team members that they are doing strong work. Receiving appreciation for a task or project makes people more willing to complete a similar task or project in the future.



**In addition to using belonging cues, here are a few other methods to help you develop a safe environment:**

**Create a “collision-rich” workspace.** “Collisions” are personal interactions between team members that promote connection through community. To create a “collision-rich” workplace:

  * Keep employees in close proximity to one another.
  * Develop communal spaces for employees to interact.
  * Connect team members with one another.
  * Go out of your way to interact with your co-workers and employees.



**Promote a vocal workforce.** Team members must feel comfortable speaking up and providing input. To promote open communication:

  * Invite feedback. This builds trust and encourages team members to speak up. 
  * Promote honesty and directness, especially surrounding “bad news.” If people don’t feel safe delivering bad news, you often won’t get essential information. 
  * Create environments in which people can have a voice, such as explicitly inviting people to participate in meetings and reviews. When given the platform, team members will speak up.



**Let yourself (and your team) have fun.** This may sound trivial, but genuine enjoyment is essential to developing psychological safety. In fact, laughter is a key indicator of a safe and well-connected workplace. Take the time to create engaging and entertaining activities through which you and your team can simply have a good time and bond.

### Vulnerability: The Foundation of Teamwork

#### What Is Vulnerability and Why Does It Matter?

**Key Attributes: Vulnerability is the exposure of personal weakness followed by a request for help or support.** This exposure develops a collective sense of trust: _We can show the areas where we struggle and help strengthen each other_.

Team members develop relationships through the exchange of vulnerability—a process known as **the Vulnerability Loop** :

  * Person 1 expresses vulnerability
  * Person 2 recognizes Person 1’s expression
  * Person 2 responds by expressing their own vulnerability
  * Person 1 recognizes Person 2’s vulnerability
  * A new precedent is set, and the trust between both parties becomes stronger



**Benefit #1: When team members trust one another enough to be vulnerable, they can communicate openly and honestly.** Discussions surrounding failure are not always comfortable, but they’re essential. By directly asking for help, team members can locate flaws and either solve them before they escalate or plan for them in the future.

**Benefit #2: When team members are vulnerable and trust one another, they can act quickly and cooperatively, even in high-pressure situations.** They rely on each member of the group to do their job accurately and ask for assistance if necessary. The group is able to move as if part of a well-oiled machine, with each cog of the machine fulfilling its purpose and relying on the other cogs to fulfill theirs.

**Benefit #3: Teams can collectively discover the best solutions to problems through feedback.** Vulnerability often reveals problem areas. Team members with different backgrounds, experiences, and expertise can develop solutions to these issues through feedback sessions and collective insight.

#### What Are the Consequences of an Unwillingness to Show Vulnerability?

**Consequence #1: Insecurity takes over.** A culture that prohibits vulnerability tends to punish people for showing weakness. As a result, team members get insecure about their performance and become defensive. They reject feedback and fail to see errors in their own logic, robbing the group of the opportunity to fix issues.

**Consequence #2: People don’t notice issues.** If the work environment does not allow team members to ask for help, the team won’t find potential issues in proposals or projects. Without feedback, the team robs themselves of the opportunity to fix these issues.

#### How Can You Develop Vulnerability?

**Lead by example.** No signal of vulnerability is more powerful than one that comes from a leader. When team members see a high-level member of the group admit to a mistake, they immediately feel more comfortable owning up to their own mistakes and concerns. Accepting imperfection and opening yourself up to scrutiny develops trust.

**Be a better listener.** Team members want to feel heard, especially when expressing vulnerability. Make sure that your team members know that you are listening closely and care about what they have to say. The most effective listeners:

  * Make the speaker feel secure.
  * Approach the conversation from a supportive stance.
  * Ask _occasional_ questions that gently challenge the speaker to dig deeper into an obstacle or issue.
  * Make _occasional_ suggestions to lead the speaker down alternative paths.



**Be candid, not brutal.** You don’t want to demoralize or embarrass the person you are giving feedback to, but, at the same time, you need to be straightforward with your feedback. The best approach is to aim for candor: make your feedback specific and avoid making it personal or judgmental.

**Give bad news or negative feedback in person.** When bad news is sent digitally, it feels cold and can easily be misunderstood. Speaking in person allows for team members to connect on a personal level, even when the conversation is inherently negative.

**Design activities that promote honest feedback.** As you begin developing feedback meetings, standardize them and schedule them consistently. The more often you hold these meetings, the more comfortable the team will become sharing vulnerability and developing solutions.

### Purpose: The Core of Decision-Making

#### What Is Purpose and Why Does It Matter?

**Key Attributes: Purpose creates a central message that guides the direction of the company.** Purpose answers the question: _why do we do what we do?_ Leaders use purpose to focus the attention of the group towards a singular goal through a set of small signals. These signals can include direct reminders of purpose or indirect symbols such as catchphrases, iconography, and mission statements.

**Benefit #1: Giving team members a sense of purpose changes their perspective on their work.** When someone feels as though they are working on something that matters, their entire approach changes, typically increasing the quality of the work.

**Benefit #2: People with purpose learn faster.** Connecting the process of learning a new skill to the importance of that skill helps team members understand the purpose of their efforts. Consequently, they’ll devote energy and attention to understanding that skill. This energy **improves “learning velocity”**(the speed at which a team improves upon a new skill).

#### What Are the Consequences of a Lack of Purpose?

**Consequence #1: Without constant reminders of purpose as motivation and guidance, teams fail to perform up to standard because they don’t grasp the big-picture framework of their actions.** Work becomes tedious and work ethic, product quality, and communication tend to decrease.

**Consequence #2: Without a unified purpose, team members make inconsistent (and often harmful) decisions that don’t fall in line with the company’s philosophy—often without even realizing it.**

#### How Can You Develop Purpose?

**Give priorities a name and rank.** Focus on what’s important to your organization. Clear priorities allow team members to make decisions with consistency, even without direct instruction.

**Develop a unified language through the use of catchphrases.** Catchphrases make company ideals easy to remember and immediately actionable. Keep them simple and straightforward:

  * Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day. Teach him to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.
  * Shoot for the stars, but be happy with the moon.
  * Practice doesn’t make perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect. 



**Use mental contrasting.** Mental contrasting is the process of visualizing an attainable goal, then visualizing the obstacles.**** This process creates a story that reminds teams of where they are, where they are going and why:

  * Visualize an eventuality: _this is where we’re working towards._
  * Recognize your current state: _this is where we are today._
  * Discover obstacles: _this is what is currently in our way._



#### High-Proficiency vs High-Creativity Environments

Different groups have different priorities. When developing a high-purpose environment, you must determine if your organization requires **a high-proficiency or a high-creativity environment**.

##### High-Proficiency Environments

**Environments in which failure must be avoided require a high-level of proficiency.** Think of a military organization or a restaurant. Failure results in severe consequences and often takes significant effort to remedy.

**The purpose of a high-proficiency workplace is to create an environment in which team members can make quick and appropriate decisions while working as a singular unit.** The goal of a leader in a high-proficiency environment is to lead the team from point A to point B in the most efficient way possible, while adhering to the standards and ethics of the organization. The leader does this by creating a clear central message that allows employees to make consistent decisions based on the principles of the company.

**When crafting a high-proficiency environment, train your team members using repetition and feedback.** Reinforce standards, practices, and processes. The more a team is reminded of procedures, the faster they become routine.**** Also, remind team members of the importance of their positions by explaining the purpose of their roles as well as what they bring to the team.

##### High-Creativity Environments

On the other hand,**environments in which failure is a necessary component to development require a high-level of creativity.** Think of a design company or a movie studio. The process of creation requires a degree of failure as the improvement of a new concept develops through trial and error.

**The purpose of a high-creativity workplace is to create a space in which artists and creative people can discover their work for themselves.** When a company’s core purpose is to promote creation, teams have the freedom to fail quickly and often. Even if 90% percent of the ideas end up failing, the 10% that work can lead to incredible discoveries or advancements. The goal of a leader in a high-creativity environment is to lead the team into the unknown by giving them the tools to explore without hindering their journey.

**When crafting a high-creativity environment, safeguard creative freedom and embrace failure.** Autonomy is essential to the creative process. Without it, teams feel as though they have no ownership over their process. Give teams a framework, but avoid taking too much direct control of the process or taking over when failure occurs. Instead, be prepared to have a conversation about what that failure taught the group by creating activities and environments in which feedback can be given routinely and honestly.
