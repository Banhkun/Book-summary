## High-Proficiency vs. High-Creativity Environments

The standards for high-purpose environments change based on the overall goals of the company. When looking at their product and process, **teams must determine if they want an environment that encourages proficiency or one that promotes creativity.**

### High Proficiency Environments

#### The Key Attributes of a High-Proficiency Environment

Environments in which _failure must be avoided_ require a high-level of proficiency.**** Think of a military organization or a restaurant. Failure results in swift and severe consequences.

**The purpose of a high-proficiency workplace is to create an environment in which team members can make quick and appropriate decisions while working as a single unit.**

**A high-proficiency environment doubles down on clear priorities.** Team members must know what takes precedent in their day-to-day activities. Priorities allow employees to make decisions based on a hierarchy of focus or attention.

**These priorities are often emphasized by catchphrases that show causality (if X, then Y).** These simple rules of thumb (known as heuristics) include easy-to-remember phrases that dictate how team members should behave in certain situations. For example, if a restauranteur wants to ensure that servers are allowing guests to send back food without charging them, they may use a phrase such as “if they don’t like the souffle, they don’t have to pay.”

**The goal of a leader in a high-proficiency environment is to lead the team from point A to point B in the most efficient way possible while adhering to the standards and ethics of the organization.**

#### The Benefits of a High-Proficiency Environment

**A clear central message allows for a streamlined and consistent decision-making process.** Even without explicitly setting processes or guidelines, team members can make consistent decisions if given a magnetic core on which to base their choices.

##### The $100 Millon Recall

In 1982, tragedy struck. Someone had laced packages of Extra-Strength Tylenol with cyanide, leading to the deaths of 6 people in Chicago. John Burke (the president of Johnson & Johnson, the parent company of Tylenol) met with law enforcement to discuss the best route forward. The FBI and FDA recommended that he hold off on a nationwide recall as such an action could cause hysteria and would cost Johnson & Johnson millions of dollars. Burke ignored this recommendation and called for a total recall of the product—costing the company $100 million.

When asked why he went forward with the recall, his immediate response was to quote the company credo, which stated that the company’s first responsibility was to protect the people using their product. Thousands of decisions were made by Johnson & Johnson’s employees, all centered around the central purpose of the company. Because of these decisions, Tylenol’s market share (which had hit zero following the crisis) ultimately recovered and thrived.

#### Developing a High-Proficiency Environment

**Create a model of success.** Show team members what success looks like. Use successful team members, projects, and initiatives to promote a certain action or behavior.

**Train your team members using repetition and feedback.** Continually remind team members of the nature and importance of their position. Explain their purpose in the role as well as what they bring to the team. Reinforce standards, practices, and processes. The more a team is told what to do, the faster it becomes routine.

**Develop a clear language.** Use catchphrases that show causality (if X, then Y):

  * If a customer isn’t happy, we’re not happy.
  * If customer service is a vicious wave, then we are elite surfers.
  * If you show up on time, you’re already late.



**Praise the practice of fundamentals.** High-proficiency environments require the precise execution of particular skill sets. When you see an employee consistently use the foundational skills of the position, point it out. This serves as a constant reminder to team members that their efforts are being noticed, and that their attention to detail is important.

### High-Creativity Environments

#### The Key Attributes of a High-Creativity Environment

Environments in which _failure is a necessary component to development_ require a high-level of creativity. Think of a design company or a movie studio. The process of creation requires a degree of failure as the improvement of a new concept develops through trial and error. **The purpose of a high-creativity workplace is to create a space in which artists and creative people can discover their work for themselves.**

**High-creativity environments necessitate the ability to parse through large quantities of concepts.** Leaders need to develop processes to give teams honest feedback and set deadlines to ensure that projects stay on-task. These sessions help teams look at their ideas in new ways and cut out concepts that aren’t working while remaining in a reasonable timeframe.

**Creative control stays in the hands of the creators.** Teams need the freedom to make decisions and explore new avenues without the constant fear and frustration of losing control of their project.

**The goal of a leader in a high-creativity environment is to lead the team into the unknown by giving them the tools to explore without hindering their journey.**

#### The Benefits of a High-Creativity Environment

**In high-creativity environments, purpose gets people to develop new works more efficiently.** Even if 90% percent of the discussed concepts end up failing, the 10% that work can lead to incredible discoveries or advancements.

##### Pixar’s Process

Ed Catmull (president of Pixar) has created a space in which artists have developed some of the greatest animated films in cinematic history. However, by his own admission, most projects at Pixar start out as disasters.

How does Catmull bring a project from failure to acclaim? He acts in accordance with the central purpose of Pixar’s existence:**** to create an environment in which artists feel they have ownership of their creations while receiving guidance and feedback to help them grow.

He uses a series of routine meetings and activities through which artists can develop their projects and allows creators to choose their own projects. When giving feedback, he rarely makes any creative decisions. He says that the creators know their projects better than he does and that his suggestions would likely only be followed because he’s in a position of power, not because it’s the best creative choice for the project.

Catmull’s process allows creative teams to maintain control of their projects while accessing the collective intellect of the company as a whole to improve the product and guide the process.

#### Developing a High-Creativity Environment

**Pay close attention to team interaction.** Creativity relies on collaboration. When a team works well together, new ideas and concepts can be generated at a high rate. When a team does not work well together, incoherence can destroy the creative processes. If this occurs, step in and attempt to problem-solve. You may need to change the group makeup, adjust the focus of the team or change the roles of the team members.

**Safeguard creative freedom and self-sufficiency.** Autonomy is essential to the creative process. Without it, teams feel as though they have no ownership over their projects. Give teams a framework to work in and the resources they need to succeed, but try to avoid taking direct control.

**Embrace failure and promote feedback.** Failure will occur, and, when it does, be prepared to have a conversation about what that failure taught the group. Create activities and environments in which feedback can be given routinely and honestly. Schedule daily, weekly, and/or monthly meetings in which you can openly discuss projects and give direction.

**Praise initiative, especially when it arises without prompting.** When a team takes the initiative and moves forward on an idea, applaud them—even if that route ends in failure. This action will make your team _want_ to explore and will increase the volume of ideas they can sift through on their search for the “right” one.
