## Exercise: Overcome Temptations and Instant Gratification

Walter explains that one of the biggest threats to self-discipline is acting on your impulses without thinking—most commonly, giving into temptations and instant gratification. However, if you can identify your weaknesses and determine strategies to overcome them, you’ll be able to strengthen your self-discipline and engage in productive behavior.

* * *

What are three of the most common unproductive impulses you encounter in your daily life? (For example, do you feel compelled to eat a bowl of instant pasta instead of a nutritious meal? Do you struggle with the urge to play video games instead of cleaning the house?)

Based on the biological tendencies and _bad_ habits discussed by Walter, what do you think are the underlying causes of each of the impulses you just identified? (For example, do you crave the bowl of pasta because it’s comforting to you? Do you feel compelled to play games instead of cleaning because you fear losing your enjoyable gaming time?)

Finally, identify which of Walter’s potential solutions will help you resist these temptations and develop self-discipline. (For example, would the 10-minute rule help you overcome your impulse to eat a bowl of pasta instead of a nutritious meal? Would working cleaning into your morning routine make it easier to resist the urge to play games instead?)
