## 1-Page Summary

Forcing yourself to be productive when there’s almost _anything_ you’d rather do is difficult. In fact, it’s part of our nature to choose temptations and instant gratification over hard work and long-term goals. However, in _The Power of Discipline,_ Daniel Walter explains that the ability to self-discipline—to act in your best interests despite temptation—is the foundation of achieving any amount of success in your life. Luckily, he notes, self-discipline is a _skill_ that can be practiced and strengthened over time by developing good habits.

Walter is a Canadian author. After graduating from Yale University with a degree in cognitive neuroscience, he chose to use his passion for writing and his expertise in the mind to help others improve their abilities and reach their full potential. Specifically, his work focuses on improving focus, habits, and memory. Walter is also the author of _Habits for Success, How to Stop Procrastinating, The Productivity Blueprint, Take Your Day Back, and Ten-Minute Focus_.

In this guide, we’ll start by explaining what self-discipline is and why we struggle with it. We’ll then discuss the biological tendencies that hinder self-discipline and how to combat them. Finally, we’ll discuss the productive habits you should develop to overcome negative tendencies and strengthen your ability to self-discipline. In our commentary, we’ll explore arguments and methods from other books on attaining your goals and reaching your full potential, such as _Awaken the Giant Within _(Tony Robbins) and _The Power of Habit_ (Charles Duhigg).

### What Is Self-Discipline and Why Do We Struggle With It?

**Self-discipline is the ability to make healthy and productive choices, fight against temptations and instant gratification, and ultimately act in your best interests**. Walter notes that having self-discipline is crucial because it pushes you toward actions that breed success—fully committing to your goals, developing good habits, and consistently putting in hard work.

(Shortform note: In _Discipline Equals Freedom, _Jocko Willink agrees that self-discipline is crucial for committing to goals, developing good habits, working hard, and ultimately becoming successful. However, Willink’s definition of self-discipline is less detailed than Walter’s: He simply defines self-discipline as an internal force that drives you to take action and be better. This arguably misses an important nuance from Walter’s definition: that self-discipline _also_ encapsulates the ability to fight temptations and instant gratification (in other words, the actions that weaken our ability to self-discipline).)

Despite the importance of self-discipline, many people lack this ability because **humans have a natural tendency to opt for instant gratification over hard work and long-term rewards** —even if hard work is in their best interest. According to Walter, this is problematic because self-discipline doesn’t come naturally to people: It’s a skill that’s developed over time through practice and hard work. So, if you neglect to practice the skill regularly and instead chase instant gratification, you’ll struggle to engage in self-discipline, fail to achieve your goals, and feel unsatisfied in life.

(Shortform note: While experts agree that we naturally lean toward instant gratification, some argue that the solution isn’t practicing self-discipline as Walter recommends. Instead, they suggest learning how to minimize temptations. If we’re able to do this—by either changing ourselves or our environment—we won’t _need_ to use self-discipline. This alternative approach is arguably important to consider because, based on recent research, it might not be possible to teach people lasting self-discipline skills.)

**Walter further explains that humans struggle with self-discipline, and consequently fail to reach their goals, due to four main biological tendencies:** craving consistency, overestimating their own abilities, procrastinating, and setting unrealistic expectations. It's crucial to understand these tendencies so that you're aware of the biological forces working against you and your ability to self-discipline.

In the following sections, we’ll explore each of these tendencies, how they manifest, and how to overcome them.

#### Tendency #1: Craving Consistency

First, Walter explains that we resist change and crave consistency—in our lifestyles, jobs, environments, and so on. This tendency impedes self-discipline because **it stops us from taking uncomfortable steps that disrupt consistency but trigger improvement and success.**

(Shortform note: In _The Mountain Is You,_ Brianna Wiest agrees that our tendency to resist change and favor consistency hinders our ability to take difficult steps and improve ourselves. She explains that this phenomenon occurs because our brains are hardwired to maintain _homeostasis_ —a balance of chemicals and hormones in our bodies. When we step out of our comfort zone and do hard things (like practice self-discipline), we experience emotional changes that alter our bodily chemistry. To avoid these changes and maintain homeostasis, our brain sends us urges to resist change and maintain consistency.)

##### Humans Fear Loss and Failure and Desire Comfort

There are three reasons why humans crave consistency and therefore avoid making difficult but necessary choices.

**Reason #1: We’re afraid that change, or moving on to something new, will cause us to lose something valuable that we currently have.** For example, you resist moving to a different country because you’re afraid that you’ll have a worse life than you would if you stayed in your home country.

**Reason #2: We’re afraid of the failure and regret that change might trigger**. For example, you might resist moving to a different country because you’re afraid that you won’t find a new job, won’t make new friends, and will ultimately regret your decision.

**Reason #3: The longer we experience something—in this case, our current situation—the more comfortable and enjoyable it becomes.** For example, you might resist moving to a new country because you’ve lived in your home country for your entire life—you’re comfortable here and know what to expect, so why sabotage that by changing locations?

To overcome these issues and the tendency toward consistency, Walter suggests performing a thought analysis exercise. The following exercise will help you rationally analyze your decisions so you can make choices that are in your best interest rather than succumbing to your biological tendency to crave consistency:

When you have an important decision to make, write down your options (for example, make the move or stay in your current location), and list the pros and cons for each. The following day, return to your notes and determine which option will be most advantageous for improving yourself and reaching your goals.

> **We Crave Consistency Because of Our Pain vs Pleasure Response**
> 
> Whereas Walter argues there are three underlying reasons why people resist change and favor consistency, Tony Robbins argues that all unproductive behaviors and decisions can be linked to one underlying cause—our biological urge to avoid pain and seek pleasure. In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Robbins explains that these pain and pleasure responses are controlled by _neuro-associations_ —pathways in our mind that connect certain aspects of an experience with either pain or pleasure. When we have a positive (pleasurable) experience, we form positive neuro-associations with the experience and seek it out again in the future. When we have negative (painful) experiences, we form negative neuro-associations with the experience and avoid it in the future.
> 
> Robbins elaborates that there are three important factors that determine whether we’ll form a pain association or pleasure association with an experience. These factors may help explain why, according to Walter, we resist change and crave consistency.
> 
> First, Robbins explains that if a situation introduces a potential loss or physical or emotional pain (such as the pain experienced from failure, regret, or humiliation), people are more likely to form a negative neuro-association with that experience. This may explain why the fear of loss and the fear of failure make us resist change—we’ve negatively neuro-associated change with the potential of these painful fears coming true, meaning we avoid change in the future.
> 
> Second, Robbins explains that people are likely to form pleasure associations with experiences that provide comfort, causing them to seek these experiences over unknown experiences. Further, the more we engage in a certain comforting experience that provides pleasure, the stronger the positive neuro-association with this experience will grow, and the more we will seek out the experience. This may explain why experiencing comfortable consistency makes us even less likely to seek out change—we’ve positively neuro-associated consistency with pleasure and comfort, and the more we keep things consistent, the stronger that neuro-association becomes.
> 
> Despite these similarities in approach, Robbins and Walter differ regarding how to overcome these urges. While Walter recommends performing a thought exercise, Robbins recommends reconditioning neuro-associations so you can overcome harmful ones that cause you to engage in negative behaviors (like resisting change). (Walter discusses this technique briefly, but doesn’t emphasize it as the _key_ to overcoming bad habits as Robbins does.) We’ll discuss Robbins’s in-depth advice for overcoming negative neuro-associations and replacing them with positive ones in later commentary.

#### Tendency #2: Over-Estimating Personal Abilities

The second tendency that can impact self-discipline is the Dunning-Kruger effect, notes Walter.**This effect means that people who have low ability in a skill are more likely to overestimate their ability in that skill.** According to this phenomenon, people who are bad at self-discipline are likely to overestimate their ability, and, therefore, neglect practicing it. This is problematic because as noted, self-discipline is a skill you must _regularly practice_ to be good at it.

For example, someone who exhibits this tendency might leave work early as a reward for, in their view, usually being so self-disciplined about hitting their work hours. However, they’ve been rewarding themselves this way at least twice a week—they’re not disciplined in keeping to their work hours at all. Because this person falsely believes they’re a self-discipline expert, they neglect to ever _practice_ the ability. This causes them to possess a _lack_ of self-discipline.

(Shortform note: While it’s important to accurately judge your own abilities, the Dunning-Kruger effect might not be as big of a threat to self-discipline as Walter claims—recent studies show that the Dunning-Kruger effect might not actually exist. In one study, only 5 to 6% of unskilled participants overestimated their ability. Further, experts and novices overestimated _and_ underestimated their skills at the same frequency.)

**To avoid this tendency, Walter recommends seeking feedback from others** —especially those that are proficient at the ability you want to work on. This way, you can receive constructive criticism that will help you improve your abilities and avoid the Dunning-Kruger effect.

(Shortform note: Walter’s recommendation to overcome the Dunning-Kruger effect by seeking feedback from others could be problematic because it fails to address the underlying problem causing the effect—a lack of self-awareness. To overcome this tendency in the long term, you arguably need to learn to accurately judge your own abilities, rather than relying on others to do so. Psychologists make a few suggestions for improving your general self-awareness, which in turn, will enhance your ability to accurately assess your self-discipline skills: Practice identifying your emotions and emotional triggers to become more in sync with yourself, and consider how your actions affect others to get a more objective perspective of your behavior.)

#### Tendency #3: Procrastination

Walter explains that procrastination weakens our ability to self-discipline because**the more we procrastinate, the more habitual it becomes, and the less likely we are to practice self-discipline.** As previously explained, self-discipline is a skill that takes _practice_ to develop. So when you choose to practice the _opposite_ of self-discipline (procrastination, a type of temptation and instant gratification), you actively _weaken_ your ability to make productive choices (to self-discipline).

(Shortform note: In _The Now Habit, _Neil E. Fiore agrees that procrastination ultimately leads to more procrastination, which in turn weakens our ability to self-discipline. Furthermore, he provides a more in-depth explanation of why this happens. Fiore argues that we’re taught by society that work should be hard: Therefore, we dread it. This dread leads to a vicious cycle that feeds our procrastination: We dread the work, procrastinate to avoid it, feel guilty about procrastinating, and then continue to avoid thinking about or doing work to evade all the dread and guilt it stirs up.)

There are two main forms of procrastination. First, we might delay hard work in favor of something that’s instantly gratifying. Second, we might spend more time _planning_ work than actually _doing_ work, making us less likely to start the work at all.

For example, imagine that you want to submit a piece for an art show next month. Creating the piece of art might take 10 hours, so you tell yourself that you might as well start next week and do something fun like watch TV right now. Next week, you start to plan your piece, but you still have three weeks before the due date so you take your time coming up with the _perfect_ idea. By the time the week of the show arrives, you’re cramming to complete your artwork. You aren’t accepted into the show because you procrastinated and didn’t have enough time to produce a high-quality piece.

**To resist the tendency to procrastinate, Walter makes two suggestions.** First, get started on a task as soon as possible after deciding to do it—this will ensure that you complete your work on time or even ahead of schedule, allowing for higher-quality results. Second, stop _planning_ and start _doing_ a task when you’re 70% sure you’ll succeed—perfection doesn’t exist, so if you plan until your idea’s perfect, you’ll never get anything done.

> **Procrastination Isn’t _Always_ Bad**
> 
> In _A Mind For Numbers, _Barbara Oakley also explores the two main types of procrastination mentioned here; however, she argues that only one of these types is harmful. She explains that deferring tasks to continue planning them can be beneficial because it saves you from having to rework rushed decisions or tasks later. On the other hand, she agrees that consciously choosing to put off work _to do something more immediately favorable_ (like watching TV) is unproductive. She differentiates between these two forms of procrastination by labeling the latter as _habitual procrastination._
> 
> Oakley’s recommendations for how to overcome procrastination both align with and differ from Walter’s. Both authors agree that you should start tasks as soon as possible to avoid procrastination. However, Oakley adds that you should get the _hardest_ tasks done first to avoid burnout—you’ll naturally have more energy first thing, and if you get hard tasks finished early, you might have more time for rest.
> 
> Oakley _doesn’t_ echo Walter’s recommendation to stop planning and start working when you’re 70% sure you’ll succeed—likely because she believes that spending time planning isn’t a negative form of procrastination and therefore shouldn’t be curbed.

#### Tendency #4: Setting Unrealistic Expectations

**Finally, Walter explains that we set unrealistic expectations by underestimating the amount of time and effort it takes to reach our goals.** When we neglect to put the necessary time and effort into our endeavors, we’ll likely fail to reach our goals. This failure discourages us from continuing to work toward our goals in the future, crippling our ability to self-discipline.

**When you make the easy decision to give up rather than putting in the time and effort necessary to achieve your goal, you _weaken_ your ability to self-discipline. **This is because giving up is another form of temptation and instant gratification. As previously explained, when you practice these habits that are the _opposite_ of self-discipline, they grow stronger while your ability to self-discipline grows weaker.

For example, your goal might be to learn how to knit. To do so, you need to practice one hour per day for one month. Someone who sets unrealistic expectations might think that spending one hour a day practicing for a week is enough to master the skill. Another person with unrealistic expectations might practice for a month, but only spend two hours a week practicing. Both people give up at the end of their allotted time frame because they didn’t put in the necessary time or effort to complete their goal. When they give up and _stop trying_ to knit, they’re giving into temptation rather than practicing their ability to self-discipline, consequently weakening their ability to self-discipline in the future.

**To overcome this tendency, Walter recommends taking the time to analyze your goals and the actions you’re taking to reach them**. Ensure that you’re not engaging in self-sabotaging behaviors that set you up for failure, like setting unrealistic expectations. Ask yourself what a rational time frame to complete your goal is, what work you must do to achieve it, and how often or when you need to do that work to reach your goal within the given time frame. This realistic analysis will reduce your chance of failing and giving up, thus preserving your self-discipline.

> **The Impacts of the Planning Fallacy and How to Resolve Them**
> 
> Experts explain that the tendency to set unrealistic expectations can be linked to an underlying cognitive bias called the planning fallacy _._ This theory states that people tend to underestimate how much time it’ll take to complete tasks (or reach goals) due to poor planning and overly optimistic performance expectations. They elaborate that this tendency is the result of three main biases:
> 
>   * _Optimism bias_ convinces us that we’re less likely to experience misfortunes that might disrupt our plans. For example, we might expect to get to work in 10 minutes because we don’t anticipate rush-hour traffic slowing us down.
> 
>   * _Motivated reasoning_ makes us set unrealistic expectations because those are the results we _want_ rather than what’s _realistic._
> 
>   * _Taking the inside view_ makes us focus on the small details of something rather than the big picture, which can lead to avoidable mistakes.
> 
> 

> 
> Further, experts reiterate Walter’s claim that setting unrealistic expectations can lead to a lack of self-discipline. They also provide more detail on why this might occur, explaining that the repeated disappointment of failure due to unrealistic expectations can trigger self-judgment, depression, and burnout. These factors likely prompt the negative thoughts that convince us to give up on our goals—in other words, to give up on self-discipline.
> 
> Walter recommends avoiding unrealistic expectations by analyzing your behaviors to ensure you’re being productive and realistic. But what types of analysis should you perform? Experts make a few suggestions:
> 
>   * **Take the outside view**. To gain a more realistic perspective on your goals, the time and effort required to complete them, and the obstacles you might encounter, seek advice from experts or people who’ve attempted similar goals in the past.
> 
>   * **Define your priorities.** When you plan what tasks to complete and when as Walter recommends, prioritize your tasks and avoid unnecessary work. This will ensure that you’re getting everything done in an orderly and timely manner.
> 
>   * **Manage your time and resources.** Block time off in your calendar to complete tasks and list all the resources that you’ll need to complete them to ensure you’re maximizing your productivity.
> 
>   * **Consider obstacles.** Brainstorm a scenario in which you failed to meet your deadline and determine the obstacles that could have gotten in your way. This will help you take action to avoid this scenario.
>

### Improve Self-Discipline With Good Habits

Now that you understand the biological tendencies that inhibit self-discipline and how to overcome them, it’s time to focus on strengthening your ability to self-discipline. Walter argues that **the best way to improve your ability to self-discipline is to get rid of bad habits and replace them with good ones that support discipline**.

Habits are things that we do regularly without even thinking about them: for example, scrolling on social media every time we feel bored. When we allow ourselves to form habits that are contrary to our best interests, we lessen our chances of adopting positive habits and thus weaken our ability to self-discipline.

(Shortform note: While Walter argues that building good habits is one of the best ways to _strengthen_ your self-discipline, Gary Keller explains that this might actually _drain_ your ability to practice self-discipline (what he calls willpower). In _The One Thing, _Keller says that we have a limited supply of self-discipline. Doing things like building new habits uses up our discipline allotment quickly and makes us more prone to giving in to temptations at the end of the day. To recharge your self-discipline and continue practicing good habits, Keller recommends eating plenty of complex carbohydrates and proteins throughout the day.)

To override bad habits that weaken your ability to self-discipline, Walter recommends developing the following _good_ habits:

#### Habit #1: Create Morning and Evening Routines

Walter explains that **following a healthy morning and evening routine makes it easier to engage in productive behaviors and make good choices**. Making these routines a habit will help you to resist unproductive temptations—like sleeping in, eating poorly, or staying up too late—that decrease your self-discipline abilities.

For your morning routine, plan out what time to wake up, eat breakfast, leave for work, and so on. Your evening routine should start an hour before bed and incorporate things that make it easier to fall asleep. For example, if your bedtime is at 10:00 pm, start your routine at 9:00 pm—brush your teeth, wash your face, set your clothes out for the next day, journal, and then get into bed.

> **How to Make Routines Into Habits**
> 
> In _The Power of Habit, _Charles Duhigg agrees that routines are central to adopting good habits. He also notes that changing core habits, like your morning and evening routine, helps with resisting temptations and sticking to good habits throughout the day. However, he elaborates that simply _creating_ a routine isn’t enough for it to become a habit. There are two more elements involved in the habit-forming process: a cue that signals the start of your routine and a reward that comes after. Without these additional elements, your routine won’t become a _habit_ ; rather, it’ll be something you must force yourself to do every time.
> 
> Your morning routine has a natural cue built in: waking up. However, you may need to intentionally curate this routine so there’s a reward at the end—for example, arriving at work 30 minutes early so you can make a cup of coffee and read a novel before the day begins. On the other hand, your nightly routine might have a built-in reward—a good night’s sleep—but not a natural cue. This can prevent you from starting it on time or at all. Instead, ensure that there’s an obvious trigger for you to begin your routine, like an alarm set for 9:00 pm.

#### Habit #2: Create Plans to Achieve Your Goals

Walter explains that big goals are daunting and can lead to inaction if they seem too lofty—and as previously discussed, failing to take active steps toward your goals is a bad habit that weakens your ability to self-discipline. **To avoid inaction, clearly identify your goals and create a plan of action for accomplishing them**. Your plan will consist of the numerous daily tasks and sub-goals that must be fulfilled before you can achieve your larger goal.

Being clear about your goals and breaking them down into daily actions will make it easier for you to practice self-discipline, and it’ll make you more likely to succeed. This is because you’ll know exactly what needs to get done and when, so you can hold yourself accountable.

To create an effective plan of action, you first need to be clear and realistic about your end goal. For example, don’t just say you want to move abroad immediately: Say you want to move to Argentina by April. Next, break down the tasks you must do to reach your goal—for example, apply for residency, find an apartment, research the cost of living, and so on. Once you’ve outlined the tasks required to accomplish your goal, create a daily schedule so you can accomplish a task (or subgoal) every day.

> **An Additional Method to Create Fool-Proof Plans That Facilitate Self-Discipline**
> 
> In _Eat That Frog!, _Brian Tracy agrees that creating clear goals and a plan for completing them is crucial to avoiding inaction and making efficient progress. Like Walter, Tracy also emphasizes the need to break large goals down into smaller tasks that can be completed on a daily basis to keep you motivated and on task.
> 
> However, Tracy adds two important recommendations that will arguably make it even easier for you to practice self-discipline with regard to your goals and tasks. First, assign a priority level to each task when creating your plan—this will ensure that the most important or foundational tasks get completed on time and don’t delay your progress. Second, review your goals daily to ensure that they still align with your desires. Repeatedly revisiting your list of goals will motivate you and inspire you to work hard (and practice self-discipline) to achieve them.

#### Habit #3: Gain Control Over Your Impulses

Walter explains that one of the habits most detrimental to self-discipline is acting on our impulses without thinking. This habit can come in the form of giving into temptations, like the urge to give up, or giving into instant gratification—choosing something that’s immediately rewarding even if it’s bad for us in the long term. Walter recommends developing two habits that will help you control your impulses: keeping in mind the 40% rule and following the 10-minute rule.

The 40% rule states that typically, you’ve only done 40% of the work you’re capable of completing when you start to lose energy and feel ready to give up. **Instead of giving up at this point, acknowledge the discomfort and try to push past it.** This will help you practice self-discipline and reach your full capabilities.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that the urge to give up is common but detrimental to self-discipline and success. They explain that these urges arise because the closer we get to a goal, the more we fear failure and become stressed. To escape the fear and stress, our minds urge us to give up and let go of the goal altogether. While using the 40% rule is a strategy to “ _push through_ the pain,” psychologists recommend overcoming the urge to give up by _replacing_ pain with positivity and motivation. For example, find a “why” that gives meaning to your goal, stop comparing yourself to other people, or find a mentor to support and inspire you.)

The 10-minute rule is designed to help you overcome your impulses for instant gratification. **When you feel the urge to make an unproductive decision, wait 10 minutes and see if the urge fades.** The 10-minute gap will help you think more logically about what the best choice is, and your impulse for instant gratification might dissipate.

> **Applications of the Pomodoro Technique**
> 
> The Pomodoro Technique is a method for avoiding instant gratification that’s similar to Walter’s “10-minute” rule, but it’s specifically designed to improve time management. Despite this difference, the technique can prove beneficial to avoiding instant gratification in general.
> 
> Like Walter’s method, the Pomodoro Technique recommends that you set a timer for 10 minutes (or longer) when you feel the urge to procrastinate. However, whereas Walter doesn’t specify what you should do in that 10-minute time span, the Pomodoro method says to fill that time by doing something productive. Many experts believe engaging in productive behaviors during these 10 minutes will make you more likely to _continue_ to be productive afterward and less likely to give in to instant gratification and other temptations.
> 
> These benefits can arguably help you avoid instant gratification even outside of a work context. For example, if you feel the urge to binge eat, you can spend 10 minutes doing yoga instead. You’ll be less likely to feel the urge to do something that harms your health after spending 10 minutes doing something to benefit it.

#### Habit #4: Become Familiar With Discomfort

Walter explains that **self-discipline can be uncomfortable because it often involves making ourselves do something that we don’t want to do** —for instance, working instead of going to a party. However, by observing our urges to engage in unproductive behaviors and instead choosing to practice self-discipline despite its discomfort, we’ll strengthen our ability to resist those urges and persevere in hard situations.

Walter explains that **one of the best ways to familiarize yourself with discomfort is to actively seek situations that take you outside of your comfort zone**. For example, if you feel uncomfortable being on stage, the next time your friends want to go to a karaoke bar, join them and do a duet. This will be really difficult, but it’ll familiarize you with the feeling of discomfort and help you be more resilient to these feelings in the future.

(Shortform note: In addition to improving your self-discipline and resilience in difficult situations, experts explain that stepping outside of your comfort zone will make you more confident, creative, and in touch with yourself. However, they caution against stepping outside of your comfort zone too quickly and becoming overwhelmed: Trying new things arguably won’t be that beneficial if you’re stricken with fear the entire time. Psychologists make a few suggestions to help you embrace discomfort in a sustainable way: Stop comparing yourself to others, take baby steps, and start by entering uncomfortable situations with a friend.)

#### Habit #5: Practice Mindfulness and Meditation

Walter argues that practicing **mindfulness—focusing on the present and controlling your thoughts and emotions—is key to improving self-discipline.** This is because it’s harder to self-discipline when you’re overwhelmed by negative thoughts and emotions—especially ones about the future. If you can focus on the present moment and control your thoughts and emotions, they’ll be unable to influence your ability to self-discipline.

**Walter explains that one of the best ways to develop mindfulness is to get into the habit of meditating**. Over time, meditation allows you to be more mindful more often. It also produces many benefits that are directly linked to the ability to self-discipline, such as focus, rational decision-making, and delaying instant gratification.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that mindfulness and meditation are two of the most impactful practices for increasing self-discipline because they give you control over your emotions and impulses. These practices also indirectly improve self-discipline by increasing sleep quality and alleviating stress. One of the best meditation techniques to help beginners develop mindfulness and awareness of their emotions is “noting:” recording the thoughts, feelings, and urges you’re experiencing in a given moment. For example, if you’re feeling overwhelmed by impulses, record the experience. This will help you realize that impulses are just thoughts to overcome.)

#### Habit #6: Fully Commit to Your Goals

Walter explains that **to effectively practice self-discipline, you must fully commit to your goals**. When you make a commitment to “ _try_ ” to do something, you’ll only make a half-hearted effort to achieve your goal, hindering your ability to self-discipline. To actually achieve your goals and strengthen your self-discipline, you must put 100% of your effort into the necessary work and truly believe that you have the ability to succeed.

(Shortform note: In _The 12 Week Year, _Brian Moran agrees that you won’t be inspired to hold yourself accountable (practice self-discipline) and shoot for goals if you’re not _fully committed_. He explains that weak commitments are a product of our subconscious intentions _._ For example, you might struggle to fully commit to losing weight because your subconscious wants to binge eat. These subconscious intentions have the most power over our behavior when we’re unaware of them. Therefore, to fully commit to your goals, become aware of these intentions. You can do this by identifying the limiting thoughts, beliefs, and habits that are making you subconsciously resist your goals and replacing them with more positive ones.)

##### Increase Commitment by Pacing Yourself and Creating a Routine

To ensure that you’re fully committed and maintain momentum toward your goal, Walter makes two recommendations.

**First, pace yourself and the amount of work you’re doing.** Ensure that you’re spreading your work over a rational amount of time and not taking huge strides at the very beginning. When you take on too much too soon, you’re more likely to lose motivation and momentum down the road, weakening your self-discipline.

**Second, make a goal-focused routine and stick with it even after you begin to succeed**. Walter explains that achieving success requires consistency, and maintaining that success requires you to continue practicing the habits that got you there even _after_ you’ve reached your goal. Having a set routine can help you do this.

For example, if you’re trying to gain supporters to donate to your new innovation, posting on social media twice a week at random times won’t be helpful. Instead, plan to post once in the morning and once in the evening every day. Once you’ve gained a wide base of supporters and achieved your goal, continue to post twice per day to maintain those supporters and strengthen that community.

> **Set SMART Goals to Increase Commitment**

> Another technique to help increase commitment to your goals is the SMART goal-setting method. Like Walter’s recommendations, SMART goals help you increase your commitment levels by making your goals more realistic and helping you identify specific actions that will help you succeed. While some of the SMART method steps align with Walter’s recommendations, the process also provides additional strategies that will arguably further increase your commitment:
> 
>   * **Make your goals _specific._** Having specific goals makes it easier to identify the steps needed to achieve them.
> 
>   * **Make your goals _measurable._** Identify a variable you can use to measure your progress and ensure that you’re being productive. You can use this step to check that you’re not moving too fast or too slow, as Walter recommends.
> 
>   * **Make your goals _achievable._** Ensure that you’ve given yourself a realistic time frame to complete your goal and that you’ve identified the actions to take and obstacles to overcome to achieve it. This step will help you create a more realistic routine, as Walter suggests.
> 
>   * **Make your goals _relevant._** Align your goals with your long-term objectives and values to provide you with intrinsic motivation to succeed.
> 
>   * **Create a _timeline._** Based on the deadline, actions, and obstacles you identified in Step 3, create a timeline showing what you need to do and when to achieve your goal on time. This step aligns with Walter’s recommendation to create a routine.

#### Habit #7: Create Positive Associations

Walter explains that using self-discipline to force yourself to do important work won’t sustain you forever. If you truly don’t like the work you’re doing, your negative emotions surrounding the work will eventually burn out your ability to self-discipline. To avoid this outcome and maintain your self-discipline, Walter explains that **you must form positive associations with the work you’re doing—even if it's not something you particularly enjoy.**

**To form positive associations with your work, create a ritual that integrates things you enjoy into your work process—before, during, and after your work.** Walter emphasizes that these routines must be _repeated_ for your brain to form positive associations with your work.

For example, before you start work, open all the curtains in your office to let the natural light in. During work, light your favorite scented candle. After work, reward yourself by cooking a nice dinner. When you repeat this routine _every time_ you work, it’ll create a positive mental association with the work and make it easier for you to self-discipline.

> **Change Your Neuro-Associations to Boost Self-Discipline**
> 
> In _Awaken the Giant Within, _Tony Robbins agrees that rewiring your negative associations (what he calls negative neuro-associations) is crucial to engaging in productive behaviors, or in other words, practicing self-discipline. If you allow negative associations with necessary activities like work to persist, you’ll struggle to get anything done.
> 
> However, while Walter focuses on building positive associations to replace old ones that cause unproductive behaviors, this might not be enough to completely override the original _negative_ association. To ensure that your old associations are completely undone and replaced by new, positive ones, Robbins recommends taking a few additional steps:
> 
> **1) Identify the specific change you want to make and what’s getting in your way**. For example, you want to be able to work for 5 hours straight without getting distracted. You might be struggling to do this because you get bored and would prefer watching TV.
> 
> **2) Create a sense of urgency to change.** To do this, identify how your current associations are harming you and preventing you from becoming who you want to be. This will motivate you to start rewiring your associations immediately rather than delaying until a “convenient time.”
> 
> **3) Disrupt your existing pattern of thinking.** Whenever you start to feel the negative association with a certain action (like work) hitting you, do something dramatic to interrupt it. For example, whenever you start to feel the dread or boredom of work sink in, jump out of your seat and do 20 jumping jacks while singing your favorite song. This will help you break the old, negative neuro-association by distorting the neural pathways that used to connect boring work with dread and procrastination.
> 
> **4) Create a positive pattern to replace the old one, and then reinforce that pattern.** This step aligns with Walter’s recommendation to create a routine that builds positive associations with the activity. Robbins recommends replacing the old urge with a strictly positive behavior. For example, when you feel the urge to procrastinate, go get a cup of your favorite tea and get back to work. Once you’ve replaced the old pattern, make the new pattern a routine to enforce the new neuro-association.
