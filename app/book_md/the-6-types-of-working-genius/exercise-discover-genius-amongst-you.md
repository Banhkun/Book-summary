## Exercise: Discover Genius Amongst You!

Lencioni emphasizes the importance of being able to recognize specific intelligences in yourself and those you work with. In the following exercise, you’ll get the chance to seek out these intelligences’ vital characteristics at play in your own projects, as well as potentially discover how to nurture them even more over time.

* * *

Take a few minutes and try to determine the last project you worked on collaboratively with your teammates. Which tasks or phases seemed to come most naturally to you?

Did you also find that you enjoyed those tasks or phases the most, or that you found them the most fulfilling? Why or why not?

Based on your responses above, what would you guess are your specific intelligences from Lencioni’s framework? Remember that they’re Perceiving Opportunity, Innovating Solutions, Vetting Ideas, Mobilizing People, Supporting, and Seeing Things Through.

Now try determining those of your teammates.

How might you use your next team project as an opportunity to further anchor yourself in roles connected to your intelligences? How could you better demonstrate or advocate for them to your supervisor and coworkers?
