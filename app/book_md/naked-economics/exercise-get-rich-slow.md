## Exercise: Get Rich Slow

Financial markets’ reputation as a way to “get rich quick” is misleading, because first, all information you can make trading decisions with is available to the public, and second, while you’re trying to maximize your utility (your happiness), everyone else is doing the same.

* * *

Describe a time you used financial markets to invest or speculate in a way that you hoped would earn you a quick return. What was the ultimate result of your speculation?

If you were successful, why do you think this was? (For example, was it because of good luck or because you had information before other people did?) Do you think you could consistently repeat your results in the future? Why or why not?

If you weren’t successful, why do you think this was? (For example, was it because of bad luck or because other people had information you didn’t have?) What might you do differently in the future to produce a different outcome?
