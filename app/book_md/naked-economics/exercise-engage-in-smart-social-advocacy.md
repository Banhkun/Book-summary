## Exercise: Engage in Smart Social Advocacy

Sometimes, rich-world social advocates object to what they see as negative effects of globalization that the poor world suffers and try to impose regulations intended to counter these ills. Unfortunately, though well-intended, these “solutions” often make problems worse, not better.

* * *

Describe a time you boycotted goods from a developing country, or saw others doing so, because of social advocacy. (For example, did you ever avoid a product because of news about poor factory conditions or a bad environmental record?)

What is a better way you could aid in the welfare of people in the developing world? (For example, could you contribute to organizations that work to improve living conditions in developing countries?)
