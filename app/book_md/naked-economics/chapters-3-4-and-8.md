## Chapters 3, 4, and 8: Government’s Role in Markets

Now that we’ve explored some basic concepts of economics, let’s look at the role governments play in markets.

**A government makes a capitalist market possible.** Though people, including many politicians, sometimes speculate about how much better the market could operate if there were little or no government control of markets (or even society), the truth is, countries without strong governments have almost non-existent markets in which it’s difficult to conduct even simple transactions. For example, businesses find it almost impossible to operate in Somalia, where a lack of government means there’s little infrastructure or protection against criminals.

In this chapter, we’ll explore the different ways a government can facilitate a functioning market economy. We’ll also explore the ways it can destroy one: Government intervention in the economy isn’t always beneficial.

### A Government Enforces Laws

The most essential thing a government does to benefit the economy is **provide laws and infrastructure that allow businesses to conduct transactions.** Without a set of rules that everyone involved in a market agrees to, and which can be enforced, a market can’t smoothly operate (or operate at all). Laws and regulations allow people to trust complete strangers in situations where they otherwise wouldn’t be able to. This is why you can, for example, give your money to a bank teller and feel confident you’ll see that money again later. Your transactions with other individuals are protected as much as with firms: You can send an online payment to a person on the other side of the world and feel comfortable that you’ll receive the, say, necklace you ordered—and they’ll feel comfortable they’ll receive your payment.

### A Government Protects Property Rights

Without established property rights enforced by the government, you could spend your time, money, and other resources growing a crop of wheat, only for someone else to come to your farm and harvest it for themselves—and you would have no legal recourse against them.

Property includes intangible things as well as tangible ones, like ideas (protected by copyright laws, patent laws, and trademark laws). **In order for an economy to produce anything of value, ideas must be protected** —if a firm develops, for example, a new medication, and other firms are allowed to simply copy their formulation and sell it for their own profit, the first firm will have no incentive to create the medication in the first place.

Property rights can also include even more complicated notions of “property.” For example, do you own the right to enjoy a quiet night’s sleep, or does your neighbor own the right to leave her barking dog in her yard all night? Noise ordinances and other such regulations can help resolve these disputes.

### A Government Provides Public Goods

One of the most important responsibilities of a government is building and maintaining goods that everyone benefits from:

  * **Infrastructure:** roads, bridges, shipping ports, and so on, so that companies can transport goods, customers can freely travel to businesses, and an economy can function properly
  * **Public safety:** law enforcers at every level of government, from local police to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
  * **National protection:** a military and the equipment it needs



**The private sector wouldn’t be able to provide these goods because of the “free rider” problem,** which is what happens when something expensive is paid for by one person but then enjoyed by all.

For example, if a clothing company realized it needed paved roads for its delivery trucks to reach customers, and it decided to fund those roads itself, then it would be at a disadvantage against its competitors, who’d get to use the road, too, but at no cost to them—meaning they’d be able to conduct business without the debt of the road-building project weighing them down. Because of this inherent competitive disadvantage, the clothing company would never bother to create the roads in the first place, and therefore all companies would remain worse off, unable to easily transport items. A government, paid for by taxes, is the only fair solution to such problems.

### A Government Helps the Needy

A government prevents a capitalist economy from devolving into a fully polarized structure in which some people reap all the rewards and others reap none. **To do so it redistributes some wealth from the richest to the poorest citizens.** This doesn’t mean directly taking cash from wealthy people and handing it to poor people, but instead, taxing people who have excess funds in order to pay for safety-net programs that help people in financial need. These programs include unemployment payments, food stamps, and the like.

### A Government Manages Externalities

Decisions you make affect other people, even when those other people didn’t have a say in your decision. For example, if you buy a large, gas-guzzling car, there are social costs:

  * You make travel a little more dangerous for other cars. 
  * You emit exhaust fumes that harm asthmatics.
  * You contribute to global warming, which brings stronger monsoons to people in far-off regions of the globe. 



**Economists call this an _externality_ , or the difference between the cost of something to one individual and the cost of it to the wider society. **Governments manage externalities by passing regulations to limit the damage that one person’s decisions might have on another person’s quality of life. This task falls to governments rather than individuals because a government’s reach is wide, while an individual has only a narrow perspective on the world and is either unable to see how her decisions affect other people or unable to do anything about it.

#### Banning Versus Taxing

A government can manage externalities through either regulation or taxes. Regulations ban certain things in order to protect a large number of people from the personal decisions of a few: For example, zoning boards in local governments sometimes ban ugly buildings or ones that block views. However, a government can’t ban too many things or it will become authoritarian, infringing on people’s freedom to choose how to live.**For this reason, governments often use taxes to discourage unwanted behavior.**

Taxes are effective because they increase the _private_ cost of something that has social costs. Increased private costs deter people from doing or buying certain things. For example, increasing the cost of driving a heavy, gas-guzzling vehicle by adding a fuel tax will encourage people to buy more fuel-efficient cars. Taxes also limit those behaviors to individuals willing to pay more for them.

Taxes have other benefits as well:

  * They raise useful revenues that a government can put toward other solutions to the unwanted behavior—for example, cigarette taxes can fund health education.
  * They encourage producers to shift their priorities, which decreases supply of things that enable the unwanted behavior—for example, if people start demanding fuel-efficient cars, car manufacturers will produce them instead of fuel-guzzling alternatives. 



### The Negative Side of Government Intervention

While a government must establish rules that allow for a functioning economy, if it sets too many rules, or gets too involved in managing economic operations, it can destroy an economy in a number of ways:

  * Governments can misdirect resources.
  * Regulations can raise costs.
  * Regulations can stifle growth.
  * Taxes can distort incentives.

Each of these ideas is explored below.




#### Governments Can Misdirect Resources

**One major way that a government can steer an economy wrong is by misdirecting resources**. While a market directs resources according to where market demand indicates they’re needed, a government directs resources according to how _individuals in power_ want them to be directed. These individuals often have motives that don't align with the movies of the rest of society.

For example, in the early 1990s, the federal government funded the building of a high-speed particle accelerator. The best building spot for the accelerator would have been Illinois, which already had much of the necessary scientific infrastructure built because of previous projects. However, the government chose to locate the accelerator in Texas, not for practical reasons but because the President at the time, George W. Bush, hailed from Texas and wanted the prestigious project built there. Because there was no existing infrastructure or expertise in that area, the price of the project skyrocketed and work was ultimately halted—after the government had spent over $1 billion on it.

When governments direct resources to pet projects because of a personal preference, taxpayers lose in two ways:

  1. Tax money is wasted on projects that eventually go bust because they weren’t sound.
  2. Taxes are tied up in less valuable projects instead of being spent on projects that could improve society: money for entrepreneurs, loans for students, and so on. 



#### Regulations Can Raise Costs

**Governments can also interfere with an economy’s operations by implementing too many regulations.** Regulations are a subtle way of directing resources and money, and they can raise the cost of doing business in various ways—for example, through excessive licensing requirements or paperwork. When businesses incur extra costs because of regulations, they typically raise their prices, making goods and services more expensive for consumers.

For example, regulations ensure that lawyers are well-educated, so that consumers can be sure to hire qualified legal help. To a degree, this is a good thing for consumers, because it protects them from unqualified lawyers. However, the educational standards for lawyers are exorbitant, requiring many years of school and ongoing certifications, and are not necessary for the majority of legal work that many consumers need advice on—much legal work is simple paper-filing, not complicated prosecutions. As a result, lawyers are very expensive, and sometimes consumers can’t afford them. Consumers would be better off if they were allowed to choose between lawyers of differing levels of credentials.

#### Regulations Can Stifle Growth

**Regulations can also stifle growth by propping up specific industries.** They are often used by these industries to protect their incumbents. Such incumbents are called _special interest groups_ : groups that influence governmental policies. Special interest groups promise politicians votes in return for policies that benefit them, but that don’t necessarily benefit the rest of the economy. An example would be corn farmers, who pressure politicians into imposing corn-sourced ethanol requirements in gasoline, purportedly because ethanol makes gas more environmentally friendly. Even though the scientific evidence for the benefits of ethanol is scant, politicians continue to promise ethanol regulations and ethanol subsidies because corn farmers make up a powerful voting block.

Regulations supported by special interests have a number of negative effects on an economy:

**1\. They prop up industries** that couldn’t otherwise sustain themselves (like the ethanol industry detailed above).

**2\. They waste taxpayer money** on projects that don't benefit most taxpayers (such as funds for local museums paid for by federal dollars).

**3\. They erect barriers** to people trying to enter an industry, which makes it harder for qualified people to offer their services. For example, the training and certification regulations for teachers haven’t been shown to raise teacher performance, but do serve to protect existing teachers from competition. In fact, most new certification laws that are introduced _exempt existing teachers_ —if such laws were truly necessary for the benefit of students, all teachers should be subjected to them.

**4\. They raise prices** for consumers, without providing additional benefits. For example, in many states, people wishing to become manicurists have to complete stringent licensing requirements, not because consumers regularly get injured from pedicures, but because existing nail salons want protection from incoming immigrants offering cheaper prices. Such regulations deliver few benefits to consumers but allow existing salons to keep their prices high.

**5\. They prevent creative destruction, which is when markets destroy an existing system when creating a new one.** For example, the rise of streaming services destroyed the business model of retail video-rental stores. Creative destruction is a natural part of an economy, and regulations that prevent it by protecting industries from being destroyed or altered also prevent companies from innovating in ways that benefit consumers.

#### Taxes Can Distort Incentives

Taxes are an important source of income for a government, enabling it to provide the services needed to run an economy. **However, if taxes are not well-designed, they can harm an economy by distorting people’s incentives in a number of ways:**

1\. In order to avoid taxes, rich people often try to **exploit tax code loopholes,** moving their money to different investments or even to a different location—states or countries—with laxer tax laws. Tax avoidance acts as a drag on productivity in an economy, since it directs business activity away from productive pursuits and instead toward tax evasion. This type of activity also exacerbates inequality because in general, only rich people can afford accountants who can exploit the tax code.

2\. By taxing income, a government essentially punishes work, which can **discourage people from working.** The effects of this can be seen when married couples are lumped together under the same tax bracket: The earner who pulls in less income will end up paying a much higher tax rate than she would pay by herself, making her efforts significantly less financially rewarding. Since these second earners are typically women, such taxes discourage women from staying in the workforce. This can have a tangible effect on workforce participation; after the 1986 tax reforms addressed this issue in the U.S., women’s participation in the workforce increased threefold.

3\. If tax rates get so high that the people being taxed feel they’re unfairly treated, they’ll **create a black market** to conduct their business. This can be a real problem in some high-tax countries; for example, experts estimate that a shadow economy in Norway expanded from 1.5 percent of gross national product in 1960 to 18 percent of it by the end of the 20th century. Further, when people drop out of the official economy and stop paying taxes, everyone else’s taxes rise, which then encourages more people to move into the black market, and it becomes a downward spiral.

##### How Much Is Too Much Taxation?

Some economists argue that since taxes punish work (as well as discourage investment by taking away some of the future returns of a firm investing in a business), **they should be reduced to almost zero.** These economists argue that such tax cuts would encourage such economic growth that they would pay for themselves, because the smaller taxes recouped from the increased economic growth would more than equal the larger taxes taken from smaller economic growth.

**Unfortunately, this belief is based on a misunderstanding.** It’s true that cutting taxes and rolling back regulation can encourage productivity, but such cuts will only pay for themselves if they’re swinging the tax rates from one extreme to another. For example, if tax rates are set at 95 percent of income, that economy is probably slow-growing (such high rates remove almost all incentives to work hard or invest in businesses). If those taxes get reduced to 5 percent, that economy is likely to take off to such an extreme that the government will end up raking in much higher revenues.

However, in a country like the United States, where tax rates are relatively low—and certainly lower than many other developed countries—a further tax cut isn't going to pay for itself. Instead, it will simply deprive the government of revenue that it could use to keep the economy running smoothly, defend the nation, educate children, and so on.

Therefore, the answer to how much the tax rate should be falls somewhere in the middle of two extremes, leaving the door open to debate.

##### There’s No Optimal Tax

Unfortunately, examining all the pros and cons of various methods of taxation does not produce the ideal tax that will effectively encourage the right kind of actions all the time. **Different approaches will always result in conflicting incentives for different facets of the market, and will always prioritize a solution to one problem over another.**

For instance, the problem of rich people cheating the tax code could be solved if a government used a flat tax instead of a progressive tax. A _flat tax_ sets one rate that affects everyone equally, while a _progressive tax_ takes a larger percentage of rich people’s incomes than poor people’s (which is why rich people try to manipulate their incomes through creative accounting).

However, a flat tax (also called a _regressive tax_) has its own drawback: It falls harder on poor people than on rich people. For example, at a flat tax rate of 25 percent, a person earning $40,000 a year has to pay $10,000 while a person making $400,000 has to pay $100,000. It’s much harder for the poorer person to live on her resulting net income of $30,000 than it is for the richer person to live on _her_ net income of $300,000.

There are also negatives to using taxes to incentivize good behavior or to manage externalities. For example, taxing large cars might encourage people to buy smaller cars, but it carries its own sets of unfair consequences:

  * **Taxes favor the rich:** When certain behaviors or items become more expensive, poorer people are priced out of them. This might lead to situations where, for example, a high tax on gas allows investment bankers to drive Hummers but makes it hard for construction workers to drive their pickup trucks, which they need for work. 
  * **Taxes are hard to get right:** There are endless policy debates about how high taxes should be on various items, because each option carries with it its own set of conflicting incentives. Set taxes too low, and bad behavior isn’t curbed, but set them too high and you’ll create new problems—like the black markets we discussed earlier. 



### A Provider of Last Resort

It can be hard to know where to draw the line between too little and too much governmental involvement in the economy, but a good place to start is with this guideline: **Governments should never provide goods or services unless there is a compelling reason to do so.** In general, a government should act as a _provider of last resort_ for any goods or services, allowing the private sector to provide these things instead whenever possible.

This is because a government is a _monopoly_ , meaning it has no competition (at least, within its own country). Monopolies are generally bad for an economy because they lead to inefficiencies: If you have guaranteed customers, you have few incentives to work hard to attract or keep those customers.

**However, there are some situations in which a monopoly is a better option for a particular good or service** —for example, if competition might lead to decreased quality as firms compete for customers on price. For this reason, agencies dedicated to public health or safety, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles, should stay in the hands of the government; if private companies were to issue driver’s licenses to less-safe drivers in order to get their business, unsafe drivers on the roads would harm society as a whole.

Another reason justifying governmental monopoly is if it provides a service that private firms would not be able to because of logistics, technology, or profits. In America’s early days, this justified the government providing a postal service—no private firm had the delivery infrastructure to reach every corner of the country, nor the incentive to do so, as delivering to remote, rural areas wasn’t profitable. However, today, private firms such as FedEx and UPS have proven that these issues are no longer relevant, and the postal service no longer needs to be a governmental provision.

One way a government can combine the oversight of a monopoly with the efficiency of the private market is to act as a mediator; it can oversee government programs but hand the operation of those programs over to private firms. Done well, this can allow for the best of both worlds—the government can keep an eye on quality, while firms can compete on price and efficiency in order to win governmental contracts. This is the way that many roads are built: Governments field bids and assign the work to the company best positioned to complete the work properly.
