## Chapters 5-6: Information and Human Capital

The next elements of economics we’ll discuss are **information** and **human capital** : Any economy is driven in large part by these two major influences. In these two chapters, we’ll explore how each element affects individuals, businesses, and the functioning of an economy.

### Information

Information, and who has access to it, has an outsized influence on how smoothly an economy runs. **A free flow of information allows for easy and smart transactions.** Information imbalances—when one party knows more than the other party in a transaction—put one party at a disadvantage to the other: Markets generally favor the party who has more information.

To counter information imbalances, people and businesses will try to glean information about what they’re buying from indirect sources. This process affects how people and businesses interact with each other.

#### Information and Individuals

**You’re often at a disadvantage when you make a purchase because the business selling you a product knows more about its quality than you do.** You won’t be able to fully judge its quality until after you’ve purchased it—for example, you won’t know if you like a burger until after you’ve paid for it and eaten it. The burger company, however, knows ahead of time what the quality of their burger is; they know how they’ve made it and how other people before you have reacted to it.

To counter this inherent disadvantage, people seek information in a number of ways:

  * **People trust other customers’ opinions:** You’re likely to trust the opinion of other customers over the word of a seller because customers have less of an incentive to lie to you about the quality of an item for sale. This is why people seek out, for example, online reviews when shopping for anything from blenders to hotel accommodations.
  * **People trust superficial markers of success:** When you enter the office of lawyers you’re considering hiring, you’re more likely to think they’re competent if their office is clean and nicely decorated than if it’s dingy and dirty. Similarly, you’re likelier to trust a lawyer in a suit than one in sweatpants. 
  * **People seek out familiarity:** People trust things they’ve had experiences with before because they feel they know what to expect—for example, you know what a Burger King burger is going to taste like no matter where you run into the restaurant. This is why people trust familiar brands, and why businesses invest so heavily in building their brands. 



#### Information and Business

Sometimes, businesses can be at a disadvantage because they have less information about a transaction than their potential customers. This is not such a problem for companies selling goods like shoes because the habits and preferences of their customers don’t affect them much beyond that individual sale.

However, an imbalance of information can be a significant problem for companies that forge a long-term relationship with a customer, such as insurance companies, which may be affected for many years by the lifestyle choices of their customers. For example, a life insurance company is exposed to more financial risk from a customer who skydives than from one who does not, and it benefits the company to know which customers have such habits.

Such companies can counter their information imbalances by either:

**Demanding information:** In certain situations, a company might refuse to offer services to a customer unless they have more information. Life insurance companies are a good example of this. They typically require health exams of their potential clients to set a client’s fee structure appropriately, based on their overall health and life expectancy.

**Structuring their services to encourage customers to reveal information:** A company can’t always demand proof of a customer’s health—for example, health insurance companies are sometimes not legally allowed to. This puts the health insurance company at a significant disadvantage when it comes to setting prices for their plans: If the company offers cheap insurance, and their customers need lots of medical care, the company won’t be able to cover their costs. But if it offers expensive insurance, not enough people will sign up to make the company self-sustaining.

If the insurance company knew which customers are generally healthy and which customers will likely require lots of care, they could offer cheap plans to the healthy people and expensive plans to the sicker people. Naturally, however, the sicker people aren’t going to volunteer this information. So, insurance companies allow their customers to self-select by offering different plans with different deductibles. A deductible is a predetermined out-of-pocket expense that an insured person pays before her insurance kicks in. A person with a $5,000 deductible will pay $5,000 in medical expenses before insurance takes over; a person with a $100 deductible will pay only $100 before insurance kicks in.

**Deductibles encourage customers to be honest about how much medical intervention they’re likely to need in the near future.** Cheaper insurance plans have higher deductibles. They attract people who anticipate needing few or no medical interventions in the near future and are therefore willing to take the risk of a one-time high medical expense (in this example, having to pay $5,000 if they, say, break their arm) in order to pay overall lower insurance rates. Expensive plans with low deductibles attract people who anticipate going to the doctor more often and don’t want to keep paying high healthcare costs out-of-pocket—for example, an elderly person who has ongoing health problems might want her insurance to kick in after just $100 of out-of-pocket expenses, and will pay a higher annual rate for that benefit.

#### Information Imbalances Can Lead to Discrimination

Another situation where information imbalance can put a business at a disadvantage is when they interview people for a job: People aren’t always honest in job interviews. In order to figure out what a job candidate might not be telling them, interviewers try to glean information from related sources they think might reveal something useful. Sometimes this can be relatively innocuous, like when an employer thinks a candidate who went to a good school is a good candidate, assuming that the school vetted her. **Sometimes, though, this can lead to discrimination,** where one party, afraid of what they don’t know about the other party, assumes something based on information that is somewhat related but may or may not be correct in this specific instance.

This is called _statistical discrimination_ , or _rational discrimination_ , and it can lead to discrimination for what appear to be logical reasons. For example, studies show that when an employer wants to avoid hiring someone with a criminal history, she is less likely to hire black men if her company doesn’t conduct criminal background checks as part of the employment process. However, if the company _does_ conduct criminal background checks, her discrimination disappears, and she is as likely to hire black men as other demographics. The theory supposes that with a lack of real information, she relies on related information to try to make informed guesses—in this case, the fact that more black men have criminal backgrounds than other demographics, leading her to believe she is less likely to hire an ex-con if she avoids all black men.

#### Information and Policy

Governments can also be at an information disadvantage: Individuals know more about their own lives than they’ll let on to the government when remaining silent gives them an advantage. Well-intentioned policies often fail as a result.

For example, in the 1990s, Yale University experimented with a scholarship structure that allowed students to borrow money for their education and pay it back not with a typical payment schedule, but from a percentage of their future earnings. The idea was that students who went on to become, for example, highly paid doctors would subsidize the educations of those who went on to become, say, social workers in low-income areas. In this way, people would not be discouraged from choosing careers devoted to helping others—careers that generally don’t pay well—because of the need to pay back expensive college loans.

Unfortunately, the experiment failed and had to be discontinued because the students knew more about their future plans than did the people running the scholarship, and they selected themselves either into or out of the plan depending on whether or not it would benefit them. Those who planned to go on to high-paying careers recognized that the percentage structure would disadvantage them later, and therefore they opted for other, more traditional loans. The only people left who wanted the scholarship were those who planned to go into low-paying industries, because they recognized that the percentage structure would benefit them later. Without the high earners to subsidize the low earners, the scholarship couldn’t sustain itself.

### Human Capital

The second market influence we’ll explore is _human capital_. **Your human capital is the sum of what makes you valuable and marketable as an individual.** It’s your intelligence, athletic ability, education, and work experience. It’s also less quantifiable traits like charisma, work ethic, creativity, and honesty. It’s what you would be left with if all of your wealth and assets were stripped away from you: What would you be able to use to rebuild your life if that happened? People who’ve invested heavily in their education and training have more human capital than do, for example, high school dropouts with addiction problems.

As with other items for sale, the price of a person’s human capital (the income they can command for their skills) reflects the capital’s scarcity, not its inherent value. For example, a civil servant who helps raise people out of poverty might make less than a star basketball player. This is a reflection of the fact that there are many civil servants working with that same skill set, while there are only a few basketball players who excel to that level.

Economies with higher levels of human capital are stronger than those with lower levels, for a number of reasons:

  * Human capital increases wealth.
  * Human capital controls population growth.
  * Human capital drives productivity.
  * Human capital explains inequality.



We’ll explore each of these reasons below.

#### Human Capital Increases Wealth

Human capital creates wealth for everyone, not just for the individual who has the capital, due to the way it supports entire economies. Economists estimate that 75 percent of our modern economy is driven by personal resources like education, training, health, and skills, not physical resources like oil and steel.

This accounts for the striking correlation between economic wealth and human capital in any given country, while there is a decided lack of correlation between economic wealth and natural resources in a country. For example, Japan and England—countries with lots of human capital—are among the richest countries in the world despite having relatively few deposits of natural resources. Conversely, Nigeria has enormous oil deposits but its citizens have a comparatively low standard of living because they don’t have as much education or access to job training—things that would increase their human capital.

Further, and to a large degree, poverty is caused by a lack of human capital more than by a dearth of jobs. A lack of jobs is often a reflection of a society filled with people with low human capital, who don’t have the skills and education needed to contribute to the economy and create jobs.

#### Human Capital Controls Population Growth

One of the most difficult problems that poor countries face is high birth rates but few resources to properly care for their populations. **While many people think that high birth rates _cause_ a country to be poor, the causality actually runs in the other direction:** Poverty causes people to have large families. This is not only because the cost of raising children is cheaper in poor countries, but also because those children are less likely to reach adulthood for a variety of reasons (malnutrition, disease, and violence being just a few), so parents have more kids as insurance.

When parents start accumulating human capital—through education or work experience—the cost to raise kids increases, both because parents start investing in their children more and also because raising children takes time that could otherwise be spent making money (opportunity costs). Further, as a country gets richer, the likelihood that each child will survive increases, which lessens the pressure for parents to have more children.

**Consequently, when a population starts accumulating more and more human capital, its birth rate starts to decrease**. This usually has a positive cyclical effect of then allowing parents to accumulate even more human capital (as they can spend their time and resources on things like education and work instead of caring for children), which encourages parents to have fewer children again as they start to feel more secure in the futures of the children they do have. Countries caught in such a positive cycle increase their overall standards of living, as parents with smaller families increase their financial stability.

Therefore, the best way to control population growth is to increase human capital, which leads to economic opportunity. The proof of this can be seen across the developing world, where increased education and economic opportunities (especially for women, who often drive the family planning decisions), have led to fertility rates decreasing to or dropping below replacement rates of 2.1 births per woman.

#### Human Capital Drives Productivity

**How an economy uses its human capital determines how efficiently it turns inputs into outputs—which in turn determines _productivity_. **Inputs include time, money, labor, materials, and other resources. Outputs are tangible goods like cars, clothes, and houses, as well as intangible goods like health care and computer programming. Productivity rises when we can get more outputs out of fewer inputs. For example, a factory worker who makes a lamp in 10 hours is more efficient than one who makes the same lamp in 30 hours. A farmer who gets 100 bales of hay from a field is more efficient than one who gets only 15 bales from it.

Productivity depends upon human capital: A labor supply that is capable, educated, and healthy. Countries that have ready supplies of these kinds of workers, especially for skilled work, can offer productivity that lesser-developed countries can’t rival. This is why warnings from politicians about other, lesser-developed countries stealing domestic jobs en masse are mostly overblown. When deciding where to locate a factory, firms must take into account productivity as well as labor costs: A worker who costs half as much as a domestic worker but produces only a tenth as much is not a good bargain.

Further, productivity—and productivity growth—is what makes a country rich. Productivity growth explains why a typical American household needed 1,800 hours of labor to amass its annual food supply in 1870, while today, it only needs about 260 hours of labor. **When goods become cheaper in terms of the work-hours needed to purchase them, consumers can afford more items, and their standard of living rises.**

#### Human Capital Explains Inequality

**Human capital goes a long way toward explaining economic inequality.** By almost any measure, America is unequal and is growing more so: In 2004, the bottom fifth of American households in terms of income distribution earned only 2 percent more than they did in 1979 (inflation-adjusted), while the top 20 percent of Americans saw their income increase by 63 percent in the same time frame.

This divergence corresponds with a divergence in the levels of human capital at either end of the economic spectrum and an economy that increasingly rewards skilled workers (those with human capital). Almost every industry has shifted toward a need for computer skills, which has decreased the need for low-skilled workers but increased the need for high-skilled ones. For example, automatic teller machines have made many bank tellers redundant, but at the same time, have created jobs for computer programmers who design the machines.

However, because computer training and other such capital-building investment is often unaffordable for those at the very bottom of the social-economic ladder, they get shut out of the fastest-growing segments of the economy, leading to increased inequality between the upper and lower echelons of society.

##### Does Inequality Matter?

Economists have traditionally argued that inequality is an acceptable part of a healthy economy for two reasons:

  1. Inequality motivates people to do things that will improve their stations, such as go to school or start businesses.
  2. As long as everyone’s standards of living are improving, there’s no harm in some people’s standards improving more than others’. 



However, economists are starting to question the absolute truth of these assumptions. People don’t actually react to inequality in a way consistent with these assumptions, because the assumptions don’t take into account certain aspects of human nature.

On the first point, **there may be a level of inequality at which differences in income are no longer motivating, but are instead de-motivating.** When poor people feel so disenfranchised that they don’t believe they can climb out of poverty, they start to reject some basic market foundations, such as the rule of law or property rights. A breakdown of the foundations of the economy benefits no one, as it creates problems of lawlessness and inefficiency that become a drag on the economy as a whole, affecting everyone.

On the second point, economists are starting to acknowledge that**a person judges her wealth based not only on the absolute value of it, but also on its relative value in comparison to people around her.** This means that economists are misjudging what constitutes “success” and misunderstanding what makes people satisfied with their lives. For example, a person earning $100,000 a year when everyone around her earns $75,000 will be happier than a person earning $200,000 when everyone around her earns $300,000, because the first person feels she’s earning more than her peers while the second person feels she’s earning _less_ than her peers. Therefore, while it might seem on paper that the person earning $200,000 is better off than the person earning $100,000, the actual people involved may not feel the same way.

Thus, economists are starting to agree that a certain level of inequality might do more harm than good to an economy, because **people react negatively to it emotionally and might therefore behave negatively as well.**
