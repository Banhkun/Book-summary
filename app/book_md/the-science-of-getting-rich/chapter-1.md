## Chapter 1: Why It’s Important to Be Rich and Other Truths About the Universe

Chapter 1 will cover some fundamental concepts and myths about the universe. We need to understand how the universe works before we can understand how to become rich.

### Original Substance

**Everything in the universe—you, your house, the planets—is made out of the same stuff,** “Original Substance.” Original Substance is God. It is alive and intelligent. It manifests thoughts into tangible forms. For example, when the Original Substance thought of planets, physical planets formed.

**By nature, Original Substance and God favor the advancement and improvement of every intelligent being,** from oak trees to dolphins to you. As a result, it’s perfectly natural, even dutiful, for you to pursue wealth. **You need money to buy the resources that will help you improve yourself.** Your advancement is Original Substance expressing itself vicariously through you. You need to be rich in the same way a seed needs to grow into a flower. If you’re not rich, you’ll never have enough access to resources, and you’ll never achieve a full and successful life.

### Advancing Yourself

There are three main aspects of our existence, all of them equally important, and all of which require money to develop:

  * **Mind.** You develop your mind by appreciating art, studying books, and traveling.
  * **Body.** You take care of your body by sheltering it, clothing it, feeding and watering it, and resting.
  * **Soul.** You develop your soul through love. The best way to express love is to give other people material gifts.



For example, if you want to paint something beautiful, and therefore develop your mind, you’ll need an easel, paints, and other art supplies, all of which require money to purchase.

### The Myth of Resource Limitation

God isn’t done. He didn’t create the world and then step away, leaving the planet with limited resources. **Because life is always advancing, and everything is made up of limitless Original Substance, resource limitation is a myth.**

There are plenty of resources for everyone, and **if the planet ever did run out of something, Original Substance could simply create more.** If there are existing channels for creation, Original Substance will work through these. For example, diamonds are formed by applying heat and pressure to carbon, and Original Substance works through this existing process to create diamonds. If there is no existing method for creating something, the Original Substance creates it from its own substance.

#### Competition vs. Creation

**Because Original Substance is limitless and there’s more than enough to go around, no one has to compete with anyone else to become rich.**

In fact, competition is an unfavorable method for becoming rich. The Original Substance will never give you things by taking them away from others. Therefore, if you compete, you can only succeed via luck, and your success won’t last.

**Creation is the guaranteed method for becoming rich.** Instead of competing with someone for something, go in a different direction. Original Substance will favor you with opportunities. For example, if you’re the employee of a railroad company, don’t try to become the owner. Instead, look for opportunities elsewhere. You might find success in another industry.

### Cultivating Your Relationship With the Original Substance—Being Grateful

To find harmony with and relate to the Original Substance, you need to be grateful. **Gratitude allows you to cultivate a close relationship with Original Substance so that it can most effectively favor you.**

There is a law of gratitude, which is the same as Newton’s third law—for every action, there’s an equal and opposite reaction. **If you strongly and gratefully reach out towards the Original Substance, it will respond to you equally as strongly.** The more grateful you are, the faster and more often you’ll receive responses from Original Substance.

In addition to improving your connection to the Original Substance, **gratitude has an additional benefit—it keeps you from becoming dissatisfied with your current state.** If you’re grateful, you’re always focused on positivity.

**Faith stems from gratitude.** If you’re continually grateful, you continually receive positive responses from the Original Substance. You come to expect responses and come to have faith that they will keep coming. **This allows you to be grateful for gifts in advance.**

Everything in the world contributes to your advancement (because everything is formed from Original Substance and Original Substance favors your advancement), so **you should be grateful for everything.** Be grateful even for things that seem negative. For example, be grateful for the superrich or corrupt politicians. They have flaws, but ultimately, they contribute to your and others’ advancement—the superrich start businesses that you make use of, and politicians create order, both of which create new opportunities.

Gratitude requires continuity. If you stop being grateful the moment you receive your first response, your connection with Original Substance will break.
