## Chapter 3: Universal Enrichment

In Chapter 2, we learned how to become rich. Chapter 3 explains how our personal wealth will contribute to enrichment on a global scale.

There are some entrenched myths about the financial situation of the global population:

  * **Myth #1: The only way for everyone to become rich is to overhaul government and social systems.** This is not the case. If populations act in the Certain Way, no system is going to be able to stop them from becoming rich. Systems may change in response to the Certain Way, but they don’t have to change in advance of it.
  * **Myth #2: Poverty is moral and God requires it.** God expresses himself through people. In order to reach full expression, you need money for resources to develop yourself. Therefore, God wants you to be rich. He does _not_ want you to suffer in poverty.



**The only way to get rid of poverty is to get more people following the Certain Way.** Once enough people are doing it, anyone lagging behind will realize that all they have to do to catch up is start following the science of being rich.

**The best thing you can personally do to help the poor is to become rich yourself.** This is for two reasons:

  * **Leading by example.** If you become rich, you show others that following the Certain Way is the guaranteed (and only) way to become rich. You also demonstrate that being rich is natural and noble, aligned with the Original Substance’s goal of continuous advancement. 
  * **Improving yourself inherently improves others.** Recall the “Act” step of the Certain Way. Whenever you interact with others in the pursuit of your own advancement, you give more than you take. Therefore, your advancement advances others.
