## Chapter 2: The Certain Way

In Chapter 1, we learned how the universe works. In Chapter 2, we’ll learn how to use this understanding to become rich.

If the Original Substance favors everyone, and resources are infinite, why isn’t everyone already rich? Why aren’t you rich?

You might think it has something to do with your environment, industry, talent, thriftiness, or innovativeness. In fact, these aren’t critical factors, merely considerations. You can tell that these factors aren’t critical because the world isn’t full of cities composed entirely of rich people, or industries in which everyone is poor. All sorts of people get rich—smart people, stupid people, strong people, weak people.

There is one reason why you aren’t rich—you’re doing things wrong. **To be rich, you need to do things in the “Certain Way.”** Acting in the Certain Way guarantees that you will become rich, and anyone who follows the Certain Way, regardless of circumstance, will get rich. The Certain Way is the only natural, fundamental way to get rich. God will help you if you act in the Certain Way because it’s in his own nature.

Why don’t people act in the Certain Way?

  * **Ignorance.** People don’t know about the existence of Original Substance or how it works.
  * **Mental laziness.** People feel it’s too much work to follow the Certain Way.
  * **Confusion.** People are distracted from the Certain Way by other theories about how the world works.



The Certain Way has three main facets—think, will, and act:

### Think

In Chapter 1, we covered the fact the Original Substance is sentient and responds to thought. **If you think about being rich or acquiring a particular possession, the Original Substance will impel a physical manifestation of your thoughts in your direction.**

However, you must think in a particular way for this to work:

**You must have a precise, coherent idea of what you want** in order to transmit it to the Original Substance. If your want is vague, the Original Substance won’t know what to do with it—transmitting a vague thought would be like sending someone an email containing the letters of the alphabet and then expecting them to create the message.

  * Vague: You want to be rich so you can help people.
  * Precise: You want a car. You imagine the color, the paint, the make and model, the interior, and every last detail.



**You must have conviction that you will achieve what you want.** You should have so much purpose and faith in your convictions that you act like you already have your vision.

  * For example, imagine you’re driving your new car and believe that you already own it. Talk about your car as if you have it. Don’t dream about having it, be convinced that you _do_ have it. **This also helps you practice gratitude in advance.**



**You must constantly be thinking about what you want.** The specific mental picture should always be present in your mind, the same way a pilot is always keeping an eye on her instruments. If you really want something, it shouldn’t be difficult to concentrate on it.

  * You don’t need to pray or meditate. All you have to do to send your vision to the Original Substance is think about it. However, once your vision is fully formed, it can help to orally address the Original Substance. This helps you imagine you’ve already received your vision, which further strengthens your vision.
  * Concentrate on precision and details of your vision in your free time and hold the big picture in the back of your mind while you’re working. 



**You must think truthfully.** Anytime you see something, you’ll unconsciously observe it at the surface level. You must look deeper than what’s visible.

  * For example, if you see someone who’s ill, you’ll think about disease unless you hold in your mind the truth that disease doesn’t exist—people only experience it because their negative thoughts have manifested it. 



Take a moment to come up with a vision that encompasses these principles.

#### Manifestation

Your thoughts most likely won’t cause the Original Substance to form your want out of its own substance. Instead, **the Original Substance works through existing methods of creation, spurred into action by your thoughts.**

For example, if you want gold, gold won’t spontaneously come into being in your living room, or pull itself out of a mine and zoom into your hands. Instead, it’ll come your way via the usual channels: someone will mine it, transport it, and you’ll have the opportunity to access it.

#### Perils

Original Substance will send whatever you’re thinking about in your direction. Ideally, you’re thinking about getting rich,**but if you get distracted and think about negative things, those are what the Original Substance will manifest.**

For example, if you see someone poor, you’ll think about poverty, and the Original Substance will send poverty your way. Poverty is a particularly dangerous thing to think about because it’s the exact opposite of what you want.

There are a few ways to avoid negative thoughts about poverty:

  * Look beyond the visible surface level to the deeper truths.
    * For example, if you start thinking about poverty, remember that resources are infinite and poverty doesn’t really exist.
  * Avoid negativity.
    * For example, avoid anything to do with poverty. Don’t try to eradicate it, don’t raise your awareness of it, and don’t do charity work. 
  * Recall that life, by nature, is advancing. Something negative may exist now, but it won’t in the future (unless you keep dwelling on it, which causes it to continue to manifest.)
    * For example, anyone can rise out of poverty by following the Certain Way.
  * Change your frame of reference.
    * For example, think of the poor as people on their way to becoming rich.



In addition to avoiding poverty, specifically avoid thinking about:

  * Alternative ways the world might work. By following the instructions in this book, you’ve committed to one way, so why spend brainpower considering other theories?
  * Negative news. Only look at optimistic coverage.
  * The occult. Don’t think about the dead or how you might reach them.



### Will

The second facet of the Certain Way is to harness your will.**You will use your will to maintain the vision you came up with in “Think.”** It will take some effort to maintain the force of thought necessary to connect with the Original Substance.

**However, make sure you only ever direct your will at _yourself_.** It’s wrong to use your will on others, as wrong as physically forcing someone to do something would be. Don’t apply your will to things, either—this is the equivalent to applying your will to the Original Substance, which is also wrong.

If you apply your will only to yourself, forcing yourself to concentrate on your vision, the Original Substance will push things and people towards you.

### Act

The final facet of the Certain Way is to act in a way that sets you up to receive your vision. You can never know how exactly the Original Substance is working its ways. Therefore, **do your best at everything you do every day** to remain open to every opportunity Original Substance may use to manifest your vision.

**Doing your best involves doing all your individual actions efficiently—efficient actions are successful actions.** The Original Substance is always working in your favor, so if you make use of your purpose and faith while doing tasks, you can’t help but be efficient and successful.

#### Acting With Others in Mind

Doing your best also involves considering your effect on others. Whenever you interact with others, be so strong in your convictions about Original Substance that anyone who encounters you can feel your purpose. _Know_ that riches are coming your way, and lead by example. **People are naturally attracted to those who follow the Certain Way, and many of your visions will manifest via other people.**

Additionally, whenever you make a transaction, either personally or professionally, don’t drive hard bargains, compete, or take advantage of people. Other people will be involved in realizing your vision, and you may be involved in realizing theirs. **Give more than you take.** Consider usable value rather than cash value.

Example #1: If you sell someone a book you’ve written, they’re giving you money. In exchange, you’re giving them information that will improve their life, which is far more valuable than whatever they paid in cash for the book.

Example #2: If you’re an employer, people give you work more valuable than the cash value of their wages, so use your business to improve their lives.

(Shortform note: For more on how people fall onto a spectrum of giving vs. taking, see our summary of Give and Take.)

#### Acting Within the Bounds of Your Current Situation

**You can succeed in any environment or business.** You can start acting in the Certain Way, right now, wherever you are, and the process of following the Certain Way will change your circumstances. **If you’re always doing your best, you’ll advance by outgrowing your current state.** Success is cumulative—because the inherent goal of life is to advance, each step towards advancement creates momentum towards the next step.

##### Doing Your Best in Your Current Environment

**You need to be in an environment where you can interact with people,** but otherwise, your physical location doesn’t have a large effect on your ability to get rich. If you don’t like your current environment, as you follow the Certain Way, you’ll find opportunities to change it.

##### Doing Your Best in Your Current Business

If you’re not currently in the business you dream of, following the Certain Way will help you change your situation. **Usually, the best way to change your business is by improving your current business enough that you get new opportunities.** For example, if you work hard at your current job and get a raise, you might be able to buy some land and pursue your dream of farming.

Note that you’re not doing a good job in order to get on your employer’s good side; your employer won’t advance you if it’s not in their interests. You’re doing a good job in order to harness Original Substance’s natural advancement. If you don’t get an opportunity to advance at your current job, you’ll get one somewhere else.

What business should you transfer to? **You’ll typically do best in a business that you have a talent for.** For example, if you’re going to be a music teacher, you need to understand music, and it’ll be easier to understand music if it already comes naturally to you.

However, **you’ll also typically do well at a business you enjoy.** If you want to work in the music industry, the Original Substance will help you develop the talent and tools to do so. Wanting to do something is your talent trying to develop and express itself.

It’s more important that you do what you want to do, rather than do something you have a lot of natural talent in. You’ll be most satisfied with your life if you’re doing what you want to do.

Note that **there’s no hurry to change your situation.** Hurry is a symptom of competitiveness, and we’ve previously disproved the idea that there is a finite amount of resources humanity has to share. If you’re uncertain about making a change, wait. No one else will steal your chance; you’ll get another opportunity later. Whenever you’re unsure, work on your gratitude. Spend some time thinking about what you want and your gratefulness that you’re going to get it.

However, **don’t wait for the _perfect_ opportunity—take opportunities that allow you to better yourself one step at a time.**

**Don’t do anything you don’t want to, except as a step towards doing whatever it is you do want.** For example, if you made a mistake in the past, you might have to live with a certain circumstance for a while. You make mistakes when you act hurriedly, out of doubt or fear, or forget that the goal of being personally rich goes hand in hand with enriching others. As you live through a mistake, remember that the Original Substance will eventually advance you away from it.

No matter what your current business or dream business is,**if you follow the Certain Way, you will attract others and you will get rich.** For example, consider a doctor whose vision is that he’s excellent at his job. He specifically imagines each of the ways he expertly carries out procedures. He contemplates his vision with faith, purpose, and gratitude. As a result, he’ll be very good at his job, which will attract patients.

### Why Do People Lose Their Way?

There are a couple of reasons people fall off the path of the Certain Way. First, some people don’t follow the Certain Way for long enough.**If anything stops working towards advancement, it dissolves or dies.**

For example, consider the parable of the talents (an old currency). A man gave each of his three servants talents. Two of the servants invested their talents and made more money. The third servant buried his talent in the ground, where it did nothing. The man took the buried talent away from the third servant and gave it to one of the other servants, who would actually do something with it.

Second, some people are tempted away from the Certain Way by other apparent methods of getting rich. There are examples of people in the world, such as Carnegie and Rockefeller, who have gotten rich by being competitive or shrewd, or by only accidentally using Original Substance.

**People who get rich in a way other than the Certain Way aren’t truly rich.** They’ll only stay rich for as long as it's useful to the Original Substance, for example, as long as it takes them to invent something that is related to the success of someone else’s vision. This kind of rich person is simply part of the evolutionary process, and God will do away with him when he’s no longer needed.

**Don’ts**

There are some don’ts to keep in mind when following the Certain Way:

Don’t concern yourself with any moment except for the present. More specifically:

  * Don’t spend time worrying about future problems unless they affect today’s activities. The Certain Way will iron out obstacles, such as lack of capital, and present you with fixes as you proceed.
  * Don’t worry about the past; worry about today. The past is unchangeable, but you can still act in the present.
  * Don’t worry that you’re going to run out of talent or ability. As you increase your wealth, your talents and ability increase too.



Don’t act at the wrong time or in the wrong way. More specifically:

  * Don’t stop following the Certain Way after “Think” and “Will.” If you don’t act, your thinking and willing will have been for nothing.
  * Don’t wait to act because you’re not in the right environment or business. Your actions will cause your environment or business to change.
  * Don’t choose an outlandish action unrelated to anything you’re doing now as your first action.
  * Don’t use mystical or occult tactics. Follow the Certain Way.
  * Don’t idly daydream; maintain your vision and purpose.



Don’t think negatively. More specifically:

  * Don’t talk about any subject in a negative way, whether it’s yourself, others, your business, or a situation. The Original Substance will take the form of your thoughts, so keep them positive.
  * Don’t acknowledge evil. Instead, change your worldview. See the world as something that’s always advancing, and view anything bad as undeveloped rather than evil.
  * Don’t acknowledge failure or feel disappointed or discouraged. What might feel like a failure right now is only setting you up for a greater opportunity later.
