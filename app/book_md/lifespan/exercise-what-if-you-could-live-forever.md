## Exercise: What if You Could Live Forever?

Imagine for a moment that Sinclairâ€™s work has already panned out, and that anti-aging treatments work like he imagined in his most optimistic predictions. If you could live forever, would you want to? And what would you do?

* * *

Would you want to live 100 years? How about 200? Why or why not?
