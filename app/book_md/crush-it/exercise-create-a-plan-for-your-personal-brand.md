## Exercise: Create a Plan for Your Personal Brand

Whether you’re a social media networker or an abstainer, reflect on how you could use Vaynerchuk’s guidance to develop a personal brand that could generate income.

* * *

First, choose a niche. List two to three interests that you spend the most time thinking about, talking about, and looking at online.

Pick one of the niches to apply to the rest of the questions in this exercise. (You can repeat the exercise with each of the other interests.) List two to three possible domain names that relate to your niche. Keep in mind that your social media handles should closely match this name.

Between blogging, podcasting, and posting video, which medium would you prefer to use and why?

Brainstorm and list three to five topics you could blog, podcast, or vlog about right away.
