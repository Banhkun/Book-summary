## 1-Page Summary

_Unlimited Power_ is a classic self-help book that teaches you how to take control of your life. The author, Tony Robbins, claims that the key to this is ensuring that your actions, beliefs, and goals all work together and complement each other. He believes that doing so will allow you to harness a level of energy and conviction that would normally be impossible to access, and he says you can use that energy to achieve all of your goals in life.

Robbins is a world-famous life coach, motivational speaker, and business strategist. _Unlimited Power_ , published in 1986, was his first big hit as an author. The book has enjoyed largely positive reviews praising its insights and straightforward, actionable ideas.

This guide will start by teaching you how to harness your thoughts and beliefs and turn them into purposeful action. Then, once you understand how to achieve your personal goals, we’ll discuss how you can find even greater success through cooperation and leadership. Finally, we’ll briefly examine how you can use your successes to help others and improve the world around you.

Note that, since its 1986 publication, some of _Unlimited Power_ ’s core principles—especially those based on psychology—have fallen out of favor or been refuted outright. Therefore, our commentary will explore how those theories have evolved since the 1980s, including how Robbins himself has updated some of the ideas he presents here. We’ll also draw connections to other prominent self-help books like _Flow_ and _Extreme Ownership_ , offering clear and actionable advice on achieving your goals and living a happy, productive life.

### Harness the Power of Your Mind

**Robbins believes that taking control of your life starts with taking control of your mind.**

Many people find themselves wasting enormous amounts of time and energy because their thoughts and beliefs aren’t aligned with their goals—their mental gears grind against each other instead of meshing smoothly. For example, imagine someone wants to lose weight but spends a lot of time thinking about food and believes that he lacks the self-control to eat healthily. He’ll waste a lot of energy fighting against those thoughts and beliefs and berating himself for his perceived lack of willpower.

The first step toward achieving your goals is to eliminate that internal resistance; in other words, to make sure that what you _think_ and what you _do_ are really getting you closer to what you _want._

(Shortform note: As a partial counterpoint to Robbins, psychologist Tara Brach says that it’s impossible to fully control your thoughts and feelings; however, you can make sure that they don’t control _you._ In her book _Radical Acceptance_ , Brach says that you should face each moment with recognition of what you’re experiencing and compassion for yourself while you experience it. For example, if you’re doubting your ability to do something, Brach would say that you should take a moment to recognize that uncertainty and remind yourself that it’s a temporary feeling. In this way, you can allow negative thoughts and feelings to wash over you and fade away without influencing your actions.)

Let’s discuss three of Robbins’s tips for how to gain power over your mind by aligning your goals, thoughts, and beliefs.

#### Tip #1: Reprogram Your Mind

**One way to take control of your mind is through a practice called _neuro-linguistic programming (NLP)._**

Robbins says that all people’s nervous systems—meaning both the brain and the body—work in more or less the same way. Nervous systems are like computers all using the same operating system. **Therefore, whatever one person can do,_any_ person can do; it’s just a matter of running the right mental “programs.”** This theory is known as NLP.****

Robbins believes that NLP provides a method to accomplish anything you can imagine. Furthermore, because people’s minds all work with the same programming, you can figure out which programs to run by observing and imitating people who have already done what you’re trying to do.

For example, someone who wants to become a better martial artist might study Bruce Lee: how he moves, how and when he strikes, and even how he breathes during a fight. Robbins calls this process _modeling_.

> **From Neuro-Linguistic Programming to Neuro-Associative Conditioning**
> 
> _Unlimited Power_ was published in 1986. Since then, numerous studies on NLP have failed to produce consistent results, and it’s now considered to be pseudoscience by the scientific community.
> 
> Even Robbins himself has moved away from using the term neuro-linguistic programming—in his 1991 book _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Robbins still argues that you can change your habitual thought patterns, but he refines the concept and begins calling it _neuro-associative conditioning_ (NAC) instead. NAC recognizes that people’s habits and thought patterns physically change their brains, making them work differently.****
> 
> Therefore, NAC is less about finding the right “programs” to run, and more about deliberately rewiring your brain. You can do this by disrupting harmful thought patterns and replacing them with constructive ones.

**However, there’s more to NLP than just copying the person’s physical actions.** Robbins says you have to copy that person’s mental state, intentions, beliefs, and values. If you want to achieve what someone else has achieved, then you must—at least for a short while—think and act _exactly_ like that person.

(Shortform note: Although NLP has been debunked, scientists agree that _imitative learning_(learning by watching others) is an effective way to develop new skills. In fact, people—particularly children—learn through imitation so effectively that they’ll often successfully imitate irrelevant or inefficient actions if the person modeling the skill does them first. For example, if a mother picks up a toothbrush and sets it down several times before actually beginning to brush her teeth, her children are likely to imitate that behavior _even if they know it’s unnecessary._)

#### Tip #2: Control Your Mind by Controlling Your Body

**Another way to take control of your mind is by stimulating your body _._**

Robbins says that mental and emotional states are closely linked to what your body is doing.**** For example, someone who’s afraid will probably be tense, have an elevated heart rate, and breathe quickly and shallowly—these are all physical responses to the emotion of fear. **However, the connection goes both ways.** This person can bring his fear under control by relaxing his muscles, sitting up straight, and taking slow, deep breaths; a physical state associated with calmness and confidence.

The same goes for any mental or emotional state: **You can create the state you want by recreating the physical cues that go along with it.** For instance, if you want to improve your focus, you could lean forward; if you want to feel happier, you could force a smile. Just as your body naturally reacts to what you think and feel, your brain naturally reacts to what you _do_.

(Shortform note: Recent studies have confirmed a link between physical cues and mental or emotional responses. Psychologists hope that they can take advantage of that connection to improve patients’ mental health—for example, they might be able to trick patients’ minds into thinking that upsetting situations are actually happy or pleasant by having them smile at stressful stimuli.)

Robbins adds that, while you can influence your emotions with short-term bodily mastery as explained above, a major part of taking control of your life is through long-term bodily mastery—or in simpler terms, physical fitness. **A strong body is a source of endless energy, both physical and mental; you can use that energy to help you accomplish your goals.**

> **Some Benefits of Fitness**
> 
> Regular exercise has many proven health benefits—both physical and mental—of which increased energy is only one. Some other benefits include:
> 
> **Better sleep.** Tiring yourself out with exercise helps you to get higher quality sleep at night, which in turn helps you feel rested and focused during the day.
> 
> **A stronger heart.** Exercise boosts cardiovascular health, helping your body adapt to stress more easily. In other words, physical exertion won’t feel so tiring anymore, and you’re more likely to have energy left at the end of the day.
> 
> **Improved mental health.** People who exercise regularly are less likely to suffer from mental illnesses such as depression, anxiety, and addiction; in fact, exercise is often recommended as part of an addiction recovery program.
> 
> In short, a strong and healthy body helps promote a strong and healthy mind.

#### Tip #3: Control Your Beliefs

**A crucial part of taking control of your mind is to make sure that you have powerful beliefs rather than disempowering ones.**

Robbins says that everyone has a belief system that they’ve built—largely without realizing it—based on their upbringing, personal experiences, and knowledge. Those beliefs create the boundaries, or the lack of them, that person operates within.

**In other words, you can do whatever you believe you can; conversely, you _can’t_ do what you believe you can’t. **

For example, suppose two scientists each get the chance to present their work at a large and prestigious conference. One believes that he doesn’t deserve the chance—that his work isn’t important enough, and that he’s not experienced or knowledgeable enough to stand in front of a room full of famous scientists and teach them something new. He believes that he can’t do it, so he declines the invitation and remains in obscurity. This scientist’s beliefs got in the way of him achieving his goals.

The other scientist believes that she’s as good a scientist as anyone else at that conference, that her work is as important and as well-done as anything the other attendees produced, and that all she needs is the chance to prove herself. Therefore, where the other scientist saw a frightening and overwhelming event that he wasn’t prepared for, she sees an opportunity. She presents her work, her name spreads through the scientific community, and she gets a large influx of funding to continue her research. This scientist’s beliefs drove her to achieve her goals.

> **The Three Levels of Belief**
> 
> While _Unlimited Power_ talks about beliefs as if they’re all the same in their level of influence over us, this isn’t the case. People hold some beliefs much more strongly than others—those strong beliefs are the most difficult to change, but they also have the most impact on behavior. The more strongly you hold a belief, the more important it is for that belief to be powerful rather than disempowering.
> 
> In a later book, _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Robbins expands on the topic of beliefs by dividing them into three categories:
> 
> **Opinions** are the weakest type of belief. You form opinions based on limited, temporary experiences, and you don’t generally attach strong emotions to them. Opinions are the least motivating type of belief, and they’re also the easiest type of belief to change. For example, you might personally prefer coffee to tea, but you’re not likely to put any great effort into convincing others that coffee is the better beverage. Furthermore, you might change your opinion if you happen to find a type of tea you particularly like.
> 
> **Beliefs** are stronger than opinions, and they’re usually anchored by emotions as well as by experiences. As a result, beliefs are more motivating (and more difficult to change) than mere opinions; you’re more likely to try to convince others that your beliefs are correct, and you’re less likely to accept evidence that your beliefs are wrong. In fact, your beliefs are a key part of how you see yourself, so changing a belief feels like changing your identity.
> 
> **Convictions** are the strongest category of belief. Your convictions are key parts of how you understand the world, and they have intense feelings connected to them. Convictions are so central to your sense of self that you might become angry if anyone questions them. For example, a devout Christian holds the conviction that people can only reach Heaven by believing in Jesus—that person is likely to try very hard to save others by converting them to Christianity, and they would probably become upset if someone questioned or mocked that religion. An empowering conviction is the most beneficial type of belief you can have.

##### Choose Powerful Beliefs

**The good news is that you can replace your disempowering beliefs with powerful ones.** According to Robbins, changing your beliefs is as easy as simply deciding to do so: You can identify a disempowering belief, pick a powerful belief that you’d like to replace it, and then act according to that new belief.

To help with this process, Robbins suggests that you imagine what life will be like once that new, empowering belief is in place. Envision, as clearly and specifically as possible, a situation in which you act according to that new belief. This will put you in the right mindset to go forward and make your imagined life a reality.

> **Overcoming Resistance to Change**
> 
> Many people naturally resist change, especially when it comes to something as personal as their beliefs. How do you overcome this resistance?
> 
> In _The Success Principles_ , entrepreneur Jack Canfield suggests asking yourself a series of questions to determine whether a change you’re considering is really necessary and, if so, to figure out _why_ you’re resisting that change. By answering these questions, Canfield says that you can overcome your fear of change and replace it with excitement for the possibilities that change could create for you.
> 
> **What change am I resisting?** Start by clearly defining the change you’re thinking of making.
> 
> **What am I afraid of?** Try to pinpoint the reason why you’re resisting that change. For example, do you think it will be hard to do? Does it feel like you’d be giving up part of who you are? Are you concerned that the change itself might have negative consequences—and if so, what’s the absolute worst that could happen?
> 
> **What if I _don’t_ make the change? **What benefits are there to keeping things as they are? What potential downsides are there—what’s the worst-case scenario for _not_ making this change?
> 
> **How do I begin making this change?** Imagine that you’ve already decided to go through with it; what are your first steps? What will your life look like once you take those steps? Note that this step is the same as Robbins’s suggestion to visualize how you’ll behave in the future.
> 
> **When will I begin making this change?** Once you know how to get started, the only question remaining is when you’ll do so _._ Setting a deadline can help encourage you to get started.

##### Determine What You Value Most

Robbins adds that values are a particularly important subset of beliefs: They’re beliefs about what’s right and wrong, or what’s good and bad. **Values are important because while other beliefs determine what you _can_ do, your values determine what you _will_ do.** For example, someone who values wealth will work hard at a profitable career, while someone who values friendship will work hard at relationships instead. Someone who values joy will seek it out; someone who values health might forgo momentary joys like junk food and alcohol to stay fit.

Just as people have numerous beliefs, they have numerous different values. Furthermore, sometimes those values can oppose each other—for instance, someone who values both honesty and self-esteem might experience some confusing feelings if someone else’s honesty damages his self-esteem.

**That’s why Robbins suggests creating a list of values and then ranking them by importance.** Doing so serves two purposes: First, it allows you to see what’s important to you and decide what’s _most_ important. Second, if you find yourself caught between conflicting values, you’ll know which one should take precedence.

Finally, remember that it’s possible to pick and choose values just like any other beliefs, so make sure that your personal values are beneficial and empowering.

(Shortform note: Since the point of choosing values is to make sure that all of your energy and intentions are pushing you in the same direction, it’s important to limit how many values you commit to—having too many values will inevitably pull you in different directions, causing confusion and wasting energy. In her book _Dare to Lead_ , Brenè Brown suggests choosing just two key values to practice. Much like Robbins, Brown suggests starting by writing a list of your values and then choosing the two that are most important to you. Since in Brown’s framework you’re only pursuing two values, it’s especially important to make sure they’re beneficial and empowering—limiting yourself to just two values that _don’t_ fulfill these criteria won’t support your growth.)

##### Align Your Beliefs, Values, and Actions

**Robbins concludes by saying that you can achieve incredible energy and focus by aligning your beliefs and values with bold, confident action.** He calls this _congruence_ : a state in which you’re able to bring all of your mental and physical abilities to bear on whatever task is at hand.

The trick to reaching this state is making sure that all of your thoughts, desires, and actions are working toward the same objective. That’s why it’s crucial to take control of your mind—you must make sure that you’re not obstructing yourself with disempowering beliefs or conflicting values.

For example, someone who talks about what he “wants” to do, or what “might” happen, is getting in his own way; he doesn’t fully _believe_ that he’ll achieve his goals. Therefore, he won’t be able to fully harness his energy and his conviction.

> **Counterpoint: Look for Enjoyable Tasks**
> 
> What Robbins calls congruence is very similar to what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls _flow_ : a state in which you’re completely focused on the task at hand and do your best possible work while feeling like you’re not putting forth any effort at all.
> 
> While Robbins says that you achieve this state by acting in line with your values and making sure your thoughts, desires, and actions align, Csikszentmihalyi believes **you can only achieve flow if you’re doing something enjoyable; furthermore, that enjoyment must come from accomplishment and improvement.** In _Flow_ , he provides a list of common qualities of enjoyable tasks:
> 
> **There’s a clear goal, and you have the skills to reach it.** In other words, you know what you’re trying to accomplish, and you’re confident that you _can_ accomplish it.
> 
> **You’re in control.** While someone else might have set the goal for this task, how you reach that goal is up to you.
> 
> **You receive immediate feedback.** This doesn’t necessarily mean feedback from another person—rather, you have a way to easily keep track of your progress. For example, a writer can use word count as a form of feedback; an increasing word count means that the writer is making progress.
> 
> **You become completely absorbed in the task.** This is the essence of flow: While working on the task, you lose track of time and may even temporarily lose your sense of self. Every bit of your attention is on completing the task, and there are no extraneous thoughts. Some people also call this hyperfocus.
> 
> Note that Csikszentmihalyi’s “flow state” doesn’t require that your values and beliefs be in line with your goal. All that’s required for flow is an enjoyable task that you can get absorbed in.

### Take Power Over Your Life

Now that you know how to create energy and momentum by controlling your body and your mind, it’s time to learn how to harness that energy to achieve your goals. Based on Robbins’s ideas, we’ve created a four-step process to accomplish anything you can imagine. We’ve included some of Robbins’s essential tips to help you through the steps.

#### Step 1: Decide What You Want

Before you can start working, you need to know what you’re working toward _._ Robbins says that an effective goal must be clear, ambitious yet achievable, and most importantly, _inspirational._ That last point is crucial because, no matter how much energy you have, you won’t want to put any of it toward a goal that doesn’t excite you.

(Shortform note: Robbins suggests setting goals that are challenging enough to inspire you but not so hard that they become frustrating or disheartening. In _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cardone suggests a different approach: Think of a realistic goal, then multiply it by 10. For example, if your “reasonable goal” is to retire in 20 years, your 10X goal—doing it 10 times faster—would be to retire in _two_ years. Cardone’s reasoning is that a 10X goal will drive you to work hard, and even if you fall short, you’ll still have achieved more than if you’d reached a mediocre goal.)

#### Step 2: Get Started

Once you have a goal in mind, figure out a course of action that seems likely to get you closer to that goal, then take that course. Robbins emphasizes this step very strongly; no matter how much you want something or how carefully you plan, you’ll never get closer to your goals unless you take action.

(Shortform note: In _Extreme Ownership_ , former SEAL officers Jocko Willink and Leif Babin explain how to effectively create and carry out a plan of action. Once you’ve set your goal, take stock of your available resources (time, money, other people, and so on), and consider the best ways to use each of those resources. Brainstorm multiple different plans, then **pick one and fully commit to it** —once you’ve chosen a plan, the time for worrying about whether it’s the _best possible_ plan is over.)

##### Step 2.5: Fearlessly Work With Others

There are few goals, if any, that you can accomplish completely on your own. Somewhere along the way, you’ll need support, advice, or approval from someone else, and any interaction with another person carries the possibility of being rejected. **That’s why one of Robbins’s essential tips is:_Don’t fear rejection._**

Rejection can be painful, but you mustn’t let the fear of it stop you from doing whatever’s necessary to reach your goals. Remember: Some of the world’s most famous artists, actors, and musicians spent years experiencing rejection after rejection before they finally found success.

(Shortform note: Doctors say that, psychologically, people respond to rejection the same way that they respond to physical pain. Therefore, people avoid situations in which they’re likely to be rejected in the same way that they avoid situations in which they're likely to be injured. In fact, the psychological responses are so similar that Tylenol has been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of hurt feelings. With that said, doctors don’t recommend using painkillers to cope with rejection—instead, they suggest having a support network of friends or family members whom you can turn to when you’re chasing your goals and suffering from rejection.)

#### Step 3: Gauge Your Progress

Once you’ve started your plan of action, regularly review your progress toward your goal and consider whether each action so far has served you well. Whether it was a simple conversation, a business investment, a workout, or just a daily habit, determine whether each action got you closer to your goal or farther from it.

Robbins adds that, in many cases, other people’s responses to your actions will be the best indicator of whether or not you’re getting closer to your goals. Did people respond positively or negatively to what you did?

> **Plan Your Evaluation First**
> 
> To effectively evaluate your results, you first need to determine _what you’ll be evaluating and how._ In other words, decide beforehand how you’ll know whether your actions are getting you closer to your goal or farther from it.
> 
> Robbins suggests using the reactions of people around you as your metric for success, but that isn’t always applicable. For example, if your goal is to save up enough money to retire, then you can use your savings and investments as your measure of success—anything that helps you put aside more money is getting you closer to your goal. On the other hand, if your goal is to improve your physical fitness, you could use weekly measurements like weight, waist size, and how much weight you can lift to determine your progress toward or away from that goal.

#### Step 4: Change What’s Not Working

If you determine that an action got you closer to your goal in some way, then continue doing it. However, if it didn’t, then you must be flexible enough to change your approach. Reexamine your actions and see if you can determine what went wrong; if necessary, recheck your mental program against the person you’re imitating to make sure it’s accurate. Keep evaluating and adjusting your actions however many times it takes to start getting the results you want.

(Shortform note: Even if you know that your plan didn’t work, it can be difficult to pinpoint what went wrong or how to fix it. In these situations, one of the most important things you can do is to stay true to your values. Since you’ve chosen values and goals that complement one another, examining how your actions might have gone _against_ those values could provide valuable clues about why your plan didn’t work. Furthermore, adjusting that plan to bring it more in line with your values will make you more likely to achieve your goals.)

This brings us to another of Robbins’s essential tips: _Learn to cope with aggravating setbacks._ Nothing great was ever achieved smoothly and easily. The world’s top achievers in any field—business, sports, science, art, and so on—went from mistake to mistake and defeat to defeat on their way to success. So, no matter how many times you have to adjust your plan and try again, **remember that the only true failure is giving up.**

(Shortform note: Experts offer numerous different tips on how to cope with frustration, but they generally boil down to either burning off the negative energy or refocusing your mind away from the feelings of frustration. Some suggested methods are exercise, meditation, and distracting yourself with an activity you enjoy.)

Another of Robbins’s essential tips is that**you mustn’t let yourself stagnate.** Once you accomplish a goal, start thinking about the next one—use the momentum you’ve built to keep improving yourself, rather than resting on your laurels and losing the energy you worked so hard to create.

(Shortform note: One method for building and maintaining momentum is what Robin Sharma (_The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_) calls _kaizen_ , which is a Japanese word meaning “continuous improvement.” The idea behind kaizen is that each day, you should become a little better at something than you were the day before; as Robbins would say, each day, you should get a little closer to one of your goals. Sharma’s suggestion is to identify your greatest weaknesses—perhaps low energy, a lack of confidence, or insufficient practice with some key skill—and work on improving a little bit each day until you overcome those weaknesses.)

### Other People Multiply Your Power

So far, you’ve learned how to create incredible energy by aligning your thoughts with your actions and how to use that energy to take control of your own life. However, no matter how empowered and motivated you are, there will always be limits to what a single person can achieve. **That’s why Robbins says that you can only achieve the titular _Unlimited Power_ through leadership and cooperation. **

> **Counterpoint: Play to Your Strengths**
> 
> Robbins says that the only way to achieve your full potential is to become a good leader with strong people skills. However, this is a narrow way of thinking, and not everyone is born to be a leader. As a counterpoint, in _Limitless_ , Jim Kwik says that the key to unlocking your potential is to identify where your talents naturally lie.
> 
> Kwik says that there are four kinds of intelligence and that everyone is a natural-born genius in at least one of them:
> 
> **1)** **What Robbins describes here is what Kwik calls a _blaze genius:_** someone with strong people skills and leadership abilities whose ideas spread like wildfire.
> 
> **2) A _dynamo genius_ is great with ideas and concepts.** Many entrepreneurs and artists are dynamo geniuses; they know how to harness the energy of an exciting idea and direct it into innovative new projects.
> 
> **3) A brilliant long-term planner is a _tempo genius_ :** someone who sees the big picture and seems to think 10 steps ahead of everyone else. Strategists of any kind—whether business or military—tend to be tempo geniuses.
> 
> **4) Finally, someone who enjoys working with tiny, intricate details is a _steel genius_.** While a tempo genius sees the big picture, a steel genius sees the world through a magnifying glass; they focus intensely on one small area at a time. Many scientists are steel geniuses, dedicating their lives to uncovering the smallest details about their areas of interest.
> 
> Kwik adds that it doesn’t make sense to try to force yourself to think or act in a way that doesn’t come naturally—for example, a steel genius will never have the same level of people skills that a blaze genius does. Therefore, the way to reach your full potential is to discover what kind of genius you are and figure out how those natural abilities will help you achieve your goals.

#### Learn People’s Motivations

**Robbins says that to effectively work with people, you need to understand their motivations.** Even if you have a motivating, inspiring goal, you won’t be able to get others to cooperate in achieving it __ unless you can communicate it in a way that motivates them. Note that Robbins doesn’t mean that you need to find out people’s specific goals and desires—although that can help. Rather, try to understand how they interact with the world around them. You can use this understanding to find the most effective way of motivating someone.

For instance, one person might be highly motivated to get what she wants. You’re likely to convince this person with promises of what she could gain by listening to you: perhaps a new job, the chance to make a difference in the community, or the respect of her peers. However, another person might be more motivated to _avoid_ what he _doesn't_ want—for someone like this, you’d have to tell him what he might lose by ignoring you (like missing out on an exciting opportunity, losing money, or ending up with an inferior product from your competitor).

This is just one example—people can have countless different motivations. Robbins’s point is that **getting people to work with you requires observing them, speaking with them, and finding clues about what motivates them.** Whether you’re trying to resolve a problem with a loved one, make a sale, or bring in a new business partner, finding the right way to communicate with the other person is crucial.

> **The Three Components of Motivation**
> 
> Robbins discusses numerous different motivations that people might have and recommends looking for subtle clues about each individual’s motivations so you can give them what they want. However, the truth of how to motivate others might be much simpler—recent research suggests that people are motivated by just three things:
> 
> **Autonomy:** People want freedom and control over their own actions. So, to motivate people, you might explain that they’ll have the freedom to tackle their work in their own way, or you might tell them how going along with your ideas will grant them greater control over their own lives.
> 
> **Mastery:** People want to be recognized for their skills, but they also want to learn and improve upon those skills. So, you might inspire someone by explaining how you’re offering an opportunity to learn and grow. Alternatively, you might motivate someone by explaining that you’ve approached them because you need their specific skills.
> 
> **Purpose:** People want to feel appreciated, and they want to know that what they do matters. Therefore, you could motivate someone by showing your gratitude for them or by explaining the impact that person’s work will have on the company, the community, or the world.

### Use Your Power to Help Others

Now that you know how to create and harness unlimited energy to achieve your goals, Robbins warns that **you mustn’t let your personal successes define you or control you.** In other words, stay true to your own beliefs and values even after you successfully transform your life.

For example, don’t start believing that you’re better than others because of what you’ve accomplished. Similarly, don’t fall into the trap of believing that your _only_ worth is in what you accomplish or how much money you have so that you become obsessed with working.

Others may try to define you or stereotype you based on superficial things like your job title or your income; don’t accept their judgments either. The only one who defines you is yourself.

(Shortform note: Robbins talks briefly and simply about defining yourself, but in reality, doing so is a complex and deeply personal process. Some people define themselves by their jobs (CEO, artist, scientist), others by their belief systems (Christian, atheist, humanist), and still others by their relationships (loving parent, supportive friend, and so on). The good news is that you’ve already taken some important steps toward defining yourself by choosing your core beliefs, values, and goals. However, if you're still struggling to land on a definition, it might help to create an “elevator pitch” for yourself: something you can say in 30 seconds or less that explains who you are and why you matter. Even if nobody else ever hears your elevator pitch, it will help you to develop your own sense of identity.)

This brings us to Robbins’s last essential tip: **Be generous—since only you can decide who you are, make sure to be a good person.**

Robbins recommends taking 10% of your income and donating it to good causes. Furthermore, he suggests starting this practice today, rather than waiting until some undefined point in the future when you’re “successful.” However, Robbins adds that generosity isn’t just about money; you can be generous with your time, with your skills, with your love, or with anything you have that others need.

Finally, give more than you think you’ll ever get back—the happiness and fulfillment you’ll get from doing so are worth more than anything you could possibly give away.

In short, Robbins believes that true success in life doesn’t come simply from creating unlimited power or even from achieving your personal goals.**Rather, success comes from using your unlimited power to help others.**

> **Why Is Generosity So Fulfilling?**
> 
> People are hardwired, biologically and psychologically, to be generous. In _The Selfish Gene, _evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins explains that altruism (helping each other) was a necessary part of survival for our distant ancestors—one person would help another and trust that he or she would get help in return when needed. Even to the present day, people are genetically predisposed to help each other and to feel a rewarding sense of fulfillment when they do so.
> 
> Furthermore, generous acts can spread far beyond the people directly affected by them; witnessing a generous act makes people want to be generous themselves. In other words, by being generous, you’re not just helping yourself or the people around you. Your actions could positively impact your entire community, or even the entire world—for example, when the #TrashTag trend encouraged people all over the world to clean up litter.
