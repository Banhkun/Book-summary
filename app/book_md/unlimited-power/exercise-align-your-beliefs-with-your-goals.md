## Exercise: Align Your Beliefs With Your Goals

The key idea of _Unlimited Power_ is to fully harness your energy by making sure that your thoughts, actions, and goals all support one another. In this exercise, you’ll choose one or two of each (thoughts, actions, and goals) and make sure they’re all aligned with each other.

* * *

What’s one goal that you’d like to achieve? Describe it in detail. (For example, your goal might be to spend a year putting 10% of each paycheck into a savings account.)

Choose one or two beliefs you’ll adopt to support that goal. Hint: Remember that values are also a type of belief. (For example, if your goal is to save 10% of each paycheck, you might choose to believe that you’re good with money and that you value frugality.)

Choose one or two actions you can start doing today to get closer to your goal. (For example, you could review your weekly and monthly expenses to identify opportunities to save some money.)
