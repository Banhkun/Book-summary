## Exercise: Diversify Your Audience

Assess your idea's current audience and devise strategies to broaden that audience.

* * *

The first red flag that indicates that your idea may not scale is the lack of a scalable audience. The first step in knowing if your audience will scale is identifying your current audience. If your idea has already launched, who has it succeeded with thus far? If your idea has not yet launched, who are you hoping to reach? Briefly describe the group that comprises your current (or target) audience.

Now that you’ve identified your audience, consider who is _not_ in your audience. Aside from groups that you intentionally aren’t targeting, which groups of people has your product failed to reach thus far? If your idea hasn’t launched yet, which groups are you most concerned about reaching? Below, briefly list one or two of these groups, and describe why you think your product hasn’t yet (or might not) succeeded with them.

Finally, consider how you might diversify your idea to broaden your audience. For each group you listed in the previous prompt, consider how you might alter your idea to make it more attractive to that group. For example, if your organization sells chew toys for dogs, and you want to start marketing your products to cat owners, you could begin by designing a new line of laser pointers or other cat toys. Below, list one or two ways you can tweak your idea to make it more scalable.
