## Chapter 4: Making Better Decisions Now by Learning From the Future and Past

We’ve discussed two ways to analyze your decisions: by guarding against resulting, and by outcome fielding. We still have one more strategy to cover. In this chapter, Duke discusses how thinking about past errors and future goals can aid your truthseeking endeavors, thereby enabling you to make better bets.

### Time Travel as a Thought Exercise

"Mental time travel" is a strategy where you consider how past decisions turned out and imagine future outcomes when making a decision in the present. You ensure that you're actively learning from your past. And you keep your long-term goals in mind even when it comes to decisions where possible benefits or consequences might not be immediately obvious, as is the case with many decisions we make.

**We have a tendency to prioritize our immediate desires—our present-day self—over the well-being of our future self.** That’s why we tend to do things like avoid working out or neglecting the laundry a little too long.

Research shows that we make more rational decisions when forced to mentally time travel. That rationality arises in part because the same areas of your mind involved in recalling the past or envisioning the future are the areas associated with deliberative thinking. You can mentally time travel into the future, the past, or a combination of the two.

**Traveling into the future might involve imagining the consequences of your present decision for your future self** , but in detailed and specific ways. What are the positive impacts that working out regularly could have on your life? What could be the negative impacts of not staying fit?

**Traveling into the past can involve calling on regrets.** Usually, regret isn’t all that helpful, because it occurs after the fact. But if you conjure up the regret of a similar past decision, it can help guide you toward making a more rational choice in the present moment. If you recall what a hassle it was to have to do three loads of laundry in one day because you let it pile up, you’re more likely to get to it sooner this time around.

### The Benefits of Mental Time Travel

#### Regulating Your Emotions

**Mental time travel helps put your feelings in the moment—which can feel intense and all-encompassing—into perspective.** When you're having a bad day at work, the frustration and misery can consume you and drive irrational decisions, like arguing with a colleague over a minor issue that you normally would’ve ignored. If you recall similar events in your past, you'll likely find that they didn't have a huge impact on your life over time; the emotions are a lot less significant, in retrospect, than they were in the moment.

Rather than focusing on the immediate emotions, keep a big-picture view of your life. What decision or series of decisions will make you happier over time? Is that argument with your coworker actually a discussion worth having? If so, are you in the right frame of mind to handle it productively and in a way that won’t permanently damage your relationship?

Another problem is that, in the moment, the way we feel about a situation (or outcome) is influenced by how we got there. For example, if you regularly stay at work for an extra hour or two because you like to stay ahead on various projects, you won’t be upset that you have less time to cook dinner or watch your favorite shows when you get home. But in the rare instance when you have to stay at work for an extra hour because you made an error you have to correct, that lost time weighs on you a lot more, even though ultimately it’s not much of a change from the norm. That negative outcome might put you in a terrible mood, affecting how you interact with your family when you do get home or even making you more short-tempered with your colleagues the next day. In other words, it’ll put you _on tilt_.

**Poker players use the term "tilt" to describe the state of mind where you make irrational, emotionally driven decisions because of a previous outcome (whether that outcome was good or bad, such as a crushing loss or a euphoric win).** Being on tilt can cause you to make decisions you wouldn't have made if you'd taken a step back and gotten some perspective.

You can often tell when you're on tilt: Are you experiencing intense emotions? Is your heart racing? Are you snapping at people? Then you might not be in the best place to make a decision.

**Once you notice you're on tilt, you can use mental time travel to gain the perspective you're lacking in the moment.** How much will the present event matter later on? If it's going to matter a lot, then maybe you shouldn't make a decision until you've calmed down. If it won't matter all that much, then realizing that can help you get your emotions in check more quickly.

You might not be able to make rational decisions 100% of the time, but the goal is to reduce the amount of emotionally driven decisions—to get better at long-term decision-making.

#### Breaking Bad Habits

Just as there are emotional and physical signs of tilt, **you might start to notice behaviors and thinking patterns that can indicate that you're not making a good decision,** or that you’re drifting away from objectivity.

When you’re engaging with other people, these signs might include dismissing them with insults and ignoring the points they’re making—for example, with ad hominems or straw-man arguments, which are used to attack the speaker or misrepresent their viewpoint. Or you might begin to notice when you’re trying to influence them toward passive belief, maybe by speaking in absolutes (“That strategy _always_ succeeds”; “You should _never_ do that”) or subtly discouraging feedback by not acknowledging your uncertainty about the topic being discussed.

When you’re alone, a red flag might be when you realize you’re beating yourself up over something that happened, as opposed to constructively focusing on how you could do better in the future. Conversely, you might notice that you’re prone to blaming everything negative that happens to you on bad luck, or being overconfident about your skills, which might be a clue that your outcome fielding needs work.

Once you’ve practiced identifying the signs that you’re being influenced by your biases, you can get better at overcoming them.

#### Planning Ahead

##### Building Up Barriers

You can use what's known as a "Ulysses contract" to ensure that your past or future self has input into a present-day decision. The term comes from a story from Homer's _Odyssey_ , when the hero Odysseus (or Ulysses) had his crew tie him up as they passed by the island of the Sirens so that he wouldn't steer the ship there and doom them all. He knew that the Sirens' song would affect his ability to think rationally, so he used his past-self to keep his present-self in check.

**Make commitments in advance that will place barriers on your future self, reducing the chance that you'll make an irrational decision.** For example, imagine that you have trouble waking up when your alarm goes off. When you’re half-asleep, you reach over, hit the snooze button, and doze off for a few more minutes. You do this again and again until you have to rush to make it to work on time, which is stressful.

So you decide to put your alarm on the other side of the room. Now, to turn it off, you have to get out of bed and walk over to it. You could still crawl back into bed afterwards—but, by adding a barrier, you’ve reduced the likelihood of making that choice. You're forcing yourself to take an extra step before you can get to that bad decision. In other words, you're giving your deliberative mind a chance to take charge.

##### Imagining Scenarios

Another strategy is **“scenario planning,” an exercise where you imagine all the possible outcomes of a decision—all the possible futures—and try to guess the probability of each of these outcomes occurring**. Just by weighing the possibilities and confronting your uncertainty, you’ll be more likely to make a more rational decision. You'll have a chance to prepare for negative outcomes, rather than being taken by surprise if they happen. You can set up barriers to your own irrational tendencies (like moving your alarm across the room). Your emotional response to either a failure or a success will be moderated—you're less likely to self-flagellate if things don't go your way, because you braced yourself for that result in advance. You’ll avoid the trap of resulting, or judging decisions based on the outcome rather than the thought process—because you'll have weighed the merits of the decision well before the outcome happened.

Scenario planning allows you to consider not only what the possible outcomes are, but also which outcomes to prioritize. If there's a slim chance of getting your best-case scenario, but a very high chance of getting your second choice option, then the second choice probably has greater value to you. You can also consider the consequences that could follow each outcome, which could reveal pros or cons to each that you hadn't previously considered.

For example, imagine that you forgot to prepare for a big holiday dinner you’re hosting tomorrow. Your two options are:

  1. Order food from a nice restaurant nearby.
     1. Pro: convenience, professional cooking
     2. Con: more expensive
  2. Rush out to the grocery store tonight and spend all day cooking tomorrow.
     1. Pro: cost-effective, more personal
     2. Con: time-consuming



Let’s say you lean toward option 1. But then you start scenario planning: What are the ways that option #1 could go wrong? “Wrong” in this case means that you don’t get the result you want: delicious food and happy guests.

  * Delivery could be delayed.
  * They could send you an incorrect order.
  * One of your guests could have allergies, and since you didn’t prepare the food, you won’t be able to tell them what’s safe to eat.



What are the ways that option #2 could go wrong?

  * You could make a mistake because you’re rushing, burning the food or mixing up ingredients.
  * You might not have time to cook _and_ clean up after. 
  * You could miscalculate and wind up with not enough food for all your guests.



By scenario planning, you realize that if option #1 goes wrong, it will be hard to fix. You won’t be able to whip up enough food at the last minute to feed everyone. If option #2 goes wrong, you _could_ order a rush delivery from the restaurant, but as scenario planning showed you, that’s not a foolproof plan either. You also have more control over option #2, whereas the success of option #1 relies mostly on other people’s actions. So how confident are you about your cooking? Conversely, how much faith do you have in your local Italian place?

You settle on a third option, a happy medium: You’ll prepare a few crowd-pleasing recipes you’ve made before and you feel confident about pulling off, but you’ll order a few items from the restaurant. Your bases are covered; if something goes wrong, it won’t be a complete disaster.

##### Starting at the End

Another approach to scenario planning is to **start with the goal you're trying to achieve and then consider the different routes to getting there.** You can do this from a positive standpoint, imagining that you’ve achieved the goal and focusing on what you did to make it happen, or a negative one, imagining you failed and considering all the factors that may have contributed to that result. What are all the things that can go wrong? What precautionary steps can you take to avoid that?

Research by a psychology professor at NYU showed that people who imagine negative scenarios related to their goals are more likely to achieve those goals. In imagining how they could fail, they do a better job of taking steps to avoid that failure.

**By planning for both negative and positive futures, you end up with a clearer picture of all the possibilities.** That will help you be more accurate when guessing at the probability of each outcome, which will give you a clearer sense of what to prioritize, which all adds up to making better decisions.

Scenario planning can protect you from hindsight bias. If you've considered all the different outcomes, the one that actually happens won't seem like it was inevitable—especially if the outcome that happens is one that you'd guessed had a low probability of occurring. That awareness will make you a more accurate judge of your own decisions, able to have compassion for yourself and others when things go wrong, able to keep from becoming overconfident about a success, and ready to make similar decisions going forward.
