## Chapter 3: Learning From Outcomes by Considering Luck and Skill

We’ve learned about how engaging with our own uncertainty can lead us to beliefs and decisions that are more balanced and well-thought-out. Now we’re going to address the role of uncertainty in how we analyze our outcomes and learn from them.

Before you can learn from the outcomes of your decisions, you have to figure out how much of the outcome can be attributed to skill, and how much of it was due to luck. We'll discuss some of the obstacles that prevent us from accurately sorting outcomes into the "luck" or "skill" category, and how you can work around those obstacles by building more effective thinking habits.

### Outcomes Are Learning Opportunities

To improve at anything, you have to update your beliefs and change your behavior based on feedback. When it comes to decision-making, **you recalibrate based on your _outcomes_.** We’ve all heard the advice to “learn from your mistakes,” but how do you actually do that? (Bear in mind that you can learn from your successes, too.)

First you have to figure out _when_ an outcome is something you can learn from; not all of them will provide useful information. If an outcome is the product of luck or other forces that you have no control over, then it might not be able to teach you anything. But you’ll find that most outcomes are the result of a combination of factors, some of which you _can_ control, like skill.

You can think of outcomes as existing on a spectrum between luck and skill, with the majority falling somewhere in the middle of the two extremes.

### Categorizing Outcomes as Luck-Based or Skill-Based

**When you attribute an outcome to skill, you’re taking the credit or the blame for it.** You can learn from that by adjusting your behavior going forward. When you recognize that it was about luck, and it wasn’t in your control, then you can discard it rather than changing your behavior based on what happened.

In poker, a loss could come down to the fact that you made the wrong moves—an issue of skill. Or it could be because another player drew better cards—an issue of luck. The ability to tell those two situations apart differentiates good players from bad ones. Duke calls this sorting process “outcome fielding.”

**How you sort an outcome is a kind of bet, just like your decisions and beliefs.** If you attribute an outcome to skill, you’re _betting_ you can learn from it and thereby adjusting future decisions (other _bets_) in a way that will impact future outcomes. It’s a chain reaction. That’s why it’s important to get better at outcome fielding and get it right as often as you can.

### Obstacles to Accurately Evaluating Outcomes

Let’s break down some of the hurdles we have to overcome for more accurate outcome fielding.

#### The Challenges of Working Backward

It’s difficult to work backward from a negative outcome and pinpoint exactly what went wrong. **Different causes can produce the same effect.** Multiple causes can work _together_ , each with a different degree of influence, to produce a single effect.

For example, people who achieve great success or fame in the arts often attribute some degree of that success to luck. You probably have to have some level of talent and understanding of craft to make it as an actor. But you also have to hope that a casting director takes a chance on you when you’re starting out, that you form the right connections, that roles are created that you’re a good fit for, and that the projects you get cast in are well-received by the public. And a variety of factors other than the quality of the work can influence public reception, like current events or whether the release date of your film coincides with (and has to compete against) the latest installment of a popular franchise film.

When you’re analyzing a complicated situation or outcome—such as the trajectory of a career—it might be impossible to draw clear conclusions about how much luck played a role as opposed to skill.

#### How Self-Serving Bias Holds Us Back

We're prone to "self-serving bias"—we own the positive outcomes, attributing them to skill, and brush off the negative ones as bad luck. **We don't want bad things to be our fault.** It's tempting to give in to self-serving bias even if we've accepted that most outcomes result from a combination of luck and skill.

**This self-serving bias can make us overlook the learning opportunity in a mistake, or double down on beliefs that are holding us back.** An actor who can’t find work might tell himself that he’s just unlucky or he hasn’t come across the right role yet. He’s always been praised for his talent; he knows he’s good enough. And he might be right that it’s just bad luck stopping him. But maybe he needs to try auditioning with a different monologue or learn new techniques. His certainty about his own talent might be preventing him from experimenting with new, potentially more effective, approaches.

(Shortform note: For more on bias and the other ways our innate irrationality throws off our decision-making, read our guide to Predictably Irrational.)

#### Why It’s Hard to Learn From Others (But You Should Do It Anyway)

You can learn from watching people just as much as you can learn from gaining your own experiences. You watch others play a game and observe the strategies they use. You watch a parent or instructor drive when you're first getting your license. You watch how a colleague delivers a presentation and then apply their tactics to become a better speaker and presenter yourself.

**When you watch other people make decisions—make bets—you can learn without having to risk anything yourself.** But the same kind of thinking that produces self-serving bias exists when we watch others, too—only in reverse. In the same way that we instinctively want to attribute our successes to skill and our failures to bad luck, we're tempted to attribute other people's successes to luck and their failures to a lack of skill. This is especially true if it's a person we have an existing opinion about—a belief that affects our perception of them.

Competition is in our nature—competition for resources, for jobs, for partners. For victory in a poker game. **Downplaying other people's skills is a way of downplaying the competition.** Even when we're not competing, we're comparing. Research shows that a significant factor in how happy we feel with our lives is where we stand in comparison to other people. That’s why status symbols like designer clothing or luxury cars are so popular. A logo or a higher price tag doesn’t necessarily make a product better. The appeal is in how that product makes you appear to others, and how their perception of you lifts your self-perception.

But if you don't keep that instinct in check, it'll hinder your ability to learn from other people. You'll miss your chance to pick up on strategies you could've put to use in your own life. More importantly, you might fail to treat others with a compassion you would have wished for yourself if you were in their shoes.

### Creating Better Thinking Habits to Become a Better Learner

#### The Three Parts of a Habit

These flaws in our thinking are habits that can be broken. There are three parts to a habit:

  * The _cue_ is a signal that activates your routine. 
  * The _routine_ is the action you take to address the cue and which delivers a reward.
  * The _reward_ is the positive outcome that reinforces the habit.



If you have a habit of biting your nails, the _cue_ might be stress. Nail-biting is the _routine_ that helps you cope. The _reward_ is a brief respite, or at least a distraction, from that stress.

**The trick to changing a habit is to replace the unwanted routine with something else.** You can't get rid of the cue (stress). And you don't want to get rid of the reward (less stress). You just need a different routine to bridge the two—like going for a walk or squeezing a stress ball when you get the urge to bite your nails, until eventually, the urge goes away altogether. You can deal with the habit of self-serving bias, toward yourself and others, in the same way.

(Shortform note: For more on how to understand and change your habits, read our guide to The Power of Habit.)

#### Establishing New Routines

The routine of blaming your negative outcomes on bad luck and other people's negative outcomes on a lack of skill rewards you with a more positive view of yourself. **So find ways to uplift your self-perception _without_ that biased thinking. **

If taking credit for a success makes you feel good,**learn to derive pleasure from interrogating those successes and identifying things you could have done better** —because that will set you up for more success later on, and isn't that a good thing? If being better than others makes us feel good about ourselves, what if we focus on being better at judging people fairly, better at giving them credit where it's due and compassion where it's needed?

**Self-serving bias and motivated reasoning are routines that you can swap out for better ones, like self-reflection and the ability to view situations from multiple perspectives.** When you've confronted the fact that brushing off someone else's success as a lucky break is not just a throwaway thought you can forget about, but a bad habit that can determine how fast or how much you learn, therefore affecting your ability to make better decisions down the line—then changing that habit becomes more important. More learning, better decisions, and ultimately more success are rewards, so it's possible to build habits to produce those rewards more consistently. Like any routine, it takes practice to master and to turn into a habit.

One strategy when observing someone else's outcome is to ask yourself what you'd think in their shoes—if it was _your_ outcome. Is it easier to see, then, what they did right? Is it more obvious what was out of their control?

You can take your own mistakes and successes and view them as if you were an outsider, too. When you picture someone else making all the same choices you did, can you see where there’s room for improvement? Can you see where you got lucky?

Although training yourself to change the way you think can be hard, remember that you don't have to be perfect. **You don't have to completely eliminate bias from your life** ; in fact, that's probably not possible. But small improvements can have a snowball effect that produces significant changes to your life over time. Learning a little bit more every week might mean learning a _lot_ more in a year. And being a faster, better learner gets you closer to pretty much any goal you can think of.
