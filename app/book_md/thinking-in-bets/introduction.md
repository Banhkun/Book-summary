## Introduction

In _Thinking in Bets_ , author Annie Duke discusses how her decades-long poker career helped her refine her approach to decision-making and develop strategies that can be applied to day-to-day life and business settings.

She left her doctoral studies in cognitive psychology, took up poker to earn a little money, and ended up becoming a professional poker player whose 20-year career would garner over $4 million in earnings. The game enabled her to observe how other people make decisions in a setting where every choice leads to one of two clear outcomes—winning or losing money—and those outcomes serve as feedback about the quality of your decisions. In the early 2000s, she began sharing her strategies with professionals across such fields as finance, law, and business.

Her process boils down to “thinking in bets,” or re-framing every decision as a “bet” against yourself. **By "thinking in bets," you will:**

  * Learn not to judge the quality of a decision solely on the outcome it produces
  * Move away from reactive decisions and toward objectivity
  * Understand the value in having a group of like-minded individuals whose support _and_ dissent can help you vet your decisions
