## Exercise: Assess Your Current Work Mindset

Apply Godin’s linchpin philosophy to your life by reflecting on your current working habits and attitude toward work.

* * *

Would you currently consider yourself a linchpin at work? Why or why not? Consider how much you focus on the positive impact of your work, how much control you have over the tasks you choose to do, and whether you feel like you can be yourself at work. Which parts of your job make you feel like a linchpin, and which don’t?

Consider what you can do to become more of a linchpin at work: Identify the people your organization serves and how it serves them. Then, list as many ideas as you can think of for new ways you could improve those people’s lives—whether by furthering your organization’s mission or pleasing the customers directly. (For example, if you serve tables at a bar, you could improve your customers’ lives by tasting more of the menu so you know what to recommend, organizing fun community events the bar can host, or making an effort to be open and honest with customers rather than superficial and inauthentic.)

Are there any obstacles you foresee preventing you from executing any of these ideas? If so, what could you do to overcome these obstacles? (For example, if your boss at the bar keeps shooting down your ideas for community events, you might gather evidence that similar events at other bars are profitable to make your argument more persuasive.)
