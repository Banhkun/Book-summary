## Exercise: Plan to Finish and Share Imperfect Work

Godin states that finishing and sharing your work with the world is the most important skill a linchpin can cultivate. Set a plan to put this into practice in your life.

* * *

Think of a project you’d like to create and give as a gift to the world. If you’re having trouble thinking of something, remember to use fear as a guide—is there anything you could make that intrigues you, but scares you? Perhaps something that you’d like to do, but that you’ve told yourself you’re not good enough to do? (For example, you may want to become a film critic and start a blog where you review new movies.)

What would be a realistic deadline for you to complete your first project, and how do you intend to share this project with the world on that day? (For example, you could plan to create a website and post your first movie review on it 10 days from now.)

What actions could you take to hold yourself accountable and make sure you share your work on this deadline? (For example, you could post your self-imposed deadline publicly on social media, or promise to reward yourself by buying something special if you meet this deadline.)
