## Exercise: Reflect on Your Relationship to Faith

Think about and discuss the role of faith—creative and non-creative—in your life.

* * *

We talk in this chapter about joyous faith in Creative Sorcery. Describe other parts of your life in which you have unconditional faith and why this faith exists. (This doesn’t have to be religious faith and can be quite narrow. It can just be, for instance, faith that difficulties at work will get sorted eventually, or faith that your kids will get their grades up in school without you needing to panic about it or intervene.)

How does that faith impact your life? Does it make things easier or harder for you? Explain your answer.

Now, think about your creative process. How strong is your faith in your creative abilities? Explain your answer.

Describe some ways you might increase your creative faith (by, for instance, adopting a perspective of abundance or stating your identity as a creator out loud).
