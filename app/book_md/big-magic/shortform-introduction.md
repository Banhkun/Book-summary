## Shortform Introduction

_Big Magic_ is a guide to leading a more fulfilled life by making creativity, in any guise that suits you, a part of your daily existence. Elizabeth Gilbert provides advice and thoughts on the creative process, which she sees as a way to access an unseen, transcendent force of creative energy. Gilbert also explores how to effectively incorporate creativity into your life in a way that is enjoyable and sustainable. She offers tools to make you a more resilient and committed creator, able to weather the storms of a creative life with grace and ease.

This book is not about how to attain a creative career or achieve success as a creative. It is, rather, a spiritual treatment of how creativity can enhance your life by making you more attuned and receptive to beauty and joy.

### About the Author

Elizabeth Gilbert is a bestselling author. Her first published work was a short story collection, _Pilgrims_ (1997), which was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway award. She followed this with a novel, _Stern Men_ (2000); and a work of nonfiction, _The Last American Man_ (2002), which was a finalist for the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. During her early career, she also worked as a journalist for Spin, GQ, and The New York Times magazine.

Gilbert became a household name when her best-selling memoir, _Eat Pray Love_ , was published in 2006. In it, Gilbert recounts her post-divorce journey to Italy, India, and Indonesia to make sense of her life. _Eat Pray Love_ sold over 10 million copies globally and was adapted into a film starring Julia Roberts in 2010. One critic later would describe the mania over _Eat Pray Love_ as “Gilbert fever.” In 2008, TIME listed Gilbert as one of its 100 most influential people.

Some critics of Gilbert’s felt that _Eat Pray Love marked a decline in her career_. They saw her smash-hit memoir as being self-involved and insubstantial and a step down from her more serious journalistic work.

After _Eat Pray Love,_ Gilbert published _Committed _in 2010, which chronicles her love affair-turned-marriage with a Brazilian man she met in Indonesia (about whom she first wrote in _Eat Pray Love_)_._ In 2013, she published _The Signature of All Things, _a novel about a 19th-century female botanist’s around-the-world adventures. She followed this up with _Big Magic_ in 2015 _,_ and, in 2019, _City of Girls_ , a novel that follows a young woman arriving on the New York theater scene in the 1940s.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Penguin Books USA

_Big Magic_ was published in 2015 by Penguin, an imprint of Penguin Random House. It was Gilbert’s fifth book overall but her first book that falls within the self-improvement and self-help category.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical and Intellectual Context

Gilbert based _Big Magic_ on two TED Talks she gave in 2009 and 2014. In her first, entitled “Your elusive creative genius,” she presents some of her ideas around genius and the irrationality of the creative process. The second, “Success, failure and the drive to keep creating,” revolves around sticking with a creative pursuit through both success and failure.

On the broad spectrum of books on creativity, _Big Magic_ falls closer to the end dealing with creativity’s links to spirituality and faith than to the end dealing with creative productivity and success. It thus has more in common with Julia Cameron’s _The Artist’s Way, _which approaches creativity as a way to self-actualize,__ than with Ed Catmull’s _Creativity Inc., _which provides actionable advice on how to build a creative team.

#### The Book’s Impact

_Big Magic_ was a New York Times bestseller. While not as influential as _Eat Pray Love,_ it helped position Gilbert as not just an author but also a self-help guru (particularly for women). In 2015, she appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to discuss _Big Magic_. She now appears on podcasts, in YouTube series, and even at spirituality and psychology conferences to discuss creativity and spirituality.

Gilbert continues to expand her creative identity and influence. In 2020, she founded the Onward Book Club on Instagram, in which she speaks with Black female writers about their books.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Big Magic_ received mixed reviews. Some readers felt its ideas were sound, inspiring, and worthy of implementation. Others felt the book was insubstantial, lacking in concrete actionables, and too fluffy to motivate creativity over the long run. Negative critics also thought the book as a whole was Gilbert-centric: that it provided recommendations that worked for Gilbert but might not work for everyone.

Furthermore, some readers struggled with Gilbert’s belief in magic that underpins much of the book. Her perspective on creativity is rooted in mysticism rather than science, and most of her views are unprovable and must be taken at face value. Finally, some objected to the “cutesy” expressions of how creativity worked: for instance, the presentation of an idea as an entity that has agency and can leave you if you don’t pay enough attention to it.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach and Organization

Gilbert tackles the concept of creativity from six different angles in _Big Magic_ , each of which has its own chapter:__ courage, enchantment, permission, persistence, trust, and divinity. However, the discussions in each chapter are only loosely linked to the title: For instance, the chapter on courage mainly discusses _fear_ and coping with it.

The book reads more like a collection of Gilbert’s musings and stories on a particular aspect of creativity than as a set of guidelines. In the chapter about enchantment, for instance, Gilbert relays an anecdote about how an idea first visited her before transferring to the mind of author Ann Patchett as almost the exact same idea. This anecdote illustrates how Gilbert envisions ideas working (that they can move from person to person), but there are no concrete actions or recommendations to be drawn from it.

This loose structure and indirect approach reflect Gilbert’s own views on and approach to creativity. She conveys in her book that creativity involves a high degree of “magic”: in other words, irrational, unexplainable, possibly supernatural input. To present such ideas on creativity in a highly structured and methodical way with many actionables would not only be difficult, but it would also somewhat defeat the purpose of the book itself.

Overall, Gilbert’s aim seems to be to inspire and catalyze readers using her own experiences and learning, not to provide concrete tips or suggestions.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Rather than centering each chapter in this guide around a concept, our chapters each discuss a step of the creative process. This allows you to follow approximately chronological advice as you embark on your creative explorations.

Here’s what we’ll discuss in each chapter:

  * **Chapter 1: Definitions of Creativity, Creative Sorcery, Ideas, and Genius:** We outline Gilbert’s non-scientific definitions of key aspects of the creative process, which will appear throughout the rest of the guide. 
  * **Chapter 2: Building a Good Relationship with Creativity and Creative Sorcery** : We describe how to set yourself up for success on your creative journey by adopting the right attitude toward the mystical forces of creativity. 
  * **Chapter 3: Embarking on Your Creative Journey:** We cover specific attitudes you should develop to build resiliency as you begin a creative practice. 
  * **Chapter 4: Responding to Ideas** : We discuss the most creatively productive ways to respond to ideas when they come to you. 
  * **Chapter 5: Encountering and Dealing with Creative Challenges** : We describe the challenges you will encounter and create for yourself during the creative process and how to overcome them. 
  * **Chapter 6: Maintaining Your Creative Momentum** : We shift to a long-term perspective and discuss how to keep up a creative practice over a lifetime. 
  * **Chapter 7: Maintaining Faith in the Creative Process** : We end in the same long-term perspective, focusing on the best mindsets to keep up a healthy, faithful relationship with your creativity. 



Our commentary in this guide predominantly serves three main goals:

  1. To provide actionables to help you implement Gilbert’s ideas around creativity 
  2. To give context around Gilbert’s writing on spirituality and art, so you can understand and explore the traditions she is drawing on or discussing 
  3. To explore scientific explanations for the creative phenomena Gilbert attributes to magic
