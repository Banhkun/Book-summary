## Exercise: Develop a Resilient Mentality

Develop the mental strength to ensure your creative process remains positive.

* * *

Describe a time when you cared too much about a creative project or took a project so seriously that it became a negative experience for you.

Now, describe a time when you were afraid or embarrassed to put your creative work into the world. What most embarrassed you? Try to put your finger on what you were afraid of.

Moving forward, what are some ways you can prepare yourself mentally for the inevitable fear, embarrassment, and seriousness that can arise around your work? What mental habits or guardrails can you put in place for yourself to prevent you from falling into those traps? (For example, you might practice mindfulness or develop shame resilience.)
