## Chapter 5: Encountering and Dealing With Creative Challenges

In the last chapter, we discussed how to best respond to an idea. In this chapter, we’ll discuss how to handle the inevitable creative challenges you’ll encounter on your creative journey. We’ll first discuss accepting the inevitable difficulty in your creative work. We’ll then cover some common mental pitfalls creators set up for themselves and how you can, as best as possible, guard yourself against them.

### Make Peace With Irritations

First, Gilbert claims that **no matter what creative pursuit you take on, there will always be attending annoyances**.**** A circus performer, for instance, must contend with physical danger. A bird watcher must deal with the reasonable chance of not seeing any birds. A world traveler must cope with jet lag.

Instead of railing against or trying to avoid pain points, view them as equally integral to your job as the high points, says Gilbert. Developing an ability to cope with irritants and unpleasantness is as much a part of your job as a creator as actually creating.

> **Meditation Can Help Cope With Difficulties**
> 
> Gilbert suggests viewing irritation as part of your job as a creator, but she doesn’t offer concrete suggestions on how to develop that perspective. This is where meditation may help: Some meditations help you see difficult thoughts and life experiences as waves in a broader sea of life. In meditation, you learn how to avoid clinging to these negative thoughts or feelings. Instead, you let them pass through your mind without staying there and becoming a mental burden.
> 
> Meditation also teaches you that you can’t stop negative thoughts or feelings from happening. You can’t prevent anger or irritation from arising when a creative project isn’t going your way, for instance. But you can change how you relate to those thoughts and whether or not you allow them to affect your attitude or your engagement with your work.

#### No Matter What, Always Create

If you question whether or not you’re able to cope with the irritations of your creative pursuit, Gilbert acknowledges that it may be best to give it up. However, if you do so, find something else to commit to creatively. Gilbert believes that **every human needs to have some creative pursuit that allows them to temporarily escape their reality** and their current societal roles and responsibilities (for instance, being a parent or a CEO).

> **The Broader Benefits of Creative Work**
> 
> Creative pursuits can have personal benefits beyond giving you the chance to slip out of your established identities for a while, as Gilbert proposes. A creative project, or hobby, can help you by:
> 
>   * **Forcing you to manage your time better** : If you must build creative work into your schedule, you’re forced to manage your time more effectively and waste less of it.
> 
>   * **Building your social networks:** A creative pursuit can get you in touch with people you wouldn’t otherwise meet. In an age where we tend to only socialize with people who are very similar to us, this is of huge personal and creative benefit.
> 
>   * **Forging new identities:** Beyond escaping your current roles and responsibilities,**** pursuing a creative project allows you to explore _new_ identities and positive ways of seeing yourself.

### Don’t Try to Make the “Right” Creative Work

Having made peace with the irritations of your chosen creative pursuit, you next need to face down some common mental obstacles that prevent you from doing your best work, says Gilbert. **The first obstacle is your perception of what your work should look like**. Prescriptive thoughts prevent you from fully exercising your creativity and ultimately only stymie you.

Below are three common prescriptive thoughts that get in the way of your creativity and which you should dispel:

#### “My Work Must Be Novel”

Gilbert claims that many people—artists especially—feel their work must be totally novel to be worth making. **But it’s nearly impossible to be novel anymore.** Most ideas or concepts have already been executed in some way.**** There have been, for instance, many different parodies of the Lord of the Rings books and films.

However, writes Gilbert, all other executions of a concept will be different from yours. You bring a specific sensibility and worldview that make your idea unique. While there are indeed dozens of Lord of the Rings spoofs, each of them is unique because each creator’s sense of humor and perspective on the original work is different.

Gilbert says that when, instead of trying to be original, you try to be genuine—try to best express how you really feel through your unique lens—you create work that is interesting and will resonate with others.

> **Gilbert’s Inconsistent Use of the Word “Idea”**
> 
> Here, Gilbert uses the word “idea” in a way that seems contradictory to her use of the word in Chapter 2. She said previously that there were many ideas floating around the universe, searching for people to make them manifest. Yet now, she seems to assert that there are actually only a few limited ideas floating around the universe (and most of them have already been executed).
> 
> Perhaps the easiest way to reconcile these two descriptions is to say that **there are many duplicate or closely related ideas in existence**. This would explain why it’s hard to be totally novel despite a proliferation of ideas being out there.
> 
> It may also make sense to broaden the conception of what an “idea” needs to look like or contain. An idea may not need to be fully fleshed out; perhaps it can just be “Lord of the Rings parody.” The “Lord of the Rings parody” idea can visit many people over many years, yielding many different parodies. In this way, just one “root” idea can spawn many different similar yet unique ideas.
> 
> In any case, Gilbert’s definition of an idea is somewhat nebulous, leaving room for multiple interpretations.

#### “My Work Must Help Other People”

Another way Gilbert thinks you can limit your creativity is by **feeling that your work needs to be helpful to others, politically relevant, or otherwise “important.”** This approach always ends up backfiring. Those consuming your work sense that you’re trying to fulfill some external expectation rather than express a genuine feeling or experience. This renders your work less resonant, writes Gilbert, because it does not come from a place of truth.

> **The Need to Help and the Savior Complex**
> 
> The need to help others through your creative work that Gilbert describes is similar to a psychological phenomenon called the savior complex, or white knight syndrome. This is the compulsion to help others to feel good about yourself. People with savior complexes often exacerbate problems they’re determined to solve because they lack the required expertise or skillset to solve them. They also stifle the growth of those they’re helping by keeping them from coming up with solutions to problems. In the end, helping others to receive external validation—even in creative work, as Gilbert suggests—typically will not help anyone, least of all the helper.
> 
> Advice on how to counter the effects of a savior complex revolves around changing your self-perception and your perception of your role in the world. Understand that you can only really help yourself: Everything outside you is out of your control. Plus, your own life probably isn’t perfect, either, so why not work through your problems before tackling those of others?

#### “My Work Must Be Lofty”

A final way in which Gilbert feels you might stymie your creativity is by thinking your work must be “lofty,” “high-minded,” or “worthy.” **It’s a waste of time to try to meet some vague standard for “worthy” work, and you should instead just create what you want to create**.

Gilbert continues by saying that there’s no such thing as “high” or “low” creation; there’s just creation. When people draw a line between highbrow and lowbrow, it’s merely a subjective distinction. Work that someone condemns as philistine might be lauded as a tremendous accomplishment by someone else.

(Shortform note: The distinction between “high” and “low” art to which Gilbert alludes has been widely debated and is in constant flux. In the past, the line between high and low art was drawn between works that were created purely for aesthetics—a painting, for instance—being high, and works that served a purpose, such as a chest of drawers, being low. But over time, the utilitarian came to be regarded as high art: A beautifully decorated box or piece of furniture might today be considered high art. If “low,” utilitarian work can eventually become “high” art, Gilbert’s assertion that it’s pointless to try to be “highbrow” seems valid.)

### Don’t Let Others Define You

According to Gilbert, another mental challenge many creators face is the input and feelings of others about their work. Others will inevitably form opinions of and try to categorize your work, **but you must not let those opinions or labels affect how or what you create**. The need to categorize and label is an inherent human trait. You cannot change that and you cannot fight off every label or opinion others try to assign to you, writes Gilbert. All you can do is to make what you want to make. Everything that comes after is out of your hands.

(Shortform note: The impulse to label and categorize people, concepts, and things is innate to humans, as Gilbert suggests. What’s more, when you’re assigned a trait, others will come to see you as having more of that trait than you did before the assignation. Similarly, you will become less associated with a different trait. For instance, if you’re categorized as “avant-garde,” you’ll be seen as more avant-garde than you were before, and also less, for example, “classical.” Gilbert is therefore right to caution against letting others’ labels define you. If you let labels determine how you see yourself, you cede your right to create what you want to those labels—labels that will only become more restrictive over time.)

Gilbert adds that **when you put a creation into the universe, you surrender control over how it is interpreted by consumers**. For instance, you might write and produce a play about a love affair. After the performance, audience members approach you to tell you what they thought of your play about “growing up,” or your play about “family,” or your play about “coming out.” Each audience member might interpret your play completely differently, based on their own unique lived experience.

This, again, is normal, claims Gilbert, because each human sees the world through a unique lens. But this means that **you should not try to control how the world takes in your work or allow the reactions to your work to define you as a creator**. Trying to control others’ perception of your work is an energy-sapping waste of time, and their reactions have little to do with you and everything to do with their unique situation and worldview.

> **How to Cope With External and Internal Opinions**
> 
> Gilbert’s belief that the reactions to a creator’s work don’t say anything about the creator as a person is echoed by don Miguel Ruiz in his classic self-help book _The Four Agreements._ Ruiz’s Second Agreement (or habit to improve your life), “Don’t Take Anything Personally,” states that others’ negative input about you is merely a reflection of their struggles or issues. This is similar to Gilbert’s assertion that we all see the world, and thus art, through our unique lens and that your reality may be different from someone else’s.
> 
> Ruiz takes this notion even further, saying that you shouldn’t even always listen to your _own_ opinions about and feedback on yourself (and, by extension, your work). You can develop a myriad of thoughts and feelings about yourself and your work which often are in disagreement with one another: For example, you might in one moment loathe something you’ve created and in the next, think it’s the greatest thing you’ve ever made. To avoid inner turmoil, don’t give these thoughts too much credence, says Ruiz.

### Don’t Fall for Perfectionism

According to Gilbert, one of the greatest mental obstacles to creativity is perfectionism. She believes that**no matter how hard you try, you will never be able to attain perfection** : There will always be a way someone can find your work lacking. It’s therefore pointless to strive for perfection and better just to create something imperfect and put it into the world.

To Gilbert, perfectionism is a nefarious psychological ailment because it appears to be a good thing: You seem to simply be holding yourself to a high standard. But in reality, perfectionism is a manifestation of the fear of not being worthy.**** You don’t believe that you deserve to exist as you are and therefore put the onus on your work to earn you that right by being perfect.

If you let it, says Gilbert, perfectionism can stop a project dead in its tracks or prevent you from even starting it for fear it won’t be perfect, and that is the worst possible way to honor an idea.

> **Brené Brown’s Take on Perfectionism**
> 
> Brené Brown discusses perfectionism at length in her book, _The Gifts of Imperfection,_ diving more deeply than Gilbert into the psychological underpinning of perfectionism _._
> 
> Brown states, like Gilbert, that perfectionism is founded on the belief that you aren’t inherently good enough. But Brown goes on to claim that perfectionism isn’t just a way to earn your right to exist—it’s also a way to control how others perceive you. Perfectionists don’t want to be seen as different or aberrant, so they work extra hard to project normalcy and perfection. This kicks off a vicious cycle: Because you will never succeed in appearing perfect all the time, you blame and shame yourself for not conforming. This shame leads you to try even harder to be perfect, which you, again, cannot succeed at. Perfectionism thus negatively impacts your life in every way.
> 
> Brown agrees with Gilbert that ultimately, striving for perfection is pointless, and she recommends that you be compassionate with yourself to fight perfectionism. Don’t try to hide your imperfections or punish yourself for having them. Instead, embrace them through, for instance, positive self-talk.

Perfectionism is hard to get over, though. Here are a few habits you can develop to reduce its impact on your work:

#### Be Realistic

Gilbert says you can reduce perfectionism’s impact by **being realistic about what you can accomplish in the time you can allot to your creativity**. Decide what you can reasonably finish, and then don’t force yourself to do more or spend more time on it.

> **A Different Way to Manage Time and Expectations**
> 
> Gilbert advocates for changing your _perspective_ on your productivity: In other words, don’t expect more from yourself than you can reasonably accomplish in a set amount of time. There are other time management approaches out there, though, that aim to _increase_ productivity: in other words, do more with the time you have.
> 
> For example, Stephen Covey’s _First Things First_ focuses on improving how you spend your time rather than increasing the amount of work you accomplish. One way he proposes that you do that is by distinguishing between tasks that are important—necessary to the achievement of personal goals—and tasks that are urgent—requiring your immediate attention but not necessarily related to your goals. Then, work to prioritize tasks that are _important_ over _urgent_ , so you are more often pursuing the meaningful goals in your life.

#### Learn to Let Go

**Another way to curb perfectionism is to exercise your “release” muscle** , says Gilbert. When you find yourself tweaking to get something to be “just right,” stop yourself and leave minor imperfections as they are.

(Shortform note: Gilbert advises learning to let go and stop fixing mistakes but doesn’t propose ways to practice this skill. One way you might consider strengthening your “let go” muscle is through improvisational (improv) comedy. Improv encourages you to make bold choices on the fly. Once you’ve made a choice, you’re forced to deal spontaneously with the outcome however you can.)

#### Take Pride in Finishing

**Take pride in the completion of a project rather than in its attainment of some ideal to curb perfectionism** , recommends Gilbert. Many creators do not complete projects, and finishing is an achievement in itself.

(Shortform note: Gilbert proposes that you learn to take pride in finishing a project, even if it’s not perfect. In _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brené Brown presents the same argument but using shame, rather than pride, as her starting point. Brown proposes you develop shame resilience, the ability to normalize and accept shame, in your creative and life pursuits. When you finish a project that doesn’t fully live up to your standards, shame resilience, like pride, lets you move on with a minimal amount of negative feeling.)

#### Don’t Fear Feedback

Gilbert emphasizes that **nothing bad will happen if you release something imperfect**. Most of the time, others are too caught up in their own work and lives to pay much attention to your creative output. If they _do_ pay attention, it will be fleeting.

(Shortform note: The rise of the internet in some ways complicates Gilbert’s belief that no one will care (for long) if you release something imperfect. In 2011, thirteen-year-old Rebecca Black’s music video “Friday” became a viral sensation, viciously mocked all across the internet for its imperfect imitation of the music video style of the time. The video is still referenced in pop culture today. It’s unlikely that most creative projects could provoke Friday-level ire, but it’s still worth thinking long and hard about releasing creative work on the internet.)

#### Take Joy in Moving On

Gilbert finally urges you to **take joy in the abundant ideas floating around the universe and the prospect of encountering and starting something new**. A creative life is one in which you create many things. Perfectionism prevents you from doing this by gluing your attention to the same project.

(Shortform note: Tunnel vision is a psychological phenomenon that can prevent you from moving on to a new project in the way Gilbert describes. It’s a stubborn focus on one task or project that prevents us from taking in new information, and it’s based on existential fear: We cling to projects because we fear what will happen to us if they don’t end up perfect. One way to combat tunnel vision is by writing down your overarching goal in a place you’ll look at often (for instance: “Submit short film to competition”). This is a constant reminder to re-focus on the big picture, rather than getting stuck on details.)

### Do Something Else for a Bit

The final mental obstacle to creativity Gilbert mentions is the feeling of being stymied or uninspired. When you find yourself struggling to progress for any reason, **find a different creative pursuit to engage with temporarily.** This pursuit should be in a different medium than your original pursuit, says Gilbert. By engaging in a creative activity you have no prior investment in, and in which you don’t care if you do well or not, you often become able to re-access your creative playfulness. That playfulness can then find its way into your original project, unblocking you.

For instance, if you’re struggling to finish your work of historical nonfiction, you might take up learning the harmonica. Because you’ve never thought about the harmonica before or been able to establish any goals or feelings around harmonica-playing, it won’t matter to you if you play well or not. Once you’ve achieved a carefree attitude toward the harmonica, you can take that attitude back to your work of nonfiction.

> **An Argument for Doing Nothing**
> 
> Gilbert says that if you’re experiencing difficulties in your main creative pursuit, you should switch to a different one for a while and not just sit idle. It’s possible, though, that doing nothing at all, rather than doing something new, can help you regain your creativity more effectively. Studies have shown that “idle” activities, like daydreaming, can actually promote creativity. Letting your thoughts roam, rather than focusing them on a task, also enhances your problem-solving abilities, meaning you may be more likely, not less, to overcome an obstacle in your creative work.
> 
> Idleness also helps when you feel burned out on a creative project. Doing nothing lets you replenish your energy and regain a measure of productivity and momentum to bring to your creative pursuit.
