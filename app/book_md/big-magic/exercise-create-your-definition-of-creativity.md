## Exercise: Create Your Definition of Creativity

Define creativity for yourself.

* * *

Ignoring Gilbert’s definition of creative work for the moment, how would you define creativity? What in your life do you consider to be a creative pursuit? Explain your answer.

Do you agree with all of or parts of Gilbert’s definitions of creativity, Creative Sorcery, ideas, and genius? If so, describe what resonates for you and why. If not, how would you frame or describe these processes differently?

Think of a current hobby that you don’t consider to be “creative.” Keeping in mind Gilbert’s definition of creativity (the search for and excavation of universe-endowed gifts that are within us), how might you reframe this activity as being a creative endeavor? (For instance, you might now consider your hobby of fixing old trucks as creative as it allows you to use your gift for mechanics.)

Going forward, what new creative activity might you choose to pick up and why? (Remember that in Gilbert’s view, _anything_ can be creative.)
