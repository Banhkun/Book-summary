## Chapter 6: Maintaining Your Creative Momentum

In the last chapter, we discussed how to deal with the challenges you’ll run into during the creative process. In this chapter, we’ll switch to a long-term perspective on creativity. Gilbert believes creativity is not a one-off project or pursuit only for the young. It is, rather, a lifestyle and mode of being you should maintain throughout your lifetime. Here, we’ll discuss Gilbert’s suggestions on how to upkeep your creativity over your life.

We’ll first cover your relationship to your genius and how to work with or without it over the long term. We’ll then move on to more practical suggestions on maintaining your creative practice. We’ll end the chapter with advice on how to find inspiration when it doesn’t visit you for an extended period.

### View Your Genius as a Separate Entity

In Chapter 1, we defined your genius as an entity that exists outside of you which occasionally graces you with visits. Gilbert says **this perspective helps you to hang on to your creative freedom over the long term by reducing personal responsibility for brilliance.**

If, says Gilbert, you see yourself as singularly responsible for your work, when you produce something bad, you’ll feel the weight of that failure rests solely on your shoulders. You’ll frame this as a personal shortcoming, and this may stymie you or put you off creative work altogether.

Conversely, writes Gilbert, if something you make is exceptional, and you’re hailed as a “genius,” you’ll be burdened by the need to uphold that title. You’ll feel pressure to forever produce groundbreaking work, which is simply not possible for any human. This pressure may become so great that you never create again.

Instead of taking either above route, if you see yourself as simply “working with what you have,” says Gilbert, you’ll be able to distance yourself from sub-par work and frame it merely as something completed without your genius. This will allow you to engage with a new project with less self-reproach and anguish.

> **Does “Genius” Even Exist?**
> 
> Gilbert stresses the importance of seeing your genius as something outside of yourself, rather than as an identity you inhabit, to avoid anguish around your work. Meanwhile, others question whether you need to acknowledge the existence of a genius at all.
> 
> Kevin Ashton, a noted technologist who coined the phrase “internet of things,” argues in his book _How to Fly a Horse: The Secret History of Creation, Invention and Discovery_ that genius is nothing more than hard work combined with trial and error. Ashton draws on his own lived experience to come to this conclusion: He worked for several years for MIT and realized that the great intellects studying and researching there were simply using normal patterns of thought and discovery to lead them to big breakthroughs.
> 
> Renouncing the concept of the genius may help you cope with the mental hurdles around success and failure which Gilbert mentions: When you succeed, you won’t feel the pressure to repeat that success, as you know it may not be humanly possible to do so—you’re no genius, after all. Similarly, if you fail, you won’t feel as badly, as you know you’re only human and not capable of succeeding all the time.

#### Always Work Hard, Genius or No

**Whether or not your genius is around, says Gilbert, always work hard on your idea**. Not only is your genius an entity with its own will, but it’s also not very reliable. It can provide you with hours of fruitful, fulfilling inspiration, or it can remain at a distance for years.

If you wait until your genius strikes before getting serious, an idea may lose patience and leave you, claims Gilbert.**** It’s better to develop a disciplined practice and independent motivation to work and let genius come when it wants.

> **Substituting Help From Your Genius with Good Habits**
> 
> Gilbert describes the importance of putting in the creative work even when your genius doesn’t show up to help you. But this can be hard to do: It can feel like a slog to work without creative inspiration, which is what the genius allegedly provides.
> 
> One way to make it easier to invest that creative time when you don’t feel particularly inspired is by establishing strong creative habits. In _Atomic Habits,_ James Clear writes that when you put in place extremely specific habits, you remove the need for outside inspiration or an internal feeling of motivation.
> 
> You might consider putting in place a specific creative habit like “work on my canoe for forty-five minutes every morning starting at seven. Then, reward myself with a cup of coffee.” This way, you don’t have to think about working on the canoe or even feel like working on the canoe to do so; the habit makes you do it automatically. Genius can join you if it wants, but it’s not needed.

### Don’t Set Time Limits

To create in the long run, Gilbert says you must also **abandon the notion that there are time constraints on your creativity**. You and only you decide when you’re ready to start and stop being creative. Believing that you can become “too old” for creativity can rob you of years of happy and fruitful work.

(Shortform note: Others agree with Gilbert’s claim that you are never too old to start creating and add that there are negative repercussions of this societally-held belief: For instance, there is too much pressure on young people to be prolific creators and too much pressure on older people to stay out of the creative game entirely. You can fight this unhelpful conviction by being aware of when you tell yourself you’re too old or too young to do something. Whenever you say this, stop yourself and correct the thought to: “I can do whatever I want in whatever time frame suits me.”)

### Hunt for Your Creative Time

Another way to stay creative indefinitely is to **be willing to hunt for creative time** , says Gilbert**.** Throughout history, creators have never had enough time to be creative. To cope with this dearth of resources, Gilbert advises thinking outside the box about when you can squeeze in an hour or half-hour for your work. You can accomplish a lot in “between times:” during lunch, before bed, on your commute.

(Shortform note: Gilbert’s advice to hunt for snippets of creative time isn’t the only approach out there to effective time management. In _The 5 AM Club_ Robin Sharma proposes an alternative approach to maximizing your potential each day: Sharma suggests you firmly claim the hour between 5 a.m. and 6 a.m. for yourself. This is what he calls the “Victory Hour,” a time before others have risen and when your responsibilities have not yet come crashing down on you. Sharma suggests specific activities to do in your Victory Hour (exercise, reflect, and grow), but you could seize the Victory Hour for your creative work.)

### Be Disciplined

To keep up a productive creative practice long-term, **be disciplined** , insists Gilbert. According to Gilbert, a disciplined practice means you**** try hard at all times, but don’t take your work so seriously that you lose the joy in it. This is the only part of the creative process you have full control over: your commitment to your practice and the efficiency of your efforts.

(Shortform note: Gilbert advises working on your discipline, but _how_ do you become more disciplined? In _Deep Work_ , Cal Newport offers suggestions on how to develop focus and discipline in a world in which both are increasingly hard to come by. These include 1) focusing on what’s important and leaving what isn’t, 2) measuring your progress appropriately, and 3) creating accountability to yourself. Newport’s definition of deep work (work that is mentally strenuous, which you complete with concentration and without interruption) describes what most people feel disciplined creative work should look like, and his suggestions can therefore be applied to creative projects.)

### Have a Day Job

To ensure you can stick with your creative pursuit over the long run, Gilbert says**you should secure a reliable, non-creative source of income.** Adjust your life so all your necessities—bills, rent, food, healthcare, childcare, and so on—are taken care of by some other job. This will keep your mind creatively free. Gilbert herself held on to her day job until she published _Eat Pray Love_ , which was her fourth book.

(Shortform note: Gilbert strongly recommends that creators get a day job that pays their bills. But the advice to “just get a job” can seem a little out-of-touch with current job market realities. Finding a decently-paying, stable day job that leaves you time to create is becoming harder and harder. Part of the reason for this is that the skills needed for a given position change quickly because of new software and technology adoption, and candidates struggle to keep up. What’s more, companies rely heavily on software for their hiring, meaning many potentially qualified candidates are being eliminated without their resumes ever being seen by a human.)

### Be Inquisitive About Everything

To stay creative over months and years, Gilbert also advocates a **policy of gentle inquisitiveness about everything**. This lets you contact Creative Sorcery and reignite your creative flame at times when your inspiration inevitably falters.

As stated in Chapter 2, Creative Sorcery is at all times leaving clues to assist you in your creative work. Gilbert believes that when you adopt a policy of inquisitiveness, you’re more likely to notice and follow these clues. When followed, they can eventually lead you to a new creative pursuit.

> **How Inquisitiveness Fuels Creativity**
> 
> Gilbert argues that by being inquisitive, you notice more clues Creative Sorcery leaves you. But you could also view this phenomenon from a rational standpoint. If you’re inquisitive—in other words, pay attention to the world around you—you’re more likely to notice interesting things that can inspire you. Paying attention also leads to improved memory function, meaning you remember details that can come into play in your creative work. Furthermore, you build your capacity for patience when you pay attention, which in turn fosters contemplativeness, an attitude that’s helpful in creative work.
> 
> Therefore, Creative Sorcery doesn’t have to be seen as a _guide_ that _leads_ you to inspiration. Just by noticing, you can inspire yourself.

#### Inquisitiveness Can Be Subtle

Your inquisitiveness needn’t be overwhelmingly strong, writes Gilbert. Even a subtle interest or curiosity in something can, in small steps, lead you to an exciting new endeavor. In fact, Gilbert stresses that “subtle inquisitiveness” is a better approach than the similar-seeming advice to “pursue your passion.” Passion implies there must be a deep-seated, burning desire to do something. Subtle inquisitiveness, meanwhile, allows for mild interest.

> **Be Gently Inquisitive, Not Passionate**
> 
> Gilbert advocates for a policy of being subtly inquisitive, rather than seeking a burning passion. The book _Designing Your Life_ takes a similar stance: Authors Bill Burnett and Dave Evans argue that searching for a burning passion is the wrong approach to life. Instead of looking for your single passion that will allow all the pieces of your life to come together, adjust the pieces of your life so that you can feel passionate about it.
> 
> Being curious is one mental attitude that helps you make those necessary shifts to your life and generate passion. Both Gilbert and Burnett and Evans thus see inquisitiveness as the starting point for a good life and creative practice: Passion grows from inquisitiveness, not the other way around.

##### An Example of Gentle Inquisitiveness

At a movie theater, you might notice a poster for a new film by your favorite director. You look up the film and discover it takes place during the Vietnam War. You remember that your neighbor is a Vietnam War veteran and decide to bring this up to him. He’s happy for the chance to talk about his experience and shows you his collection of photos and letters from the time.

You love your neighbor’s old photos and visit your library to digitize them. It just so happens that the local history society meets at your library and its members ask you to digitize their photos, too. In this way, you have just started an online photo album, documenting your town and its inhabitants during the 20th century. Creative Sorcery has left you small clues—the poster, the connection to your neighbor, the local history society—that lead you to a creative project you are excited about.

### Frame Failure as “Interesting”

As a long-term creator, writes Gilbert, **learn how to reframe all your work, and in particular your creative misses, as “interesting.”** All creative output, no matter how beloved or reviled, can be seen through a certain lens as “interesting” and educative.

Gilbert notes that a mindset that frames everything as “interesting” encourages you to wonder what can be improved. A “good vs. bad” mindset, conversely, doesn’t encourage growth. It instead encourages giving up if you produce “bad” work.

> **Cult Films: The Ultimate “Interesting” Creative Work**
> 
> Gilbert stresses the importance of framing your work as “interesting,” rather than as “good” or “bad.” For examples of this reframing in our culture, we can look to cult films. Cult films often were not well received initially but garnered a following in subsequent years because there is something in them that piques audiences’ interest. _Plan 9 From Outer Space _and _The Rocky Horror Picture Show _are iconic examples of such films: _The Rocky Horror Picture Show_ in particular piqued the interest of LGBT communities at a time when gay rights were becoming an important political and cultural topic.
> 
> Seeing all creative work as “interesting” rather than “good” or “bad” thus is not an impossibly high-minded perspective to take. It’s a view we as a society take all the time toward the creations of others.

### Make Yourself Appealing to Inspiration

Gilbert suggests making it easier to stick with your creative work long-term by inviting more visits from Creative Sorcery. You can do this by physically making yourself more appealing: **Dress up as if you were going on a date with inspiration.** Put on clothes that make you feel good, style your hair, and use a scent you like. When you take yourself seriously as a creator by presenting yourself well, ideas and your genius are more likely to see you as committed to your work and to visit, claims Gilbert.

> **The Effect of Clothing on Self-Image**
> 
> The concept of “enclothed cognition” is similar to Gilbert’s idea that the clothes we wear change how inspired we are. This theory describes the impact one’s clothes have on one’s self-perception. For instance, wearing a suit may make you feel more professional and competent, while wearing wrinkly sweatpants may make you feel lazy and unmotivated.
> 
> Enclothed cognition theory also indicates that it's not only what we wear, but how we perceive what we wear that affects how our minds work and how we see ourselves. In the 2012 study which introduced the term enclothed cognition, students were recruited to wear white lab coats. In one group, the lab coats were described as “a medical doctor’s coat,” and in the other group, the coats were described as an “artistic painter’s coat.” Students wearing the “medical doctor’s coats” were more able to sustain their attention than those wearing the “artistic painter’s coats.” The lab coats alone, therefore, did not impact attention: It was rather the value that students assigned to the lab coats that made them more or less able to sustain their focus.

### Don’t Expect a Reward, But Look Forward to Moments of Creative Sorcery

We established in Chapter 3 that you shouldn’t be creative to receive a reward. While this remains true, **there is one form of reward Gilbert says you can look forward to as you create long term: touching Creative Sorcery.**

You can’t predict when Creative Sorcery will visit, adds Gilbert, so just keep plugging away at your creative work. But know that when it does come, you’ll get to experience a transcendent feeling of communion with a higher life force. This, not accolades or praise, is what makes creativity worthwhile, she claims.

> **Altruistic Reasons to Create**
> 
> Gilbert believes that coming into contact with the otherworldly forces of Creative Sorcery should be the only reason to create. Other creators might see a different “ultimate purpose” to creativity than this. For example, graphic novelist R. Alan Brooks talks about how he left his job and dedicated himself full-time to making comic books because he felt that his art could help people around the world cope with global turmoil. Helping others, to him, was the central reason to create.
> 
> This may, of course, be seen as its own form of sorcery: Rather than touching the forces of creativity, you are touching the forces of altruism and humanitarian joy through your work. Therefore, no matter what a creator might state as their purpose or motivation, it’s likely that all creators believe in and strive for contact with a transcendent force to some degree.

### Welcome Creative Sorcery by Praising the Process

When Creative Sorcery keeps at bay, as it may in the long term, it might be because you’re expressing negativity about it, writes Gilbert. **If you complain a lot about the creative process, stop**. Complaining frightens away ideas and your genius, which see in you a being that’s not open to inspiration.

Instead, suggests Gilbert, proclaim to yourself and others that you love creating, that you love the creative lifestyle, and that you’ll carry on creating simply because you enjoy it. Saying this invites the forces of Creative Sorcery to visit more often. They’ll sense your receptivity and grace you with their presence.

(Shortform note: Gilbert’s line of thinking here has a lot in common with Rhonda Byrne’s _The Secret_ , in which Byrne presents the Law of Attraction: the idea that you can use your thoughts to attract the things you want into your life. For Byrne, getting what you want takes place in three steps: 1. Ask for what you want. 2. Believe you will get what you want. 3. Receive and feel the happiness you will feel when you will get what you want. While Gilbert’s approach to creativity veers significantly from the three steps described above, she does suggest that by saying, and thinking, and believing that you love creating, you will attract into your life the things that help you create: ideas and your genius.)
