## Chapter 1: Definitions of Creativity, Creative Sorcery, Ideas, and Genius

In _Big Magic_ , Elizabeth Gilbert explores what it means to live a creative life and the benefits of a creative existence. In this guide, we’ll discuss Gilbert’s ideas on:

  * Defining creativity and associated terms
  * Building a good relationship with the mystical forces of creativity
  * Beginning a creative journey
  * Handling your first creative idea
  * Coping with creative challenges
  * Maintaining your creative momentum over the long term
  * Keeping up your faith in the forces of creativity over the long term



In this chapter, we’ll introduce Gilbert’s key terminology and unique definitions surrounding creativity, which we’ll use throughout the guide. We’ll first describe Gilbert’s vision of creativity, then introduce the concept of Creative Sorcery, the cosmic force that can visit you when you are creating. We’ll end by discussing two key ways Creative Sorcery might come to you: via ideas and through your genius.

### What Is Creativity?

Gilbert defines a creative life as **the search for and excavation of universe-endowed gifts that are within us, hidden from our view.** Our gifts are the talents, interests, and desires that make us _us._ You can have a gift for anything—stargazing, website design, or mushroom hunting, for instance—not just a traditionally artistic pursuit, like painting, writing, or performing.

In practice, Gilbert’s idea of searching for a gift and becoming creative might look something like this: All your life, you’ve felt that you get along well with animals. You’re not sure why, but it seems as though you can understand them better than other people can. Finally, after years of feeling this way, you decide to test out your hunch by volunteering at your local animal shelter. To your delight, you find that the shelter animals do indeed respond well to you. You are great at training them, playing with them, and bonding with them. Injured or abused animals grow healthier under your care. You have just excavated a creative gift that has always lived inside you, but which you never before searched for.

Notice that Gilbert does not define creativity as a professional pursuit or even as the main goal or mission of one’s life. It’s simply a commitment to exploring your depths and bringing to light the powers that exist within you.

> **Other Definitions of Creativity**
> 
> Gilbert’s conception of creativity for this book is unique, perhaps because seasoned creators develop idiosyncratic definitions of this concept. If Gilbert’s definition doesn’t fully resonate with you, fellow writer Amy Tan has her own definition, which she presented in a popular TED Talk. Tan feels her creativity is the product of her upbringing, the big questions that preoccupy and interest her, and her quest to derive meaning from the world.
> 
> Steve Jobs’s definition of creativity was different still: He said that creativity was just a matter of forming novel connections. For Jobs, magic and mysticism figured far less into creativity than for Tan and Gilbert.
> 
> Finally, Jazz musician Charles Mingus defined creativity similarly to Jobs in that he didn’t romanticize the creative process. Mingus felt that creativity was found in striving for simplicity, not uniqueness or newness. Being able to execute something simply and elegantly was, for him, the truest expression of creativity.
> 
> As a creator, you may wish to come up with a definition of creativity that most resonates in your life.

### A Creative Life Gives You Access to Creative Sorcery

According to Gilbert, the central reason to develop your creativity is to come in touch with what she calls “Big Magic,” or, as we’ll call it moving forward, **Creative Sorcery. In Gilbert’s view, Creative Sorcery is a mystical or spiritual force of creativity.** This force is bigger than us and cannot be explained scientifically or proven empirically. It is an eternal cosmic entity that creatives must have faith in.

For Gilbert, coming into contact with Creative Sorcery is a transcendent experience. Touching Creative Sorcery lets you be moved by and interact with something greater than yourself. This communion with a higher creative energy constitutes the chief goal of Gilbert’s life.

> **Other Forms of Spiritual Enlightenment**
> 
> Gilbert’s vision of touching Creative Sorcery has a lot in common with the search for spiritual enlightenment which humans all around the world and in all faith traditions seek out, either to stimulate creativity or to experience more general spiritual relief. Sufi Muslims, for example, perform a whirling dance to escape the confines of their egos, commune with God, and become spiritually perfect.
> 
> Outside of faith, some use mind-altering drugs to come into contact with something bigger than themselves and even to enhance their creativity. Research has shown that psychoactive substances don’t activate creativity but do make drug-takers more sensitive and open to stimuli, which can indirectly lead to greater creativity.

#### Creative Sorcery Communicates Through Ideas

Gilbert states that Creative Sorcery is trying at all times to contact humans to help them bring their creativity into the world. **One way Creative Sorcery communicates with humans is through ideas**. Gilbert envisions ideas as living entities, capable of self-sustained activity. Ideas move around space, seeking humans who will take them on and give them life.

According to Gilbert, humans do not give rise to ideas: Ideas exist independently of us. This means that ideas are free to come and go as they please. You may find yourself visited by an idea and then deserted by it.

> **The Neurological Explanation for Ideas**
> 
> Gilbert’s description of what ideas are and how they operate comes from a magical perspective. Science, meanwhile, has a different explanation.
> 
> According to researchers at the University of Haifa, creative ideas come into existence when two separate and possibly opposing brain networks are activated. These networks are the “associative” region and the “conservative” region. The associative region seems to be linked to originality, while the conservative region may be associated with adhering to social norms and rules. Thus, it seems that when both originality and an awareness of social regulations come together, the best ideas are produced.
> 
> This neurological explanation for ideation is at odds with Gilbert’s belief that humans don’t give rise to ideas and that they “visit” us; instead, it seems they’re formed, and stay, within us.

##### **Receiving Ideas**

Most of us are typically too preoccupied, unhappy, or stressed out to be open to receiving an idea, writes Gilbert. But when you’re relaxed enough, ideas can slip into your psyche. The experience of receiving an idea is a pleasant, physical one, akin to falling in love or beholding a natural wonder, and the idea will occupy your thoughts until you choose to act on it or not.

(Shortform note: As Gilbert suggests, there appears to be a negative correlation between stress and creativity. Studies have shown that stress renders you less cognitively flexible and able to use your working memory (which the brain draws on during the creative process). In addition, Gilbert’s assertion that receiving an idea feels good is also backed up by science: Dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of pleasure, is required to be creative. The more dopamine is released, the greater our creativity.)

Ideas sometimes even visit two people at once to be sure they are taken on by a host, claims Gilbert. This explains the phenomenon of multiple discoveries, when two independently operating scientists, entrepreneurs, or companies make the same discovery at the same time. In such cases, the idea, says Gilbert, is trying to increase its chances of being taken up.

> **The Science of Multiple Discoveries**
> 
> While Gilbert claims that sentient ideas visiting multiple people are responsible for multiple discoveries, there is also a scientific explanation for this phenomenon, in which creators—in this context, usually inventors—make the same breakthrough simultaneously.
> 
> Inventors don’t create in a vacuum: They instead draw upon an existing body of research, adding small breakthroughs of their own that other inventors can then draw upon. Thomas Edison, for instance, didn’t outright invent the light bulb. Instead, he incorporated a new filament that worked better than the material used by other inventors working on the light bulb. Because inventors work incrementally, using the same existing body of knowledge, they often make final critical discoveries at the same time.
> 
> While this explanation is scientific, it, like Gilbert’s vision of sentient ideas that come to humans, shifts responsibility for full ideation away from the individual. It shows that individuals don’t come up with brilliant ideas on their own—they only come up with the final _piece_ of an idea on their own.

#### Creative Sorcery Communicates Through Your Genius

For Gilbert, your genius is another manifestation of Creative Sorcery: It’s **an external creative spirit that can help you as you work.** Gilbert draws on the Roman and Greek conception of genius to craft this definition. For ancient thinkers, a genius was a creative imp or “daemon” that resided in your house. That imp would sometimes appear to assist you in your pursuits.

Gilbert emphasizes that your genius is not a part of you. It is, rather, an outside entity that sometimes visits you. In this regard, a genius is similar to ideas. Yet, while there are many ideas floating around the universe, you only have one genius.

> **Drawing on Ancient Conceptions of “Genius”**
> 
> The personal, singular, visiting “daemon” of genius to which Gilbert refers here has classically been called a eudaemon. Both Gilbert’s genius and the Ancient Greeks’ eudaemon promote personal improvement. What’s more, just as Gilbert argues we each only have one genius, in the ancient world people believed that children were assigned a single, personal daemon at birth, which represented their best possible selves.
> 
> Yet Gilbert’s genius differs from the eudaemon in subtle ways. While Gilbert’s conception of the genius helps you be a stronger _creative_ specifically, the eudaemon helps you be a better person in general. Additionally, unlike Gilbert’s genius, which appears whenever it wants, the eudaemon appeared at opportune times to guide the person’s choices. Socrates, for instance, felt his eudaemon made itself known when he was making difficult decisions and dissuaded him from making the wrong choice.

##### Your Genius Aids Your Creative Process

Gilbert adds that**when your genius is helping, your creative process becomes more fluid**. You might be struggling to make progress on an idea and then suddenly realize you’ve just spent hours fully and blissfully immersed in your work—that was your genius lending a hand. But your genius is not going to be reliably present when you’re working on a project. It comes and goes as it pleases, claims Gilbert.

> **Genius and the Concept of Flow**
> 
> Gilbert’s visits from your genius that leave you absorbed in your work have a lot in common with Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s concept of _flow_ , outlined in his book of the same name. Flow is a state of concentrated, purpose-driven work that is enjoyable and immersive.
> 
> But unlike Gilbert, who says you have to wait for your genius to appear, Csikszentmihalyi proposes active ways to achieve a flow state. First, set a specific, appealing aim that you can get lost in and a way to measure progress toward it. Next, concentrate on working towards your aim, keeping an eye out for opportunities for new approaches and learning. Finally, keep challenging yourself to avoid complacency and boredom, which inhibit flow.
