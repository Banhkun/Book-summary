## Chapter 2: U—Unexpected

The “U” in the SUCCESs formula for creating “sticky” messages stands for “unexpected.”

The first challenge of communication is getting people’s attention. Some people—for instance, parents or the president—get attention simply because they have authority. However, most people have to attract attention in some other way.

The best way to do it is to break a pattern: introduce the unexpected. **Sameness makes people tune out. They become aware of things only when something changes** —for instance, you snap to attention when your car or refrigerator starts making a strange noise. Your brain is engineered to be acutely aware of changes.

Here’s an example of how breaking a pattern got people’s attention. On every flight, flight attendants are required to give safety instructions, but they’ve become so routine that no one listens to them. However, one flight attendant got people’s attention by saying things they didn’t expect. For instance, during the seemingly obvious instructions for how to fasten and unfasten a seatbelt, she said: “For those who haven’t been in a car since 1965, the proper way to fasten a seatbelt is to slide the flat end into the buckle.” Regarding the exits, she said: “As the song goes, there might be fifty ways to leave your lover, but there are only six ways to leave this aircraft.” Passengers applauded her routine when she finished.

Her spiel did **two things a message must do in order to stick: 1) get people’s attention: create surprise and 2) hold their attention: generate interest.** She created surprise with her first unconventional remark, then maintained interest as she made additional jokes, which made people wonder what might come next.

### Get Their Attention

Some ideas are naturally sticky because they present surprising facts. For instance, the Great Wall of China is the only man-made structure you can see from space. Or, you only use 10 percent of your brain capacity. (Both of these statements are false.)

When you surprise people, you nullify their ability to guess what’s coming next, or as the authors call it, “break their guessing machines.” **When we realize we’ve guessed wrong (our schemas have failed), we snap to attention, which is a built-in biological response to prevent us from getting something wrong in the future**. Our eyebrows go up, our eyes widen, and muscles tense as we stop everything in order to process where we went wrong.

An advertisement by the Ad Council triggered this response. The ad for a new minivan shows a father picking up his son after soccer practice and driving along attractive, tree-lined streets while the narrator describes the van’s features. The dad stops at an intersection, the camera cuts to the boy, who’s looking out the window, then the father pulls forward. Suddenly, the van is broadsided by another vehicle. The screen goes black and these words appear: “Didn’t see that coming? No one ever does. Buckle up—always.”

The ad surprises by defying people’s schema for minivan commercials (minivans deliver kids safely). Viewers are more likely to think about checking seatbelts before the next trip. Surprise makes us stop and think.

Surprise usually is short-lived. However, there are a few instances where surprising ideas generate ongoing attention—for example, conspiracy theories and gossip—where we want to know more or figure out what’s going on. Because of the surprise factor, conspiracy theories tend to crop up when a celebrity dies young, like JFK or Kurt Cobain, and people are trying to get their minds around it. In contrast, old people’s deaths typically don’t generate conspiracy theories.

#### Avoid Gimmicks

**A pitfall to avoid when using surprise to draw attention to your message is the gimmicky surprise**. Attention-getting gimmicks are typically not relevant to the core message and leave your listeners feeling puzzled or cheated.

For instance, a Super Bowl 2000 ad for a dot-com fell flat when it grabbed attention through surprise, but viewers couldn’t figure out the message. It showed a college marching band performing at a football game, when suddenly a pack of wolves ran out of the tunnel and attacked the musicians. (Shortform note: here’s a video of the ad.)

To be effective in making your message stick, surprises must make sense in retrospect—when the listener thinks back, he or she must instantly see the logic connecting the surprise with a core message. To put it another way, if you disrupt your listener’s guessing ability, you have to fix it by showing how the surprise makes sense.

In summary, to use surprise to get attention:

  * Determine the core of your message.
  * Think of an unexpected implication of your message, or an aspect that violates common sense.
  * Use the unexpected element to defy your listeners’ schema or ability to guess.
  * Help them adjust their schema by showing them how the surprise actually makes sense.



#### Create New Schemas

Here are two examples of using surprise to upend old schemas while also replacing them with new, unforgettable schemas.

**1) Nordstrom department store** : Nordstrom’s mantra is extraordinary customer service. The company conveys to new employees just what that means through stories that replace old schemas with striking examples of how “Nordies” do it differently by, for example, ironing a just-purchased shirt so the buyer could wear it to an immediate presentation; refunding a customer for returned tire chains even though Nordstrom doesn’t sell tire chains; gift-wrapping items a customer bought at Macy’s.

These surprising stories replace employees’ past ideas of common-sense, efficiency-driven customer service with Nordstrom’s version of uncommon sense: going the extra mile no matter how absurd it may seem. The surprise element in the stories underscores the company’s core message.

**2) Journalism lesson** : Writer Nora Ephron recounted a lesson from a journalism teacher that “reset” her idea of the purpose of journalism. The teacher assigned students to write a lead based on a set of facts. The entire faculty of Beverly Hill High School would be attending a conference Thursday on new teaching methods. Speakers would include anthropologist Margaret Mead and California Governor Pat Brown. The students wrote leads focusing on the facts presented—for instance, “Governor Pat Brown and Margaret Mead will address the Beverly Hills High School faculty at a conference Thursday…”. However, after glancing through the students’ work, the teacher set it aside and revealed the correct lead: “There will be no school Thursday.”

Ephron replaced her old idea of journalism (simply presenting the facts) with a new one: reporting the _meaning_ of the facts. In a single, surprising lesson, Ephron’s teacher transformed his students’ schema of journalism.

### Keep Their Attention

While surprise gets people’s attention and can even hold it for a short time, sometimes you need to keep people’s attention longer in order to convey a complex message. You do this by creating interest in two ways: 1) create a mystery or 2) generate curiosity.

#### Create a Mystery

**Mysteries sustain interest because people want closure.** When intrigued by a puzzle or question, they’ll follow a story to get to a conclusion without knowing exactly how they’ll get there. It can be a painless and memorable way of absorbing a complicated message.

For example, an Arizona State University professor was searching for ways to engage his students and found a scientific article that used mystery to pull in readers and hold their interest. It began by asking, “What are Saturn’s rings made of?” The writer then told a story of numerous theories and investigations that led nowhere, before he presented the surprising answer: dust.

The professor began using the mystery technique to present concepts in his classes. He introduced a mystery at the beginning of a lecture, but held off on revealing the answer until the end. In one instance, he ran out of time before the bell rang, but his students didn’t want to leave until he provided the answer.

Mysteries sustain attention by going beyond the first moment of surprise and leading listeners on a journey.

#### Generate Curiosity

You can also hold people’s interest by making them curious. According to **the “gap theory” of interest, our curiosity is aroused when we encounter a gap in our knowledge**. Wanting to know something causes a sort of pain and to relieve it, we need to fill the gap in our knowledge. For example, we’ll sit through a bad movie because not knowing the end would be painful.

Movies make us want to know what’s going to happen. Similarly, mystery novels raise the question of who did it. We watch sports to find out who will win.

To craft a message that holds attention, before telling people the facts, **you need to create or exploit a knowledge gap by suggesting there’s something important that they don’t know**. Ways to do this include:

  * Pointing to some knowledge people are missing.
  * Presenting a puzzle or asking a question they don’t know the answer to.
  * Asserting that someone else knows something they don’t.
  * Getting listeners to predict an outcome.



Local news programs highlight a knowledge gap by teasing upcoming news stories: “Find out which local restaurant was cited for not cleaning the silverware.” (Shortform note: Other examples today are Facebook’s “clickbait” headlines like “Shutdown of nuke plant has a surprising stinging consequence” and the chyrons on cable news like “The most dangerous celebrity online is revealed”.)

A listener’s overconfidence can be an obstacle to your efforts to create a knowledge gap. Research shows that people tend to overestimate how much they know. There are several ways to counter this:

1) Make people commit to a flawed schema, then shoot it down, as Nora Ephron’s journalism professor did.

2) Make listeners publicly commit to a prediction, for instance by asking for a show of hands. Sometimes this deters overconfidence because people don’t want to be proven wrong publicly.

Some topics or formats naturally create knowledge gaps. For instance, human interest stories make us want to know how someone feels, while gossip fills in what we want to know about celebrities’ lives.

##### Priming the Gap

If people don’t know much about a topic to begin with, you have to provide enough information to spark their curiosity or desire to know. In the 1960s, when ABC got a license to broadcast NCAA football games, a young executive named Roone Arledge came up with a way to interest viewers in games that didn’t involve their favorite teams. His strategy was to place the viewer at the game by focusing not just on the action on the field, but also on the fans, hoopla, campus, and the surrounding area. In addition, he suggested having sports announcers explain the emotions and past history affecting a game. The plan worked—the network made viewers care by providing context, then created further interest with knowledge gaps.

##### Creating Long-Term Interest

When you’re a visionary, highlighting a huge knowledge gap or “mission impossible” can inspire scientists, inventors, and the public imagination. Here are two examples.

**A pocket radio** : Soon after the invention of the transistor, Sony technologist Masaru Ibuka wanted to explore applications for the new technology, but needed to come up with a way to hook the interest of his scientists and engineers. So, in the era when radios were so big they were incorporated into furniture, he came up with the idea of a pocket radio. It was an attention-getting idea. The idea that a young company like Sony could pull it off was equally outlandish. But Ibuka’s engineers seized the challenge and the development and production of a pocket radio inspired years of effort and transformed Sony into a major company.

**Man on the Moon** : In 1961, while the Soviet Union led the world in space exploration, President John F. Kennedy made his bold proposal to send a man to the moon and return him safely to earth within 10 years. His unexpected idea mobilized the work of hundreds of people for years and caught the imagination of the nation.

Both the pocket radio and the moon mission were unexpected ideas that identified big knowledge gaps, and both ideas had huge staying power.
