## Exercise: Is It Credible?

Using an external authority to bolster your message is one way to make it believable or credible. Another way is to build internal credibility by using details, statistics, and compelling examples.

* * *

Think of an entertaining or surprising story you heard from a friend or coworker recently that you were skeptical of. What were the key points? Did you believe the story?

What specific elements of the story made you believe it or question it? For instance, did it cite a credible source or include convincing details? What were they?

What would have made the story more credible to you?
