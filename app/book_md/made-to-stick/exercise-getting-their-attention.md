## Exercise: Getting Their Attention

The best way to get people’s attention is to break a pattern or introduce the unexpected. Sameness makes people tune out. After getting their attention you have to hold it by generating curiosity.

* * *

Can you think of a time when you were surprised by a speaker or message—for instance, at a class lecture, Sunday sermon, or a company meeting? What caught your attention and why?

Think of an instance where you were trying to get a message across but people weren’t listening to you. Why do you think they weren’t paying attention?

How could you have introduced something unexpected into your message to get attention and then generate ongoing interest?
