## Introduction

In our overstimulated and distracted society, **great ideas and important messages often fail to gain traction, while bad ideas and falsehoods such as urban legends go viral** and seem to stick around forever.

_Made to Stick_ by brothers Chip and Dan Heath explores what makes some messages “stick” in the public’s consciousness while others go unheard or unremembered and explains how to create an idea that sticks. Chip is a professor at Stanford and Dan is senior fellow at Duke University. Based on a wide-ranging examination of psychology research, popular culture, and news headlines, they identify six criteria for shaping your message so it resonates.

**You don’t have to be a great speaker or be particularly creative to communicate effectively.** Rather than sweating over an original presentation, you can follow the book’s “stickiness” template or even emulate someone else’s idea that worked.

### Sticky Versus Nonsticky

Some ideas naturally grab you—they’re inherently interesting. Others don’t—they seem to be inherently boring. But in a version of the nature versus nurture argument, the authors contend that **most ideas and messages—even naturally less-than-thrilling ones – can be nurtured or designed for success**.

Here’s an example of a story with staying power. In a city near you, a traveling businessman has a drink with a woman in a bar and blacks out. He wakes up in a hotel bathtub full of ice. He spots a note at eye level that says, “Don’t move, call 911.” His cell phone is beside him and, in a panicked state, he calls. The operator asks him to carefully check to see if there’s a tube sticking out of his back. When he finds one, she tells him he’s been the victim of a kidney harvesting ring and she’s sending the paramedics.

This story is an urban legend with countless versions differing only in the “local” details, such as the city where the incident took place. It’s so “sticky” or memorable that it’s been around for decades —and if you waited an hour and then called a friend, you could easily repeat the story.

Contrast the kidney heist story with a message from a nonprofit organization that begins, “Comprehensive community-building lends itself to a return-on-investment rationale…”. Anyone would be hard-pressed to remember and repeat it after even a few seconds. Such communications are the norm in many workplaces. They can’t compete with the kidney heist story in interest, but could well be the type of message you’re tasked to deliver.

You’ll find plenty of advice for successful communication: Start with a joke. Tell the audience what you’re going to say, say it, then tell them what you told them. Or, make sure you understand your audience and tailor your message accordingly. But these tips don’t help you create and shape your message so that it sticks.

### Shaping Ideas

**We all have messages and ideas we need to deliver, but often struggle to get them across**. For instance:

  * Teachers must explain mitosis or introduce algebra so it’s understandable. 
  * Managers have to get employees to implement new company initiatives.
  * Directors of charities need to present their missions in a way that makes people care about them and donate. 
  * Political candidates want to communicate their policy ideas to voters.



With all of the messages, especially false ones, competing for people’s attention, getting necessary messages across is daunting. Yet even an idea less riveting than the kidney heist story can be designed in a way that makes it memorable.

For example, in 1992, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit group that educates the public on nutrition, analyzed the ingredients of movie theater popcorn. Its testing showed that a medium-sized serving of popcorn had 37 grams of saturated fat, compared to the USDA’s recommendation that people consume no more than 20 grams a day. At the time, movie popcorn typically was made with coconut oil, which had advantages over other oils but was also higher in saturated fat. CSPI’s challenge was to put the numbers into some kind of meaningful context and present them in a memorable way. They had to make the message—movie popcorn is very unhealthy—stick.

The organization called a press conference at which they displayed a medium serving of movie popcorn juxtaposed with three meals: a bacon-and-eggs breakfast, a Big Mac-and-fries lunch, and a complete steak dinner. The message: One serving of movie popcorn has more saturated fat than a full day's worth of high-fat meals. The story caught the attention of the major television networks and newspapers as well as late-night comedians. As a result, moviegoers shunned popcorn until the biggest theater chains announced they would stop using coconut oil.

CSPI had an important message to share, they came up with a way to communicate it so that people would hear and care about it, and the message resonated or stuck. They did it despite lacking a sensational topic, a multimillion-dollar budget, or a staff of professional marketers. You can craft equally effective messages.

### Defining Stickiness: Urban Legends

**Ideas or messages that stick are understandable, memorable, and have a lasting impact**. Here’s an example of a story that succeeds on all three levels: the Halloween candy tampering scare story.

Like the kidney heist story, it’s also false. But it’s indelibly changed how society functions. Poisoned candy rumors originated in the 1960s, followed later by stories about sick people putting sharp objects in apples at Halloween. Parents searched their kids’ candy, schools and fire departments offered safe Halloween events, and hospitals offered to X-ray kids’ treats. It even led to several state laws with penalties for candy tampering. But researchers in 1985 couldn’t find any instance, even going back to 1958, of a stranger causing life-threatening harm to a child by tampering with Halloween treats.

The story was understandable and memorable, so it had a lasting impact, even though it was false: it changed people’s behavior, even to today.

(Shortform note: The original candy tampering scare story was false, but it’s evolved into some real instances of tampering, although they remain rare. The greater danger to trick-or-treaters today is getting hit by a car.)

Other urban legends continue to get traction, although with less tangible impact than the Halloween tampering story. They include assertions that:

  * a fried rat was found in a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.
  * if you flash your headlights at another vehicle, you’ll be shot by a gang.
  * China’s Great Wall is the only man-made structure visible from space.



(Shortform note: The explosion of social media since 2007, when this book was published, continues to fuel the spread of hoaxes and false stories like the above. But it’s also provided easy ways to check a sticky story’s veracity, for those who make the effort to do so.)

### Common Traits of Sticky Ideas

The Halloween scare story and the movie popcorn message share key traits:

  * They warn of an unexpected risk in a common activity.
  * They create powerful, concrete images.
  * They strike an emotional chord.
  * They call for simple action: check the candy, don’t eat the movie popcorn.



The kidney heist story also has elements of the unexpected, has concrete images and details, and generates horror and other emotions. Other forms of **successful communication share these traits, which can be codified into six principles for making an idea stick. They spell the acronym SUCCESs** —Sticky ideas are Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, and tell Stories.

An idea doesn’t have to apply all of the principles to stick, nor does applying all of them guarantee stickiness. But they’re a useful guide, not only for shaping your ideas, but for spotting naturally sticky ideas you can use. Here’s an overview (a full chapter is devoted to further exploration of each principle).

#### Six Principles

1) **Simple** : To make a message or idea simple means distilling it to its central point or essence by cutting away nonessential information, like getting to the core of an apple. Making an idea simple isn’t enough—it must be both simple and meaningful. Proverbs are a good example, as is the Golden Rule, a sentence that you could spend your life putting into practice.

2) **Unexpected** : A sticky message surprises people by defying expectations. While surprise gets an audience’s attention, however, it doesn’t last. To hold attention, use the unexpected to also generate curiosity and interest.

3) **Concrete** : Ideas must be concrete in order to stick: think of apples with razor blades in them or a buffet of fatty food versus a single bag of popcorn. In contrast, many messages in business are ambiguous and no one interprets them the same way. The abstract must be made concrete so that it means the same thing to everyone, like the proverb, “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.”

4)**Credible** : To be credible, sticky ideas must have external credibility (an authoritative spokesperson or source) and internal credibility, which means they’re supported by details, data presented in an accessible way, a compelling example, or a way for the audience to verify the message (try before you buy). For example, instead of presenting statistics on the lagging economy in 1980, then-candidate Ronald Reagan suggested a self-test, “Before you vote, ask yourself if you’re better off today than you were four years ago.”

5) **Emotional** : To get an idea to stick, you need to get people to care about it. To make them care, you arouse emotions—you make them feel. The movie popcorn message generated disgust, while the Halloween candy tampering message generated fear. Nonprofit organizations seeking donations generate emotions by showing you people—here’s a starving child named Rokia—rather than presenting abstractions such as statistics. The trick is determining what emotion you want to generate.

6) **Stories** : Telling stories is the best way to make a message memorable and get people to act on it. Stories motivate people to act through inspiration. But more importantly, they tell people _how_ to act—stories are simulations in which listeners think through what they’d do in the same situation. They’re mental flight simulators. For instance, firefighters and medical personnel can learn how to respond to crises from the stories of colleagues.

### Expertise Gets in the Way

Anyone can apply these six principles to craft a sticky message—they’re mostly common sense—yet a majority of people produce opaque, mind-numbing prose instead. **The reason people don’t take simple steps to make their message compelling is that they’re blinded by a cognitive bias known as “the curse of knowledge.”** Instead of keeping their message simple and concrete, they lapse into abstractions because they wrongly assume their listeners have the same level of knowledge or expertise as they do.

In 1990, Stanford Ph.D. student Elizabeth Newton illustrated the curse of knowledge with a study in which she asked subjects to choose a simple tune, such as “Jingle Bells,” from a list and tap out the rhythm on a table. She assigned other people to try to figure out the tune being tapped.

Tappers were shocked to learn that listeners guessed the song correctly only 2.5 percent of the time. Because they were hearing the song in their heads as they tapped (knowledge the listener didn’t possess), they thought their tapping was making the song perfectly clear. Because they had the curse-of-knowledge bias, they couldn’t imagine the perspective of the listener who wasn’t “hearing” the same song. Once you know something, it’s hard to remember that others don’t. Teachers obviously have to overcome this mismatch in knowledge between speaker and listener, but everyone with a message faces it to some degree. For instance, a CEO must translate her company’s strategy of maximizing shareholder value into clear terms for employees. The way to do it is to **transform your message by using the six principles as a checklist.**

For example, President John F. Kennedy sidestepped the curse of knowledge in 1961 when he presented an unexpected goal in simple, concrete, credible terms: He wanted to land a man on the moon before the end of the decade. He could have said, “our mission is to become the international leader ... through maximum innovation…”. But he made his idea sticky and its impact was historic.

### Creative Messaging Isn’t Rocket Science

**You don’t need to be a creative genius to create a sticky message**. In 1999, researchers analyzed 200 award-winning advertisements and found that 89 percent of them fell into one of six categories or templates, most of which involved the principle of unexpectedness.

For example, one category was “extreme consequences.” This category included an ad for a powerful car stereo with the exaggerated ability to collapse a bridge with its vibrations. Another example is the World War II slogan and ad campaign, “Loose Lips Sink Ships.” (Shortform note: The point was to urge people to be careful not to say anything that a spy might be able to use.)

When researchers tried applying the six ad templates to 200 less-successful ads, they found that only 2 percent fit a template, which suggests that creative people use what works (templates), while less creative people reinvent the wheel.

The lesson is that **if you want your message to stick, emulate how successful people have done it** using the six SUCCESs principles.
