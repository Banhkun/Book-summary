## Exercise: Reflect on Your Heroic Origin Story

Now that you’ve read Sharma’s ideas about how to unlock and use your full potential, think about how you could start your journey to become an everyday hero. Remember that you don’t need to make a lot of changes all at once—small adjustments over time add up to big improvements.

* * *

Which of the four areas of empowerment (body, mind, heart, and environment) do you feel would be most beneficial for you to focus on right now? Why? (For example, if your home is always messy, then perhaps focusing on empowering your _environment_ would do you the most good right now.)

What’s one thing you could do _today_ to start empowering yourself in that area? (For example, if you want to empower your environment, you could take 15 minutes today to clean just one room in your home.)

Which of the five principles of everyday heroism (self-confidence, responsibility, resilience, purpose, or selflessness) would you most like to embody? Why? (For example, if you’re uncomfortable in social situations, then perhaps you’re feeling the need to embody _self-confidence._)

What’s one thing you could do today to start living up to that principle? (For example, if you want to build your self-confidence, you might pick one task or goal you’ve been putting off for fear that you’ll fail at it and start telling yourself that you _can_ do it).
