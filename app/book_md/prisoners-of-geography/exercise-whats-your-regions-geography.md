## Exercise: What’s Your Region’s Geography?

Marshall argues that a region’s geography shapes both its economy and politics. Learn to analyze the effects of geography on the place you live.

* * *

Consider the major geographic features of the region you live in. For example, your region might be flat or mountainous; it could be infertile desert, or it could be well-irrigated farmland. Whatever your region’s geography is, briefly describe it below.

What natural resources does your region produce, and what must it import? Below, briefly describe the relationship between your region’s geography and its economy. For example, if you live in an area with rich mineral deposits but little arable farmland, you might describe how your region’s wealth of minerals fuels its economy and brings in more than enough money for it to import the food it needs.

What are your nation’s relationships with other countries within the region and beyond? Below, briefly describe how the geography of your region has shaped your nation's politics. For example, if there are tense border disputes between nations in the region, competition for control of important trade routes and harbors, or any other form of geographical political conflict, briefly describe that conflict below.
