## 1-Page Summary

In _Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers_ , neurologist Robert Sapolsky argues that people today are facing constant psychological stress and that our mental and physical well-being are suffering because of it. As a biologist who specializes in the study of primates and neuroscience, Sapolsky looks at stress from an evolutionary perspective, noting that the way human behavior has changed since our time as hunter-gatherers leads to high levels of stress in the modern world. Because of this, diseases and illnesses caused, or at least exacerbated, by stress are now the leading cause of death across the globe.

In our guide, we’ll examine how psychological stress came to dominate the lives of so many humans and how our natural stress responses turn into chronic stress. We’ll then describe why chronic psychological stress is so harmful and what you can do to curb its effects. Throughout the guide, we’ll provide additional context for Sapolsky’s ideas, focusing on the work and research of other scientists and psychologists regarding stress, how it affects us, and how we can manage it.

### The Evolutionary Explanation for Our Constant Stress

Sapolsky writes that due to advances in medicine, health, and agriculture, our lives have become both longer and much less immediately dangerous than our ancestors’. Instead of having short-term stressors like famine, childbirth, and predators, our stressors are long-term, like financial or career concerns. **However, our stress response hasn’t evolved to cope with such long-term stressors, which results in our feeling _constantly_ stressed. **

> **Hunter-Gatherers and Old Age**
> 
> Sapolsky contends that people are now much more likely to live long enough to suffer the long-term effects of stress. It’s important to note, however, that a fair amount of our hunter-gatherer ancestors _did_ live to old age, and it’s mainly higher infant mortality rates that dragged their average life expectancy down.
> 
> Other research suggests that it wasn’t uncommon for hunter-gatherers to live well past the age of fifty. Hunter-gatherers lived much healthier lives than the average person today—they were constantly on the move and had much healthier dietary habits, which lowered their risk of cardiovascular disease. They also weren’t exposed to the many toxins that modern humans are in the industrialized world which would have lowered their chances of developing cancer.

For most of our evolutionary history, we were hunter-gatherers. Hunter-gatherer societies were relatively small, social groups. Like most other animals (such as zebras),**hunter-gatherers’ main sources of stress were short-lived, intense,_physical_ stressors**—being chased by a predator, or hunting down your prey so that you didn’t starve.

These sorts of events are extremely stressful, and surviving them requires an intense physiological response. And because these sorts of stressors were the most common for most of our evolutionary history, our bodies are fine-tuned to deal with these types of stressors. That is, we’re able to quickly and efficiently recover from this type of stress without long-term damage to our minds and bodies.

(Shortform note: Another term for this kind of short-term stress is acute stress. However, acute stress isn’t necessarily a response to a _physical_ threat, as Sapolsky suggests: It’s just a response to an _immediate_ threat, whether physical, emotional, or psychological. People usually experience acute stress multiple times a day and are usually able to deal with it quickly and avoid bodily damage. But you should be careful about the amount of acute stress you experience because enough instances of acute stress can build up to chronic stress rather quickly.)

Now, think about the main stressors in _your_ life. **These are likely ongoing _psychological_ and _social_ stressors**. You might be worried about how your career is advancing, how you’re going to pay your bills, or how your date went last night. We’ve invented countless things to be stressed about, and we can stimulate a stress response just by _thinking_ about them.

The problem with this is that our bodies haven’t evolved to deal with these never-ending mental stressors. When you’re stressed, whether you’re running for your life or thinking about that humiliating social encounter you had five years ago, you turn on similar physiological processes. The stress response evolved to deal with short-term, physical crises, yet **your body turns on this response constantly when there is no _immediate_ danger, only sustained, imagined danger**. This type of chronic stress can have disastrous consequences, which we’ll discuss in a later section.

(Shortform note: A 2019 study performed on rats provides additional insight into the effects of physical and psychological stress. The research suggests that although physical and psychological stress have similar effects on the mind and body, there are some key differences. The behavioral and mental effects of physical stress appear more quickly than the effects of psychological stress; but over time, the effects of psychological stress are more severe. Furthermore, the damage from long-term psychological stress is harder to reverse than the damage from physical stress. This shows that even when it occurs regularly, physical stress is less damaging than psychological stress, especially long-term.)

### How the Stress Response Works and How Chronic Stress Influences It

To better understand how stress affects the body, let's take a look at how the stress response works and how chronic stress affects its functioning. Sapolsky points out that when you identify a stressor, your brain has two main ways of activating your stress response. The first is through the release of neurotransmitters by the autonomic nervous system. The second is through the release of hormones. **When you’re chronically stressed and these systems are activated too often, it can disrupt the body’s functions and potentially cause harm**.

#### Autonomic Nervous System

According to Sapolsky, the autonomic nervous system controls involuntary processes (like the stress response), and it consists of two key parts: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. These two systems work in tandem to respond to and then recover from stress.

The sympathetic nervous system turns on during times of stress (fight or flight) and helps your body respond almost immediately during a perceived emergency. It does this by releasing neurotransmitters through the nerve endings all over your body. The two key neurotransmitters the sympathetic nerve endings release are the closely related epinephrine (more commonly known as adrenaline) and norepinephrine. Both of these neurotransmitters make your body immediately react to a stressor.

When you encounter a stressor, the sympathetic nervous system activates and epinephrine quickly reaches your organs and causes physiological changes in your body—your heart rate increases and blood flow is diverted to your muscles from other parts of the body. These physiological changes are meant to help you deal with the current stressor.

The parasympathetic nervous system is best understood as working in opposition to the sympathetic nervous system. It promotes calm, vegetative activities, like growth, energy storage, and digestion._After_ a stressful event, the parasympathetic nervous system slows your heart rate and returns blood flow back to the rest of your body.

In a healthy person, there’s a balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems—you get stressed, so the sympathetic activates. The stressful event ends, so the parasympathetic kicks into gear. When you’re consistently stressed, however, you're constantly turning on your sympathetic nervous system and turning off your parasympathetic one. This can, among other things, cause harm to your cardiovascular and metabolic systems, lower your immune response, and affect your brain functioning, leading to many health problems (some of which we’ll cover in depth later in the guide).

(Shortform note: To better understand the functioning of the autonomic nervous system and how it relates to stress, you can look at the simple act of breathing. In _The Body Keeps the Score_ , Bessel van der Kolk explores the process of breathing and its effect on the heart. Inhaling activates the sympathetic nervous system, while exhaling activates the parasympathetic. Measuring heart-rate variability (HRV), the variation in time between heartbeats, can provide insight into the health and balance of your autonomic nervous system. If you have a low HRV, your heart rate and breathing are out of sync, and you’re more likely to have a hyperactive stress response and suffer from stress-related diseases like heart disease and cancer.)

#### Hormonal Release

The second way your body reacts to stress is through the release of hormones. Similar to its effect on the autonomic nervous system, **the constant activation of the stress response caused by chronic stress disrupts the balance of the hormonal system, causing health issues.**

When a chemical messenger like epinephrine is transmitted through nerve endings, it acts as a neurotransmitter. When it’s released into the bloodstream by the adrenal gland, it acts as a hormone. There are many different hormones responsible for a wide variety of bodily functions. Some of these hormones are released during stress, and some are blocked. In a chronically stressed person, there’s often too much of certain hormones in the bloodstream and not enough of others. Additionally, because hormones are released into the bloodstream, their effects last longer than the effects of neurotransmitters.

(Shortform note: Because hormones are released into the bloodstream, the scientific community has long believed that the stress-regulating effects of hormones aren’t seen as quickly as the effects of neurotransmitters. A 2016 study, however, found evidence that hormones might also play a role in the immediate response to stress. The research found that the pituitary gland, also known as the “master gland” of the brain, becomes immediately active when encountering a distressing situation, and the hormones released have an immediate effect on one’s subsequent behavior.)

On top of epinephrine and norepinephrine, Sapolsky points to one other type of hormone that’s vital to the stress response: glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids affect multiple body systems and have several different functions related to the stress response. Glucocorticoids help activate the stress response, they help with the recovery from the stress response, and they also work as anticipatory hormones, helping your body _prepare_ for the next stressor. An overactive stress response can cause elevated levels of glucocorticoids, leading to issues related to all the different functions and bodily systems affected by glucocorticoids.

> **Cortisol: The Stress Hormone**
> 
> Perhaps the most important glucocorticoid is cortisol, also known as the “stress hormone.” Though Sapolsky mentions cortisol, he writes about glucocorticoids more broadly and doesn’t single out cortisol as the most significant stress hormone, even though it’s generally thought of as such in scientific literature. Cortisol is released _after_ epinephrine so that you continue to stay alert after a stressful event. Cortisol also activates the release of glucose from your liver to provide energy during stress.
> 
> Cortisol also has a wide variety of functions on top of regulating the stress response, which may explain why chronic stress can contribute to so many different diseases and ailments. Cortisol helps regulate metabolism, blood pressure, blood sugar, the sleep cycle, and the immune system. High cortisol levels can result in weight gain, hypertension, high blood sugar, and many other symptoms.

### Chronic Stress and Its Effect on Your Body

Sapolsky’s main argument is that **the chronic stress humans regularly feel can be extremely damaging to their bodies**. Because dealing with a stressful event can be so intense, and potentially important to one’s survival,**** the stress response affects virtually every system of the body. So it’s easy to see how chronic stress might be so harmful. Let’s look at some of these harmful effects in more detail. We’ll focus on how chronic stress affects two systems: the cardiovascular system and the metabolic system.

#### Stress and Cardiovascular Health

Sapolsky states that **the harmful effects of psychological stress are seen most clearly in cardiovascular health**. Since stress causes your blood pressure to increase, chronic stress can cause chronically high blood pressure, also known as hypertension. Hypertension can lead to a self-reinforcing cycle: As blood pressure increases, your blood vessels have to work harder to regulate the blood flow and ensure your body is getting adequate oxygen and nutrients. As they work harder, they become stronger and more rigid, and thus more resistant to blood flow. Now there is a constant cycle of increasing vascular resistance and blood flow, driving blood pressure higher and higher.

When blood pressure gets higher, blood returns to your heart at a faster rate, slamming into the wall of your heart. In response, this wall will thicken into what is known as left ventricular hypertrophy, one of the leading predictors of cardiac risk. Similarly, hypertension also causes damage to the blood vessels as the blood moves with more force throughout the body. As this damage occurs, it makes it more likely that plaques will build up at these damaged sites. So chronic stress causes hypertension, which leads to the accumulation of plaques in your bloodstream, and both of these can lead to heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.

> **Labile Hypertension and the Effects of Fluctuating Blood Pressure**
> 
> Sapolsky argues that the constant _raising_ of blood pressure causes hypertension, which then leads to a variety of cardiovascular health issues. But _fluctuations_ in blood pressure can also cause considerable harm. Labile hypertension differs from hypertension in that it’s defined by extreme variations in your blood pressure over brief periods of time rather than consistently elevated blood pressure. Labile hypertension is usually caused by stress, and it includes many short-term and long-term symptoms.
> 
> Several studies emphasize the dangers of fluctuating blood pressure. A 2015 study found that an average blood pressure variation of around 15 mm Hg carried significant cardiovascular risks, including a 46% increased risk of stroke, a 30% increased risk of heart attack or heart disease, and a 58% increased risk of death from any cause. A 2017 study found that dramatic fluctuations in blood pressure may be just as dangerous as consistently high blood pressure. This evidence suggests that the fluctuations in blood pressure caused by stress can be extremely harmful, even if they don’t lead to hypertension.

#### Stress and Metabolic Health

Sapolsky argues that **chronic stress can cause a variety of metabolic issues**. During intense physical stressors, your body doesn’t need to digest food and store the energy for later—it needs energy _now_. To get this energy, the sympathetic nervous system activates, decreasing the secretion of insulin, the hormone responsible for storing energy. Also, glucocorticoids are released to stop nutrients from being transferred to fat cells, which basically cancels out the effects of any insulin left in the bloodstream.

As a result, your body has successfully blocked the energy storage function of your metabolic system, but it also needs to gain access to some of the energy that already is stored. Hormones are then released that transform the more complex proteins stored in fat cells into glucose, which can be converted into energy quickly. _After_ a stressor, the body responds by releasing hormones that increase appetite in order to make up for the energy you just used. This is why many people eat a lot more when stressed.

(Shortform note: Because of its effect on metabolic processes, stress can cause weight gain, as well. Several studies from the 2010s even show that there is a feedback loop between chronic stress and body fat. In 2015, researchers found that body fat sends signals to the brain that help regulate the stress response. Too much extra fat, however, can weaken the body’s ability to turn off the stress response, resulting in a feedback loop: Too much stress can result in extra body fat, and extra body fat can cause even more stress.)

Like with the cardiovascular system, **when this response is turned on too often, metabolic problems emerge**. First, constantly turning on the metabolic stress response is inefficient. It takes energy to break down nutrients and transfer them between storage and usage, so when you do this too often, you lose out on potential energy. This can result in the fatigue many feel after stress.

(Shortform note: The kind of fatigue Sapolsky is referring to here is the everyday fatigue many people feel when mildly stressed, and researchers suggest that we should pay more attention to fatigue because it can cause us considerable harm. But it’s also important to understand the difference between tiredness and chronic fatigue. Tiredness can be mitigated by rest, while fatigue occurs when the body is unable to keep up using normal recovery methods. Understanding the distinction is important because people often confuse the two, which can lead to inaccurate diagnoses that can make the problem worse.)

Another problem with constant activation of the metabolic stress response is that it increases the amount of fat and glucose circulating in your bloodstream. This can then clog your blood vessels and arteries, which can lead to hypertension. It can also make you more insulin-resistant, which can lead to and exacerbate the effects of diabetes. As stated above, when you’re stressed, glucocorticoids are released to cancel out the insulin in your bloodstream so that you can use the energy from glucose. Do this too often, and you can build up an insulin resistance that characterizes type-2 diabetes.

> **How Evolution Has Led to Hypertension and Diabetes**
> 
> Research suggests further evolutionary links between insulin resistance and hypertension beyond stress-related reasons. Throughout most of our evolutionary history, humans have required strong energy storage and salt-retention capabilities. To survive periods of famine or starvation, we needed to be able to store food efficiently. And, to survive the heat and laborious activities, which induce sweat, we needed to be able to retain sodium efficiently. Additionally, the foods available to hunter-gatherers were low in sodium and calories, further adding to our need for these traits.
> 
> However, these particular traits we’ve inherited from our ancestors no longer serve a vast majority of people. We live a much more sedentary lifestyle, and we have access to plenty of food with high sodium and caloric content. Because of our different lifestyles, and because our bodies have adapted to store energy and retain sodium, we’re much more likely to develop hypertension, insulin resistance, and type II diabetes.

#### The All-Encompassing Effects of Chronic Stress

Though we focus on how chronic stress affects your cardiovascular and metabolic health, Sapolsky goes into depth about how stress can be harmful to other systems and parts of the body, leading to a wide variety of ailments and diseases. Here’s a brief overview of the many harms caused by chronic stress:

  * Chronic stress can stunt growth in young people.
  * Chronic stress can affect reproductive health, decreasing libido and fertility.
  * Chronic stress can harm the immune system, leading to autoimmune diseases _and_ immunosuppression.
  * Chronic stress can damage the digestive system, causing ulcers and other gastrointestinal issues.
  * Chronic stress can affect pain receptors, causing a weakened or heightened tolerance to pain.
  * Chronic stress can worsen one’s memory.
  * Chronic stress can disrupt sleep and lead to sleep disorders.
  * Chronic stress can quicken the aging process.



(Shortform note: The many harmful effects of chronic stress are well-documented. On top of the effects Sapolsky details, chronic stress also affects the musculoskeletal system and the respiratory system. When you’re stressed, your muscles tense up to protect you from pain and injury. If they do this too often, it can lead to headaches, back pain, chronic pain conditions, and even muscular atrophy. Because stress can cause respiratory responses like rapid breathing, chronic stress can make breathing more difficult for those with respiratory diseases like asthma. Stress has even been shown to trigger asthma attacks.)

### Stress, Anxiety, and Depression

Chronic stress doesn’t just impact your physical health: It also impacts your mental health. Sapolsky argues that there’s a significant link between stress and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety, which both **involve a person inadequately dealing with stress**.

#### Depression

Sapolsky states that **there’s a significant link between stress and depression and that chronic stress can be a precursor to a depressive episode**. Depression has long been linked to an imbalance or deficiency of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, which, as we’ve discussed, makes your body immediately react to a stressor. Furthermore, people suffering from major depression usually have elevated levels of glucocorticoids, a sign of an overactive stress response. Taking all of this into account, here’s a simplified version of how someone falls into a depression:

  * First, a significant stressor or series of stressors occurs, causing neurochemical changes that lead to a depressive episode. The more stress you’ve had in the past, especially if at a young age, the more likely these neurochemical changes are to occur. 
  * Then, glucocorticoids are released that alter the neurochemical processes, helping you recover. Unfortunately, for some people, these recovery processes don’t work as well due to their genetic makeup, making it more likely they’ll fall into a long-term, severe depression. 



Sapolsky states that the defining feature of depression is the inability to feel pleasure, also known as anhedonia. People suffering from depression can struggle with feelings of grief or guilt, slow movement or speech, weakened immune systems, lack of libido, and trouble maintaining healthy sleeping and eating habits. These symptoms prevent the sufferer from coping with the stress that caused the depression in the first place.

(Shortform note: The idea that anhedonia is the main symptom of depression is a feature of Western medicine. In the US especially, medical practitioners mainly look for the emotional and cognitive symptoms of depression. In China, the focus is more on physiological symptoms like the inability to concentrate or sleep.)

> **How Depression Worsens Your Stress Response**
> 
> Research shows there are specific ways depression can prevent you from effectively handling day-to-day problems. For instance, people with a history of depression are more likely to have a greater decline in their mood when dealing with chronic pain, and pain is more likely to compromise their daily emotional well-being and capacity to cope.
> 
> There are two competing hypotheses on why depression affects people’s ability to cope with stress.). The first, known as the “scar hypothesis”, posits that a depressive episode leaves emotional “scars” that leave them more vulnerable to future mood alterations. The second, known as the “trait marker” hypothesis, posits that people who have suffered from depression have pre-existing traits that make them more vulnerable to stress, and these traits persist even after a depressive episode occurs.

#### Anxiety

Like people with depression, people with anxiety disorders usually have overactive stress responses. The main difference, according to Sapolsky, is that **while depressed people have more or less given up on trying to cope with stress, people with anxiety are still able to use coping mechanisms**. The problem is that people with anxiety disorders constantly mobilize their stress responses, even when they don’t need to. They’re hypervigilant, overestimating dangers and letting their imaginations lead to a constant state of dread or foreboding. Unsurprisingly, people with anxiety disorders are much more likely to suffer from the many diseases exacerbated by chronic stress.

(Shortform note: Experts note that around 30-40% of people in Western societies will develop an anxiety disorder at some point in their lives. It’s believed that anxious feelings do have a purpose, such as protecting us from dangers and helping us deal with challenges, and it’s improbable that anxiety would be so common if it didn’t help us in some way. However, anxiety becomes a disorder when the sufferer holds inaccurate beliefs that don’t serve them and aren’t based on any objective reality. Furthermore, a major hurdle in tackling anxiety issues is that they cause avoidance behaviors that make it difficult for an anxious person to engage in the activities that would contradict their inaccurate beliefs.)

Though anxiety and depression both involve an overactive stress response, the biological responses differ. With depression, you often see a higher level of glucocorticoids, as the brain tries to recover from a stressor and prepare for the next one. Anxiety, on the other hand, is more often associated with a hyperactive sympathetic stress response (excess epinephrine and norepinephrine), as the brain is constantly on edge and trying to deal with a _current_ stressor.

Through these hormonal and neurochemical responses, we can see how anxiety sometimes leads to depression: Someone constantly tries to cope with a multitude of stressors, showing high sympathetic activation (anxiety). Eventually, if the stress becomes too much to handle, they may give up trying to cope and show high levels of glucocorticoids (depression).

(Shortform note: Another way to frame the difference between anxiety and depression is that depression is associated with a focus on the past while anxiety is focused on the future. This framing is based on the assumption that these negative mental states provide some form of adaptive value to the sufferer: Depression is usually caused by the loss of a goal. So people dwell on the past as a way to come up with a new goal or strategy. Anxiety, on the other hand, is more about dealing with a potential threat to one’s self-preservation. So anxiety entails an obsessive focus on potential future dangers.)

### Psychological Factors of Stress

As we’ve explored, the author argues that chronic stress arises because our bodies are responding to constant psychological stressors. But **there are outside factors that can impact the _degree_ of stress we experience.** Sapolsky identifies five psychological variables that can change the level of stress we feel: 1) the ability to vent frustration, 2) social support, 3) predictability, 4) control, and 5) our perception of whether things are getting better or worse.

#### Venting Frustration

Sapolsky claims that **humans can deal with stress better if they have a way to relieve it.** Perhaps you’ve experienced this yourself—maybe you feel less frustrated if you exercise, yell into a pillow, or simply do something you enjoy. Humans can even _imagine_ a way to vent frustration and feel relief. Being able to vent frustration helps distract you from the stressor, but it also reminds you that there is more to life than the stress of your current situation.

(Shortform note: Most stress reduction techniques revolve around finding ways to vent frustration. Here are some more specific ways to vent frustration: Engage with media (such as music, a podcast, or book); take care of your body (by exercising, showering, or eating); go outside; or write about your thoughts or feelings. This last item might give you relief by letting you write about and then _imagine_ releasing your frustration without actually doing anything.)

#### Social Support

According to Sapolsky,**people who feel they have social or communal support are often much less stressed.** A number of studies support this effect: When dealing with a relatively small stressor like public speaking or arguing with strangers, people with a supportive friend present show less of a cardiovascular stress response. In women diagnosed with breast cancer, the more social support they have, the lower their cortisol levels. People who are socially isolated, on the other hand, are much more likely to have an overactive sympathetic nervous system.

(Shortform note: Though social support has been shown to reduce the adverse health effects of stress, research suggests that the stress-reducing benefits of social support may not be as strong in marginalized populations. For people living in poverty, social support may not be as helpful as for more affluent populations because there are fewer resources available in poverty-stricken communities and therefore fewer tangible benefits to social support. Additionally, when there are fewer resources available, social support may create more interpersonal conflict, which increases stress.)

#### Predictability

Furthermore, Sapolsky claims that **if you can predict when your next stressor will be, you’ll be less affected by it.** This is because when you know that a stressor is coming, you can prepare for it. Additionally, knowing when the stressor _won’t_ happen lets you relax during that time. For example, knowing that at some point in the year you’ll get a sudden migraine is more stressful than knowing which day and at what time it will happen.

(Shortform note: Experts suggest that predictability is especially important for children, whose brains are still developing and who are thus more impacted by stress than adults. Unpredictable environments early in life have been shown to adversely affect the brain’s development and, in some cases, to even affect mental health throughout adulthood. Predictability in a child’s life is so important because it helps set a foundation of trust and care that is vital to healthy relationships and also helps the brain regulate emotions.)

#### Control

According to Sapolsky, **a sense of control over a situation can also alleviate stress.** For example, he observes that people are generally more afraid of flying in a plane than driving a car, even though it’s widely known the latter is much more dangerous. This is because when you fly, you cede complete control to the pilot of the plane.

(Shortform note: The stress of air travel doesn’t just stem from a lack of control over steering. As psychologist Sally Augustin explains, when you fly, you’re forced to give up control of your environment. The decisions you have, such as what book to read or whether to open the window, are insignificant compared to the decisions you can no longer make for yourself—you can’t get away from the people sitting right next to you, go out for fresh air, or even use the bathroom at times. All of these lead to a perception that you have no control in your current situation, which is why flying can be so stressful for many people.)

#### Perception of Things Getting Better or Worse

**The same stressor can create drastically different stress reactions depending on whether you feel the situation is improving or worsening** , writes Sapolsky. For example, back pain can be stressful, even if it’s mild. But mild back pain is much less stressful for someone who’s been suffering from severe back pain for months because for them, mild back pain is an improvement.

(Shortform note: The way your perception of improvement affects your stress level shows that simply changing how you _think_ about a stressor can change its effect on you. One helpful way to reframe how you think about stress is to embrace the stress in your life. Since stress is inevitable, learning to see stress as something that you can get better at dealing with, and something that can make you a stronger, more capable person, is perhaps more effective than trying to reduce stress.)

### How You Can Learn to Better Cope With Stress

Sapolsky contends that you can reduce stress by finding ways to displace frustration, lean on social support, and implement a sense of predictability and control in your life. There are, however, caveats and exceptions to these methods you should be aware of. **The key is to find the right strategies and coping mechanisms for certain situations and to figure out which ones work best for _you_**. Let’s look at some of the strategies you can use to reduce psychological stress in your life while keeping in mind some of their caveats.

#### Exercise as a Way to Vent Frustration

According to Sapolsky, a popular, well-studied, and effective way to reduce stress and vent frustration is to exercise. Remember, the stress response is preparing your muscles to exert energy, so **by exercising, you give your body the chance to release that energy.** Exercise can also reduce stress by simply taking your mind off the stressful event.

(Shortform note: Using the energy created by a stress response can help you avoid stress response hyperstimulation, in which your body is constantly semi-prepared to respond to stress, and anxiety-induced excess energy, in which you feel you’re too excited or have too much energy. By simply getting rid of some of the energy caused by stress, you may be able to decrease your likelihood of developing an anxiety disorder.)

It’s important to note, however, that **exercise only reduces stress if it’s something you _want_ to do.** If it’s something you feel like you have to force yourself to do, it may add to your stress levels and _worsen_ your __ health. Sapolsky points to a study where rats that voluntarily ran on a wheel saw health improvements, but rats that were forced to run saw their health decline.

(Shortform note: A 2016 study reinforces Sapolsky’s claim that forced exercise can be harmful, as it found that mice that were forced to exercise saw increased stress hormones and neuronal damage. It should be noted, however, that the rodents in these experiments are being forced to exercise _against their will_ , which is much different than not _wanting_ to exercise. As a human, you’re rarely if ever forced to exercise against your will. Though you may not want to exercise, it’s still a voluntary decision, so you may still see health benefits. In any case, finding a form of exercise you enjoy is still important as it increases motivation and helps you maintain healthy exercise habits.)

It’s also important to make sure you **don’t exercise too much.** Too much exercise can be just as bad as or worse for your health than too little exercise.

(Shortform note: Experts say around 150 minutes of moderate physical activity a week is enough to see reduced stress and other health benefits. Too much exercise, however, can lead to an increased chance of injury, exhaustion, and a decline in mental and physical health. Excessive exercise can even be an addiction similar to eating disorders. Like those who practice extreme diets, exercise addicts exercise because they feel a need for control, even though their excessive working out is actually harming them.)

#### When Predictability Does and Doesn’t Help

We’ve noted that predictability can help reduce stress in humans. Therefore, Sapolsky claims that it can be helpful to **make your life more predictable:** Make schedules based on various timeframes (daily, weekly, yearly), make a budget to keep track of expenses, look up the weather before going to an outside event, and so on.

> **Globalization and the Decline of Predictability**
> 
> Even though people benefit from it, predictability has rapidly declined for many people due to globalization. This could be a significant contributor to rising global stress levels.
> 
> When globalization took off in the 1980s and 90s, many organizations discarded standard practices and procedures that made life predictable for the average person—like lifelong job security. To remain competitive in a globalized economy, organizations felt the need to constantly adapt and change alongside it. People across the globe lost stability and predictability, not knowing if their jobs might be discarded, offshored to another part of the world, or made obsolete by rapidly advancing technologies. The rapid changes in the modern world were bound to make life less predictable and thus more stressful.

There are, however, several exceptions to the rule that predictive information reduces stress:

  * Getting information about common occurrences doesn’t help much because you’re fairly certain these are going to occur anyway. (It’s not useful to be told that you’ll have to wait in a doctor’s office for the doctor to see you.)
  * Getting information about a stressor just before it occurs doesn’t reduce stress because you don’t have enough time to adjust your coping mechanisms. (For example, your hair dresser announces they’re about to cut five inches of your hair and then do.)
  * Getting information _well_ before a stressor also doesn’t reduce your stress because you weren’t stressed about it to begin with. (It’s unhelpful to know that in 19 years you’ll have to go to the hospital.)
  * Getting information that is too vague might actually increase stress because you don’t know what to do with the information. (Say, you learn that something bad will be announced at work this afternoon.)



(Shortform note: Each of these list items shows ways in which increased predictability doesn’t reduce stress because we can’t do anything useful with the information. Another way we might become stressed is when we receive predictive information that _could_ be useful if acted upon, but we feel that other people aren’t taking the proper precautions. For example, many people fear the effects of climate change and don’t feel others are doing enough to curb those effects. In this way, predictability can actually _increase_ stress—if you know something bad might happen, yet feel no one’s doing anything about it, you’d probably be better off not knowing about it at all.)

#### When Control Does and Doesn’t Help

According to Sapolsky, **a sense of control reduces stress** by letting you believe that your actions and decisions have meaning and that you can change a bad outcome or maintain a good one if you work hard enough. In general, people who believe their actions matter, also known as having a strong “internal locus of control,” are better equipped to deal with the psychological stresses of everyday life. For instance, if you are struggling financially, the belief that through determination and effort you can get yourself out of that rut might help you achieve that goal and be less stressed because of it.

A sense of control can only help to a certain extent, however. In general, **a sense of control only helps when you believe you can produce _positive_ outcomes.** If something bad happens, and you think that outcome was completely within your control, you’ll think about what more you could have done to prevent it, which creates stress.

> **How to Maintain a Healthy Internal Locus of Control**
> 
> In _The Happiness Advantage_ , Shawn Achor argues that having an internal locus of control is instrumental to one’s happiness and success. If you have an external locus of control, you blame other people or circumstances for your failures and deny credit for your successes, which leads to an unfulfilling life. Achor also points out that feeling stressed or overwhelmed can _disrupt_ your internal locus of control, causing a vicious cycle of stress and poor decision-making—stress causes you to feel overwhelmed, making it harder to complete the task and leading to even more stress and anxiety.
> 
> Sapolsky notes that an internal locus of control can be harmful when dealing with negative outcomes. Here are three tips to avoid feeling stressed by your perception of control over a situation:
> 
>   * **Learn to move on** : A sense of control can cause some people to obsess over their role in a negative outcome. When something bad happens, acknowledge what happened, reflect on what you can do differently next time, and then let it go.
> 
>   * **Delegate tasks** : People with an internal locus of control may find it hard to share responsibility, but doing so can help alleviate some of the stress when something bad happens.
> 
>   * **Control what you can control** : Make note of what you can and can’t control in a situation. This will help you realize that there _are_ things you can’t control and that you simply have to accept them.

#### How to Best Seek Social Support

Sapolsky claims that **having the social support of a community can greatly reduce stress.** Even in highly individualized societies, people still long to be a part of something. Therefore, he recommends that to become better at managing stress, you strengthen your current relationships with friends and family and build new ones that are intimate, supportive, and communal.

It’s also important that you **_give_ support as well as receive it.** Helping others not only strengthens bonds and releases endorphins, but it also gives you a small sense of control in the world—it shows you that through small acts of kindness, you can improve people’s lives and change the world.

> **The Communal Support of Group Therapy**
> 
> One form of social support psychologists recommend is group therapy. Group therapy can be extremely beneficial for one’s mental health, especially for those who may not consider themselves a “group person.” Many people are reluctant to join group therapy because, due to a culture that views vulnerability negatively, they’re afraid to talk about their problems in front of a group of people. They may also not like the idea of listening to other people’s problems.
> 
> But if you can overcome your reluctance to join a group therapy session, you may see several psychological benefits. With group therapy, you’ll build strong relationships as part of a tight, close-knit community, and you’ll be able to receive _and_ give support, as Sapolsky recommends. Additionally, it can reduce the shame you may have around your negative emotions or feelings because you’re surrounded by others who are going through the same things.
