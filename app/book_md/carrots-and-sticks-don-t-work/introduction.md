## Introduction

After graduating from his PhD program in Clinical Psychology, the author had a terrible experience at his first job. People didn’t care about him on his first day; no one seemed engaged at work; his bosses gave unclear expectations of what he was supposed to do. He quit.

Marciano realized that respect was the center of an engaging workplace. Whenever he felt unrespected, he always disengaged. Over several years, he found the factors forming the acronym RESPECT:

  * Recognition
  * Empowerment
  * Supportive Feedback
  * Partnering
  * Expectations
  * Consideration
  * Trust



The book covers why reward programs don’t work, how the RESPECT model drives engagement, and how to implement RESPECT in your organization.
