## Chapter 8: Partnering

The author uses partnering to connote a relationship where parties are treated as equal partners, not as us-them or superior-subordinate.

By making your employees partners on a team, they think like business owners, and they act as stewards of the organization’s values. They can make decisions without waiting for approval. When working as partners on a team, people put the team’s goals before the self and use the best of their collective strengths while nullifying their weaknesses.

To foster this spirit, the manager should emphasize that **no one wins unless everyone wins**. Managers should also be willing to dive in and get their hands dirty.

Between departments, employees can partner to work on special projects. And outside of the company, organizations can partner with customers and vendors. If you engage all people like they’re on equal footing, giving them information and trust, they’ll enjoy working with you.

### Actionables for Partnering

  * Share big picture, long-term vision with employees. Have regular drumbeat meetings and publish department blogs.
  * Share financial info with employees.
  * Involve employees in major decisions affecting the team, like hiring, equipment purchases, and budget.
  * Reach out to internal and external customers for feedback. Work alongside them to fix their problems, rather than treating them like annoying clients. Fly them in to brainstorm about new services.
  * As a manager, be willing to dig in and get your hands dirty and fight alongside your troops in the trenches. Walk the factory floors and ask individual contributors for their opinions.
  * Build cross-departmental teams to allow crosspollination of ideas and people. More extremely, have people spend a day working in other departments, or crosstrain them in a second role so they can cover each other. 
  * Keep compensation and benefits egalitarian. No manager parking spots.
  * Allow employees to have equity (shares) in the company.
  * Create an employee council consisting of a heterogeneous mix of employees.
