## Exercise: Are You Engaged?

Think about your current work situation and whether the environment increases engagement.

* * *

An engaged employee takes initiative, is excited to exceed goals, speaks with pride about where they work, and is committed to the organization. Do you consider yourself engaged? How can you tell?

What about the working environment makes you feel that way? If you’re engaged, what about the workplace stirs you to engage? If you’re not engaged, what is uninspiring about the workplace?
