## 13: Sex and Reproduction

There are perhaps few mysteries as intriguing and perplexing as the courtship between females and males. Darwinian thinking has explanations for this too.

### Sex and Mating

#### Why Sexually Reproduce?

Some animals reproduce asexually, with mothers essentially giving birth to a clone of itself. Why do mammals and humans go through all the trouble of sexual reproduction?

The classical explanation is that **sexual reproduction promotes genetic diversity** , through the combination of genetic material from the mother and father. Having more genetic diversity avoids over-optimization to one genome, and it promotes survival in changing environments.

In comparison, a woman who could bud off offspring without sex may have a short-term advantage in producing offspring, but the entire enetically identical clan may be wiped out in one calamity. If ten thousand clones of one woman are all especially vulnerable to influenza, they may all die in one epidemic, whereas a genetically diverse population would only lose a fraction of its members.

#### Different Reproductive Strategies

Different animals have different reproductive strategies. They vary in these factors:

  * The number of offspring produced per birth
  * The mode of childbearing
  * How males and females choose one another
  * The split of childcare between males and females



For example, a female salmon releases hundreds of eggs into the water, and a male fertilizes the eggs. The fish then hatch from eggs with no parent supervision and forge onward into life. This is obviously very different from how humans reproduce.

#### Egg and Sperm

In many animals, the male produces sperm and the female produces eggs. This contrasts with hermaphrodite animals, which can produce both sex cells within one organism.

The small size of sperm and large size of eggs make it easier to get sperm inside females, rather than the opposite. It would be much more difficult for a woman to transmit her egg into a male.

Human sperm are much smaller than eggs, which contain most of the resources for the developing embryo. This size disparity arose through natural selection. Consider a situation where eggs and sperm started out being the same size. The sperm that carries fewer nutrients travels faster and wins the race to the egg. To compensate for the lower-nutrient sperm, the eggs that contain more nutrients end up producing more viable offspring. Both these forces continue, with the sperm getting smaller and the egg getting larger, until we arrive at today’s equilibrium.

**The size of the egg and sperm have huge consequences on the mating relationship between males and females:**

  * Sperm enters the female, and the fetus develops in the female over 9 months. This **requires a much larger commitment for females than males**.
  * **Females know for sure the child is theirs, while males don’t.** The female could only have produced the egg that led to the embryo inside her, but multiple males could have contributed sperm to the female, so no male is completely sure that the child is theirs. (Shortform note: Of course, this is no longer true with today’s genetic testing, but we’re discussing the history of natural selection here.)
  * **Males expend little resources when creating a child**. Theoretically, a male can hundreds of offspring in a lifetime, while females can have only 5-6.
  * **Males compete among each other to have the chance to inseminate the female.** Females have the ability to be selective about which males to mate with. Therefore, males compete to show their genetic prowess through feats of strength (such as male elk fighting with their antlers) and showmanship (such as peacock feathers).
  * Sperm from different males may compete within the female’s body to fertilize the egg.
    * Among species, the size of male testes depends on the promiscuity of the species. For species in which females mate with multiple males, like with chimpanzees, the testis are larger. In contrast, monogamous species like gorillas have small testes. Humans are somewhere in between.
    * The volume of ejaculate increases with the time the couple has been apart, as well as the time passed since the male’s last ejaculation. This is possibly to outcompete sperm from other males when the male was away.
    * Within ejaculate, some sperm are incapable of fertilizing the egg. Why produce these? They’re possibly meant to find and destroy sperm from other men.
  * Female orgasms take longer to achieve than male orgasms, for evolutionary reasons.
    * If female orgams happened too quickly, they may lose interest in sex before insemination occurs, thus decreasing reproductive success. The same is true of males who take too long to ejaculate. Therefore, the equilibrium for natural selection is for women to take longer to orgasm, than males.
    * Premature ejaculation is common in young men. This might make evolutionary sense—while the tribal elders and alpha males are away, young males can sneak in and quickly inseminate females before elders return.



Suddenly, human courtship rituals might make more sense! But there’s more—how the child is taken care of also influences mating behavior.

### Childcare and Sex

The skulls of humans are relatively larger compared to primate relatives and ancestors. The size of the human skull allows for a larger, more intelligent brain. However, how large the fetus’s skull can be is limited by the size of the female birth canal. Human children are therefore born with under-developed brains, and they require a long period of care to become self-sufficient and for their skulls to continue growing outside of the mother. Contrast this to other animals like baby deer, who are much more self-sufficient when born.

**This long period of childcare requires the participation of both males and females** , which has engendered the following mating-related behaviors:

#### Mate Selection

From a biological point of view, **males and females want different things in relationships**.

**Males want women who are:**

  * Of fertile age
  * Attractive, which suggests good genes
  * Nurturing, which will lead to better care of the child
  * Uncommitted to others. Ideally the woman has had no prior children and might even be a virgin. This ensures the woman’s attention is focused on the male’s children.
  * Sexually loyal. The male doesn’t want the female to have sex with other men, which may lead the male to take care of a child that is not his.



**Females want men who are:**

  * Capable of providing resources for the mother and children
  * Are faithful to the family, thus participating in childcare for long term and not splitting resources with other women.
  * Capable of providing good, competitive genes for their offspring.



Over time, the selection pressure may cause species to develop traits that are not all that practically useful. Male peacocks have large plumes of feathers that serve no purpose other than reproduction, and may actually hamper their survival among predators.

#### Sexual Behavior

Some female primates change color when they’re ovulating, signaling that it’s mating season.

**In contrast, female humans conceal when they’re ovulating** —there’s no external difference between ovulating women and non-ovulating women. This has a number of benefits:

  * **Hiding ovulation prevents the male mate from being absent most of the time and returning only to reproduce**. Instead, if he wants to have more offspring, the male needs to stick around and provide for the family.
  * Hiding ovulation prevents rival males from noticing that the female is ready to mate. They therefore don’t swoop in opportunistically. This also protects the female from unwelcome attention.
  * Women themselves don’t know when they’re ovulating. If they did, they might avoid their mate when they’re fertile, if they don’t want to have more children and are afraid of the pain of childbirth.



#### Testing Relationships for Loyalty

Both women and men are concerned about the loyalty of their mates. Women want men to provide for their family, and men want women to be faithful so they don’t bear the children of other men.

**People in relationships might therefore want to test their relationships for loyalty.** They can provoke their partner with arguments or instigate jealousy, and see if the partner sticks around and stays committed.

(Shortform note: If true, then this suggests that relationships where the parties are unsure of each other’s capacity for commitment tend to be more volatile, with more arguments.)

#### Jealousy

The father can’t guarantee the child is his, while the mother can. Therefore, the man is fearful of being cuckolded and raising a child that is not his.

**In response, the father shows jealousy and a threat of anger. This is a response that discourages other mates from intruding, and dissuades the mother from straying.**

Sexual jealousy is so strong that it’s been institutionalized in many cultures. In China, women’s feet were bound as children to limit their mobility and independence. It was tradition to demonstrate virginity on wedding night by observing blood on the marital sheets. The authors say that for much of history, in nearly all societies, men created social institutions to control female sexuality.

(Shortform note: This might also point to why there’s a modern double standard of sexual activity. Females who are promiscuous are chastised by males (since they fear cuckolding), and by women (for possibly drawing away men). In contrast, men are admired for their sexual conquests, because it makes them more appealing as possible mates.)

### Pregnancy and Childcare

According to evolutionary medicine, **pregnancy is a conflict between mother and fetus**. The fetus carries only half the mother’s genes, so their interests are not perfectly aligned. The fetus will manipulate the mother to provide more nutrition, and the mother will resist this.

Here are two examples of how the mother and fetus combat for control of resources:

  * The fetus secretes human placental lactogen, which is anti-insulin and raises the mother’s blood glucose. In return, the mother counteracts this by secreting more insulin. This tension can lead to gestational diabetes in the mother.
  * Pre-eclampsia, or high blood pressure in mothers, provide more nutrients to the placenta. The placenta may cause this by making substances that constrict arteries in mother’s body. This effect works: mothers with higher blood pressures have larger babies and show lower fetal mortality. However, this endangers the mother.



Both these examples incur risks to the mother, and possible death of the fetus, but on average the fetus wins. Therefore the fetus can be seen as playing the odds for its own benefit.

#### Childbirth

Women giving birth are more successful when a supportive woman is around—they show a lower rate of C-section by 66% and lower use of forceps by 82%. This may be because human babies are born in an odd position, facing backward, and if the mother were to finish labor by pulling on the child, she might injure it. A supportive woman would have been able to help reduce the risk dramatically, and so women may have evolved a preference for another woman during labor.

During birth, pressure on the vaginal walls causes oxytocin to be secreted. Oxytocin makes the mother bond to her child. C-sections don’t have this signal and oxytocin secretion. In sheep, birth by C-section usually causes the mother to reject the baby as her own offspring.

#### Crying, Feeding

**Babies naturally cry to get attention, and this sound is naturally aversive to parents so they try to make it stop**.

Crying could increase fitness by promoting bonding with the mother through contact. It also encourages feeding and lactation, which prevents competing pregnancies from taking resources from the baby.

Babies who cry more for no apparent reason are often diagnosed with colic, but colicky babies don’t cry more frequently or at special times, just for longer. The authors hypothesize that this may result from modern habits of infrequent feedings and less contact. Some native tribes carry their babies around constantly and feed multiple times per hour, compared to once every few hours in typical Western societies.

As babies grow, they may manipulate the mother to pay it more attention. Spitting up milk prompts the mother to produce more milk. Also, infants may regress, or act younger and more helpless than it really is. Both these behaviors attempt to convince the mother to pay the baby more attention and limit future pregnancies.

#### SIDS

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome causes more deaths in babies than any other cause except for accidents.

SIDS may be caused by the immaturity of the infant’s nervous system. As we’ve discussed, human babies are born with immature brains because the mother’s birth canal restricts how large the fetus’s skull can get.

SIDS may be higher in modern days because babies and mothers sleep apart. In the past, sleeping together led to coordination of sleep cycles and intermittent arousals that might sustain babies who are vulnerable to SIDS.
