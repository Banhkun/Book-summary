## Exercise: Consider the Ideas of The Wealth of Nations

This exercise will give you a chance to reflect on Smith's main ideas and develop your own economic thinking.

* * *

Smith argues that people specialize their labor out of self-interest. If you had to choose between two jobs—one where you completed a repetitive task over and over but made lots of money, or one where you frequently switched between tasks but made less money—which one would you choose and why?

Smith divides the natural price of goods into three components: labor, land, and capital. Let's reflect on which of these you consider most important for an economy. Imagine three countries. The first has abundant capital and land but is short on labor. The second has abundant labor and land but is short on capital. The third has abundant labor and capital but is short on land. Which one of these countries do you think would be the wealthiest and why?n

Smith states that the four appropriate expenses for public investment are: defense, justice, education, and transportation infrastructure. Of these four, which one do you think is most important _for growing the economy?_ Explain why.

Imagine that you are tasked with designing a new tax to pay for a government initiative and that your goal is to disrupt the market as little as possible. Would you rather tax wages, land, or profits? Explain your reasoning.

Smith's central contention throughout _The Wealth of Nations_ is that the best way to grow a nation's economy is by trusting the market to guide itself without government interference. Do you agree with this philosophy? Why or why not?
