## Chapter 4.2: Hyperfocus Step 2b: Manage Distractions

Now that we’ve discussed Bailey’s strategy for dealing with distractions you _can’t_ control, we’ll discuss his strategies for dealing with distractions you _can_ control.

#### Strategies for Dealing With Distractions You Can Control

**#1: Track your distractions.**

We previously discussed how to keep track of the things that distract you with an attention alarm. Similarly, Bailey suggests that writing your potential and actual distractions down reduces your mind’s inherent tendency to wander during focus sessions: Before your hyperfocus session, write down anything that _could_ distract you—like to-dos you haven’t completed. During your hyperfocus session, write down anything that _does_ distract you—like the argument with your spouse you keep replaying at inopportune times.

(Shortform note: Instead of keeping a list of actual or potential distractions, Eyal recommends scheduling a 20-minute block or “timebox” each week to reflect on what you got distracted by and how to adjust your schedule to reduce those in the future. Adjusting your schedule may include adding time to list your to-dos.)

Citing the work of _Getting Things Done_ , Bailey explains that your brain wasn’t built for keeping track of everything but for creating and processing. In fact, Bailey suggests that your brain views commitments and tasks you haven’t yet externalized as threats—so it’ll naturally focus on them. By capturing both your tasks and thoughts, you deal with this perceived threat, so it no longer attracts your attention. Therefore, you reduce your mental load and are better able to focus.

(Shortform note: While externalizing your tasks is an essential part of the Getting Things Done system, it’s the first step of five. After capturing all your ideas, clarify each one, organize them all appropriately, reflect on them, and engage them.)

**#2: Distance your distractions.**

As Bailey explains, our brains are constantly looking for more interesting things to focus on. So get as much distance as possible from anything that might be more stimulating than your main task—both in your physical and digital environments. First, assess how stimulating every potential distraction is and then make them difficult to access—perhaps by removing them together. (Shortform note: Distancing your distractions makes accessing them inconvenient, and making bad habits inconvenient is an oft-cited strategy for breaking them: _Switch_ also discusses creating change-supporting spaces that make good behavior easy and undesirable behavior difficult.)

Bailey’s strategies for your physical environment are:

**Put your phone in a different room**. (Shortform note: Charge your phone outside the bedroom if you’re trying to hyperfocus on your relationships.)

If you want to focus on a person, **trade phones**. This allows you to make calls, but the phone isn’t super-customized so you won’t get nearly as distracted. (Shortform note: Alternatively, try the phone stacking game, which went viral in 2012: Everybody puts their phone in the middle of the table and the first person to pick it up pays for the meal.)

**Add elements that trigger productive behavior.** Music may help—but only if it’s the right kind. Bailey explains that all noise attracts some of your attention, so silence is best for hyperfocus. But noise that’s **_recognizable_ , _straightforward_ , **and**_quiet_ **is best—so if music hides the blare of construction next door, it can help you hyperfocus. (Shortform note: If you need good work music, try lo-fi music. It’s generally recognizable, straightforward, and quiet, and it boomed during the COVID-19 pandemic—perhaps because it relaxes you, too.) Other productive elements Bailey suggests include calming houseplants or a whiteboard to capture your daily intentions. (Shortform note: If you’re allergic to plants, try adding a photo of them to your whiteboard: a University of Michigan study found that looking at pictures of nature can replenish your attentional capacity.)

Bailey’s strategies for your digital environment are:

**Delete apps you don’t need**. (Shortform note: How do you know if you need it? _Indistractable_ suggests keeping only apps that benefit you or align with your values.)

Use apps like Freedom (paid) or Self-Control (free) to **block access to distracting apps and websites**. (Shortform note: If you can’t use apps, _Indistractable_ also recommends using browser extensions to limit what you see.)

Alternatively, **hide** **distracting apps in folders so they’re not as accessible**. You could also move them away from the home screen. Bailey specifically recommends using a “Mindless” folder for your most distracting apps, arguing that the folder name will make you think twice about using it. (Shortform note: Eyal recommends a similar strategy: Place only apps that are “Tools” (apps that help you with everyday tasks) or “Goals” (apps that help you with things you’d like to spend your time with—like a mindfulness app if you want to meditate more) on your home screen—and move everything else into folders on your secondary screen.)

**Close your email client** **if you’re not using it.** (Shortform note: If you can’t close your email client, try expanding your work to your full screen—if it’s not visible, it’s less likely to distract you.)

Bailey also recommends that you **declutter to both physical and digital distractions**. Clutter reminds you of your other to-dos, so it stresses you out. Cleaning it all up by putting your computer away or clearing off your desktop screen will help you focus when you need to—and rest when you need to. (Shortform note: You could try the extreme strategy _Indistractable_ author Eyal describes: Leave your desktop screen completely blank except for the files you’re working on, and file everything else into one folder labeled “Everything.” Use your laptop’s search function to find files you need so you’re never distracted by visual desktop reminders.)

(Shortform note: Clearing your work laptop may be particularly important if you’re hyperfocusing on your personal life and work from home—if you don’t see it, it’s less likely to trigger thoughts of work tasks.)

**#3: Delegate.**

Bailey points out that many of our tools perform similar or identical tasks. For example, you might be able to send and receive text messages on both your cell phone and computer.

Bailey implies that this redundancy increases our likelihood of giving in to a tempting distraction. For example, you might successfully ignore the text message notification on your phone but fail to ignore the notification on your computer. He suggests reducing this redundancy in two main ways.

First, he recommends limiting how you use each tool by **delegating specific devices to specific tasks**. His strategies for this are:

  * Purchase a device you use solely for distractions.
  * Separate your devices by app. For example, remove your email app from your phone and only check your work computer.
  * Alternately, limit which devices notify you. For example, you could have Facebook on your tablet and phone—but enable notifications only on your tablet. 
  * Instead of tracking your to-dos in your email client, keep a separate to-do list.
  * Use separate email accounts.



Secondly, he recommends **carefully evaluating whether you need the tool at all**. Each digital device is a tool with a collection of features—but if two of your devices do identical tasks, do you really need both of them? For example, if you have an analog watch and a smartphone, you may think twice about purchasing a smartwatch.

> **The Origins of Delegating Your Distractions**
> 
> The recommendation that you delegate specific devices to specific tasks echoes _Digital Minimalism_. But unlike Bailey, who discusses only devices, Newport suggests viewing all technology as a collection of features and evaluating all the technology you use by its individual features. By following Bailey’s strategy, you might use Facebook Messenger on your phone and Skype on your tablet. But Newport would question why you can’t eliminate one app entirely since both have similar features: They let you call and direct message people.
> 
> Bailey’s suggestion to evaluate whether you need the tool at all is also both similar to and different from Newport’s. Like Bailey, Newport questions the necessity of various digital tools. But Newport suggests overhauling your entire philosophy of tech use by identifying your priorities and determining which digital tools promote or inhibit these priorities; Bailey doesn’t elaborate nearly as much. Interestingly, however, Bailey does base his suggestions on a theory with much broader implications: He cites Clayton Christen, who argued that devices have “jobs,” and you only need to hire one device to do each job. Christensen’s original theory targeted producers—not consumers—and applies not just to devices but to all products consumers use.

**#4: Disconnect.**

Many of our most time-sucking diversions require the internet. So if you’re trying to hyperfocus, **consider** **disconnecting your computer from the wifi** or the Internet. This technique is especially useful if you’re unable to install apps on your work devices. (Shortform note: You may need to get permission from your boss on this one, since many of us are available to our coworkers only via the Internet.)

**Bailey also suggests** **limiting your internet access in general** so that you can pay attention to other tasks and potentially feel more rested. This is a daunting request for most people. Bailey recommends starting by spending a 24-hour period on the weekend without Internet to see how it feels. Alternatively, you could not buy Wi-Fi when you travel to see how productive you are without Internet.

(Shortform note: Bailey suggests that a major benefit of temporarily pausing your Internet is deeper engagement with your family. But what if you live alone? _Digital Minimalism_ states that a key tenet of reducing your digital dependency is to replace the time you spend on devices with high-quality leisure activities, such as building or fixing something new each week.)

Another way to disconnect is to **stop looking at your cell phone every time you have a short break in your day**. Instead of occupying your attention with your phone, Bailey recommends using these brief intervals to give your brain a break. In these moments that you are seemingly doing nothing, reflect on the activity you’ve just been doing, or reflect more broadly on your work or life. (Shortform note: _Digital Minimalism_ argues that regular breaks from your phone are essential: When we’re constantly on our phones, we never get a break from all outside input. This “solitude deprivation” harms both our mental and emotional health—but we can reclaim it by, for example, taking long walks without our phones.)

**#5: Disable notifications.**

As Bailey says, notifications are a seemingly innocuous black hole. They only take up a second of your attention—but once you click on one, you’re dragged into a device that’s specifically designed to keep you on it as long as possible.

So Bailey recommends **disabling your notifications for non-essential apps on your devices**. You can usually do this via the Settings menu on your devices. (Shortform note: Bailey only recommends disabling the audible and vibrating notifications, stating that he looks for new alerts when he looks at the time on his phone. But you might get distracted every time you pick up your phone to look at the time if the screen is overrun with notifications. Adjust your visual notifications so they only appear when you unlock your device.)

You also **set when you receive notifications** —either by pre-scheduling Do Not Disturb or Airplane Modes or by turning these modes on when you want to hyperfocus. (Shortform note: Think of this as setting office hours for conversation, as _Digital Minimalism_ suggests _._)**** If you are waiting on a notification from a specific person, Bailey recommends **temporarily enabling notifications for just that person**. (Shortform note: This echoes _Digital Minimalism_ ’s assertion that some technologies are only essential under specific circumstances. It describes a digital decluttering experiment where one woman used her phone only to communicate with her husband when he traveled by only allowing text notifications from him.)

**#6: Change your environment.**

According to Bailey, **you may find it easier to work away from the office.** He suggests that when at the office, you’re constantly bombarded with environmental cues that remind you of all of the other tasks on your to-do list. For example, you might see the coworker who’s waiting on a report you’re not working on. This stresses us out and redirects some of our working memory away from the task at hand.

(Shortform note: Hyperfocusing consistently in one environment—and only one environment—may be advantageous. One article suggests by devoting specific types of work to specific environments, that environment can trigger that type of work. So if you always hyperfocus at your favorite coffee shop, sitting there may trigger a bout of hyperfocus.)

If you’re a team leader, Bailey suggests, have your team **use environmental cues to signal when they’re doing focus work**. (Shortform note: Do this even if you’re not a team leader: _Indistractable_ suggests using obvious visual cues like headphones to signal to others that you’re not available for conversation.)

**#7: Schedule distraction breaks.**

As we’ve seen, dealing with distractions ahead of time drastically reduces the mental energy you spend avoiding them. But you spend some mental energy regulating your behavior whenever you hyperfocus—whether it’s to refocus your thoughts on the task at hand or to ignore the occasional temptation to go to the other room and pick up your phone.

(Shortform note: Your brain takes up just 2% of your total body weight but uses 20% of your total energy. So you might assume that if you spend more mental energy, you’ll burn more calories. Scientists note that this is true, but the difference is barely noticeable: Your brain mostly uses its calories for more basic activities like staying awake.)

One reason breaks are energizing is because, during the break, you stop regulating your behavior and give yourself permission to do anything you want. Therefore, Bailey recommends scheduling occasional “distraction breaks” between hyperfocus sessions: Allow yourself to indulge in all the mental temptations you avoid when you try to focus. (Shortform note: Eyal suggests another reason breaks are helpful: They can renew and restore your motivation to complete difficult tasks.)

Distraction breaks may be especially helpful if you’re impulsive: Bailey explains that more impulsive people feel more stress when blocking distractions. This implies that since it’s harder for you to focus, you’re likely spending more energy to stay focused. A distraction break relieves your stress level, which lets you return to the task with renewed vigor—both because the break energizes you and because when you’re less stressed, it’s easier to focus so you spend less energy regulating your behavior to stay focused.

(Shortform note: You may want to be careful with distraction breaks. If you always hyperfocus and then reward yourself with a distraction break, your brain may consider this a habit with hyperfocus as the behavior and your distraction break as a reward. Craving a distraction break every time you hyperfocus may be problematic, especially if it causes you to shorten your hyperfocus sessions.)

**#8: Be more intentional.**

Bailey defines a distraction as something that diverts you from your original purpose. So whether an activity counts as a distraction depends not on the content of the activity but on your original purpose. If you’ve scheduled 45 minutes to exercise but watch a TV show instead, the TV show is a distraction. If you schedule 45 minutes to relax, the TV show fills your original purpose and is not a distraction.

Therefore, Bailey recommends **being more intentional about when you do potentially distracting activities**. We already saw this in the suggestion about “distraction breaks.” Technically, if you schedule five minutes to scroll through Instagram during your “distraction break,” scrolling through Instagram for five minutes doesn’t count as a distraction because you’re doing exactly what you want to do.

> Timeboxing, the strategy from _Indistractable_ we mentioned previously, echoes this idea. Like Bailey, Eyal defines a distraction as something you do in place of what you originally meant to do. So when you timebox, you schedule all your activities, including things like scrolling through Reddit—which means that if you scroll through Reddit at the appointed time, it’s not a distraction because you’re doing what you meant to do.
> 
> Timeboxing has another major benefit: When you know exactly what you’re supposed to be doing at any given moment, when something _does_ divert you from your original purpose, you can pinpoint exactly when and why.

Another easy way to schedule potential distractions is to **schedule when you respond to emails so they’re not constantly interrupting you**. As Bailey notes, this could be a private decision or a public one if you use an auto-responder to explain that you only check emails once a day. (Shortform note: _Indistractable_ discusses how people are wired to imitate each other: If you respond immediately, they'll also respond immediately. If you wait to respond, expect not to receive immediate responses, either.)

Scheduling isn’t the only way to be intentional: Bailey also reminds us to **respond to emails when we have the _energy_ to do so**. Even if you have the working memory capacity and the time, responding to emails when you are exhausted can be a recipe for disaster. You could send the wrong document or a snappy unprofessional response. Remember: Most things can wait.

(Shortform note: If it’s a lack of emotional energy, not physical energy, that’s prohibiting you from answering emails, try these strategies to increase it—like breathing deeply for five to six seconds.)

**#9. Hyperfocus on the distraction.**

Emails and meetings can be distracting. But sometimes, they’re essential tasks you must complete. So, counterintuitively, Bailey recommends hyperfocusing on these potential distractions.

Specifically, he recommends **hyperfocusing on meetings you can’t get out** of in order to get the most value from them. (Shortform note: If you find the meeting tedious, you may have trouble focusing on it. _Death by Meeting_ suggests that tension is an essential element of meetings in order to keep participants engaged. Try actively looking for drama and disagreement during the meeting.) He also recommends **hyperfocusing on emails if you have many to respond to**. This strategy is especially effective when combined with scheduling if your job requires quick responses to emails. (Shortform note: If you’re inundated by emails, try following the strategies espoused by Inbox Zero: Instead of storing your emails in your inbox, view it as a temporary workspace you use to sort your emails before dealing with them.)

In addition to the above, Bailey also suggests several strategies specifically to reduce how distracting meetings and email can be.

##### Meeting Strategies

**#1: Reduce the number of meetings you attend.** Bailey suggests reducing the meetings you attend in two main ways:

First, **only attend meetings with agendas**. If there isn't one, ask the organizer to provide one for you. Bailey states that most of the time, this question will make the organizer realize that they can replace the meeting with a phone call. (Shortform note: This strategy may not be as effective depending on the culture you’re working in. In _The Culture Map_ , author Erin Meyer divides cultures into two types: monochronic cultures, which hold meetings with agendas, and polychronic cultures, which rarely have meetings with agendas.)

Secondly, **reevaluate your recurring meetings**. Look at the meetings that recur on your schedule. Do you really need to be there?

Do a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the meeting is an effective use of your time. But just as with your tasks, make sure that you are evaluating the domino benefits of meetings as well. Some update meetings might initially feel like a waste of time. But if they begin a chain reaction that ends with better relationships and greater team cohesion, they may be worth attending.

(Shortform note: One way to evaluate whether a meeting is essential is to see where it falls in the types of meetings recommended by _Death By Meeting_. It divides meetings into four essential types: the check-in, the tactical, the strategic, and the review.)

**#2: Reduce the number of people at the meeting.**

If you’re leading the meeting, Bailey suggests inviting only the essential players. Alternatively, invite the non-essential players, but let them opt out if they have more important tasks. (Shortform note: You could adapt Bailey's strategies to your own benefit even if you're not leading the meeting. For example, your boss might balk if you want to skip all your recurring meetings. But she might be more open if you ask to skip half of them.)

##### Email Strategies

**#1: Only send emails that are five sentences or fewer.**

One of the best ways to reduce the number of emails in your inbox is to reduce the number of emails you send. Bailey contends that five sentences is enough for most email conversations. If you can’t fit your response in this limit, that’s a good benchmark that calling might be better.

However, as Bailey suggests, note this limit in your email signature. He doesn’t explicitly state why, but this is presumably because emails that are too short can seem overly brusque. (Shortform note: This strategy may not be as effective if you’re a woman. Women who write short, concise emails often receive negative feedback from both superiors and clients because their tones buck traditional gender expectations.)

**#2: Take limited email breaks.**

If you have a big project to focus on, Bailey suggests not checking your email at all for one to two days. In order to avoid angering others, Bailey recommends setting an autoresponder explaining what you’re doing and when you’ll be back—just as you might if you were on vacation. (Shortform note: If you want to remain available for emergencies, include a phone number. People tend to think twice about calling instead of emailing.)
