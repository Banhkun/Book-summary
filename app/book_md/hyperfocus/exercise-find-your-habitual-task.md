## Exercise: Find Your Habitual Task

Now that you’ve learned that focusing on a fun, simple task you can use to mind-wander, you can start to think about _which_ fun, simple task you’d like to use.

* * *

What do you like to do that’s fun and easy? For example, do you like to sew or take long walks? List everything that comes to mind, even if the answer is playing a smartphone game.

Look at your list of tasks. Which could you use to intentionally mind-wander?

If you can’t use any of the exercises to intentionally mind-wander because they’re all screen-based, think back to when you were a kid: What activities did you enjoy that you could use to intentionally mind-wander?

Guess what? You just intentionally mind-wandered to come up with a list of activities to use to intentionally mind-wander. How do you feel? (Writing down how you feel might help you realize that mind-wandering doesn’t have to be stressful and reduce your aversion to it in the future.)
