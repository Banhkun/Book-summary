## Exercise: Schedule Your Meditation

Now that you’ve learned the importance of meditation and mindfulness for hyperfocus, you can take steps to ensure you perform them in your daily life.

* * *

Think about how much your schedule differs on a daily basis and decide whether you’d rather be mindful or meditate. Is there a task you do every single day without fail during which you can realistically be mindful, or would it make more sense to implement a new habit of meditating?

In Step 1 of hyperfocus, we learned how to increase your likelihood of achieving a goal by setting an implementation: Decide that when you do X, you’ll do Y. Write down exactly how you plan to implement the habits of mindfulness or meditation into your daily life. For example, you might write: When I brush my teeth every morning, I will practice being mindful.
