## Introduction

Rupi Kaur experienced oppression and abuse throughout her life. From an uncle who raped her as a child to a father who demanded she stay silent, she grew up in an environment that taught her she was worthless. **However, as she grew up, her experiences with love and heartbreak taught her how to find the beauty in herself and how to heal in the face of painful experiences.**

(Shortform note: This summary has been written to be as objective as possible. However, poetry naturally lends itself to individual interpretation. This summary is one interpretation of the work's themes and isnâ€™t meant to be definitive.)
