## Chapter 4: Healing and Moving On

**As she moved on from her first love, Kaur learned that the key to happiness in life is self-love.** Throughout her childhood, she felt defined by her surroundings. In her relationship, she felt defined by her lover. With distance from both of those, she realized the only person who could define who she was as a human being was herself.

### Finding Self-Love

Kaur saw that there was no use in clinging on to someone who didn’t want her in return.**In fact, she realized that there was no use entering a relationship at all until she loved herself.** She concluded that the only way to have a healthy relationship was to embrace that she deserved more than love that hurt her.

While she felt lonely after the breakup, she found that waiting for someone to make her feel whole was a futile task. She realized that the cure to loneliness isn’t finding another person to complete you. **It’s embracing that you are a complete human being without anyone else.** If you learn to love yourself when you’re alone, the feelings of loneliness won’t feel as crushing. Other people can complement your strengths, but they can’t give you the things you think you lack.

Kaur views pain as part of being human. Everyone experiences pain. **It’s what you do with it that counts.** She used her pain to strengthen her resolve and accept that she deserved to love herself and reject the people that hurt her. She saw every experience as a chance for gratitude. When she got hurt, she saw it as an opportunity to learn. When she was given love, she embraced it with open arms.

She realized that her self-love taught other people how to love her. The more she valued herself, the more others valued her. This wasn’t because she changed anything about herself. Rather, her best qualities began to rise to the surface because they were no longer bogged down by insecurity.

**Despite her pain, Kaur insists that everyone should love passionately and wholeheartedly.** She insists that nothing else matters if you can’t offer and accept love. You could have the greatest job in the world and make obscene amounts of money, but, without love, you’ll never feel fulfilled.

### Claiming Her Femininity

She recognized the misogynistic ways of her former lover as well as the other men in her life. Once, her lover told her that she wasn’t like other girls. Kaur hated this phrase as it implied that the only way she could be loved was to be different from other women. It was as if he were saying women are typically undesirable.

**Following her breakup, she embraced her femininity.** She realized that she was not owned by any man. She began to love her body, and she saw that she could do with it as she pleased. She learned to love the things about her body that others hated. She discovered a lot of her identity by embracing the things others may view as ugly or problematic such as her period, her body hair, and her stretch marks. She explains that every person is born beautiful, but society convinces them that they aren’t.

**Kaur cries for women to begin embracing their own beauty and stop judging other women.** She believes every woman is different, and what women do with their bodies is their business. With this in mind, she calls for women to support each other and value one another for their intellect and resilience instead of just their looks. Instead of tearing each other down, she calls for women to celebrate each other’s success and raise each other up during their struggles.

#### Women of Color

**Kaur believes that society tends to see her physical traits and those of her fellow women of color as undesirable.** She explains that her hooked nose, dark complexion, and strong legs are often seen as ugly in North American culture. She rejects this premise. As she began to love herself and her body, she embraced her racial and cultural qualities as beautiful and as something that connected her to her rich ancestry.

She uses her surname (Kaur) to reflect on the struggles and beauty of her ancestors. On her journey of self-love, she used the strength of all of the women who came before her to remind herself of the following:

  * She has a duty to support other women.
  * She is as powerful as any man.
  * She is her own unique person.
  * Her cultural and gender identity makes her beautiful.



(Shortform note: the surname “Kaur” was historically given to all female Sikhs in 1699 by the 10th Guru in Sikhism—Guru Gobind Singh Ji. The name literally translates to “princess” and was championed as a symbol of gender and class equality in the Sikh faith.)
