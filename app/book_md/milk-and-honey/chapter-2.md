## Chapter 2: Love and Sex

As Kaur got older, she began to discover the true meaning of love. **Though her trauma initially created significant obstacles, she began to break down those barriers through her recognition of the power of mothers and her first significant relationship.**

### The Power of Mothers

When her mother was pregnant with her sister, Kaur asked how her mother had gotten so large so quickly. Her father explained that a woman’s body is the closest thing to God on earth because it produces life. **This revelation made Kaur see the female body as powerful for the first time in her life.**

When she was young, Kaur struggled to understand how a mother could focus all of her love and energy into a child without expecting anything in return. She couldn’t relate to it, but she was intrigued by it. **She looked to her loving mother for guidance, especially when it came to love.** When discussing romantic relationships, her mother insisted that she marry the type of man that Kaur would be proud to have as a son.

### Falling in Love

**The first serious love of Kaur’s life focused on her intellect before her body.** They would read together and talk about their hopes and dreams. He related to her struggles and helped her work through them. He was able to take the rage she inherited from her father and calm her down. He was grounded and authentic. To her, the very sound of his name either excited her or made her long for him. She finally met a man whom she could love without being silenced or hurt. While she had been in previous relationships, none had ever been like this.

As their relationship blossomed, Kaur realized that she wanted their love to be complementary, not codependent. To do that, she began to love herself and give herself the value that had been stripped away when she was a child.**** She was no longer _“nothing.”_ She knew that she was something, and, with his support, she became a more confident and complete woman.

When they were finally ready to have sex, it was passionate and loving. **Where her abuse had once kept her from experiencing love and sex as one, she finally began to draw the connections with this man.** To her, their foreplay was like making music and their intimacy was like dancing. Because she felt empowered by sex, she enjoyed the intimacy rather than fearing the loss of control. In fact, she began to view sex as passion rather than obligation. Even when they fought, they would always return to sex as a way to remind each other of the passion both of them felt.
