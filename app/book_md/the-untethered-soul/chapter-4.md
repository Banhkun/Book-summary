## Chapter 4: Falling and Rising

Just like your cycles of closing and opening, for most of us, life is a recurring cycle of falling and rising. We cycle repeatedly into states of unhappiness and dysfunction and then rise again to a relative state of clarity and ease. It’s a traumatic and futile way to live. But fortunately, it doesn’t have to be like this.

### How You Fall

**The fall into unhappiness is actually a fall into unawareness.** Here’s how it happens:

  * You encounter a trigger (something that activates one of your Samskaras) and get pulled down into the disturbed energy. 
  * From there, you see everything through the negative energy’s distorted haze. Even beautiful and enjoyable things now appear ugly and depressing. Your experience has become polluted with negativity.
  * Eventually, the negativity plays itself out and subsides. You drift back upward toward relatively undisturbed awareness. The length of the cycle depends on the depth and strength of the energy blockage that caused the disturbance.



A series of cascading crises can occur if your life hits another blockage while you’re already down and you make life decisions from that negative state. Now you’re not just fallen, you’re caught in a downward spiral. Thoughts may come about changing your life, leaving your spouse, quitting your job, because you mistakenly see the outer circumstance as the cause of your problem. But when you act from that inner darkness, you don’t solve anything. In fact, you intensify the problem and fall to an even lower level, because now you’re putting the negativity out and stimulating reactions in kind from others. You misunderstand people’s words and motivations. You speak harshly. You act unwisely. You burn bridges. And whatever you put out into the world comes back.

**Falling and rising is all about fear and resistance: You fall because you fear life and therefore resist it.** Change is the nature of life, but you fear change because of its inherent uncertainty, so you use your mind to create a false world of static stability. Recall the way your inner roommate fears the world and wants to experience a “safer” (mentally interpreted). You fail to realize that with this mental ruse, you actually _make_ the world a scary place. Instead of recognizing fear as just another object that you can release, you unconsciously hold onto it and spend energy trying not to stimulate it. This leads you to project your fear onto the outer world and see the world itself as the source. You’ve just created another trigger.

**You thus end up defining reality according to your own inner problems: What doesn’t disturb you is okay. What disturbs you isn’t okay.** So you try to arrange people, places, and things so they don’t trigger your sense of being disturbed, and in doing this you make life itself into a threat. This means the cause of literally every problem—prejudices, negative emotions, whatever—is fear.

### How to Stop Falling

**Freedom from fear is possible, and thus freedom from falling is possible. It simply means refusing to fight with life.** Think of the whole thing as a game in which an important law is: When life hits your stored negativity (your heart blocks), let the negativity go right then, because it will be harder to do it later. The operative principles are as follows:

  * First, recognize there’s something you need to release.
  * Second, be aware that the “stuff” that comes up inside you is distinct from you-who-notice-it. Remember that you’re the objective witness.
  * Third, let the stuff go. Let it flow through you and dissipate.



### How to Fall Upward

You can actually learn to “fall upward” into ever more delightful levels of enlightenment. The whole purpose of spiritual evolution is to remove your blockages and set you free. Spiritual growth comes when you recognize and embrace life’s assault on these blockages.

**Life will inevitably hit your triggers. This also means life will automatically and effortlessly bring liberation if you let it**. Just surrender. Let your blockages and disturbances become the very fuel for your journey to freedom as your act of releasing them propels you upward into clarity and joy. Real transformation comes from accepting your personal problems as the change agents that precipitate your growth. If you fail sometimes in this practice and find yourself falling downward again, just let that go, too. Failures are nothing but more fuel for the upward journey.

In Chapter 11 you’ll learn more about rising and falling by learning about the Tao, the Middle Way, and how to align yourself with it.
