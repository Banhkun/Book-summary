## Exercise: Face Your Pain

In Chapter 7, you learned that any behavior pattern for avoiding stored up pain will actually become a doorway for that pain to enter your life. For example, if you’re sensitive about your weight, you’ll experience pain every time the subject of your weight comes up. This exercise will help you to identify and deal with your own pain points.

* * *

What’s one area of your life where you’re especially sensitive and liable to feel pain? (Is it shame over your appearance? Lack of self-confidence?)

How have you inadvertently built pain points through your life around this pain? In what areas have you arranged your life—your interpersonal relationships, your schedule, your career, your thoughts—around the desire to avoid the pain?

What specific events and encounters in your daily life might be useful opportunities to release this pain because they tend to bring it up?
