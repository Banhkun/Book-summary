## Exercise: Open Your Heart

In Chapter 3, you learned about inner energy and the way your spiritual heart either blocks it or lets it flow. This exercise leads you to become more acquainted with your heart and its blockages.

* * *

What are some typical situations where you feel your inner energy flow freely? (What situations tend to make you feel inspired, joyful, confident?)

What situations have become triggers for blocking your inner energy flow? (What are some typical situations where you feel your energy vanish so that you feel drained, depressed, and defeated?)

Pick one of your low-energy situations and reflect on it. Why _that_ situation? What life experiences have created this Samskara? What negative emotion is involved? (Anger? Jealousy? Fear?)

Focusing your attention on the blockage will actually activate the stored negative energy. Do that now. But donâ€™t react to the energy that arises. Instead, just feel it and observe it. Then report: What happens to the negative energy when you do this?
