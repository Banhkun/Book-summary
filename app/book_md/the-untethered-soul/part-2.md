## Part 2: Metaphors and Applications | Chapter 6: Awake in the Dream

Part 1 of this summary taught you the basic principles of spiritual awakening. Part 2 processes these principles through a succession of metaphors to clarify their application to various parts of your life.

### The Metaphor: You’re Lost in a Dream

**An accurate way to characterize your regular daily experience is to say that you’re sleepwalking through life. You’re essentially lost in a dream.** Your ability to get “lost” like this is a native one that you’ve had since birth. When you focus consciousness intensely on any object, you lose your sense of self-awareness in it. For example, when you really get into reading a book, you “lose” yourself in it and don’t notice the book or your surroundings. The same thing happens when you watch a movie. The same thing happens in daily life when you lose yourself in the flow of objects and events around you.

Notice especially that you don’t just lose yourself in external objects. This happens not just with physical objects but with mental objects (thoughts and emotions), which are often caused by outer events. Remember the three layers or levels of experience: thoughts, emotions, and sensory impressions. Your consciousness is able to focus on objects at all three levels

**You could also say that you’re lost in an all-encompassing movie.** It’s a movie that uses not only sight and sound but your other senses. And even more, it’s a movie that “projects” onto your thoughts and emotions. These components are all synchronized. No object of your consciousness deviates from the story, so the story completely envelopes you. There’s not even a “you” left who could think an independent thought such as, “I don’t like this movie, I want out,” because your thoughts are the movie’s thoughts.

### The Application: You Can Wake Up

**The phenomenon of lucid dreaming offers a useful analogy for spiritual awakening from this state of unconsciousness.** In a lucid dream, you become aware that you’re dreaming as opposed to being fully immersed. Similarly, you wake up in the dream of your life by learning to reverse the direction of awareness so that you “shine its light” not on any object of consciousness, but back upon consciousness itself. You become aware of your awareness. It’s like being lost in a movie but then “coming to yourself” and remembering that you’re watching a fictional story on a screen. Remember the lessons of the master question (“Who am I?”): When you wake up spiritually, you live your daily life in awareness of yourself as the witnessing subject who experiences the flux of things instead of being fully immersed in them.

When you wake up spiritually, you see and experience your life in a different way. **You realize that the person you’ve always thought of as yourself is, in essence, just a dream or a movie. It’s a movie titled [Insert Your Name].**
