## Exercise: Meet Your Inner Roommate

Chapter 1 taught you to become aware of your “inner roommate” so that you can escape its control. This exercise will help you to apply this awareness.

* * *

Mentally “step back” and pay attention to your inner roommate’s voice. What does it talk about? What kind of personality do its words reveal? (Is your inner roommate angry? Arrogant? Self-pitying?)

Remember, your inner roommate is neurotic. When it narrates your experience, it spins everything in a dysfunctional way. What particular hangups does your inner roommate impart to you? (What’s it neurotic about? Your job? Your physical appearance? Your intelligence? Your self-worth?)

Personify your inner roommate: Imagine it as someone sitting next to you. What does it look like? How does it act?

How would it affect your day if this person, with its unhealthy words and behavior, accompanied you everywhere and interpreted your life for you?
