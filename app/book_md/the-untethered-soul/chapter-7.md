## Chapter 7: Your Inner Thorn

**For true spiritual growth, you must come to peace with pain, because you’ve built your whole life on it.** From childhood, you have unconsciously built your thoughts, actions, and beliefs around avoiding a layer of pain in your heart. Your personality, behavior patterns, way of dressing and talking—you built them all on avoiding pain. Spiritual growth requires you to embrace this pain, and more, to transcend it.

### The Metaphor: You Have an Inner Thorn

For a more vivid understanding of your pain and its effects, imagine that you have a thorn embedded in your arm, right on a nerve. It’s a serious, impairing problem. Should you handle the pain by removing the thorn, or by making sure nothing touches it?

If you decide to protect the thorn, this work will consume your life. **Any behavior pattern for avoiding pain will actually become a doorway for that pain to enter, because when you attempt to avoid your deep pain, you build layers of sensitivity around it.**

In real life, you have just such a thorn. It’s made up of your Samskaras, those blocked energies in your heart from stored-up past impressions. This is why your days are precarious as you navigate through potential pain points at every turn: You’ve chosen to protect your thorn, so you’ve made your life a minefield of pain.

For example, if your pain is about feelings of rejection, you may build a busy social schedule. You may dress, act, and talk in ways that your mind thinks will earn your friends’ approval. And with these instinctive actions, you’ve now sensitized all of these areas with your original pain, so that any one of them can now make you suffer. Other real-life examples might include sensitivities about loneliness, your physical appearance, your level of ability, or your intelligence. You have the same two choices with all: Either build your life around protecting yourself from the pain, or remove its source.

**If you choose a life of protecting your thorn, you’ll build a thorn-shaped life as your daily actions revolve around shielding the painful spot.** Your thoughts and relationships will be about it. Your whole life will become a reflection of it. Instead of solving the problem, you’ll make it the center of your universe. For example, if you suffer from loneliness, but instead of removing that thorn, you build your life around protecting yourself from the pain, you might keep people at a distance. You might marry someone who makes you feel the least lonely, but then you’ll spend your whole marriage trying to please your spouse in order to avoid abandonment. And/or you’ll create a permanent state of emotional distance to preemptively protect yourself while making manipulative attempts to ensure the other person’s devotion. Your life will be shaped around your thorn.

### The Application: You Can Remove Your Thorn

To free yourself from a life of pain, employ the principles that you’ve already learned in this book, which can take on a variety of practical forms.

**Use the events and encounters of your daily life as opportunities for liberation** (remember Chapter 5 on nonresistance and unconditional happiness). Even watching a television show where the story arouses the pain of an inner thorn represents a chance for you to release the pain. Learn to watch the sensitive part of you. Notice when it’s feeling a disturbance, such as jealousy, lack, or fear. Use these opportunities as they arise.

**Release the initial pain early to avoid being trapped in the long term.** The longer you wait, the harder it will be to let it go. Remember, if you let your spiritual heart close around something, you’ll be psychologically sensitive about that thing going forward.

**Learn that it’s okay to feel inner disturbances because they don’t disturb the seat of your consciousness**. This is true freedom, the kind that comes not from solving your problems on the level where they present themselves, but from transcending them. Rest in the fact that you aren’t the pain of your thorn, nor are you the thorn itself. Instead, you’re the one who sees these things. And since inner thorns are just blocked energy from the past, you can release them. You don’t have to fear them. They’re just more things to be observed in the universe. View pain as energy passing through your heart before the gaze of consciousness. Instead of contracting and closing and damming up the energy, relax and let it go. Sometimes you can feel a palpable heat inside you as you release pain. It’s called “The fire of yoga,” and it’s the feeling of pain being purified. Learn to enjoy it.

Finally,**get some perspective.** Go outside on a clear night and look up. Cultivate a proper sense of the massive scale of the universe and your relative insignificance within it. Do you really need—do you really want—to spend your life avoiding pain by choosing certain clothes?

#### The Bliss Beyond Pain

**In addition to deep pain, you have beauty, peace, freedom, and ecstasy inside you. They’re on the other side of the pain. You have to go through the pain to find your true greatness.** When you find there’s a vast ocean of love beyond the fear and pain, you’ll encounter breathtakingly beautiful experiences. You’ll forge a personal relationship with this inner force of beauty, and it will replace your current relationship with inner pain. Peace and love will now run your life.
