## Chapter 12: The Return to God

The ultimate goal of spiritual awakening is to return to God. This is where the teaching of death and the current of the Tao are leading you.**** Books and ideas about God disagree with each other, so real knowledge of God only comes from personal experience. **You can only know God accurately from the absolute, omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent center of Being itself—that is, from God’s own perspective.**

### Your Inner Connection

Fortunately, you have a direct inner connection that gives you access to this divine perspective. You can use this connection by employing the lessons you’ve learned in this book. You can disidentify from your body and psyche and find your real identity beyond the personal self. In doing this, you can initiate a transformation in which you release your stored negativity as your spirit drifts upward, away from anxiety, unhappiness, and the other “lower vibrations” of your being toward a life of peace and happiness.

### Divine Union

**From continued practice of these things, an experience of divine union emerges.** The veils of your human mind and heart fall away to reveal the infinite, ineffable joy beyond the finite walls of your psyche. You discover the realm of Heaven, Paradise, Nirvana. You now understand the exalted experiences of divine union that saints and scriptures throughout history—the New Testament, the Kabbalah, the Hindu Vedas, the Sufi mystics—have all talked about, such as Jesus’s assertion that his words and actions were not his own but his Father’s because “I and my Father are one.” Now you know that you’re not separate from God but are like a drop of water returning to the ocean. Your sense of “I,” of separate identity, is swallowed in God.

### Transformation

**The return to God produces an authentic transformation in your experience of life.** You now feel less angry, fearful, resentful, and self-conscious. You’re less reactive because you’re less bound to your earthly self. You begin to center yourself more in your spiritual being, not through effort, but just naturally.

#### Divine Ecstasy

**You now experience the ecstasy that God knows when He looks at the world.** As you return to God through openness and unconditional happiness, you automatically move through the different stages of yoga. Shakti (Spirit) awakens and purifies your mind and heart, enabling you to take pleasure in God’s creation. Waves of positive energy roll through you. In learning to be joyful in all things, you experientially understand the ancient yogic name for God: _Satchitananda_ —being-consciousness-bliss—eternal, conscious joy.

**You walk around feeling openness, lightness, and causeless love—love for no external reason.** You see and know all creation as a proliferation of beauty. You respect and cherish all people and things. You stop judging and differentiating. You see and experience every child, person, leaf, rock, and passing phenomenon as its own object of absolute love. You love everything unconditionally, like the love of a mother for a child who’s mentally or physically challenged. To her, the child is beautiful. She doesn’t see anything wrong with this glorious, beloved child. That’s how God sees all of creation, and how you will see it in union with God.

#### The Love of Christ

This causeless love is the same as that of Christ, who revealed the heart of his Father through a life that was a unified effusion of selfless love and compassion. Christ taught the parable of the prodigal son, who squandered his father’s wealth, but then his father welcomed him back home and treated him better than the son who had stayed. When the woman was caught in adultery, Christ said to the angry crowd, “Whoever is without sin among you, cast the first stone.” As he hung on the cross, Christ said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they’re doing.”

**As you share Christ’s love, you realize that in your daily, practical life you can see with God’s eyes and give with God’s hands.** When you feel God’s love, there’s nothing you wouldn’t give. And you know beyond doubt that these eyes and this generosity are not yours. You could never be the source of such infinite love and compassion

#### Infinite Acceptance

The best analogy for the way God sees and relates to the world and everyone in it, including you, is the sun, which shines equally brightly on all people, good and bad, without discrimination. You can choose to look away from the light and live in darkness, but that doesn’t change the sun. It’s still there, still shining on everyone. When you come to your senses and turn back to the light, there’s no punishment. You don’t have to apologize. Just look up. You can’t offend God. If you feel guilt and shame, that’s just your ego blocking the light. You can’t make God stop loving you. Let go once and for all of the idea of a judgmental God.

As you go forward into a life of spiritual awakening, let this question and realization change everything for you: **Since God exists in eternal ecstasy, when He looks at you, what does He see?**
