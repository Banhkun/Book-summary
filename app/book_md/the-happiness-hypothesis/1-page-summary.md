## 1-Page Summary

One of the primary human impulses is to maximize our happiness. But **our satisfaction in life is driven by our emotions**. And our emotions, in turn, are determined by the ways in which our mental filters cause us to interpret and react to events and situations.

_The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom_ is about how human beings can maximize happiness. It explores how different philosophical traditions have defined happiness throughout human history, places them within an evolutionary framework, and shows how there is a constant back-and-forth between reason and emotion.

Neither western ideas about the fulfillment of goals nor eastern notions about the elimination of desire as being the path to happiness are 100 percent right. The key to happiness is to strike the right balance between the two—to use reason to focus the mind _away_ from desires that will only bring fleeting happiness, while giving in to those desires that will bring lasting fulfillment.

### The Rider and the Elephant

Before we can really delve into how you can maximize your own happiness, we need to understand the basic divisions that characterize the human brain—because the brain is home to the neurological and psychological mechanisms that determine how we experience the world.

**The most apt metaphor for thinking about the human mind is of a human rider sitting atop an elephant**. The rider, representing reason, can do her best to attempt to direct the elephant. But the elephant, representing emotion, is far more powerful and has its own will; it will only comply with the rider’s commands _if_ those commands are not in conflict with its desire.

But we should be careful not to overgeneralize. **Reason and emotion are not mutually exclusive or engaged in some zero-sum contest against one another**. While emotion is usually the senior partner in the relationship, it is a partnership nonetheless. The two work together—reason enhances our emotional intelligence and our emotional intelligence strengthens our powers of reason.

First, we’ll need to delve into some evolutionary anthropology to establish why the elephant is so much more powerful than the rider. Understanding the dynamics of this fundamental division within our brains will guide our analysis of human happiness. Once we do that, we’ll be able to explore specific strategies for maximizing happiness.

In general, these strategies are centered around:

  * Overcoming negativity by moving to the upper range of your affective style
  * Practicing reciprocity and tearing down self-delusions
  * Desiring the right things
  * Improving your relationships
  * Learning to overcome adversity
  * Cultivating your virtues
  * Discovering the divine or sacred in your life
  * Living a purposeful life



Our analysis of all these strategies will blend insights from positive psychology, ancient and modern philosophy and religion, and evolutionary anthropology.

### The Primacy of Emotion

As humans, we are controlled primarily by our desires, which are driven by our emotions—not our powers of reason. Our emotions determine our opinions and positions on moral questions. It is only _after_ we arrive at these positions that we invent reasons to justify them retroactively.

The automatic system (the elephant) simply responds to stimuli around it and forms judgments and preferences based on what it perceives. And, in a pure contest of wills, the automatic system will nearly always beat the controlled system (the rider). The key is to _change_ the stimuli in your environment into those that will produce desires whose pursuit and fulfillment will lead to true satisfaction. **You can’t master the elephant; but, perhaps, you can change what the elephant _sees_.**

#### Affective Style

**The elephant determines our likes and dislikes, often in ways that we’re not consciously aware of**. These emotional cues color our thinking, causing the elephant to dominate the rider. A perceived threat will make us consciously evaluate _all_ stimuli as possible threats; a rush of sadness will cause us to adopt a more bleak way of looking at the world as a whole. These are the basic mental preconditions that affect _all_ humans.

So, in general, emotion is always a stronger force within the mind than reason. And if we delve a bit further, we discover that an individual's general emotional state isn’t solely determined by the stimuli they encounter; it’s also influenced by a genetic predisposition toward happiness or sadness known as the affective style.

However, your affective style doesn’t set your level of happiness in stone. The affective style is best thought of as a range or emotional thermostat—some people simply have higher happiness levels at the upper end of their range than others. But within those constraints, there’s still great potential for improvement. Even if you have a negative affective style, you can still become happier. Moving to the upper levels of your affective style is akin to taming the elephant and guiding it down a different path. Effective methods for doing this include meditation, cognitive therapy, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

### The Reciprocity Reflex

A key factor that affects our happiness is the strength of our connections to other people. And reciprocity—the phenomenon by which we treat others as we have been treated by them—is one of the strongest ties that bind society together.

The reciprocity reflex tells us to repay others when they do something for us.**** From an evolutionary perspective, it works because it increases _everyone’s_ chances of survival. The reciprocity reflex causes the other members of the group to help you if you have helped them, creating networks of mutual obligation. These are the seeds of altruism.

#### Self-Delusion

But there is a flaw in this. Because reality is filtered through the lens of our mental perceptions, we are vulnerable to deception. **_Real_ altruism may not matter as much as behavior that we _perceive_ to be altruistic on the part of others**. There is a real advantage for those who can manipulate the reciprocity reflex to _appear_ to be fair, while actually reaping the benefits of being selfish. If there's a food drive happening in your neighborhood, for example, you can curry favor with your peers by telling people you contributed to it even if you didn’t. You get the goodwill (and future reciprocity) of your neighbors without having to sacrifice anything.

And, while we may enjoy pointing out the hypocrisy of others and relish the feeling of moral superiority that it gives us, we are _all_ hypocrites who excel at inventing rationales for why whatever _we’re_ doing is virtuous. This is the rider acting as a sort of chief counsel for the elephant—i.e., the conscious, rational mind manufacturing reasons to justify what the emotional, impulsive part of ourselves wants to do.

**To pierce through our self-delusions, we must _recognize_ our perceptions for what they are—just perceptions**. Stop treating the rider as chief counsel and start taking responsibility for your thoughts and behavior. Look at past conflicts with other people and find where _you_ were wrong. There were probably times where you said hurtful things or violated your own moral code through your actions. Once you’ve done this, you can recalibrate your mental filters and finally disengage from judgment, self-delusion, and attempts to manipulate others.

This will make people value their interactions with you more because you’ll be acting as a genuinely open and empathetic person. And, because of the reciprocity reflex, they’ll start doing the same for you—which will make for better and happier relationships, for you and them.

### The Fleeting Joy of Achievement

Many religious traditions teach that self-denial is the route to happiness. Buddhism famously encourages its adherents to break all emotional attachments to things and refrain from all attempts to attain what they don’t have. Striving, according to this view, is the source of human unhappiness. But some things _are_ worth striving for. The key is not to eliminate desire; it’s to start desiring the _right_ things.

Our brains evolved to respond to immediate pleasures like food or sex (which both advance species success) with jolts of dopamine, which serve as a reinforcement mechanism. But the effects of any reinforcement mechanism are immediate and short-lived. **The pleasure, instead, comes from the baby steps you take along the way. This is known as the progress principle.** As a corollary, no single event is likely to permanently alter your affective style, because you’ll just reach a new plateau. _This_ idea is known as the adaptation principle.

#### Striving for the Right Things

The progress and adaptation principles have important things to teach us about how we can increase our happiness. They tell us to focus more on the road to achieving a goal, not on the goal itself. Although some conditions of life are beyond the ability of an individual to alter, **there are changes you can make to your life circumstances to bring lasting happiness.**

Simple things like reducing exposure to unwanted noise, cutting down on commuting time, improving one’s perceived body deficiencies (like being overweight or being too skinny), and introducing more autonomy in one’s life have been shown to make people happier in the long term. Most of all, **meaningful and joyful connections to other people are central to happiness._These_** are the things we should all strive for.

**People are happiest when doing a task that is difficult, but closely aligned to their strengths**. For a bodybuilder, this might be lifting a heavy weight; for a violinist, it might be practicing a particularly complex piece of music. Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called this state “flow,” or what we might call “being in the zone.”

The key to flow is that you are receiving constant positive feedback; the _progress_ toward the goal sustains you. In flow, the elephant and rider are perfectly synchronized, with the elephant chasing what it wants and the rider guiding it along and spurring it to action.

Another effective way you can boost your happiness through striving for the right things is by shifting from conspicuous consumption to inconspicuous consumption. Conspicuous consumption is when we buy visible, materialistic things for the purpose of demonstrating our wealth, prestige, or status to others. Inconspicuous consumption, by contrast, refers to the kind of spending we do for _our_ benefit, on things that make us intrinsically happy.**** These are things, such as vacations, that we value for their own sake, not for what they convey about us relative to other people.

Embracing, in moderation, the pleasures of life and forging meaningful attachments is a key part of what it is to _be_ human.**Happiness can come from within; but it also comes from without.**

### Attachment Theory

People with lots of meaningful relationships and connections to other people have been shown to have better health outcomes and report being happier. But how do we form those connections? It turns out that a great deal of our relationship success later in life hinges on the quality of our connections as children.

**Attachment theory states that children have two primary needs—safety and exploration**. From an evolutionary perspective, both are necessary. Safety guarantees survival, while exploration enables children to develop the skills they need to succeed as adults and have children of their own.

This knowledge that the parent will always be there to act as a guardrail gives the child the sense of security she needs to develop independence. Accordingly, when children are deprived of their attachment figures, they become insecure and unable to develop the emotional security and independence needed to thrive in adulthood. Unconditional love does not inhibit the development of independence; it’s what makes it possible in the first place.

Thus, providing unconditional love to children will enable them to form healthy, stable connections as adults. Indeed, the research shows that **our childhood attachment styles carry forward into our adult romantic relationships** , setting the pattern for how we form bonds with other people for the rest of our lives.

### The Case For Adversity

In thinking about how to maximize our happiness, we have to consider what makes us _unhappy_.

Research suggests that **human beings need some amount of struggle in their lives in order to reach their full potential.** People who suffer setbacks, even tragedies like the loss of a loved one, often find new strengths as a result of their experience.

**Trauma survivors discover that they have a much stronger network of people who love and care for them than they previously thought**. This discovery activates the reciprocity reflex—we feel a deeper love for and connection to people in our social network and want to foster even closer ties with them. And because we come to value these relationships more, we devote more of our energies to cultivating them, instead of seeking money or possessions.

Setbacks can alter one’s life story or self-narrative. This is the rider’s domain, the conscious reality we construct for ourselves about who we are and how we got to be that way. The experience of triumph over loss**** enables us to replace a story about our frustrated hopes or positive experiences turned sour with a more compelling story about overcoming adversity and using that experience to learn compassion and empathy for others. And in the end, this is a more fulfilling story to have about ourselves.

**Our teenage years in particular are the period in our lives when our self-narratives begin to truly coalesce** and some of our most important life experiences take place. Events that happen during this time are those we revisit the most throughout the rest of our lives, serving as a constant point of self-reference. Accordingly, some adversity in one’s teenage and early adulthood years, if properly overcome, can provide a real character-building boost to people later in life.

### Cultivating Virtue

So far, we’ve talked mostly about how our interpretations of events or our relationships with other people influence our happiness. But we should also look inward. What are the innate qualities we should possess if we wish to be happy?

**Virtue is defined as the cultivation of the best version of oneself**. It is about fulfilling your potential, engaging in constant self-improvement, and striving toward the acquisition of a set of positive attributes or qualities. The specific virtues you aim for depend on your particular strengths and interests. The key to cultivating virtue—and, thus, cultivating happiness—is improvement, be it moral, intellectual, or even physical. And it’s intimately linked to human happiness.

Western moral philosophy, unfortunately, gives pride of place to rationalism and science. This has inculcated in the Western mind an aversion toward ideas of virtue based in feeling and habit.**** For the celebrants of reason, feeling was something to be conquered and overcome; the rider had to _master_ the elephant, not merely coordinate with it. But **you don’t _reason_ your way toward good morals; instead, cultivating virtues leads you to _use_ the powers of reason in a way that will lead to moral actions**.

#### Positive Psychology

Positive psychology links ancient virtue theories with our modern understanding of how the human mind works. Positive psychology **attempts to _elevate_ the human experience and cultivate excellence, instead of merely treating disorder**. The field identifies**** six core virtues that are celebrated across all civilizations:

  * Wisdom: being intellectually curious and emotionally intelligent
  * Justice: being fair
  * Temperance: exercising self-control 
  * Courage: showing perseverance and commitment to principles
  * Humanity: displaying kindness and love
  * Transcendence: appreciating beauty



The cultivation of these virtues should be a joyful, enlightening experience. You are focusing on things you enjoy, which is intrinsically rewarding. The cultivation of virtue is its own reward.

### Elevation and Religion

Some of our most powerful moments of joy come from our experiences with the divine or spiritual. We experience a sense of uplifting when we witness someone doing a good deed; we are often driven by a desire to follow suit and do good deeds of our own. It is often closely linked to religious or spiritual experiences that bring us closer to the realm of the divine. This is elevation,**** the feeling you get when you are:

  * Experiencing awe and wonder by sharing moments of transcendence with others
  * Becoming attuned with the most noble parts of yourself; and
  * Witnessing phenomena that are larger than yourself and beyond the capacity of your limited mental structures to fully process



**The feeling of experiencing God’s love as part of a congregation is a common manifestation of elevation**. It’s why religion is found in every culture at every time across the world; it fulfills a basic human need to connect with something greater.

We’ve seen how important attachments and connections are to any individual’s enjoyment of life. By binding the individual to a community, connecting that individual to a higher purpose, and facilitating intrinsically rewarding altruistic behavior toward members of the group, religion has served as a great facilitator of human happiness.

### Occupational Self-Direction

**One of the essential conditions for a satisfied life is meaningful work.** The most meaningful and satisfying work is that which people find intrinsically rewarding. Humans desire occupational self-direction—work that is complex and challenging, engages their interests or talents, and allows for a high degree of independence and autonomy. This kind of work harnesses the progress principle to maximize our happiness, rewarding us for each baby step we take toward the goal.

### The Key to Happiness

**We are responsible for creating the conditions for our own happiness**. It is about finding the right balance between connecting to your community and connecting to yourself. Happiness comes from your attachments to the world around you, but it also comes from the cultivation of inner virtues—training the elephant to explore its full potential, while respecting its power over the rider.

But by aligning the rider with the elephant, you will discover your own path to purpose, meaning, and, ultimately, happiness.
