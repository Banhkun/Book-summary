## Chapter 3: Do Unto Others

**Another key factor that affects our happiness is the strength of our connections to other people**. And reciprocity—the phenomenon by which we treat others as we have been treated by them—is one of the strongest ties that bind society together. In this chapter, we’ll explore the origins of reciprocity, why it acts as such a strong binding agent, and how it shapes and governs our happiness by strengthening our relationships with other people.

### The Reciprocity Reflex

Kin altruism is the mechanism by which individuals care for and protect individuals within their kin group (those with whom they share a blood relation). It’s observed in the behavior of many non-human animals and can be explained by simple Darwinian instincts: if the ultimate goal is to ensure the survival of one’s genes, it makes sense to be altruistic toward other members of the kin group.

But this does not fully explain the _human_ phenomenon of reciprocity as we observe it. Humans, unlike other animals, work with, care for, and protect people with whom they have minimal or no blood relation. If anything, such behavior cuts _against_ Darwinian impulse, as these other people are our “competitors” for scarce resources and their survival could be construed as hampering our own. Clearly, something else is going on.

**What separates us from these other animals is the reciprocity reflex. This tells us to repay others when they do something for us.** It’s so deeply ingrained that we hardly think about it, yet we practice it all the time. When a friend treats you to lunch, you make sure you pick up the check the next time you go out; when your neighbors invite you to a party, you invite them the next time you’re hosting an event.

We have an instinct to repay favors, even from strangers. From an evolutionary perspective, it works because it increases _everyone’s_ chances of survival. The reciprocity reflex causes the other members of the group to help you if you have helped them, creating networks of mutual obligation.

This reflex is supported by two emotional sub-reflexes—gratitude and vengeance. Gratitude causes us to aid those who’ve aided us in the past; vengeance causes us to withhold aid from those who’ve been stingy or selfish, making it less likely that free riders will exploit the community’s altruism. This opens up the possibility of mutually beneficial cooperation, which makes the group as a whole stronger and strengthens social ties between members of a community.

(Shortform note: For a fuller discussion of reciprocity, read our summary of Robert Cialdini’s Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.)

#### Altruism and Happiness

Will self-sacrifice for others (which has become synonymous with morality in much of western thought) also be self-rewarding?

To answer that, we should briefly look at the two main explanations for why humans engage in altruistic behavior.

  * The first has its roots in evolution—your genes are more likely to survive if you’re altruistic toward people in your kin group. Reciprocity is also important, as others will respond to your self-sacrifice on their behalf by returning the favor for you.
  * The second explanation is religious, namely, that you’ll be rewarded in the afterlife or in your next life by being altruistic (think of the Judeo-Christian concept of heaven and hell or the Hindu idea of karma).



But these do not fully explain the altruistic behavior we see; we often act altruistically even when there is no chance of reciprocity or direct benefit for ourselves, including people who don’t believe in an afterlife. Something else must be at work. Altruism must provide us with more intrinsic benefits.

And, in fact, studies have shown that **engaging in altruistic behavior _does_ lead to an increase in all measures of happiness.** This is especially true for older adults; because they are lonelier and have reduced social networks, altruism widens their circle and gives them new sources of comfort, as well as purpose.

Thus, while morality certainly encompasses far more than just altruism, we should not take that to mean that we _shouldn’t_ be altruistic. By doing good for others, we are doing good for ourselves.

### The Power of Gossip

**One of the most prominent and important manifestations of the reciprocity reflex is gossip—the sharing of social information about people**. When someone tells you something about someone else, the reciprocity reflex causes you to share what _you_ know about people in your community with that person.

This sharing of social information was likely an important element in contributing to group survival for early humans, enabling scarce resources to be shared more efficiently and potential threats to be identified more easily. Further, it reinforced positive social norms by making our ancestors aware of the misdeeds of people _outside_ the immediate kin group whom they may not have personally known—bolstering both altruism and the reciprocity reflex by ensuring that selfish people didn’t receive cooperation, while altruistic people did.

In fact, evolutionary psychology suggests that gossip may have been one of the earliest purposes of language itself. The sharing of important social information that it facilitated enabled humans to survive in larger and larger social groups. And as we came to live in settled agricultural communities where we needed to interact with greater numbers of people, natural selection favored the evolution of larger brains to accommodate for new and necessary cognitive tools like language.

(Shortform note: To learn more about the function of gossip in early human societies, read our summary of Yuval Noah Harari’s Sapiens.)

### Faking Altruism

As we’ve seen, being a cooperative and altruistic person will generally lead to better outcomes for you, because (thanks to the reciprocity reflex) people will be more likely to repay you with their own cooperation and altruism.

But there is a flaw in this. Because reality is filtered through the lens of our mental perceptions, we are vulnerable to deception. **_Real_ altruism may not matter as much as behavior that we _perceive_ to be altruistic on the part of others**. Indeed, there is a real advantage for those who can manipulate the reciprocity reflex to _appear_ to be fair, while actually reaping the benefits of being selfish. If there's a food drive happening in your neighborhood, for example, you can curry favor with your peers by telling people you contributed to it even if you didn’t. You get the goodwill (and future reciprocity) of your neighbors without having to sacrifice anything.

While this may give us a temporary boost of happiness (because we get to have our cake and eat it too), it also degrades the quality of our interactions with others, as people begin to sense that we’re manipulating them. As we’ll see, a better path to happiness is to be genuine and open with others, which (because of reciprocity) will make them want to do the same for you.

### The Rider as Chief Counsel

While we may enjoy pointing out the hypocrisy of others and relish the feeling of moral superiority that it gives us, we are _all_ hypocrites, excoriating others for behavior that we ourselves engage in. We are able to do this without suffering cognitive dissonance because we are masters at inventing rationales for why whatever _we’re_ doing is virtuous (or at the very least justifiable).

If we return to our central metaphor, this is the rider acting as a sort of chief counsel for the elephant—in other words, **the conscious, rational mind manufacturing reasons to justify what the emotional, impulsive part of ourselves wants to do.**

It is closely related to the psychological phenomenon of motivated reasoning, whereby people seek out pseudo-evidence and ignore contradictory evidence in order to reach the conclusion that they want to reach. And because we can always cherry-pick to find _some_ supporting evidence to justify the conclusions we want to reach, it confirms our self-delusion that our reasoning is objective.

It goes back to our earlier point in Chapter 1 about the primacy of emotion—it is the emotional core of the self (the elephant) that shapes our rational thinking (the rider), not the other way around.

(Shortform note: To learn more about motivated reasoning, also known as confirmation bias, and other common cognitive biases, read our summary of Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

### Self-Delusion

The irony is that,**despite our own motivated reasoning and self-serving rationalizations, we are very good at identifying this same behavior in _others_.** In one study at Cornell University, students were shown to greatly overestimate their own propensity to give to a philanthropic cause. But these same students were quite accurate with regard to how generous they believed _others_ would be.

Of course, having a positive view of yourself is not inherently a bad thing. Indeed, a positive self-image is strongly correlated with better mental health outcomes. But it can come at a price, namely, creating a sense of over-entitlement. Over-entitled people inflate their own contributions to the group while minimizing or discounting those of others. This makes it unpleasant for others to deal with us, thereby harming our relationships and decreasing our overall level of happiness.

We can see this tendency to overrate our contributions in one 1979 study that analyzed the self-reported contributions of husbands and wives to total household work. When asked what percentage they contributed to maintaining the household, the husband-wife pairs gave answers that added up to more than 120 percent! This would only be possible if each was overrating their own contributions and discounting those of their partner.

#### Naive Realism

Another psychological phenomenon that contributes to self-delusion is naive realism. This is the belief that one’s _own_ opinions are arrived at through a clear and objective study of reality, but that those who disagree are motivated instead by ignorance, prejudice, or self-interest.

**People are quite receptive to information about biases, but only when it provides insight into the behavior and motivations of _others_**. When asked to apply these insights to themselves, however, we are entirely unwilling to examine our own biases. Instead, we persist in the delusion that we are objective, even when confronted with evidence that nearly _everyone_ holds inflated views of themselves. Somehow, each of us clings to the belief that we are the sole exception.

### The Problem of Evil

We can take our analysis of people’s self-serving biases further to discuss the problem of evil.

This is a theological problem that has bedeviled every religion: how could evil exist alongside an all-powerful and benevolent God? If a deity knowingly allows evil, then how could they be benevolent? And if they are unable to prevent or overcome evil, how could they be all-powerful?

But this problem rests on a misconception of what evil really is. In the 1990s, social psychologist Roy Baumeister identified what he called **the myth of pure evil—the idea that people who commit heinous acts do so out of pure cruelty and a desire to hurt.** In his study of both perpetrators and victims of cruelty, Baumeister found that this was rarely the case. Most perpetrators were responding to what they perceived as some injustice done against _them_ ; in their minds, they were the _victims_ , not the perpetrators. It’s another powerful example of how mental filters influence our perceptions of reality.

Baumeister found that there was actually far more nuance and complication surrounding even the most appalling crimes. Murders, for example, were often the end result of an escalating tit-for-tat cycle of aggression and counter-aggression between the perpetrator and ultimate victim (a dreadful manifestation of the reciprocity reflex). Often the murderer could have just as easily ended up as the victim.

**Believing that one’s opponents are pure evil is how perpetrators rationalize extreme acts of violence against their victims.** Idealism is a major driver of this, as _anything_ can be justified to defeat those who stand in the way of one’s utopian vision.

### Seeing Through the Web

Given all the mental filters we’ve explored in this chapter, it’s clear that our picture of reality is distorted by our built-in biases and delusions. Indeed, we are primed to see the world as being filled with insults, grievances, and threats. But these are largely illusory; they are how we _perceive_ the world, not how it actually _is_. So how do we see the truth? How do we free the elephant from the emotional torment of constantly judging likes and dislikes?

**One way to pierce through the psychic web is to simply _recognize_ our perceptions as merely perceptions**. Ancient Hinduism, for example, viewed our experiences of life as a game in which we all play a small, but meaningful part. Its adherents urged people to live life without caring too much about outcomes or judging others.

Most importantly, you can **stop treating the rider as chief counsel and start taking responsibility for your thoughts and behavior.** Look at past conflicts with other people and find where _you_ were wrong. There were probably times where you said hurtful things or violated your own moral code through your actions.

Once you identify these, ignore the natural impulse to rationalize and defend yourself. This doesn’t mean you have to be a pushover; you just need to see where you could have gone wrong. That way, your apology to the other person will be rooted in genuine reflection and empathy. In turn, _their_ instinct for reciprocity will kick in and they will likely follow suit with acknowledgment and reflection of their own. This exchange of empathy and understanding will be mutually beneficial and will serve as a positive template for you to model your interactions and relationships with others going forward.

Once you’ve done this, you can recalibrate your mental filters and finally disengage from judgment, self-delusion, and attempts to manipulate others. This will make people value their interactions with you more because you’ll be acting as a genuinely open and empathetic person. And, because of the reciprocity reflex, they’ll start doing the same for you—which will make for better and happier relationships, for you and them.
