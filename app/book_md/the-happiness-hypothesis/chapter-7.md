## Chapter 7: Cultivate Your Virtues

The concept of virtue is often associated with puritanical values and behaviors like rigid piety and abstinence from sex. But is this really the most useful way to think about virtue?

**Virtue should be defined as the cultivation of the best version of oneself**. It is about fulfilling your potential, engaging in constant self-improvement, and striving toward the acquisition of a set of positive attributes or qualities. The specific virtues you aim for depend on your particular strengths and interests. The key is improvement—be it moral, intellectual, or even physical.

Founding Father Benjamin Franklin was the quintessential self-improver, a man who constantly devoted himself to learning new things and acquiring new skills. Throughout his life, Franklin identified specific virtues that he actively sought to cultivate. In his later years, he looked back on his life with great satisfaction—and attributed his happiness to his relentless pursuit of virtue.

In this chapter, we’ll study this relationship between virtue and happiness, using new insights from the emerging field of positive psychology.

### Ancient Virtue

Of course, the celebration of virtue is hardly new. It goes back to some of the most ancient writings. A range of thinkers from Confucius to Buddha to Aristotle wrote about the need to engage in the right kind of thinking and behavior in order to lead a positive and fulfilling life.

They tended to use allegories, proverbs, and fables to make their points, rather than logical proofs or scientifically tested theories. They put a great deal of stock in behavior, rather than knowledge—it wasn’t what you _knew_ , it was what you _did_. This was why role models were so important in ancient virtue narratives, serving as examples upon which one was supposed to model proper conduct.

From a psychological perspective, this was rather insightful. Moral instruction that guided an individual to develop an intuitive understanding of how to properly conduct oneself in all situations—and to _want_ to do the right thing—demonstrated a sophisticated understanding by the ancient thinkers of the need for the rider to tame the elephant and guide it toward the pursuit of the right things.

### Where the West Went Wrong

Intellectual developments like the Enlightenment and Scientific Revolution, however, set western civilization on a different course. These movements, building on the foundation laid by the ancient Greeks, placed rationalism and science at the center of the western intellectual tradition.

**As a result, western ideas of virtue shifted away from feeling and habit.** For the celebrants of reason, feeling was something to be conquered and overcome; the rider had to _master_ the elephant, not merely coordinate with him. But we know that this is not possible and reflects a misunderstanding of how the human mind works. The elephant leads the rider, not the other way around. While we may think that our beliefs and opinions derive from a rational study of the world around us, they are actually the product of our emotions and mental filters.

Because science and reason can be broadly defined as mankind’s quest to find a small set of rules to explain the infinite phenomena of the universe, western thinkers became myopically focused on the search for a single moral rule that could guide proper conduct in all situations at all times. This search led to two primary schools of thought.

#### Deontology

Kantian ethics (also known as deontology) are based on the ideas of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. **Kant argued that individuals should adhere to a core set of universally applicable moral laws**. Anything that was in violation of these laws would be construed as an immoral act.

Kant was most concerned with individual rights and obligations. He argued that _individual_ moral principles should be judged on the basis of whether or not they would make sense as _universal_ principles.

For example, if you plan to pirate movies because it’s inconvenient and burdensome for you to pay for them, would you then be in favor of a universal law that justifies stealing in _all_ situations where paying for something is inconvenient? If you would not (and most people wouldn’t), then you must judge your own conduct as wrong. As an individual, you would have failed in your duty to behave morally. This test is known as the categorical imperative.

The individual is the fundamental unit in Kantian ethics. Conduct is judged based on whether or not the individual has lived up to their societal duty.

#### Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism, on the other hand, is concerned with outcomes. This school of thought, founded by the English philosopher Jeremy Bentham, claims any action that maximizes human happiness is the morally correct one. Thus, it would be morally correct to kill one person in order to save the lives (and, therefore, increase the happiness) of 10 others.

**Utilitarianism, by its nature, is little concerned with individual rights or the respect that people ought to have for one another**. People are just instruments for the maximization of total happiness. Thus, actions that would be justified under utilitarianism would frequently violate the categorical imperative of deontology.

### The Failure of Moral Reasoning

Deontology and utilitarianism both, however, place little emphasis on character and inner belief.

They are overly concerned with teaching people how to navigate certain moral quandaries or make efficient trade-offs, not with the cultivation of inner virtue.

These attitudes pervaded much of western moral philosophy, teaching people to reason their way into moral conduct. But this approach confuses the rider with the elephant and is thus at odds with how human psychology works. **You don’t _reason_ your way toward good morals; instead, you behave morally first, leading you to _train_ yourself to use your powers of reason toward moral ends**. The elephant leads the rider; it is more important to calibrate one’s emotional desires towards virtuous ends.

Moreover, human beings are shaped by the time, place, and culture in which they live. What was moral to someone living in 8th-century France would not be moral to us, and we shouldn’t attempt to create a universal set of morals that can apply at all times and places. Virtue should be context-specific and grounded in cultural traditions.

#### Freedom From Excess Freedom

Following from this, we should embrace a new concept of morality (or re-embrace an ancient concept of morality) that is more based in group norms. This approach acknowledges the way the human mind actually works and will yield better outcomes for both the individual and society.

**We have lost much of our ancient grounding in group or communal morality as we have shifted to a paradigm that places the freedom of the individual as the highest ideal**. But too much freedom can be harmful, because it unmoors us from rules, norms, and standards of virtue. Even if we have the _freedom_ to do whatever we please, we lack any coherent moral framework to help us _decide_ what we want to do with our lives. Our overabundance of freedom leaves us rootless and untethered.

A shared community understanding of morality is good; we do not want diversity of morality. After all, if moral differences become merely matters of taste or preference, there is no real morality to speak of.

### Positive Psychology: The Science of Elevation

If the ancients evinced a keen understanding of how psychology interacts with morality and subsequent western philosophers led us astray, how do we find our way back? What is the bridge that links ancient virtue theories with our modern understanding of how the human mind works?

The answer lies in the relatively young field of positive psychology. **Positive psychology was founded by Martin Seligman in 1998. It attempts to use psychology to _elevate_ the human experience and cultivate excellence, instead of merely treating disorder**. Seligman and his colleague Chris Peterson combed through the world’s great moral tomes, looking for a common set of virtues celebrated in these texts.

Given that these writings came from every corner of the world across every period of history, the virtues Seligman and Peterson identified weren’t the same across all cultures, and some were emphasized more in one culture than another. But **there were six core virtues that were celebrated across all civilizations** : Below the six virtues are 24 character strengths. By developing these character strengths, an individual can work toward the ultimate cultivation of the virtues.

  * Wisdom
    * Curiosity
    * Love of learning
    * Judgment
    * Ingenuity
    * Emotional intelligence
  * Courage
    * Valor
    * Perseverance
    * Integrity
  * Humanity
    * Kindness
    * Loving 
  * Justice
    * Citizenship
    * Fairness 
    * Leadership 
  * Temperance
    * Self-control
    * Prudence
    * Humility 
  * Transcendence
    * Appreciation of beauty and excellence
    * Gratitude
    * Hope
    * Spirituality
    * Forgiveness
    * Humor
    * Zest 



Most importantly, working toward these virtues should be a joyful, enlightening experience. You are focusing on things you enjoy, which is intrinsically rewarding; in keeping with the progress principle from Chapter 4, you are getting a reward from being on the journey, receiving positive reinforcement for each baby step you take. The cultivation of virtue is its own reward.
