## Exercise: Overcome Self-Delusion

Think about how you can readjust your perceptions.

* * *

Think of a past instance in which you behaved selfishly. How did you rationalize that behavior to yourself at the time?

Do you think that this behavior stemmed from a built-in bias or self-delusion that you believed at the time? Briefly explain.

Think of a conflict you had with another person. Based on what youâ€™ve read in this chapter, can you identify the ways in which you might also have been to blame?
