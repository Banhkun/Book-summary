## Chapter 2: Overcome Negativity

One major stumbling block on our road to happiness is our negativity bias. As we saw in the last chapter, our perceptions and interpretations of the events that we witness determine our reality—not the events themselves. And unfortunately, those interpretations tend toward pessimism and negativity. The key is to shift our mental structures and patterns of thought so that we have more positive and fulfilling interpretations of the events in our lives. In this chapter, we’ll analyze why we have such a strong negativity bias and explore some strategies for overcoming it.

### Negativity Bias

**The elephant determines our likes and dislikes, often in ways that we’re not consciously aware of**. For example, studies have shown that white Americans have an automatic negative reaction when they’re shown black faces or symbols of black culture.

Similarly, people tend to be drawn to things that sound like their own names. People named Dennis are surprisingly overrepresented in the field of dentistry and married couples have been shown to be disproportionately likely to have first names that share the same first letter (like Dan and Dana or Jason and Jessica). Thus, even major life decisions—like what we choose as a career or who we marry—that we _think_ are made consciously and rationally are actually strongly influenced by the likes and dislikes of the unconscious parts of our brains.

This phenomenon comes into play more when we look at the phenomenon of negativity bias. **We are strongly wired to dislike and fear bad things more than we like good things.** This is an inheritance from evolution. For our hominid ancestors, it was far more dangerous to misjudge a risk (like eating a plant that turned out to be poisonous) than it was to miss an opportunity (like failing to spot a new source of water).

The first type of error could lead to instant death; in the second scenario, there was likely another source of water that could be found. Therefore, those individuals who had strong fear and aversion instincts had an inherent advantage that enabled them to pass this quality along to their offspring. It’s why we evolved to startle at sudden noises that frighten us but have no equivalent emotional or physical reaction to _positive_ stimuli. It also informs our strong biases toward loss aversion, whereby we value the avoidance of losses more than we value equivalent gains.

These emotional cues color our thinking, causing the elephant to dominate the rider. A perceived threat will make us consciously evaluate _all_ stimuli as possible threats; a rush of sadness will cause us to adopt a more bleak way of looking at the world as a whole.

(Shortform note: For a more detailed discussion of loss aversion, read our summary of Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

### Affective Style

**The elephant determines our likes and dislikes, often in ways that we’re not consciously aware of**. These emotional cues color our thinking, causing the elephant to dominate the rider. A perceived threat will make us consciously evaluate _all_ stimuli as possible threats; a rush of sadness will cause us to adopt a more bleak way of looking at the world as a whole. These are the basic mental preconditions that affect _all_ humans.

So, in general, emotion is always a stronger force within the mind than reason. And if we delve a bit further, we discover that an individual's general emotional state isn’t solely determined by the stimuli they encounter; it’s also influenced by **a genetic predisposition toward happiness or sadness known as the affective style.**

But we should be clear. Your affective style doesn’t set your level of happiness in stone. The affective style is best thought of as a range or emotional thermostat—some people simply have higher happiness levels at the upper end of their range than others. But within those constraints, there’s still great potential for improvement. Even if you have a negative affective style, you can still become happier**. Moving to the upper levels of your affective style is akin to taming the elephant and guiding it down a different path**. Effective methods for doing this include meditation, cognitive therapy, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

#### Meditation

Meditation, widely practiced in eastern religions, is a way of focusing the mind and blocking out the constant verbal commentary running through one’s head. Typically, it entails sitting still and focusing on a single word or idea. It’s not easy to do at first, but it can be highly effective at breaking attachments (desires for material things, but also certain emotional drives like sex). Such attachments often power our negative thoughts (because we have such a deeply ingrained sense of loss aversion and fear losing those things that we already have).

According to proponents of meditation, eliminating one’s attachments as much as possible will maximize one’s happiness in the long run because the psychological costs of _losing_ are so much higher than the psychological gains of _winning_. Once you acquire things that you become attached to, your mind will be dominated by fear of losing them. Instead, it’s better to shed those attachments entirely.

#### Cognitive Therapy

**People who suffer from negative thinking can also be trapped in a painful and negative feedback loop**. They start with low self-esteem. And because emotion (the elephant) informs rational thought (the rider), these individuals selectively seek out “proof” to confirm their belief that they’re worthless, often by magnifying minor setbacks into major catastrophes. This “proof,” in turn, further reinforces the original negative beliefs.

What can break this pattern is the technique of cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy challenges patients to consciously question their ingrained patterns of negative thinking. Practitioners encourage patients to label these thoughts as they happen and identify more positive and realistic ways of interpreting the events in their lives.

Thus, instead of thinking “I’m stupid and worthless and doomed to a life of failure” after performing poorly on a test, a patient undergoing cognitive therapy might reorient their thinking toward something more along the lines of “It was just one test; it doesn’t define my life.” Over time, the patient’s automatic thought patterns become more positive. In essence, cognitive therapy is the rider training the elephant not to lunge toward fear and sadness.

#### SSRIs

SSRIs (serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are a class of drug that includes Prozac and Zoloft. They have been shown to be remarkably effective in treating many mental health disorders, from clinical depression to eating disorders.

But these drugs have also generated some controversy precisely _because_ they are seen as quick-fixes. Critics worry that SSRIs let people eschew the hard work of becoming “better” people and enable them to transform into something other than their “true” self.

But what if the “self” as it occurs naturally is a vessel for unhappiness and dissatisfaction, as it is in so many people with a negative affective style? If SSRIs can make people more happy, productive, and fulfilled, why are they harmful? We should think of them as purely mechanical—fixing something that’s broken and causing pain. After all, when we change a deflated tire on a car or replace a burned-out lightbulb on a lamp, we don’t decry these actions as altering the “true” nature of the car or the lamp.
