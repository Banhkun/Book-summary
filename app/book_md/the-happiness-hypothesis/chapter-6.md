## Chapter 6: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Stronger

In thinking about how to maximize our happiness, we have to consider what makes us _unhappy_. If we could design the happiest possible lives for ourselves, surely we would opt for one without any setbacks or adversity, in which we get everything we want without having to overcome any struggles.

But this would actually be counterproductive. While the behaviorists in the last chapter were certainly overstating the case when they argued that providing unconditional love to children would render them weak and undeveloped, there is some truth to the idea that **human beings need some amount of struggle in their lives in order to reach their full potential.**

In this chapter, we’ll explore how, under certain circumstances, adversity can be beneficial for human happiness and fulfillment.

### Benefits of Trauma

Health psychologists now talk about post-traumatic _growth_ in addition to post-traumatic stress _disorder_. **People who suffer setbacks, even tragedies like the loss of a loved one, often find new strengths as a result of their experience.**

One way that adversity helps build character is through resilience. People who’ve suffered through hardships can emerge with a new appreciation for their strengths. They often find that they _can_ survive events they once thought they couldn’t. It goes back to the adaptation principle we explored in Chapter 4—even after a terrible loss, we tend to settle into a new normal. By discovering new reserves of resilience, you gain the confidence to face new challenges with less fear and anticipation.

**Trauma survivors also discover that they have a much stronger network of people who love and care for them than they had previously thought**. This discovery activates the reciprocity reflex—we feel a deeper love for and connection to people in our social network and want to foster even closer ties with them. And because we come to value these relationships more, we devote more of our energies to cultivating them, instead of seeking money or possessions. If we look back to what we learned in Chapter 4, loss can help us shift our focus away from conspicuous consumption towards inconspicuous consumption. We come to crave closer connections to things like family and religion that have deeper, more intrinsic value for us.

The idea of inner change coming from tragedy and even near-death experiences is, of course, well-explored in the world of literature. In Charles Dickens’ _A Christmas Carol,_ the miserly and misanthropic Scrooge transforms into a benevolent, kind-hearted humanitarian once he is shown a vision of his own death by the Ghost of Christmas-Yet-to-Come—and how little he will be missed by those who knew him unless he changes his ways. Dickens was demonstrating knowledge of a great psychological truth.

### Changing Your Personality and Self-Narrative

We’ve seen that some elements of our overall level of happiness are tied to built-in pieces of our personality, like our affective style. But can adversity play a role in altering one’s personality? To answer that, we need to examine exactly what an individual’s personality is made of. Personality appears to consist of three levels:

  * Basic traits
  * Characteristic adaptations
  * Self-narratives



The basic traits of one’s personality consist of what psychologists call the “big five”—neuroticism, extroversion, openness to new experiences, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. These basic traits are squarely within the elephant’s control and represent automatic mental processes. They appear to be fairly fixed and stable over time, remaining relatively unchanged regardless of events and experiences in an individual’s life.

But the other levels of personality _are_ more subject to change, especially through adversity. Characteristic adaptations comprise things like goals, beliefs, and values. They are our tools for coping with and succeeding in the world, given the constraints of our basic personality traits and the circumstances of our environment. But because our circumstances can change—often as a result of tragedy or loss—our characteristic adaptations can shift as well. We develop _new_ ways to cope with changed circumstances, often by engaging in pursuits that will be more emotionally and spiritually fulfilling, like religion, family, and learning.

Lastly, there is life story or self-narrative. This is the rider’s domain, the conscious reality we construct for ourselves about who we are and how we got to be that way. We reimagine events to tell ourselves a consistent narrative. It’s a core part of the self and identity.

**The experience of triumph over loss can play a powerful role in rewriting our self-narratives.** It enables us to replace a story about our frustrated hopes or positive experiences turned sour with a more compelling story about overcoming adversity and using that experience to learn compassion and empathy for others. And in the end, this is a more fulfilling story to have about ourselves.

#### Opening Up

People who are genetically predisposed to optimism are more likely to thrive in the aftermath of a crisis. Their optimistic natures instill a belief that their efforts will be successful, so they more diligently set to work trying to solve the crises that come their way. Even if they fail, they still manage to find silver linings.

People with a negative genetic predisposition (those with more brain wave activity on their right frontal cortex than on their left) will have different reactions to adversity. Believing that their efforts are doomed to failure no matter what, they pursue an avoidance strategy, often seeking to blunt the emotional effects of crisis through drugs, alcohol, or other distractions. This can lead to a self-reinforcing pattern of negative thought, a phenomenon we explored earlier when we looked at cognitive therapy in Chapter 2.

**One key to rising above crises and breaking the pattern of negative thinking around them is opening up and talking about them**. One study by social psychologist Jamie Pennebaker found that patients in an experimental group who spent just 15 minutes writing about their most upsetting life experiences had better health outcomes over the next six months (fewer incidents of illness and hospital visits) than those in a control group that didn’t write about similar setbacks.

Pennebaker suggested that, by coming face-to-face with their worst moments, the people in the first group succeeded in incorporating these events into their self-narratives. This enabled them to come to terms with these experiences, and ultimately derive meaning from them. He found this to be true regardless of the _nature_ of the specific tragedy that had befallen the test subjects; what mattered more was the ability to incorporate it into a larger narrative.

**Thus, adversity can be beneficial to anyone. It’s not _what_ happens to you; it’s _how_ your mental processes interpret and filter those events**. Accordingly, you can alter your cognitive style by:

  * Experimenting with the methods we explored in Chapter 1 (meditation, cognitive therapy, or SSRIs)
  * Deriving more value from the relationships in your life
  * Expressing your thoughts and feelings by recording them



### The Right Time for Adversity

**Even though some measure of adversity can be beneficial for everyone, there are periods of an individual’s life during which she is less likely to derive lasting growth from it than others.** We still have a moral obligation to minimize suffering, especially for children. All other things being equal, pain and trauma in childhood are more likely to lead to a child developing a negative affective style, which leads to worse emotional and physical health outcomes.

The story may be different, however, for teens. **Our teenage years are the period in our lives when our self-narratives begin to truly coalesce** and some of our most important life experiences take place. Events that happen during this time are those we revisit the most throughout the rest of our lives, serving as a constant point of self-reference. Accordingly, some adversity in one’s teenage and early adulthood years, if properly overcome, can provide a real character-building boost to people later in life.

The sociologist Glen Elder saw this in his studies of people who lived through traumas like the Great Depression and World War Two. People who were in their teens and early twenties at the time later reported finding a new purpose and sense of self as they overcame these hardships, whether it was through sacrificing to support their families through the depression or serving their country during the war.

But Elder found the opposite to be the case for people who first experienced trauma later in adulthood. By this life-stage, the self-narrative had crystallized; people who had never experienced trauma and lacked a self-narrative rooted in empowerment were less resilient in the face of new hardships. Elder’s research showed that people who had their first brush with adversity when they were older were more likely to struggle to find new strengths in the face of these crises.
