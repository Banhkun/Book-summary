## Chapter 10: Uphold Your End of a Difficult Conversation

Understanding the other person in a difficult conversation is vital — but **it’s vital for them to understand you, too, and you’re responsible for how thoroughly you express yourself.**

If you have difficulty expressing yourself, you may be insecure about how much you deserve to speak. Remember: what you have to say is worth saying. You have the right to share your thoughts, feelings, and past experiences. Even if you’re talking to a superior, your views are equally important — no more, no less.

(If you tend to feel that you’re not entitled to speak, delve into your Identity Conversation. Who from your past made you believe that? What would it take for you to feel entitled?)

### Begin at the Heart of the Matter

Start with what’s most important to you. Many of us try to drop clues about how we feel instead of stating it outright, or we try to ease our way into the conversation.

#### Subtext Isn’t the Solution

Subtext is indirect communication — through jokes, offhand comments, or other behavior. For instance, if you’re upset at your spouse for sharing in cleaning duties, indirect expression includes statements like, “The house really could use a clean-up,” or, “Do you really need to watch football every weekend?” What you really mean is, “I feel like we’re not equal partners in the household, and you don’t respect me.”

**Don’t embed your meaning in subtext.** You might think this will soften the impact on the other person and make it less risky for you to share. But this comes across as passive-aggressive and makes it more difficult for us to be understood. In the example above, the first two statements are far different from the real meaning, and lead to very different reactions.

Perhaps you wish you didn’t have to speak up or share or bring the subject up at all, that the other person could just read your mind and solve the issue for you. But this is a fantasy. The realistic goal is to know each other better, acknowledging that it will never be perfect.

**Here are some phrases for starting productively:**

  * **“For me, what this is really about is…”**
  * **“What I’m feeling is…”**
  * **“What’s important to me is…”**



#### Avoid Leading Questions

**Leading questions convey an opinion but demonstrate that you’re unwilling to share it directly.** Performance reviews sometimes start this way: “How do _you_ think you’ve been doing?” This will only activate the other person’s anxiety and immediately trigger their defensiveness, and they’ll probably imagine that what you have to say is far worse than what you actually think.

The best plan of action is to **share your thoughts directly at the beginning, while also acknowledging that you want to know how the other person feels about the situation as well.**

#### Use the “And Stance” to Present Your Own Complexity

Humans are complex. **Too often, we try to simplify ourselves so that we can be easily understood by other people.** However, this usually means our message is incomplete, and either we don’t share everything that’s on our mind out of fear of hurting the other person, or we only share the negative thoughts instead of including the positive ones that make the issue important to us.

(Shortform example: A parent might say to their child, “I don’t feel like you’ve been working hard enough in your college classes.” This is technically sharing their thoughts, but it leaves out a crucial part of the message: “I think you’re so bright and have so much potential, _and_ I don’t feel like you’ve been working hard enough in your classes.” This represents a full, complex thought, and gives the child all of the information at the root of the issue.)

Sharing thoughts this way helps you represent your perspective clearly and accurately.

### Three Guidelines for Sharing with Clarity

#### 1\. Your conclusions are not the “truth.”

As we know by now, presenting our feelings as facts usually makes the other person feel attacked, defensive, or resentful.

Expressing your opinions as facts can be more subtle than you think. “Spanking children is just plain wrong” is an opinion masquerading as a fact. If you say this in conversation with your friend about the way she treats her kids, you’ve given her no choice but to get defensive. “I don’t believe it’s right to spank children” presents it as a personal opinion instead.

Be especially wary of using these words: “inappropriate,” “should,” or “professional.” These all carry judgment that is entirely based on someone’s personal opinion. If you have to use them, make sure you preface your statement with, “My view is that…” But the book suggests avoiding these words entirely.

#### 2\. Share what leads you to your conclusion.

You are the expert on yourself: You have information that no one else has access to, and past experiences that shape your perspective. These are important to share, because they contextualize your opinion.

For example, if you were spanked as a child and feel frightened every time your friend does it, it’ll go a longer way to change her opinion about the issue if you share that information: “I don’t believe it’s right to spank children. I got spanked as a child and I always felt so afraid. I still get frightened when you do it, even though it isn’t happening to me.”

#### 3\. Don’t use “always” and “never.”

**In the throes of a difficult conversation, we often exaggerate** : your husband makes a negative comment about your outfit, and you jump right to, “You _always_ criticize my clothing. You _never_ say anything nice.” These words are good at communicating frustration, but have major pitfalls.

They’re rarely accurate, and turn the conversation into one about frequency instead of the heart of the matter. They also usually make the other person get defensive immediately. “That’s not true! I don’t _always_ criticize, and I _do_ say nice things! Just last week I told I like your new dress.”

They also make it harder for the other person to consider changing their behavior. These words suggest that change is impossible, and can make the other person feel defeated before they’re even given a chance to change.

**It’s better to go into a difficult conversation assuming that the other person doesn’t know how their actions are impacting you, and assuming that they’re a good person who will want to change their behavior once they become aware of how it’s impacting you.** Share what you have to say in an inviting and encouraging way that gives the other person new ways of behavior to consider.

### Assume They Want to Understand You, then Help Them Do It

**In a difficult conversation, both people need help understanding the other person.**

We already know that paraphrasing what someone else is saying helps demonstrate that we understand them and acknowledge what they have to say. But you can use it the other way. You can **ask them to paraphrase your feelings to check that they’re understanding you and that you’re being clear**.

  * Most of us use phrases like “Does that make sense?” or “Would you agree?” to confirm that someone else is understanding. But these questions corner people into agreeing with you, and make it harder for them to share confusions or disagreements.



Also, remember that **people take in information differently**. Some people want to understand the big picture first; others want the details first. Some people learn fast, some take more time. The more you understand the other person, the more you can help them understand you better.

To that end, you can also **ask the other person how they see it and why they see it that way.** If it seems like the other person is confused or resistant to your story, put the ball in their court to see what you can understand from their answer.
