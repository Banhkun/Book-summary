## Chapter 12: The Last Phase — Problem-Solving

You’ve finally unpacked what happened and how it makes you both feel, and have started to understand each other’s stories much better. But ultimately, you still have to work together to solve the issue, and you may disagree on how best to go about it. This is the problem-solving stage.

**Problem-solving is essentially collecting the information you just received and coming up with some test options that might help solve both sides’ issues.** Problem-solving in difficult conversations requires both parties to consider compromises and accommodation of the needs of the other person.

### Test Your (Differing) Hypotheses

Differences in perspective usually stem from assumptions or hypotheses that conflict with each other. We usually keep these assumptions to ourselves, or we might not even know they’re assumptions.

If you can identify what the conflicting assumptions are, then you can come up with a fair test to see whose assumption is more valid, or how much more valid it is.

Example: Your neighbor’s dog has been keeping you up with his barking. You talk to your neighbors and discover they just had a baby and have been keeping the dog outside at night because they’re afraid he’ll hurt the baby. It’s not a fair test to propose they get rid of the dog — it only really addresses your issue. It could be a fair test, however, to propose keeping the dog inside for a few nights and shutting the door to the baby’s room, which addresses both parties’ issues.

### Problem-Solving Tips and Tricks

**1\. Communicate what still doesn’t make sense about their perspective.** Remember, as you’re participating in a difficult conversation, you’re trying to follow the other person’s reasoning. If you’re having trouble following the reasoning, then there’s information missing that would help their side make sense.

**2\. Let the other party know what would persuade you, and ask what would persuade them.** If you go into a difficult conversation unwilling to be persuaded, you’re not really going into it interested in their side and in solving the problem. Acknowledging that you could be persuaded gives you room to be straightforward about your views and what you need to resolve about the issue.

  * For example, an employee who’s been asked to work an extra weekend might say, “I understand that you want someone to be able to deal with the supplier issue, but it seems to me that Bill, the assistant manager on the schedule this weekend, can handle it. But maybe you have reservations about Bill that could persuade me he’s not up to the challenge?”
  * In the same conversation, that employee might say, “I’ve offered plenty of good reasons why I don’t feel it makes sense for me to work the weekend, yet you don’t seem persuaded. Do you have reasons you haven’t expressed yet? Is there anything I could say to persuade you?”



**3\. Ask what they would do in your position.** This might help you discover other assumptions they have about the situation, or understand their reasoning. “How would you feel if you were in my shoes, and what would you do? Why?”

**4\. Ask for help coming up with creative solutions.** “Can we find a creative way to deal with both our issues? Are you willing to try to find a solution with me?”

**5\. Look for external standards of fairness**. Sometimes, the best place to look for a solution is outside of the difficult conversation you’re having. For example, with the barking dog, maybe there are local ordinances about noise that set a standard that will help solve the dispute, or maybe this issue has come up in the neighborhood before and other people have found alternative solutions.

### Agreement Is a Team Sport

Some people feel anxiety over problem-solving, over the task of finding a solution that meets both parties’ needs. They usually feel this anxiety because the goal of a difficult conversation, in their mind, is to make the other person happy — to meet their needs.

But **it takes two people to reach an agreement.** Unless both people are satisfied, even if it means having to compromise, there is no agreement. You shouldn’t compromise or agree to their terms just for the sake of getting the conversation over — this will breed resentment and ill-will.

“I’m not persuaded that…” is a good phrase for letting the other person know that they’re being demanding without providing good reason. For example, an editor might respond to a pushy writer: “I can see that you’re determined to have this article reviewed, but I’m not persuaded that I should do it now, while I’m on my vacation.” This is clear about the problem, and puts the onus on them to convince you.

**Sometimes, agreement won’t resolve the conflict.** No matter how deft the conversation is, there are irreconcilable differences sometimes. You can’t come up with an option that satisfies you both. In these instances, it’s up to you to decide if you can settle for a less than ideal solution for you, or if you can live with the consequences of sticking firm to what you need.

If you decide to stick firm to what you need, explain what needs of yours aren’t being met by the solutions proposed in the conversation and why you’re walking away from solving the issue. Then, know that you’ll have to accept whatever consequences there are.

  * For the employee who doesn’t want to work the weekend, he might have to walk away from the conversation with his boss explaining that it’s an important weekend to him and he hasn’t heard any persuasive reasons for why he needs to work — then, he has to be ready to lose his job, if that’s what the consequences are.
