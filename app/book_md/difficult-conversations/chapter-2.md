## Chapter 2: What Happened Mistake #1 - Arguing About Who’s Right

**In the What Happened conversation, people usually disagree** — there wouldn’t be much reason to have a difficult conversation, and therefore the What Happened part of it, if everyone was in agreement. Each side typically thinks they’re right and that they hold the one single truth.

**When we get into an argument with someone, we typically assume they’re the problem.** We’re right, they won’t listen, they’re selfish, or naive, or controlling, or irrational — so we push our own opinion harder, or try to make them see the light.

But, of course, on the other side, they think we’re the problem too. And they think we’re stubborn, or selfish, or naive. **In an argument, we rarely stop to pause and consider that it might be us who’s in the wrong — but this is because _our_ story makes perfect sense to us.** We _know_ why we’re right; we have all the supporting evidence in our minds.

### Why Doesn’t It Work?

Difficult conversations are usually about differences in perception, and in this case, the only truth is that there is no truth. Asking who’s right or who’s wrong goes nowhere.

**Arguments are when two people’s respective stories make perfect sense to them, but the stories are in conflict.** And when we focus on arguing our own “right” story, we lose the opportunity to explore the other person’s story and understand why they think they’re right.

**Arguing any point but failing to understand the other person isn’t persuasive, it’s combative.** _Telling_ someone to change rarely results in them actually changing. People need to feel understood in their own story before they can start to change. **For a disagreement to be productive, we have to understand each other’s stories enough to see how the opposing conclusion also makes sense.** Understanding alone won’t solve the issue, but it’s the first step toward actually getting to a solution.

### Different Stories and How They’re Formed

**The stories we tell ourselves are built in systematic, if unconscious ways — they aren’t random or without cause.**

#### How Our Stories Get Built

  1. First, we all take in information. But there’s so much information to take in that **we can only take in a fraction of what’s being offered to us in a given moment** — what we take in can be vastly different from what another person takes in, even if they’re sitting right next to us.
  2. Secondly, after we take in what information we can, **then it’s up to our brains to _interpret_ what that information means.** This is yet another fork in the road where people can diverge. 
     * **Two factors that influence how we interpret information are 1) our past experiences and 2) the rules we learned about how things should or shouldn’t be done.**
     * People’s actions and why they make sense _only make sense_ in the context of their past. All our strong views are extremely influenced by our past experiences, and what we learned from our family or other early influences.
     * Usually, we’re unaware of just how much our past affects our present interpretation and judgment of information.
     * Our past experiences lead us to different conclusions that become “rules” to live by — the shoulds or shouldn’ts that get us into trouble in arguments. Difficult conversations occur when two people’s rules clash.
     * However, our conclusions and rules usually reflect self-interest: they support our view and interpret the information favorably based on our conclusions.
  3. Lastly, **we draw conclusions** about the information we’ve gathered and how we’ve interpreted it, and we make judgments.



People’s stories can diverge at any of those three steps, or all of them. **In difficult conversations, we usually just assert our conclusions — the last step — without acknowledging the two preceding phases that lead us to those conclusions.**

Only we have access to our past experiences and information that form our conclusions. We know ourselves better than anyone else knows us. So we _should_ assume that other people know themselves better than we could ever hope to. We _shouldn’t_ assume that we know what others’ stories are or how others’ stories were built.

### Two Exceptions that Aren’t Exceptions

Two supposed “exceptions” to the principle that we should take others’ stories into account happen when 1) we _are_ right and the other person is wrong, and 2) the other person’s story doesn’t matter because it won’t affect the outcome of the decision being made, such as when breaking up with or firing someone.

#### But I Am Right!

You might find yourself in a conversation where you do understand someone else’s story, but you still think that you’re objectively right. **This usually means you’re right about a certain fact — but that the difficult conversation is about something else entirely.** Being “right” won’t get you far in a conversation like this.

For example, a father wants his teenage daughter to stop smoking because it’s bad for her health. Objectively, he’s right about that fact — smoking is unequivocally bad for anyone’s health — but that isn’t what their difficult conversation is about. If the father believes he’s “right,” he’s missing the point.

The conversation is really about his daughter’s need for risk and excitement, which doing something “wrong” is fulfilling. Or it’s about not wanting to be controlled by her dad, and the doubling-down that happens when he tries to control her more. Or it’s about the confusion she feels doing something she knows is wrong but that her body tells her feels good, which her dad isn’t addressing.

In this situation, though the father may be right about the fact, **he could probably get a lot further if he discussed the impact her smoking is having on him** — that he worries about her constantly, that her great-grandmother died of cancer and he’s reminded of it every time he sees her cigarettes, or whatever the impact is — instead of the inarguable facts.

#### But It’s My Choice — Why Does Their Story Matter?

Most difficult conversations don’t actually involve someone with the power to dictate the outcome of the conversation, but a few cases do. Breaking up with someone or firing an employee fall into the latter.

And it’s true: technically, their story doesn’t matter if the decision has been made, and you don’t need to understand it. But **trying to understand their story still has its merits, even if it won’t — or can’t — change the outcome.** Understanding the other person’s story allows us to be clearer about the decision that has been made and compassionate towards them. It can turn a difficult situation like a breakup or a firing into a better experience for both parties.

* * *

Understanding won’t make differences disappear immediately. Nor does taking the time to understand someone else’s story mean that all stories are equally valid. But **understanding will help you evaluate your views in light of new information and other interpretations, and understanding where both parties are coming from is the only way to begin to move forward.**
