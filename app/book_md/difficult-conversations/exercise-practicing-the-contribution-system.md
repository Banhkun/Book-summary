## Exercise: Practicing the Contribution System

Here are some questions you can ask yourself to help you take a more balanced approach to contribution. You can return to this exercise whenever a difficult issue arises.

Pick a current issue you have with someone in your life, such as a partner, a friend, your boss, or a colleague. Briefly summarize the issue from your own perspective.

List out 3-5 ways that you feel the other person is contributing to the issue.

Now, list the same number of ways that you might be contributing to the issue.
