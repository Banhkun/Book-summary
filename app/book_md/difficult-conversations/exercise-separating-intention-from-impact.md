## Exercise: Separating Intention from Impact

Use this exercise to practice separating someone else’s intentions from the impact their behavior had on you, either by reflecting on a past issue or working through a current one.

* * *

Think of an issue you had with someone else in the past, or one you’re currently experiencing. First, write down the actions the other person took. What did they actually say or do that led to the issue?

Now that you’ve written out their actions, turn inward. What was the impact of their actions? How did their actions make you feel?

How did the impact affect your assumptions? We often jump to conclusions in these situations — “he hurt my feelings, so he must not care about me” — and make assumptions based on how things affect us. What assumptions did you make in response to the impact?
