## Exercise: Discovering Your Emotional Footprint

Use this exercise to help you home in on your own personal emotional footprint by starting to understand your familyâ€™s footprint and how it affects your present emotional footprint.

* * *

Our families play a large part in shaping our emotional footprint. Which feelings were openly discussed in your family? Another way to think of this question is what emotion words (angry, sad, happy, disappointed) did you hear your parents openly use?

On the opposite end of the spectrum, which emotions were never discussed in your household? How did people deal with them, from your perspective?

What emotions do you feel comfortable identifying now? Is this answer similar to or different from your answer to the first question?

What emotions are you uncomfortable feeling or identifying? How do you deal with these uncomfortable emotions?
