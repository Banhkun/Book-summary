## Exercise: Navigating the Three Conversations

Remember, it’s helpful to do some work on your own before heading into a difficult conversation. Use this exercise to help you work through a past or present issue — and come back to it anytime you find yourself approaching a difficult conversation.

* * *

Think of an issue you’re having currently or have had in the past. Instead of writing down your POV, do your best to summarize the Third Story perspective on the issue (refer back to Chapter 14 for how to do that).

List the ways that you have contributed to this issue, then list the ways that you feel the other person has contributed (refer back to Chapter 6 for reminders on the contribution system).

Difficult conversations bring up feelings that we may or may not be comfortable with. What feelings has this issue brought up for you? Try to write down the obvious feelings and also the less obvious feelings that may be lurking beneath the surface (refer back to Chapter 8 for help sorting your feelings).

Finally, how does this issue impact your Identity Conversation? What facets of your identity are at stake in this issue? Why are those facets important to you?
