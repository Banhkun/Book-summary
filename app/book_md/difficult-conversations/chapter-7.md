## Chapter 7: Whether to Start a Difficult Conversation

Now that we’ve covered the three meta-conversations in-depth, these next chapters are about how to move through a difficult conversation. The first question is important - should you have a difficult conversation, or just get over it?

We can’t have every single difficult conversation in life — there are too many. So sometimes, it’s best to let things go. But **how can you tell what issues to let go and what issues to raise?**

Consider the purpose of the conversation, rule out conversations that won’t help, and consider whether it’s better to merely let go.

### What’s the Purpose of the Conversation?

The main purpose of any difficult conversation should be **mutual understanding**. This doesn’t mean mutual _agreement_. Difficult conversations are about working to understand each other’s stories better, so you can make better collective decisions about what to do next.

If your purposes are focused on learning and solving together, the situation would benefit from a difficult conversation. But in some cases, a difficult conversation isn’t the best path forward.

#### Four Situations Where Conversations Won’t Help

**1\. If the conflict is inside of you, raising the issue won’t necessarily help.** Sometimes conversations are more difficult than they _have_ to be because so much is going on inside of us instead of between us and another person. This is why having a conversation with yourself is important. If it feels like the conflict is mostly in your own head, have longer conversations with yourself first.

**2\. Talking might not be the best way to address the issue — changing your actions might be better.** Once you sort out how you feel, you may realize a better solution is to change how you behave, instead of raising the issue with someone else.

For example, a city doctor still had family in the suburbs, and his mother constantly asked him when he was going to come home and run the family business. Though the doctor primarily felt irritated with his mother when she asked, he went through the conversations and realized that she missed him and was sad that he couldn’t see his family as much. Instead of having a difficult conversation, he began calling his mother more and traveling more often to the suburbs so she felt more involved in his life.

**3\. Ask if your purpose for having the difficult conversation makes sense.** We often launch into difficult conversations without knowing why or what we hope to gain by having them. What if you asked the head of NASA what the purpose was of a certain space mission, and she replied, “I really don’t know. I thought we’d just get the ship up there and then decide as we went along.” This isn’t how we want NASA exploring space, and it isn’t how we want to head into difficult conversations, either.

Sometimes our goals are too distant or unrealistic to achieve, for example, changing the other person completely. That’s a _purpose_ that doesn’t make sense and won’t end well. Recalibrate your purpose and expectations before deciding to have a difficult conversation.

**4\. You don’t have enough time to prepare for the difficult conversation.** Often we want to get something off our chests immediately, but we’ve put in neither the time nor the preparation to have the difficult conversation. Don’t hit and run — these worsen the situation and don’t address the complexity adequately.

### Letting Go

Once in a while, no matter what we do, nothing will solve the problem. Or, after we go through our own side of the three conversations, we decide it’s best not to have the difficult conversation. **The healthiest option we have then is to let the issue go.**

**Letting go usually takes time**. It usually _isn’t_ easy to let go of something that’s bothering us, and we’ll have to put in practice and effort to be able to let go of it. There’s no “appropriate” amount of time to be upset by something, so don’t let anyone tell you there is. Feeling pressure to get over something is one more way to keep yourself fixated on it.

**Letting go requires us to:**

  * **Release the negative feelings we have about ourselves and the other person.**
  * **Tell ourselves a new story around the issue.**
  * **Accept who we were at the time of the issue and who we are now.**



Here are some things you can do to help yourself begin to move past the situation. Keep these things in mind as you try to let go of the issue:

  1. **You don’t have any responsibility to make things better — your only responsibility is to do your best.** You might want to make a relationship better, but you can’t do it on your own. It takes both people to improve any relationship. You can only try your best to improve it in the ways you can.
  2. **The other person has their own limitations.** They’re as imperfect as you are. People slip up and make the same mistakes, especially if it’s a long-held pattern for them. **They might not be capable of changing the way you need them to right now.**
  3. **A single conflict does not define who you are.** It’s more difficult to let something go if you incorporate the conflict into your identity. This is what makes racial conflict or other identity-based conflicts so difficult to resolve. Reconciliation can feel like it robs people of their communal identity, or it can feel like a betrayal _of_ some identity. **Remember that your purpose in _any_ conflict should be to fight for what’s just and equitable — you don’t need just _any_ conflict to survive.**
  4. **Letting go doesn’t mean you don’t care.** It could just be the wrong situation to have a difficult conversation, or you don’t feel you have the skills yet to manage a constructive conversation.



It’s okay to give up in difficult conversations. Sometimes, you’ll have to. Remember that you can’t change someone else, or control their behavior. You can’t force someone to face an issue or admit their responsibility. The only thing you can control is yourself. **Giving up still requires a difficult conversation to be had — with yourself.** You’ll have to work through why it’s a healthier choice to give up, and you’ll have to work towards forgiving yourself for giving up.
