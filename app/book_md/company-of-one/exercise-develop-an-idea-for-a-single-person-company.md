## Exercise: Develop an Idea for a Single-Person Company

Jarvis offers insights into the potential benefits of owning a single-person company. Start developing an idea for your own company.

* * *

Write down an idea for a business you could turn into a single-person company. (For example, maybe you want to start a personal training business or a business as a professional meal prepper.)

Which of the characteristics of single-person companies appeals to you the most? (For example, you might want to set your own schedule, so the independence of owning a single-person company appeals to you. Or, maybe the focus on staying small makes you feel less overwhelmed about the prospect of running a business.)

What are three skills you’d need before starting your single-person company? (For example, for the personal training business, you’d need an understanding of fitness techniques, strong interpersonal skills, and some marketing skills. For the meal prep business, you’d need a decent repertoire of recipes, solid cooking skills, and experience with client relations.)

From the three you chose, pick one skill that you need to develop more. Write a brief plan for how you might go about this. (For example, say you need to improve your knowledge of fitness techniques before starting your personal training business. You might develop this skill by getting a job at a gym and learning from more experienced trainers, or by reading books on the subject.)
