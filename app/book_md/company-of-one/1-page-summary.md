## 1-Page Summary

Have you ever wished you could own a company, but you feel out of place in the fast-paced, growth-focused world of business? In _Company of One _(2019), Paul Jarvis presents a solution—a single-person company that limits its growth and focuses on creating quality products and services. He argues that by owning such a company, you can exercise more control over your work, create your own schedule, and form meaningful, successful relationships with customers.

For years, Jarvis worked as a corporate web designer for companies such as Microsoft and Mercedes-Benz and clients such as Shaquille O’Neal and Steve Nash. Then, he pivoted to helping entrepreneurs construct their online brands. Today, he runs a company called Mighty Small Ventures, through which he teaches classes, creates software, and writes. His ideas have also been published on websites such as _VICE News_ , _WIRED_ , and _USA Today_.

In this guide, we’ll explore why fast and endless growth isn’t always the best goal for a business and define the most important characteristics of a “company of one”—which we’ll refer to as a single-person company. Additionally, we’ll discuss some of Jarvis’s tips for starting a single-person company. In our commentary, we’ll look at alternative perspectives on what makes for a successful business and discuss additional ways you can apply Jarvis’s advice.

### Why Growth-Focused Companies Don’t Always Work

To begin, let’s examine three reasons behind Jarvis’s argument that constant growth doesn’t have to be a company’s primary goal—despite this being a common ethos in the business world.

#### Reason #1: Growth Increases Complications

According to Jarvis, **growth brings inevitable complications for a business.** When traditional companies grow and scale, they have to spend more money and hire more employees. This requires a more robust infrastructure, so these companies must invest in new systems that further complicate and slow down work processes.

For example, video game company Zynga spent $100 million on building their own data centers after achieving success with their free game downloads. This became a financial burden for the company as they struggled to keep up with innovations in the video game industry, eventually forcing them to lay off a large number of employees and close the data centers.

If you’re the owner of a company that’s constantly growing, **you’ll likely spend more time managing the increasingly complex infrastructure than on the core work** —creating or designing a product or service. That core work is the reason you wanted to start the business—a reason that’s unrelated to money. So managing growth takes you away from your original purpose.

> **How Complications From Large Businesses Affect Company Culture**
> 
> Some experts agree that the complications that come from a large company aren’t worth the trouble. In addition to the added expenses and stagnation of work because of bureaucratic processes, company culture often takes a hit. Large companies may run into the following issues in maintaining a healthy culture:
> 
> **Issue #1:** To manage the large staff and infrastructure, the company culture often has to be highly formal, and employees may feel less motivated if their days are filled with procedures they must follow.
> 
> **Issue #2:** A large corporate infrastructure means that employees typically work only within a narrow area of expertise. They don’t often get to work outside their role and may get bored.
> 
> **Issue #3:** Frequently, the larger a company is, the less friendly and human-centric the atmosphere is, so employees may feel disconnected or underappreciated.
> 
> **Issue #4:** There are more opportunities for conflict within the organization since managers and directors are often the ones making day-to-day decisions instead of the owners. Owners of large companies don’t typically run day-to-day operations or manage the core work that sparked the business (as Jarvis points out). However, they likely still have strong opinions about how the work should be done that may conflict with the choices that high-level employees make. For example, the owner might take issue with decisions managers make that move away from the company’s original purpose.

##### Example: Losing Sight of the Core Work

Let’s look at an example of how managing a large company might prevent you from focusing on the core work. Say you run a business that offers book therapy: curated selections of books based on the users’ current mental health needs. Initially, you personally read each user’s profile and create their book selection. This is the core work, and it serves your original purpose for starting the business: to improve people’s lives using the psychological and emotional benefits of reading.

However, as the business grows, you have to hire employees to take on some of this work, and now you spend more time managing them along with the greater vision and day-to-day operations of the company. You spend less time selecting books and communicating with customers. As interest in your service keeps increasing, you develop an algorithm that automatically creates book selections based on customer needs, eliminating personalized, human involvement. Eventually, you spend all your time on tasks that are unrelated to the core work of book curation and the original purpose of helping people. Instead, you’re primarily focused on keeping the company going and increasing profits every year.

> **How to Determine Your Company’s Core Focus**
> 
> In _Traction_ , Gino Wickman further explores the concept of a company’s core focus (which encompasses the core work and original purpose that Jarvis describes). Wickman identifies a core focus as the job your company excels at and the thing you should be putting your time and resources into. Wickman argues that if you concentrate your company’s efforts on its core focus, you’ll see increased success and profits because you’re building on what you do best.
> 
> A core focus includes your company’s reason for existing (its original purpose) and its niche (its core work). According to Wickman, you should be able to explain your company’s reason for existing in no more than seven words. It should be simple and bold, resonate emotionally, involve everyone in the company, be separate from money, and be broader than a goal.
> 
> Your niche is the work you specifically do that fulfills the mission you outline. The description of this should be simple and useful for making decisions about how to spend time and resources.

#### Reason #2: Fast Growth Often Leads to Quick Failure

Jarvis argues that in addition to experiencing the complications of all large companies, **companies that attempt to grow substantially in a short time (such as startups) often fail.** This is because they spend money they don’t have to facilitate growth. Owners are motivated by the traditional business ethos that success means scaling up and making as much money as possible. So they spend based on projected revenue instead of their actual revenue, thinking that they’ll recoup it soon enough to keep spending and growing.

(Shortform note: According to some business experts, overspending and scaling rates aren’t always primary or inherent reasons startups fail (though they may contribute to that failure). Often, startup problems stem from inexperience and bad relationships among company stakeholders. Founders of startups aren’t always experts in their company’s industry, so they may need to depend heavily on employees for expertise in handling major aspects of the business. If those employees don’t do a good job, the company may falter. Likewise, without founders experienced in the industry, startups may struggle to connect with the right suppliers to ensure their products are high quality and made efficiently.)

**When a company spends money based on projections instead of current revenue, it’s a gamble.** If their upfront spending pays off, then they have a large, successful company that they can continue to expand or sell. However, if their revenue projections don’t match the actual revenue (which is statistically the more likely scenario), they’re unable to recoup what they spent, and the company collapses. When a high-growth company fails, huge layoffs usually follow, and the company often sells for well below its market value.

For example, Australian startup Shoes of Prey tried to scale by expanding beyond its original model as a web-based custom shoe design service by opening physical stores in malls across the world. With an influx of venture capital funds, the owners spent huge amounts of money, moved to the United States, and hired a lot of new staff to get the project going. However, their sales from the physical stores didn’t match projections, so the company couldn’t generate a return on its investments. This resulted in massive layoffs and its collapse in 2018.

> **When Startups Are Likely to Fail and What Happens When They Do**
> 
> Most startups depend on outside investors to raise the money necessary to spend and grow quickly (which we’ll explore more in the next section), and they may conduct multiple rounds of funding. During rounds of funding, startups trade shares of their company in exchange for capital (the money used to build, run, and grow a business), which they can use to take their company to the next level.
> 
> In one study, after startups secured enough funds to launch, only about 40% made it to the next round of funding. The number of startups that kept receiving funding decreased nearly exponentially with each subsequent round of funding—by the sixth round, only about 1% remained.
> 
> Failure and collapse weren’t the only reasons the startups didn’t continue to secure funding—some of them were purchased by other companies. About 92% of the startups that were acquired made it through at least the third round of funding.
> 
> When startups like the ones in this study do fail, in addition to conducting layoffs and looking for possible buyouts, the company will likely file for one of two types of bankruptcy. If a company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it’s requesting that the court keep creditors away until it has a chance to submit a plan for how it can recover. The company then has the chance to reduce costs and potentially continue doing business. The company may or may not succeed after this. If a company files Chapter 7 bankruptcy, it means the company has collapsed entirely. Its assets are liquidated and used to pay off remaining debts.

#### Reason #3: Fast Growth May Harm Your Original Customers

Finally, Jarvis states that **_fast_ growth often leads you to make compromises that can harm your relationships with your original customers.** Rapid growth typically requires outside investors, which means you have to answer to people beyond yourself _and_ your customers. Investors want returns on their investments, so they bring their own opinions and agendas to the company, some of which may not align with its original mission and goals. If you have investors who don’t support your company’s purpose, you may have to make changes that please them but also alienate your core customer base.

For example, say your company offers prerecorded online cooking classes. From the beginning, you’ve been dedicated to keeping the videos ad-free, and many customers choose your classes because of this feature. However, you bring on some investors who want the company to grow quickly, so they push you to include ads that bring in more revenue. You finally give in, which pleases your investors. It also damages your relationship with your customers since you went back on your original promise, leading to losses in subscribers.

> **Scaling Customer Service Without Losing Quality**
> 
> According to some business experts, fast growth doesn’t have to mean your customer relationships suffer. To ensure this doesn’t happen, scale your customer service along with the other aspects of your company. That way, even if customers aren’t happy with the changes your investors push you to make, you have a strong infrastructure for responding to their complaints and hopefully overcoming their concerns.
> 
> To scale your customer service, first, determine consistent internal metrics for top-quality service with your team every time your team grows.
> 
> Then, refine your customer service processes. For example, design your company’s contact page so it guides customers to ask specific questions. Specific, clear questions are much easier for customer service workers to answer than vague ones, so they spend less time on each query.
> 
> Additionally, hire a larger customer service team and invest in thorough training so you have a clear standard for performance.
> 
> Finally, expand the knowledge base that’s available to customers so they can handle some of their issues on their own. Having robust help pages saves time for you and the customer.

### The Three Main Characteristics of a Single-Person Company

Now that we’ve discussed the reasons _not_ to push your company toward fast, unsustainable growth, let’s examine Jarvis’s alternative path. According to Jarvis, **a single-person company focuses on simplicity and stability.** As the owner of a single-person company, your primary goal is to make enough revenue to pay yourself a salary and cover your business expenses.

(Shortform note: In _The $100 Startup_ , Chris Guillebeau describes a company type in between Jarvis’s single-person company model and a large, growth-focused company. He states that a mid-sized company model allows you to expand your business and reach a wider audience without the constraints of larger corporations or mass markets. You might hire more employees than you would as the owner of a single-person company to meet the demand for your product, but you still don’t outsource the creation or distribution of your product. You still pay your salary and expenses, and your business makes a higher profit.)

Over time, **you may slowly grow your company’s profit as the quality of your products and services draws in more customers.** However, you consciously limit this growth by limiting the number of clients or customers you take on and limiting your revenue goals. Running the company yourself remains manageable.

> **Benefits, Drawbacks, and Strategies of Limiting Business Growth**
> 
> Jarvis’s description of a single-person company is similar to a limited growth strategy: a business model in which a company focuses on spending minimally and growing sustainably.
> 
> Experts argue that there are advantages and disadvantages to this model. On one hand, your company won’t take on huge amounts of debt, and you’ll likely be able to keep your business going without it taking over your personal life. On the other hand, companies of limited size often can’t take advantage of the savings and discounts that come with buying inventory in bulk. Likewise, your production systems may be inefficient because of the small volume of products you produce, and you may struggle to gain market share.
> 
> When identifying financial goals as the owner of a single-person or limited growth company (including those aimed at limiting your company’s revenue), some experts suggest making them as specific and concrete as possible. For example, you might set a revenue goal of $300,000 in one year. Such specific goals help you more easily track progress, and they keep you motivated.
> 
> Then, create a detailed plan including specific steps needed to reach your revenue goals. For a single-person company, this may include actions that ensure you stay within your stated revenue goals, instead of exceeding them.
> 
> Finally, track your spending. This could be especially important for a single-person company, as you have limited funds to work with and no cushion for overspending.
> 
> When it comes to limiting clients and customers (and reaching revenue goals), one strategy is raising your prices slightly, especially on your most popular products and services. If you have more clients than you can take on, you know the demand for your product or service is there, and a small price increase likely won’t turn away loyal customers. However, it will likely drive some potential customers elsewhere, making your client list more manageable.

Jarvis describes three primary characteristics that define a single-person company and its owner:

#### Characteristic #1: De-Emphasis on Growth

Jarvis states that **a core aspect of a single-person company is its de-emphasis on growth**. Instead of solving problems by spending more money and acquiring more resources as traditional growth-focused companies do, single-person companies find solutions using their existing resources.

For example, a growth-focused company might solve the problem of how to attract more customers by increasing the money it spends on advertising. Additionally, it might hire more marketing employees to create strategies for customer acquisition, with the ultimate goal being to increase the size and profits of the company.

In contrast, the owner of a single-person company wouldn’t spend more money or hire more employees to expand its customer base—they would instead focus on creating a high-quality service or product. The better a service or product is, the more likely it is that customers will recommend it to their friends. Over time, the company’s network of clients and customers increases through word of mouth.

(Shortform note: Using your existing resources to save money as a business owner is often a matter of researching and educating yourself on free or low-cost tools. For example, if your company requires software, skip the pricier options like Photoshop, Quickbooks, and Microsoft Office. Instead, research free options that work just as well. When considering advertising, avoid costly traditional options like TV commercials and familiarize yourself with social media and SEO techniques. These options can drive traffic to your business without you having to spend anything.)

#### Characteristic #2: Adaptability to Changing Circumstances

Jarvis says **single-person companies can adapt to changing circumstances and endure hardship.** One challenge may be market changes caused by world events or new technologies. With an adaptive, resilient mindset, owners of single-person companies can pivot more easily when they encounter such challenges than larger companies can.

(Shortform note: How should a business owner adapt to big changes in the world and the market? According to some business experts, the first step is to pinpoint products and businesses that will likely experience growth as a result of the change. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, equipment for home offices, restaurant takeout, and in-home entertainment like social media and streaming services experienced increased demand. Second, determine whether these shifts are likely to be long-term or short-term and whether they began before the change or as a result of it. Finally, adjust your business model to fit the changes in supply and demand relevant to your industry.)

**Single-person companies are adaptable to hardship and changing circumstances because they typically have a strong purpose,** not just the desire to make money. As we touched on earlier when discussing a company’s core work, this purpose stems from your values as the owner—the reasons you do the work apart from profit. For example, your company’s purpose might be to support social and economic justice, help people advance their careers, or promote sustainability.

(Shortform note: A sense of purpose in the work doesn’t just contribute to resilience and adaptability—research also suggests that it boosts motivation and productivity, even during periods of stability. One survey suggested that people are more satisfied with their job and feel empowered when their work is meaningful to them. When people feel more satisfied with their jobs, they typically work longer hours, are more focused, and take less sick time. Therefore, your sense of purpose as an owner of a single-person company can continually motivate you to work hard to make it the best it can be.)

#### Characteristic #3: Increased Independence and Control

According to Jarvis, **owning a single-person company also gives you more independence than you’d have as the owner of a fast-growing company** or an employee at someone else’s company. Because your business stays intentionally small (meaning you’re likely the only one working there) and uses existing resources to solve problems, you have complete creative, financial, and administrative control. Therefore, you get to decide how often you work, when you work, who you work with, and so on.

For example, say you’re a graphic designer. If you’re working at a firm, management determines your projects and clients. You have to prioritize your work based on what other people want from you. However, if you own your own graphic design company, you can choose your clients and decide how many projects to take on at any given time.

(Shortform note: The independence of owning a single-person company may improve your mental health. Some studies suggest that people who are self-employed feel more centered and experience less stress than people who work nine-to-five jobs. In a 2019 survey, 70% of self-employed workers said they had a good work-life balance, 55% said they felt less stressed than they did in a traditional office environment, and 54% said they were healthier overall after switching to self-employment. Others said they had more freedom, fun, and satisfaction in their jobs because they could set their own schedules.)

### Getting Started With Your Single-Person Company

In the last section, we explored the characteristics and benefits of Jarvis’s single-person company model. Now, let’s dive deeper into three pieces of practical advice for starting your single-person company:

  1. How to build your skillset so you’re prepared to run your own business 
  2. How to set up a strong financial and legal foundation 
  3. How to develop strong customer relationships



#### Tip #1: Build Your Skillset

**Jarvis suggests building your skillset before starting your single-person company.** To be successfully independent, you have to be _good enough_ to stand on your own. You can achieve this in a variety of ways, including working for a while at an existing company to gain experience, taking classes, or practicing skills on your own.

First, hone your knowledge and skill in the work that forms the core of what you want your single-person company to be. For example, consider our earlier example of the business that offers online cooking classes—before you open such a company, you should learn from other chefs, practice your teaching skills as an instructor at an existing cooking school, and so on. This will give you credibility as an expert in your field and ensure that you can offer a quality product or service.

Second, acquire a broad understanding of administrative and practical business skills. As the owner of a single-person company, you’re responsible for every aspect of the business, so you need to have a working knowledge of many types of work outside of your core work. These include marketing, accounting, payroll, sales, project management, and more.

> **Different Paths for Skill-Building**
> 
> If you choose to build your skills as an employee at an existing company, seek out chances to explore types of work that push you outside of your comfort zone. Instead of going for upward movement in one department, consider making lateral moves to related departments. This will help you expand your skill set and your knowledge of related fields. For example, if you normally work in marketing, you might take a job in customer service to learn about working with customers directly. Knowing more about different types of work in your field and how they interact will help you fill multiple roles in your business later on.
> 
> In addition, you could expand your skillset in your core work or in general business knowledge on your own by taking advantage of countless online resources. Coursera offers low-cost certificate courses from accredited universities that cover business topics like marketing, sales, accounting, and project management. LinkedIn Learning and Skillshare also offer courses that help with professional development along with more specific skills you could turn into a business, such as writing, graphic design, web design, and illustration.
> 
> Finally, reading regularly can help you improve your abilities in your core work and peripheral work. Research suggests that reading of all kinds improves communication skills, writing skills, critical thinking, and creativity—all necessary for the owner of a single-person company. Additionally, reading books written about your line of work can help you stay on top of new developments in your field.

#### Tip #2: Set Up a Strong Legal Foundation

According to Jarvis, getting the legal systems of your business in order from the start ensures you don’t get duped out of money you’re owed or get into trouble for operating illegally. We’ve organized Jarvis’s recommendations for protecting yourself legally into three steps:

**Step #1: Set up your company as a legal entity separate from yourself.** This would be an LLC in the United States. Your business makes money from your work, instead of you making it directly. You then pay yourself a salary from the business. This ensures that you aren’t personally liable if anything goes awry in your business. Rather, the business itself is liable.

(Shortform note: In addition to offering reduced liability, forming an LLC allows you to establish business credit. As a new business, you need to build credit to obtain financing and build credibility as you’re fostering relationships with vendors who sell you the resources you need. Likewise, LLCs experience fewer compliance regulations from states than sole proprietors or corporations. To establish an LLC, choose the state you want to form it in and choose a name. Then, choose a registered agent to receive important legal documents and tax notices on behalf of the LLC. Next, create an agreement between you and other members of the LLC for how the LLC will be operated. Finally, file your LLC documents with your state.)

**Step #2: Create terms of service if you sell products, and create contracts if you offer a service.** Customers have to agree to terms of service before buying your products. Likewise, clients have to sign a contract before you begin working with them. This creates transparency and offers protection for you, preventing customers and clients from neglecting to pay you or taking advantage of you in another way.

(Shortform note: In a legally binding fashion, terms of service for your product state how your product or service can be used. They protect your intellectual property and protect you from possible liabilities. Your terms of service should identify your business, describe your product or service, offer any relevant disclaimers and safety information, explain conditions and rights of use, and include any other necessary terms. Meanwhile, contracts outline the terms of an agreement between someone providing a service and someone requesting a service. They should state the scope of the work expected, the timeline for the services, how conflicts will be handled, the cost of the services, and any due dates for payments.)

**Step #3: Contract a business lawyer to help you with the legal aspects of your company.** An experienced lawyer will make sure that:

  1. Your contracts or terms of service are sound
  2. Your company is operating within the legal boundaries of your particular business and location
  3. You don’t make mistakes that lead to expensive lawsuits



> **How to Find the Right Business Lawyer**
> 
> To find the right lawyer for your business, do thorough research and consult a variety of sources. Search online for lawyers with expertise in your business area, and look at reviews from past clients. Additionally, ask for referrals from other business owners—they can give you their honest experiences with their lawyers (how the lawyer solved conflicts, got their business through difficult situations, and so on).
> 
> Once you have a list of possibilities, interview prospective lawyers to assess their abilities and experience, communicate your goals for your business, and find out how they can help you achieve them.
> 
> In addition to helping you create contracts and operate lawfully, a lawyer can help you with patent applications. If you develop a new product or service, patents help you protect your intellectual property. However, the application process takes time and money, particularly when you try to do it yourself. Lawyers have the knowledge to get a patent application submitted and approved more quickly than you can.

#### Tip #3: Develop Strong Customer Relationships

Finally, Jarvis argues that **it’s vital for a single-person company to foster strong connections with its customers.** Since these companies aren’t receiving money from investors, they depend on customer relationships to sustain and grow their business. Here are two of Jarvis’s suggestions for having beneficial customer interactions:

##### Suggestion #1: Be an Educator

When you’re looking for prospective customers, Jarvis suggests playing the role of educator as a sales strategy. **Teach people about your product or service, including how to use it so it best serves them.**

Being an educator requires transparency, clearly demonstrating the strengths of your product or service. When you can show your product’s unique strengths, you’ll stand out against competitors.

(Shortform note: Before you can educate customers about your product, you need to be an expert in it. In _The Psychology of Selling_ , Brian Tracy describes a three-step process for achieving this. First, analyze your product and identify five to 10 of its best features. Ask yourself why a customer buys your product. Additionally, study your customers. What qualities does your ideal customer have? What qualities do most of your existing customers have? What additional customers might benefit from your product? Finally, study your competitors. Identify your primary and secondary competitors and determine how your product outperforms theirs.)

Additionally, by acting as an educator for your product or service, you show customers that you’re the expert in your field, which builds trust. You’re the first person who comes to mind when they need whatever type of product or service you’re offering, and they’re more likely to buy from you.

To teach about your product or service, you might use social media, teach classes that show people how it works, and so on. For example, Toni Okamoto, founder of the website Plant-Based on a Budget, teaches people how to eat a healthy and affordable plant-based diet. Her website has hundreds of free recipes, she posts regularly about plant-based cooking on social media, she speaks about it on podcasts, and she offers a newsletter with recipes and tips.

Anyone can use these resources to learn about her methods and ideas. However, they also act as a sales pitch for her business, through which she sells meal plans and cookbooks and participates in speaking engagements. By giving her knowledge away freely and showing customers how they can be successful with her services, she builds trust and expertise. If people like her content, the free education entices them to invest in her brand further by purchasing her products.

(Shortform note: In _Rework_ , Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson offer several further suggestions for what to share with customers to build trust and credibility. First, they argue that customers love to see how products are made (which is why factory tours are popular). Knowing the inner workings of a business makes the customer feel like an insider, increasing their sense of loyalty. Additionally, Fried and Heinemeier suggest being transparent about your product’s imperfections and shortcomings. Customers will appreciate your honesty and trust you more as a result.)

> **Further Benefits of Customer Education**
> 
> Many experts agree that customer education is a valuable sales tactic. First, some research suggests that it increases revenue—customer education adds value for the customer using your product, which makes them more likely to continue using it. This is beneficial because it costs between five and 25 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one.
> 
> Education also leads customers to adopt new features quickly and engage with the product more deeply. Finally, educating customers upfront reduces the time and money it costs to help them with support issues later on. When customers already know how to use your product by the time they buy it, you won’t be overwhelmed with customer service requests.

##### Suggestion #2: Prioritize Quality Over Quantity

Jarvis argues that **a single-person company should prioritize creating high-quality, long-term relationships with customers,** rather than concentrating on acquiring a greater quantity of customers. This means focusing on providing the best quality service and products possible for each person you serve.

Jarvis argues that focusing on serving existing customers will help you maintain consistent revenue as loyal customers keep coming back. Owning a single-person company allows you to maintain strong, personal, and long-lasting relationships with customers because its small size means you have the time and capacity to focus on each individual’s needs.

Additionally, loyal customers become a cost-free part of your marketing strategy—if they’re satisfied with your services or products, they’ll likely recommend your company to their friends and family, which generates new business, money, and slow, sustainable growth.

(Shortform note: Some experts argue that customers referring their friends and family to you is the highest sign of loyalty. They’re taking a risk by recommending your product or service—if their recommendation turns out to be bad, it could affect their reputation or relationships. To justify that risk, they have to feel strongly about your company’s quality.)

> **How to Create Lasting Relationships With Clients**
> 
> Like any other long-term relationship, relationships with customers and clients take work, thoughtfulness, and effective communication. To aid your efforts in building strong, long-lasting customer connections, consider the following tips from experts in client relationships:
> 
> **Tip #1: Be consistent, timely, and efficient with your communication.** Your customers and clients need to know that their projects and concerns are important to you.
> 
> **Tip #2: Maintain a positive attitude.** For your clients to feel confident in your ability to meet their expectations and goals, you must _display_ confidence and enthusiasm. Even if you’re stressed, your customers and clients don’t need to see it.
> 
> **Tip #3: Be open about your opinions and perspective on the progress of projects you’re helping your customers with.** Don’t just tell your customers and clients what you think they want to hear. They need to know that you know what you’re talking about, and you can only show that by being honest. If you withhold your true thoughts, they may lose trust and decide to work with someone else.
