## Exercise: Use New Beginnings to Take Action

According to Pink, beginnings are all about what is possible, and therefore they often inspire us to take action. While many people think of the new year as their annual new beginning, Pink shows how there are hundreds of temporal landmarks in a year that offer the opportunity for a fresh start.

* * *

What is a goal you want to achieve or a habit you want to start? Why is this goal or habit important to you?

What is the first step you need to take to make progress on this goal or habit?

Choose one upcoming temporal landmark when you plan to take the first step toward your goal or habit. (For example, your birthday or the first of next month.) Write the day/time/occasion below.
