Based on your preferred sleep schedule, would you call yourself more of a morning type or a night type?

Based on your regular sleep schedule, when is the crest period of your day? Considering your professional and personal responsibilities, what activities do you want to focus on during your peak period to optimize your productivity and focus?

Pink recommends using the slump in your day as an opportunity for a restorative break. List three ways you can take a break during this time of day that would fit into your life right now (for example, taking a nap, going for a walk, or taking a break from screens).
