## Chapter 1: Each Day Is Full and Flexible

To open the book, Trump gives a rundown of his activities every day for a week—from nearly daily conversations with his investment banker to phone calls with Calvin Klein and Don Imus.

Here are some of the key takeaways.

First, **Trump keeps his schedule fairly open and flexible** to leave room for impromptu meetings. Too much structure hinders your creativity and openness to opportunities that arise. In the week Trump outlines, this approach allows him to tour a prospective school for his young daughter, take a friend’s call about a potential business opportunity, and even take a visit from David Letterman for a _Late Show_ segment.

Second, **Trump makesdozensof phone calls each day** —often more than 100—and they typically spill over into nights and weekends. Many calls are with his investment banker, his contractors, and his attorney about various deals. Additionally, some calls are more about making contact, staying in touch, and checking on rumors he’s heard that could open up opportunities for deals; for example, he calls a U.S. senator to commend him for his opposition to a tax law that Trump opposes, as well as Calvin Klein to congratulate him on his store’s success in Trump Tower.

Third, **Trump’s days are full of meetings, many of which are impromptu and less than 15 minutes long.** All of Trump’s meetings and phone calls tend to be brief and to the point, which allows him to fit in so many activities related to so many ventures, including potential deals, ongoing construction, and personal projects. He seldom even goes out for lunch because he considers it a waste of time.

Finally, **Trump makes time to go over details.** One minute he’s on a phone call about an ongoing lawsuit he’s involved in, and the next minute he’s signing off on Christmas decorations for the atrium in Trump Tower. He even has a meeting about what color to paint the window frames on a condominium building he’s putting up.

### Shortform Note

For Trump's full schedule and the outcomes of the week's deals and conversations, refer to Chapters 1 and 14 in the book. For the sake of brevity and coherence, we've omitted Chapter 14, which follows up on the events listed in Chapter 1.

Some of the stories and details about Trump’s involvement, practices, and profits in _The Art of the Deal_ have been questioned or contradicted since its publication. In fact, the book’s ghostwriter Tony Schwartz has said that writing the book was his greatest regret and suggested that the book be “recategorized … as fiction.”

We’ve included Shortform notes to point out several factual discrepancies, though these may not be exhaustive.
