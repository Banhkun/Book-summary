## Exercise: Keep Costs Low on Your Project

Bringing projects in under budget requires strong, decisive leadership.

* * *

Describe a situation when incomplete planning or indecisiveness led to higher costs on a project.

In which aspects of your current project could indecisiveness negatively affect costs?

How can you proactively approach these decisions to avoid unnecessary costs?

In future projects, how can you build in a process to identify and address the aspects in which indecisiveness affects costs?
