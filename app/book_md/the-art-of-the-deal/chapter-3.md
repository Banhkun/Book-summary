## Chapter 3: Trump’s Formative Years

Trump is a born-and-raised New Yorker. He and his four siblings grew up comfortably, but their parents always instilled in them the value of hard work.

### Trump Growing Up

**Trump was aggressive from a young age** ; he even gave his teacher a black eye in second grade because he didn’t think the teacher was qualified.

As Trump got older, he started creating trouble, so at the age of 13, his father sent him to military school. **The New York Military Academy instilled the discipline that taught Trump to funnel his aggression into work.**

Trump became captain of the cadets his senior year, and he was also captain of the baseball team. His baseball coach, a teacher and former Marine drill sergeant, was an imposing man who had a big impact on Trump. This teacher was physically and emotionally tough and intimidated most people—not unlike Trump’s father—but Trump forged a relationship with him by showing respect for the teacher as well as confidence in himself.

Although he didn’t care much about schoolwork, academics came fairly easily to Trump. He enrolled at Fordham University, but after two years transferred to the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance. The most important things he took away from Wharton were:

  * The understanding that he shouldn’t put too much stock in academic credentials 
  * The understanding that other people _are_ highly impressed by academic credentials, and that a Wharton degree carries a lot of weight



Trump combined these experiences with lessons from his father to eventually create his own business.

### Like Father Like Son

Trump’s biggest influence was his father, Fred Trump, who was tough both personally and professionally. Donald learned about business, motivation, toughness, and efficiency from watching and helping his father in his business, building and operating rent-stabilized and rent-controlled housing in Brooklyn and Queens.

#### Fred’s Beginnings

Fred Trump was born the second of three children in New Jersey in the early 1900s. His father—a Swedish immigrant and restaurant owner—died when Fred was just 11. As the oldest son, Fred took on the role of man of the house: He worked odd jobs, including some on construction sites. That’s where his interest in construction began.

As a teenager, Fred took night classes, such as plan-reading and carpentry, to learn more about the construction business. Before he’d even graduated high school, Fred had his first business building and selling prefabricated garages.

After high school, Fred worked as a home-builder’s assistant. **Fred’s natural intelligence, ambition, and hard work—along with the skills he’d learned in his night classes—helped him excel.** Within a year, he’d built and sold a single-family home for a 33 percent profit margin.

That was the beginning of his company, Elizabeth Trump & Son. Fred tapped into an eager market for his single-family homes: working-class families in Queens who’d long lived in small apartments and were excited to have a home with more space. Over time, Fred built bigger homes to sell for larger profits.

When the Depression devastated the housing market, Fred dabbled in a mortgage-servicing business and a self-service supermarket, both of which he quickly sold for profit. Then **Fred returned to building cheaper homes in low-income areas of Brooklyn and Queens and his business success grew.**

#### Fred’s Business Success

**Fred was a demanding businessman, constantly pushing contractors on the construction sites to work quickly and produce quality work.**

Anytime Fred started construction at the same time as nearby competitors, he’d finish his building months before his competitors. In addition, Fred made his buildings slightly nicer than average rent-controlled buildings—with amenities as simple as a better-looking lobby or larger bedrooms—which attracted renters. (Principle: Appearances matter.)

Often, Fred’s competitors went bankrupt before finishing construction and Fred would swoop in and buy the projects. (Principle: Their loss is your win.)

Fred’s business was successful but difficult. Since rents were low, he had to keep costs down in order to profit. (Principle: Keep costs low.) Fred managed this by:

  * Knowing what everything cost—from supplies to services—and not letting anyone overcharge him
  * Convincing suppliers and contractors to take lower pay in exchange for a steady stream of work and on-time payments
  * Reminding contractors that he turned projects around quickly, so working for him meant that they could soon move on to the next job



**Although Donald didn’t follow exactly in his father’s footsteps, he adopted several of Fred’s tactics** , including pushing contractors to finish projects quickly and coaxing contractors with the promise of more work.

### Donald Learned the Business

Donald and his brother had accompanied their father to construction sites since childhood. He’d work with his father during school breaks, and as soon as he graduated from Wharton, Donald joined Fred’s business full time.

Donald enjoyed much of the business, but a few aspects of building and running rent-stabilized and rent-controlled buildings didn’t appeal to him.

First, **Donald wanted a business with bigger profits.** Not only would that mean more cash in his pockets, but also that he could be more creative with the design of the buildings. Donald wanted to construct buildings with luxury and stunning design details—like the glass curtain wall he’d later include on the facade of Trump Tower—that would be excessive and out of place in middle-income apartment buildings.

Second, a small portion of tenants in the rent-stabilized and rent-controlled buildings was disrespectful and even violent. Collecting rent could be dangerous when tenants didn’t want to pay. Additionally, some tenants trashed the property out of ignorance or indifference. Donald wanted a different kind of clientele.

Ultimately, Donald had his sights set on more glamour and bigger profits in Manhattan. **While he inherited his father’s work ethic, he got his mother’s love for grandeur. The combination of the two helped him to create bold buildings and large profits.**
