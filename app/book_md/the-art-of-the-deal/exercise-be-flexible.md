## Exercise: Be Flexible

You can keep your project alive by knowing when to fold on your current plan and having a backup plan.

* * *

Describe the last time you hit a roadblock in a project that prevented you from carrying out your original plan. What did you do?

What contingency plan do you have in place if something similar happens in your current project?

How will you know if you’ve reached a point where you need to switch to plan B?

How can you build flexibility into your future projects so that you know when a plan isn’t working and you’re able to switch gears without losing progress?
