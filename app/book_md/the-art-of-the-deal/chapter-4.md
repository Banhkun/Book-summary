## Chapter 4: Trump’s First Deal—Cincinnati Apartments

Trump was still in college when he made his first big deal: An apartment complex called Swifton Village in Cincinnati. He bought the site with his father and learned lessons that he’d carry into future projects.

### Their Loss Is Your Win: Trump Bought Foreclosed Buildings

During college, Trump regularly scanned the listings of foreclosed Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-financed housing projects. Browsing foreclosures is the epitome of gaining from someone else’s loss: **Once banks foreclose on a property, they typically want to get it off their hands as quickly as possible, which gives buyers leverage to swoop in and get a good price.**

In the case of Swifton Village, two-thirds of the apartments were vacant and the development was in such bad shape that Trump and his father had no competing bidders. They ultimately bought the apartments for $6 million—less than half of what the developers paid to build them a few years prior—and secured a mortgage that covered the $6 million plus $100,000 for improvements.

They didn’t have to put any of their own money in, and once they got things up and running, rents would cover their mortgage.

### Know Your Target Audience: Trump Raised Rents to Reduce Tenant Issues

The tenants were the source of most of the problems at Swifton Village. Many tenants had never lived in apartments before and didn’t know how to maintain them, so they ended up doing a lot of damage to the apartments and the property. Others didn’t pay rent, and some even moved out in the middle of the night to avoid paying.

**Trump and his father suspected they’d have fewer problems from tenants who could afford higher rents.** They spent about $800,000 (keep in mind this was in the 1960s) to make significant improvements to the building and the property so that they could charge higher rents.

After the renovations, the Trumps ran newspaper ads for the apartments and had zero vacancies by the following year.

(Shortform note: The Trumps were sued for housing discrimination after a black prospective tenant was turned away. They gave the man an apartment and settled the case.)

### Appearances Matter: Trump Made Small Improvements For a Big Impact

In order to attract higher-paying tenants to Swifton Village, Trump’s renovations included some unexpected changes, including:

  * Adding window shutters 
  * Replacing aluminum apartment front doors with white colonial doors
  * Sanding and staining floors
  * Painting hallways
  * Landscaping outside the buildings



**The improvements were meant to make the building feel nicer and more inviting than the drab, dreary look associated with lower-income housing.**

Some of these changes may seem extraneous, but these kinds of details can make a building look like it’s worth more; investing a relatively small amount in improving appearance and cleanliness can add much more in value.

### Know When to Fold: Trump Sold When Conditions Went South

Several years after the Trumps bought Swifton Village, one of the tenants told Donald that the area was getting dangerous. **The tenant said that the people who were moving in were bringing the whole area down, and that Trump should sell Swifton.**

Trump spent a few extra days in Cincinnati and talked to people around the city and near Swifton. Everything he heard and saw confirmed that the area was going downhill, so he decided to sell Swifton Village.

Prudent Real Estate Investment Trust put out an offer and sent an employee to check out the property. The representative seemed to be more interested in trying a local restaurant he’d heard about than closely evaluating Swifton, so he took a tour and spent the rest of the afternoon having lunch. This is the opposite of how Trump approaches business—he scrutinizes every aspect of the project to ensure he’s getting a good deal—but as the seller, it worked in his favor.

### Prepare for the Worst: Trump Protected Himself

Although the Trumps decided to sell Swifton Village because they saw trouble on the horizon, they still had zero vacancies when they were drawing up the contract.

**In order to protect themselves, the Trumps slipped in two unusual clauses that helped ensure them a good deal** :

  1. One clause cemented everything as of the date of _signing_ , not of _closing_ the deal, as is typical. By the time they closed a few months later, Swifton had many vacancies, which would have hurt their deal. 
  2. Another clause penalized Prudent if they failed to close the deal; normally buyers only risk losing a 10 percent deposit if they pull out. This locked Prudent in, despite the vacancies. (Shortform note: Trump doesn’t specify what the penalty was, just that it was “huge.”)



* * *

Prudent ultimately bought Swifton for $12 million, meaning the Trumps walked away with a nearly $6 million profit because they had little debt and were bringing in $700,000 a year in rents.

(Shortform note: A Washington Post report fact-checked Trump’s claims about his success at Swifton Village and found several discrepancies. The report found that the Trumps’ profit was likely a million dollars or less, rather than the $6 million he claims, and that Fred was a much larger player in the deal than Donald.)
