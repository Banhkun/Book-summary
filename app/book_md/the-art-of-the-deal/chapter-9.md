## Chapter 9: Trump’s Second Casino—Trump Castle

With one Atlantic City venture under his belt, Trump considered buying Hilton’s Atlantic City casino-hotel.

### Prepare for the Worst: Hilton Made Fatal Mistakes

The Hilton company had made some poor business decisions in the previous few decades, and it was losing its lead against competing hotel chains. Hilton bought two casinos in Nevada to give the company a boost—and it worked, so Hilton considered a casino-hotel in Atlantic City.

Hilton pulled out all the stops for this facility, with a huge site and ambitious construction plans. In its zeal to open for business in Atlantic City, **Hilton filed for its gaming license and started building at the same time** , but made several critical mistakes:

  * Hilton hired a lawyer when word got out that its application might be rejected, but there’s speculation that the proactive step didn’t sit well with the gaming commission. 
  * Hilton kept its lawyer on retainer—even though the commission had a bad history with the lawyer—up until the Division of Gaming Enforcement specifically objected to him during the application review. 
  * The company’s chief executive Barron Hilton was fairly hands-off with the licensing process, seldom attending or even sending his top executives to the licensing hearings. 



Ultimately, the Casino Control Commission denied Hilton’s gaming application just 12 weeks before its scheduled grand opening.

### Their Loss Is Your Win: Trump Positioned Himself and Was Patient

With more than $300 million already invested, Hilton planned to file for another hearing. The company was still hiring hundreds of employees in preparation for the casino’s opening; **if Hilton’s application was rejected again, the company would face a huge financial loss and be forced to sell for any price it could get.**

Trump called Barron to offer his sympathies and—more importantly—express his interest in buying the property. Barron still planned to move forward with the gaming license rehearings, but Trump had planted the seed.

Not long after, the head of the Golden Nugget started positioning himself to take control of the Hilton company, which was possible because Barron had inherited only enough shares to make him a minor owner of the company. The takeover attempt helped Trump in a few ways:

  * Defending the company from a takeover distracted Barron from the licensing rehearings
  * **The aggressive move repelled Barron from Golden Nugget and made Trump’s offer more appealing by comparison.**



Barron sold the casino to Trump for $320 million, allowing Hilton to break even with his investment in the facility.

Learning from his experience at Trump Plaza, Trump appointed his wife to run Trump Castle instead of hiring a general manager.

Under her direction, the casino-hotel grossed $226 million in its first year.
