## Exercise: Define How You Want customers to Perceive You

Consider how to distinguish your business from your competitors and appeal to your target market.

* * *

Describe your target market. (For example, your target market consists of women aged between 30 to 45 years who want to purchase custom handmade toys for children under the age of five. They primarily shop online.)

Write down at least one strategy your competitors use to appeal to this market. (For example, your competitors attempt to appeal to your target market by using celebrity endorsements.)

Write down how you want your target market to perceive your business. (For example, you want your target market to perceive your business as a reliable provider of high-quality handmade toys.)

Write down how your business, product, or service is better than whatâ€™s already on the market. (For example, your toys are the safest in the market because you implement stricter quality control procedures than your competitors.)
