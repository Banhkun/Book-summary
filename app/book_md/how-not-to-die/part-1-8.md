## Part 1-8: Deaths from Medical Treatment

Annual deaths from iatrogenic causes: 225,000

Iatrogenic causes relate to illness caused by medical treatment. This includes:

  * 106,000 deaths from side effects from medications
  * 99,000 deaths from hospital-acquired infections
  * 20,000 deaths from hospital errors
  * 12,000 deaths from unnecessary surgery complications
  * 7,000 deaths from wrong medication
  * 199,000 deaths from drug side effects



#### How Not to Die from Medical Treatment

**Reduce medical error.**

  * Residents used to have 36-hour shifts until they were shortened. Residents who undergo all-nighters increase serious medical errors by 36% and diagnostic errors by 5x.



**Reduce radiation through diet and reducing exposure.**

  * Medical treatment and diagnose entail many sources of radiation:
    * A single CT scan for a baby girl could cause cancer at a rate of 1 out of 150.
    * A chest CT has the same cancer risk as 700 cigarettes.
    * An angiogram could cause cancer in 1 out of 270 women.
    * A cross-country flight could expose you to as much radiation as a chest x-ray.
  * Reduce radiation damage through antioxidants in foods like spinach and kale. Vitamin C and E supplements don’t seem to help.
  * Survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings show that plant-rich diets cut cancer risk by 36%.
  * Ginger, garlic, turmeric, goji berries, mint leaves, and lemon may also be protective against radiation.



**Use diet instead of drugs.**

  * Patients routinely overestimate the power of drugs to treat disease.
    * Patients believe statins are 20x more effective than they actually are. In reality, the benefit of preventing heart attack is <5% over a period of 5 years.
    * In comparison, a plant-based diet may reduce the risk of heart attack by 60% over 4 years
  * Patients who overtrust drugs may be less likely to adopt lifestyle changes.



**Reconsider taking aspirin.**

  * Salicylic acid (the active ingredient in aspirin) acts as a blood thinner by inhibiting pro-coagulant enzymes. It also suppresses proinflammatory prostaglandins. People at risk of heart attacks take it regularly.
  * Aspirin is not generally recommended for people who haven’t had the first heart attack, because of the side effects it causes.
  * Fruits and vegetables contain salicylic acid—blood levels of salicylic acid in people on plant-based diets are comparable to that in people who take low-dose aspirin.
    * **Cumin, chili powder, paprika, and turmeric** have the highest concentration of salicylic acid. As suggestive evidence, India has very low rates of colon cancer, which is the most sensitive cancer to aspirin.
    * Organic produce seems to have more salicylic acid, possibly because salicylic acid is used as a defense mechanism against bugs. Produce that rely on pesticides don’t have a need for this defense mechanism.
  * Fruit and vegetables may cause fewer side effects than taking aspirin. Furthermore, if you take it naturally in diet, salicylic acid comes packaged with other gut-protective nutrients.



**Understand colonoscopies.**

  * Starting at age 50, you should get a colonoscopy per decade, have your stool tested for blood each year, or have a sigmoidoscopy every 5 years.
    * It’s unclear which of these three options is best until the experimental results come out.
    * But doctors generally **over-prescribe colonoscopies because they bill the most**.
  * Serious complications, like perforations and bleeding, happen in 1 out of 350 colonoscopies.
  * Eating peppermint oil capsules reduces the strength of colon contractions, which can reduce complications.
