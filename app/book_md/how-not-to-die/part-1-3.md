## Part 1-3: Infections, Diabetes

### Infectious Disease

Many infectious diseases resulted from human domestication of animals. We got tuberculosis from goats, measles and smallpox from cattle, typhoid fever from chickens, and the cold virus from horses.

Your immune system consists of a few types of cells:

  * White blood cells
    * Neutrophils destroy pathogens like bacteria and parasites directly.
    * Natural killer cells kill your body’s cells that are infected.
  * B cells
    * Produce antibodies that bind to a specific antigen (like a bacterial protein).
    * These antibodies then deactivate pathogens, or signal to natural killer cells that a cell is infected.



For some reason, people suffering from allergies have lower risk for some cancers. One theory is that an overactive immune system also protects against threats like cancer cells.

#### Reducing Infections and Boosting Immune System

**Fruits and vegetables**

  * An evolutionary theory for the relationship between eating plants and the immune system: to reduce energy expenditure, the immune system activates itself periodically at times of greatest risk—including eating food with potential pathogens. As cavepeople, we evolved over millions of years mainly eating plants, not meat—therefore, plants serve as better triggers to activate our immunity.
  * A host of experiments show the benefits:
    * In an experiment, people over 65 who ate 5+ servings of fruits and vegetables had a 82% greater protective antibody response to vaccine, compared to people who ate <3 servings.
    * Raw kale extract stimulates 5x greater antibody production _in vitro_
    * Broccoli activates intraepithelial lymphocytes.
    * Phytonutrients from plants reduce the toxicity of dioxins (common in pollution) _in vitro_ , but the effects only last for a few hours.
    * Blueberries (1.5 cups per day for 6 weeks) doubled natural killer counts in athletes after intense exercise, when normally exercise cuts those cell counts in half.



**Other diet**

  * Cardamom activated the activity of natural killer cells against lymphoma cancer by 10x _in vitro_.
  * Probiotics: Babies delivered via C-section have increased risk for allergies. The theory is that natural birth babies are exposed to the mother’s vaginal bacteria, which then reside in the baby’s gut. 
    * There isn’t enough evidence yet to suggest that supplementation of probiotics is necessary.
  * Mushrooms: Eating button mushrooms daily over a week increased IgA antibody levels in saliva by 50%.



**Exercise**

  * Exercise may activate IgA antibody production in saliva, eyes, and nostrils.
  * Aerobic exercise for 30 minutes a day, 3 times a week for 12 weeks increased IgA levels in saliva by 50%, compared to control.
  * Elderly sedentary women have a 50% chance of getting a cold in the fall. 0.5 hours per day of walking reduces the risk to 20%. Conditioned runners have just an 8% risk.
  * Overtraining, like with marathons, increases risk of infection. This can be addressed through eating chlorella and nutritional yeast—both reduce the risk of infection and maintain IgA/white blood cell levels.



**To prevent transmitting diseases to other people when you’re sick:**

  * Cough into the crook of your arm (inner elbow), not your hand.
  * Sanitize your hands after every bathroom visit and handshake, before preparing food, and before touching your eyes or mouth.
  * Alcohol-based rubs are preferred for sanitation.



#### Food Poisoning

Animal foods are the most common source of food poisoning. The common pathogens like _E. coli_ are intestinal bacteria and common in animal feces. Plants don’t have intestines, and so they don’t naturally harbor pathogens.

  * Outbreaks of food poisoning in vegetables are often caused by contamination by manure or animals and delivered to plants, eg through irrigation water



Food poisoning often resolves within days, but children and the elderly are especially at risk for worse infections and complications.

The most common food poisoning pathogens:

  * Eggs and _Salmonella_ : these can survive the egg cooking methods of scrambling and sunny-side-up.
  * Poultry and _Salmonella_ : even when chicken is cooked well, cross contamination spreads bacteria to the kitchen counter, faucet, refrigerator handles, and elsewhere.
  * Meat and _E. coli_ : beef has gotten safer over time to eat, partly because of the regulation on the sale of contaminated beef.
  * Pork and _Yersinia_
  * All meat and _C. difficile_ : this bacterium resides in your gut and can flare up when you take antibiotics and disrupt your gut microbiome



There’s a lot of concern about bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics. 80% of antibiotics produced go to the meat industry, where animals living in poor conditions tend to get disease that needs antibiotic dosing. This creates an environment enriching for drug-resistant bacteria. By reducing our collective meat intake, we can reduce the development of more serious infections.

### Diabetes

20 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes.

Annual deaths from diabetes: 76,000 direct deaths, plus 50,000 cases of kidney failure, 75,000 lower limb amputations, and 650,000 cases of vision loss.

#### The Disease

Diabetes mellitus is a condition in which blood sugar levels are chronically elevated.

High blood sugar damages nerves, leading to neuropathy and pain. It also damages blood vessels, which 1) leads to blindness and 2) cuts off circulation in the extremities, leading to amputation of limbs.

There are two major types of diabetes. Both types concern insulin, the hormone that causes cells to absorb glucose from blood. Insulin is secreted by beta cells in the pancreas.

  * Type 1 diabetes is genetic and caused by autoimmune destruction of beta cells. Less insulin production means higher blood sugar. Type 1 diabetes can be treated with insulin injections.
  * Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance. Insulin secretion can be normal or elevated, but insulin doesn’t work as effectively as normal, leaving sugar in blood. This is treated with drugs and sometimes with insulin.



Prediabetes in children is increasing because of obesity. Developing diabetes in childhood cuts life expectancy by 20 years and increases the risk of disease across the board.

#### Insulin Resistance and Fat

Fat is heavily associated with insulin resistance. 90% of type 2 diabetics are overweight.

  * The biological mechanism: fat disrupts the insulin signaling pathway.
  * Obese patients have about 2-5x the level of free floating fat in the bloodstream compared to people of normal weight. Obese people are basically spilling fat into the bloodstream constantly.



A person’s diet affects fat levels and insulin resistance, even controlling for the person’s weight.

  * A 1927 study put people in two groups: Group 1 had a fat-rich diet, while Group 2 had a carb-rich diet. In high-fat Group 1, insulin resistance increased within days, far more than high-carb Group 2.
  * People eating low-carb, high-fat diets can reach the same free floating fat levels as obese people.



#### Vegetarian Diet on Diabetes

Vegetarians have a 61% lower prevalence of diabetes compared to non-vegetarians.

  * It’s not just because they’re skinner—even after controlling for weight, vegans have a <50% risk of diabetes compared to omnivores. Between people of the same weight, vegans have less fat trapped in deep calf muscles compared to omnivores
  * Plant-based diets reduce insulin resistance, improve blood sugar control, and reduce LDL cholesterol.



**Vegetarian diets have multiple effects that lower the risk of diabetes.**

  * Eating fewer calories: people tend to eat the same _volume_ of food per meal, regardless of calorie count. Vegetables are calorically far less dense but feel more filling.
  * Insulin sensitivity: even without causing weight loss, plant-based diets improved insulin sensitivity and A1C levels in diabetics, within weeks.
  * Better eating habits: the plant-based diet group felt less likely to binge and felt less hungry.
  * Intrinsic benefits of plant foods: eating five cups of legumes each week had better effects on cholesterol and insulin regulation than cutting 500 calories a day.
  * Saturated fats in meat vs unsaturated fats in vegetables.
    * Saturated fats like palmitate cause a variety of bad effects: toxic byproducts like free radicals, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
    * Unsaturated fats are less harmful, easier to detoxify, and may suppress inflammation.
    * Saturated fats and LDL cholesterol are toxic to beta cells; monounsaturated fats are not.
  * Lower potentially toxic chemicals: PCBs in salmon and canned sardines can disrupt metabolism. People with the highest level of pollutants have 38x the odds of diabetes.
  * Higher resting metabolism: vegetarians have higher gene expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase, which helps metabolize fats.
  * Better mood: plant-based group reported better quality of life and higher mood scores than conventional diet.
  * Reduces neuropathy pain and can restore vision loss.



**While the risk of disease scales with the amount of meat you eat, even a little meat eating is destructive.**

  * In Taiwan, people’s diet includes little meat to begin with—women ate a single serving each week, and men had a serving every few days. Vegetarian men had half the odds of diabetes as occasional meat eater. Vegetarian women had 25% the odds.
  * Meat consumption was associated with weight gain, even after adjusting for calories. In other words, **even when eating the same number of calories, meat eaters tend to gain more weight.**
    * Specifically, an increase in meat intake of 250g per day (like one steak) leads to a 2-kg higher weight gain after 5 years (Source).
  * Poultry is potentially the most fattening meat—people eating 1oz of chicken a day had a significantly greater gain in BMI than non-chicken eaters. This could be caused by industries fattening chickens over time—100 years ago, a serving of chicken may have 16 fat calories; now, it has over 200 fat calories.



#### Other Interventions on Diabetes

Drugs are commonly prescribed to treat diabetes, but they can _increase_ mortality.

  * A seminal NEJM study showed that intensive blood sugar management by drugs led to increased mortality compared to standard therapy. The intensive group had a lower HA1C target and were subject to more drugs and higher doses.
  * Insulin administered as a drug can accelerate aging and promote inflammation in arteries.



Gastric bypass surgery reduces diabetes in up to 83% of patients. This is great, but the same effect can be achieved with extreme diets, without the surgery: within a week of eating 600 calories daily, blood sugar levels normalize.

  * Hypothesis: during extreme diets, fat is pulled out of fat storage in muscles and liver, allowing normal function of those organs.
