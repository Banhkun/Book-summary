## Preface

The US healthcare system runs on a fee-for-service model: doctors get paid for pills and procedures they perform, not for patient health outcomes. Thus, actually _preventing_ disease and improving patients’ lifestyle is undervalued in medical care.

To wit, most medical schools don’t have _any_ courses on nutrition. Doctors receive very little training on how diet can reduce the risk of serious disease and death. No wonder the medical establishment has paid so little attention to the value of nutrition.

### Introduction

**Our genes only account for 10-20% of the risk for most leading causes of death** , like high blood pressure, heart attacks, cancer. As evidence of this, when people move from low- to high-risk countries, their disease rates change to those of the new environment. For example, a Japanese person who moves to America raises her risk of heart disease, even though she is genetically Japanese.

But aren’t we dying less, and living longer? Not necessarily. Even though lifespan in America has increased slightly over the past decades, the quality of life at the end of life is worse.

The author Michael Greger argues diet is behind all of this. Specifically, that a diet heavy in meat, dairy, eggs, and processed foods is much less healthy than a diet based on whole foods and plants.

Here’s some evidence of how plant-based diets increase health:

  * People who used to be vegetarians but who went back to eating meat increased their risk of disease significantly—they increase heart disease odds by 146%, stroke by 152%, diabetes by 166%, weight gain by 231%. Their life expectancy drops by 3.6 years.
  * Women who eat more whole plant foods reduce odds of breast cancer by 90%.
  * Whole plant foods have been associated with longer telomeres (parts of your DNA that are associated with aging), while refined foods and meat are associated with shorter telomeres. Is this because vegetarians eat less? No—caloric restriction and exercise alone didn’t improve telomere length, so seems like telomeres were affected by the _quality_ of food eaten.



In total, **lifestyle accounts for 78% of risk of chronic disease**. Not smoking, having normal body weight, exercising half an hour a day, and maintaining a healthy diet can reduce the risk of chronic disease by a huge margin.

But wait—can’t we just take medication to reduce our risk of disease? Not really. Drugs can’t protect you fully from disease, and they have side effects. Here’s an analogy—you have a running faucet that is causing a sink to overflow. Taking drugs is like mopping up the floor around the overflowing sink constantly, instead of turning off the faucet.

Preventing the disease is often far better than treating it over years and decades. And diet is the way this book recommends you prevent disease.
