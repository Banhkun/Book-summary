## Part 1-4: High Blood Pressure, Liver Disease

### High Blood Pressure

Annual deaths from high blood pressure: 65,000

#### The Disease

High blood pressure, or hypertension, is cited as the #1 risk factor for death in the world, leading to 9 million deaths worldwide annually (source: the Global Burden of Disease Study in the Lancet). 78 million Americans have hypertension.

Blood pressure consists of two numbers: systolic is the pressure when blood pumps through the artery, and diastolic is the pressure between beats.

  * 110/70 is an ideal blood pressure, even though 120/80 is cited as normal
  * 140/90 is hypertensive



Hypertension promotes atherosclerosis (which leads to heart attacks and strokes). It also puts strain on the heart leading to heart failure; it damages blood vessels and leads to kidney disease.

Blood pressure tends to increase with age—65% of Americans age 60 or above have hypertension. But Kenyans of that age eating a low-sodium diet based around whole plant foods had normal blood pressure.

#### Sodium

**Evolutionarily, we ate plant-based diets consisting of 500mg of sodium a day.**

Now, average daily consumption is 3,500mg, and the AHA recommends 1,500mg. (Remember that it might not be wise to follow the standard guidelines in a country where heart disease is the #1 killer.)

The relationship is simple: sodium raises blood pressure.

  * Double-blind randomized trials show that salt increases blood pressure.
  * A single meal increases blood pressure over the next 3 hours, and decreases endothelial function within 30 minutes.



Inversely, cutting sodium from diet lowers blood pressure:

  * Dietary changes alone reversed malignant hypertension (240/150) down to 105/80.



The mechanism of action could be free radicals.

  * In Doppler flowmetry, sodium reduces blood flow, but vitamin C (an antioxidant that scavenges free radicals) blocks the sodium effect.
  * Sodium suppresses an antioxidant enzyme called superoxide dismutase.



#### How to Reduce Sodium Intake

Understand the major dietary sources of sodium:

  * ¾ of salt in the average diet comes from processed foods.
  * For kids, the major source of sodium is pizza; for people aged 20-50, it’s chicken; for ages 50+, it’s bread.



Why is there so much salt in food?

  * Partly it’s for preservation of food. 
  * Adding sodium to meat increases water retention, increasing the weight of meat that’s sold. 
  * Saltier food tastes better than unsalty food, so competition with other products increases sodium across the board.



**How to cut back on sodium:**

  * Adjust your taste buds back to normalcy.
    * Your taste buds adapt to whatever food you give it. Cut sodium, fat, and sugar from your diet for a few weeks—food will taste bland at first, but eventually your taste buds will revert to normal. Food will taste more flavorful, and you will actively dislike aggressively salty and fatty foods.
  * Don’t add salt at the table.
  * Don’t add salt when cooking.
  * Stop eating out so much.
  * Avoid processed foods.
  * Buy foods with fewer milligrams of sodium than there are grams in the serving size or calories (e.g. <100 milligrams sodium for 100g of serving or 100 calories).



#### Diet for Hypertension

**Whole grains**

  * Three portions of whole grains a day reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke as effectively as high blood pressure medications (without side effects).
  * These have to be whole grains—refined grains like white rice increase the risk of diabetes.



**Vegetarian diets**

  * Rural Kenya and China people (with a low-sodium plant-based diet) show ideal blood pressures throughout all age, unlike Westerners who increase blood pressure with age.
  * The more plant-based foods you eat, the lower your hypertension rates. Flexitarians show 23% reduced risk of hypertension; vegans show 75% reduced risk.
  * Even controlling for weight, vegetarians show better blood pressure.



**Flaxseed**

  * A few tablespoons a day may be more effective than exercise.
  * Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial showed blood pressure drop from 158/82 to 143/75, compared to no change in control. This drop was multiples that achieved by medication!



**Hibiscus**

  * 3 cups of hibiscus tea a day dropped blood pressure by 6 points over control.
  * Hibiscus ranks #1 in antioxidant content of beverages, above green tea.
  * Precautions: it’s acidic, so rinse your mouth after drinking. And because of its high manganese content, don’t drink more than a quart a day



**Nitrates**

  * Nitric oxide dilates blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. Nitric oxide is created by NO synthase from nitrates. Free radicals consume NO and disrupt NO synthase. Antioxidants prevent free radicals from causing damage this way.
  * A high-antioxidant diet improves endothelial function (the ability of vessels to relax and dilate).
  * **Best foods for nitrates, in descending order:** arugula, rhubarb, cilantro, butter leaf lettuce, mesclun greens, basil, beet greens, oak leaf lettuce, swiss chard, beets.
  * Beet juice can lower blood pressure by 10 points within hours, and by similar amounts over weeks with daily consumption. It also seems to allow higher aerobic performance from less oxygen, allowing more time to exhaustion and longer breath-holding.



**Wine with alcohol removed**

#### Hypertension Drugs

Drugs are not as effective as diet in reducing blood pressure.

  * Calcium-channel blockers drop blood pressure 8/3 points, and ACE inhibitors by 5/2 points, compared to 15/7 for flaxseed.



Drugs also come with lots of side effects

  * Diuretics cause electrolyte disturbances
  * Calcium-channel blockers (Norvasc, Cardizem) increase breast cancer risk
  * Beta blockers (Lopressor, Corgard) cause lethargy and impotence
  * ACE inhibitors (Vasotec, Altace) cause swelling



As is the theme of the book, it’s best to fix your medical issues with lifestyle changes and diet first, before needing to rely on drugs.

### Liver Diseases

Annual deaths from liver disease: 65,000

This includes cirrhosis and liver cancer.

#### Liver Function

  * All blood coming from intestines passes through the liver first.
  * The liver metabolizes nutrients and deactivates toxins.
  * You can survive without a kidney, stomach, and gallbladder, but you can’t survive without a liver.



#### Liver Diseases

We’ll cover three major diseases of the liver:

**Diet-induced fatty liver disease**

  * This is the most common cause of chronic liver disease, affecting 70 million people in the US. Nearly all severely obese people have liver disease.
  * Mechanism of action: 
    * Fat deposits in liver cause inflammation, which cause liver scarring, which leads to liver failure.
    * Cholesterol overload causes cholesterol to crystallize. White blood cells try to eat cholesterol crystals and die, causing inflammatory compounds to leak out and cause liver disease.
  * Diet causes big changes quickly:
    * One week of a fast food-heavy diet can cause pathological liver function tests.
    * One can of soda per day raises fatty liver disease by 45%.
  * Studies show animal fat and cholesterol cause liver disease. Eating the equivalent of >14 chicken nuggets per day of meat causes 3x the rate of fatty liver disease compared to <7 nuggets per day.



**Alcoholic liver disease**

  * Excessive alcohol consumption causes fatty liver, which leads to inflammation in the liver and irreparable scarring. What is excessive? It’s defined as >2 drinks per day for males, or >1 drink per day for females.
  * Heavy drinking can lead to fatty liver in 3 weeks. Luckily, in most people, stopping drinking allows the liver to resolve within 4-6 weeks.



**Hepatitis**

There are five types of hepatitis:

  * Hep A—foodborne through feces, preventable with vaccine.
  * Hep B—bloodborne, transmitted sexually and maternally through birth. Also preventable with vaccine.
  * Hep C—bloodborne, transmitted through needle sharing. No prevention. Hep C is the leading cause of liver transplants.
  * Hep D—only infects people with hep B, so prevent hep B and you won’t get hep D.
  * Hep E—pigs may be the primary reservoir. 11% of pig livers show Hep E virus. Pork consumption in countries correlates with liver disease. Hep E is highly risky for pregnancy, so, while pregnant, cook pork well or avoid entirely.



#### Preventing Liver Disease

The most important behaviors to avoid liver disease: **don’t be obese, eat less fat and cholesterol, don’t drink alcohol heavily, and don’t share needles.**

Foods shown to be good for livers:

  * **Oatmeal**
    * A double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in overweight people showed oatmeal reduced liver inflammation and led to weight loss.
    * Refined grains like white rice are associated with an increased risk of liver disease.
  * **Cranberries**
    * Beat out other common fruits in suppressing liver cancer cells _in vitro._
    * Extracts failed to match the anticancer effects of whole cranberries.
    * It’s best to eat them fresh or frozen, not juiced or dried.
  * **Coffee**
    * In the group at highest risk for liver disease, people who drank >2 cups of coffee per day showed less than half the risk of chronic liver problems.
    * Among smokers, >4 cups of coffee per day showed 92% lower risk of death from chronic liver disease.
    * Mechanism of action: coffee may reduce DNA damage, increase the clearance of infected cells, and slow the scarring process.



#### Is Alcohol Protective?

Whether alcohol is healthy or not has been the source of continuous flip-flopping in the media.

The simple facts:

  * Alcohol decreases mortality, but only for those in poorer health.
  * Drinking decreases heart disease, but increases cancer risk. Since heart disease is more common, this may be why alcohol is net protective.
  * **People who are reasonably healthy show no protective effect from alcohol.** “Reasonably healthy” means people who exercise 30 minutes a day, don’t smoke, and eat at least one daily serving of fruits/veg
