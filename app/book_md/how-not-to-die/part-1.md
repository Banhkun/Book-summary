## Part 1: How Not to Die from Disease | Heart Disease, Lung Disease

### Heart Disease

Annual deaths from heart disease: 375,000

#### About Heart Disease

Coronary heart disease didn’t use to exist in some populations. It appears to be predominantly an environmental problem—when people move from low-risk areas to high-risk areas, their disease rates increase to match their new homes.

Atherosclerotic plaque—the hardening of blood vessels and a contributor to heart attacks—can start to be seen in childhood.

**Elevated cholesterol and LDL is the only risk factor for atherosclerotic plaque.** To reduce LDL, you need to reduce intake of trans fat, saturated fat, and dietary cholesterol

  * A single unhealthy meal can stiffen your arteries within hours.



Ideally, your optimal LDL is 50-70 mg/dL, and your total cholesterol under 150 mg/dL. The usual recommendation from doctors is below 100 mg/dL and 200 mg/dL, respectively, but keep in mind this is the average recommendation in a country where heart disease is the #1 killer. It’s better to aim for better than average, if you want to beat the average statistics on heart disease deaths.

**Heart disease itself is reversible** —plaques can actually shrink in size! Your body actually wants to heal itself. But if you cut yourself and keep slicing open the cut 3 times a day, it’s not going to heal

#### How Not to Die from Heart Disease

Meat eating is associated with heart disease and atherosclerotic plaques. A possible mechanism is that bacterial endotoxins in meat might trigger inflammation, even when the meat is cooked.

Foods shown to reduce heart disease:

  * Brazil nuts lower LDL cholesterol within hours, and the effects persist a month later.
  * Drinking 3-4 shots of kale juice a day over 3 months lowers LDL and boosts HDL as much as running 300 miles does.
  * A diet of 6-8 sweet potatoes a day lowered blood pressure by 5 points.



Things that don’t reduce heart disease:

  * Fish oil shows no proven benefit for overall mortality, heart attack, or stroke.
  * Statin medications are good for patients who won’t comply with diet, but they have side effects of liver and muscle damage, as well as diabetes.



Why doesn’t the idea that diet can reverse heart disease get more public attention? It likely has to do with lobbying interests by powerful industry groups.

  * In 1977, the US Senate committee released dietary guidelines advising that the population cut down on animal-based foods. But the meat, milk, and egg industries successfully lobbied to remove this recommendation from the report.
  * Professional medical organizations are often funded by food companies, which aim to influence doctor recommendations.



### Lung Disease

Annual deaths from lung disease: 296,000

Within lung disease are three sub-diseases:

  * Lung cancer: 160,000 deaths per year
  * Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (also known as emphysema): 140,000 deaths per year
  * Asthma: 3,000 deaths per year



#### Lung Cancer

Smoking is the most serious risk factor for lung cancer.

  * Male smokers are 23x more likely to get lung cancer than non-smokers. Female smokers are 13x more likely.
  * If you think the author’s suspicion of lobbying efforts sounds a little nutty, remember that tobacco company Philip Morris executed a Whitecoat Project to influence doctors to publish research studies discrediting the link between secondhand smoke and lung disease.
  * The risk is not permanent—within a year of quitting smoking, a smoker’s risk of heart disease drops to half of current smokers.



A quarter of lung cancer comes in never-smokers. Fumes from frying foods could contribute to the development of cancer, since they release volatile chemicals that increase DNA mutations and thus increase cancer risk.

  * Smokers who stir-fry meats every day have 3x the lung cancer odds as smokers who stir-fry foods other than meat daily. Chemically, frying meat creates heterocyclic amines.
  * Mothers who were exposed to fumes from grilled meats tended to have babies with smaller head size and lower IQ. The chemicals involved are believed to be polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
  * Bacon causes more DNA mutations than beef patties, by releasing nitrosamines.



**How Not to Die from Lung Cancer**

  * Smokers eating a single stalk of broccoli a day show 41% fewer DNA mutations in their bloodstream.
  * From cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli and cauliflower), an extract of the compound isothiocyanate showed stunting of cancer growth.
  * Curcumin in the spice turmeric causes a drop in DNA mutation rate in smokers, and it reactivates apoptosis in cancer cells.



#### Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

COPD is caused by inflammation in lung that leads to long-term breathing problems. The main cause is tobacco smoking, with air pollution and genetics having smaller influences.

Eating cured meat seems to increase the risk of COPD, possibly because of nitrites used in curing meats..

**How Not to Die from COPD**

  * One extra serving of fruit a day showed a 24% lower risk of dying from COPD. This is possibly due to the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of compounds in fruit. 



#### Asthma

**How Not to Die from Asthma**

  * Antioxidants from fruits and vegetables are thought to neutralize free radicals in the respiratory tract that contribute to asthma. Oxidation by-products lowered with plant-based diet
    * Kids living in areas where whole-plant diets are more common are significantly less likely to show asthma, wheezing, and allergic eczema.
    * Removing eggs and dairy from diet improves asthma within 8 weeks. Adding fruits and vegetables to the diet reduced asthma exacerbation rate by half.
  * Supplements of fruit and vegetable extracts don’t work—equivalent servings of fruit and vegetables in pill form didn’t improve asthma.
  * Some asthma patients who were thought to be medically unmanageable even dropped asthma medications altogether after switching to a plant-based diet.
