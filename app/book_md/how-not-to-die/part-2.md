## Part 2: What to Eat | Main Ideas

As you’ve seen throughout Part 1, the themes of _How Not to Die_ include:

  * Eating a plant-based diet decreases your risk of a host of diseases.
  * Eating supplements that extract the active ingredient from fruits and vegetables leads to less benefit than eating the whole plants themselves.
  * Meat and animal products increase your risk of disease, even after controlling for calories eaten and weight.



### Even More Reasons to Eat Vegetables and Fruit

If the massive health benefits aren’t enough to convince you to eat more plant-based foods, here are a few more.

Think of your diet everyday as a bank account of 2000 calories you can spend everyday. Eating one 800 calorie hamburger displaces eating 7 sweet potatoes or 26 cups of broccoli. Which one would benefit your body more?

Some might shy away from a plant-based diet because it seems expensive. This is partly true—on a calories-per-dollar basis, junk food and fat _are_ the cheapest. But on **a nutrients-per-dollar basis, vegetables offer 6x more nutrition compared to processed food.**

  * Meat costs 3x more than vegetables but deliver 16x less nutrition. Thus, **meat is 48x more expensive on a nutrient basis than vegetables.**
  * Increasing fruit and veg spending by 50 cents/day can decrease mortality by 10%.



And if you’re the type to dislike the influence of big corporations, remember that dietary guidelines are often influenced by the industries themselves.

  * When regulators discourage the public from buying certain products, they talk about biochemical components rather than what foods to avoid. For example, guidelines tend to say “eat less saturated and trans fats” instead of “eat less meat and junk food.” This is likely to appease agricultural groups.
  * Remember how the meat, milk, and egg industries successfully lobbied to remove a federal recommendation to eat less animal-based foods.



### Today’s Foods Work Against Us

Modern foods are optimized to develop unhealthy eating habits.

Our primate brains have evolved to have natural drives for food, water, and sex. Modern industries exploit and amplify this in ways we don’t consciously perceive. Processing foods takes them into an unnaturally addictive state. As we eat more of these hyper-rewarding foods, we raise the barrier for enjoying other foods, and we decrease dopamine sensitivity.

As an analogy, natural coca leaves have not been shown to be addictive over millennia of consumption, but it does become addictive when processed into cocaine

Similarly, ice cream gives such an intense dopamine response (to both sugar and fat) that it deadens your response to natural foods like fruits. Then, because fruits are not rewarding and ice cream is what you’ve come to expect, you start seeking an even _greater_ dopamine high than what ice cream provides.

The good news is, eating normal whole foods for a period of time can return dopamine sensitivity to normal levels.

### Diet by Traffic Light

Eating a plant-based diet doesn’t have to be complicated. Michael Greger suggests thinking of food as a traffic light system:

**Green Foods: Unprocessed plant foods**

  * Unprocessed means nothing bad is added, and nothing good is taken away.
  * Sometimes, processing actually makes food healthier. Tomato juice may be healthier than whole fruit because the nutrient lycopene is more available. Similarly, cocoa powder is processed to remove saturated fat.
  * **You can eat unlimited amounts of green foods.**



**Yellow Foods: Processed plant foods, Unprocessed animal foods**

  * Processed means something bad is added, or something good is taken away.
  * For example, almond milk is worse than eating pure almonds.
  * Ideally you’d replace yellow foods with their corresponding green foods, which are more nutritious. 



**Red Foods: Ultra-processed plant foods, Processed animal foods**

  * Eat red foods sparingly. In driving, you might run a red light once in a while, but you don’t make a habit of it. The same is true of red foods.
  * It’s OK to eat these in small amounts, if they help you eat more green foods (such as bacon bits or hot sauce with vegetables).



### How to Succeed in Plant-based Diets

If you generally eat an animal-based diet with little in plants, then transitioning to a plant-based diet might be a transition. Here are a few steps to help you transition successfully.

**Don’t worry about going 100% into a plant-based diet immediately.**

  * Don’t feel like you have to give up things you love, like never eating pizza again
  * **Instead, make wise choices day to day.** Have pizza once a month instead of once every 3 days. Aim for 80% and succeed, rather than aiming too high for 100% and failing.



**Remove decision fatigue from your diet.**

  * Willpower depletes throughout the day with decisions. When your willpower is low, your inhibition is low, and you make worse decisions.
  * **Adopt strict rules** like “never cook with oil” or “eat only whole grains” so you won’t even think about the choice.
  * Remove junk food from your house so you don’t adopt a habit of snacking. When the temptation isn’t around, you’ll find you don’t even think about junk food as much as you did.



**Replace your typical meals with healthier alternatives**

  * Most families rotate through the same 8-9 meals. Rotate in whole-foods, plant-based options gradually.
  * Step 1: Add health to plant-based meals.
    * Turn spaghetti and pasta sauce into whole-grain pasta with vegetables.
  * Step 2: Adapt 3 meals to plant-based meals.
    * Turn beef chili into bean chili.
  * Step 3: Discover new healthy options for plant-based meals that can be part of your normal schedule.



**Consider it an experiment first, not a lifetime change.**

  * Lower the bar for yourself. Commit to a plant-based diet for just 3 weeks. This is mentally easier to handle than a lifelong change.
  * Your health may improve so much during those 3 weeks that you won’t want to go back to your previous diet.



### Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen

As a simple checklist for what to eat everyday, Dr. Greger recommends these 12 components. Each box represents one serving.

  * Beans: 3 Servings [ ] [ ] [ ]
  * Berries: 1 Serving [ ]
  * Other Fruits: 3 Servings [ ] [ ] [ ]
  * Cruciferous Vegetables: 1 Serving [ ]
  * Greens: 2 Servings [ ] [ ]
  * Other Vegetables: 2 Servings [ ] [ ]
  * Flaxseeds: 1 Serving [ ]
  * Nuts: 1 Serving [ ]
  * Spices: 1 Serving [ ]
  * Whole Grains: 3 Servings [ ] [ ] [ ]
  * Beverages: 5 Servings [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
  * Exercise: 1 Serving [ ]



These 12 recommendations form “Dr. Greger’s Daily Dozen.”

In the following chapters, we’ll cover each of these dozen options in more detail. Each category will contain specific recommendations on what to eat and how much a serving is.
