## Part 1: Multipliers and Diminishers | Chapter 1: Backgrounder

In _Multipliers_ , author Liz Wiseman and researcher Greg McKeown tackle the question: How do leaders perceive and use intelligence? For two years, they studied 150 leaders in four continents by interviewing them, assessing them quantitatively (using a survey that addressed 48 leadership practices), and talking to their team members.

Wiseman and McKeown concluded that **there are two types of leaders:**

  1. **Multipliers, who access and grow the intelligence of everyone around them**
  2. **Diminishers, who discourage people from using their intelligence and drain them**



In this summary we’ll cover:

  * The assumptions of Multipliers and Diminishers
  * The five disciplines that Multipliers and Diminishers approach differently
  * How to survive working with a Diminisher
  * How to create a Multiplier culture



### Shortform Note

_Multipliers_ was first published in 2010. This summary is of the 2017 revised and updated edition, which includes new examples, an expanded FAQ, and workouts.

_Multipliers_ was originally organized in nine chapters and five appendices. We've reorganized the chapter order to be more coherent and logical. As a reference, here's a mapping of our chapter numbers to the original book:

  * Chapter 1: → Original Preface and Chapter 1
  * Chapter 2: → Original Chapter 9
  * Chapter 3: → Original Chapter 2
  * Chapter 4: → Original Chapter 3
  * Chapter 5: → Original Chapter 4
  * Chapter 6: → Original Chapter 5
  * Chapter 7: → Original Chapter 6
  * Chapter 8: → Original Chapter 7
  * Chapter 9: → Original Chapter 8
  * Chapter 10: → Original Chapter 9 and Appendix D
  * Appendix: → Original Appendix B



(Appendix E is woven throughout the summary.)

### Two Types of Leaders and Their Assumptions

#### Type #1: Multipliers

**Multipliers use their intelligence to bring out the intelligence and ability of everyone else.** They do this by assuming that:

  * People can improve.
  * Intelligence and capability are very common.
  * Because these traits are so common, their team should be full of people who have them.
  * Therefore, as a leader, all they need to do is create an environment that lets people use their intelligence and capability and improve their skills.



**Multipliers access 70-100% of their team members’ capabilities** because their assumptions push and inspire people to contribute as much as they possibly can, including their discretionary energy and effort (energy and effort beyond what’s strictly required to do their job). (In comparison, on average, managers access 66% of their people’s capability.)

Additionally, **Multipliers can actually grow people’s intelligence.** In surveys, some people reported giving more than 100%—which they had to increase their intelligence to do—when working with Multipliers.

##### Multiplier Traits

Most Multipliers have the following traits:

**1\. They’re tough and have high expectations.** They know that people have a lot of untapped potential and expect them to live up to it. While people the author studied who worked with Multipliers all had positive experiences, this wasn't because the managers were “feel-good” or friendly. In fact, it was because workers found it satisfying to reach their potential.

  * For example, one person described working for a Multiplier as a workout—tiring but invigorating.



**2\. They still use their own skills and intelligence.** Multipliers don’t downplay or suppress their own abilities to amplify others’. They use every available resource, including themselves.

  * For example, when basketball player Magic Johnson was in high school, his coach told him to shoot every time he got the ball. This strategy worked—his team won many games—and the coach and his teammates were happy because they liked winning. However, Magic noticed that his teammates’ parents looked disappointed because they hadn’t gotten to see their sons shoot. He decided that he would lead like a Multiplier—help everyone on the team get better but still use his own skills.



**3\. They have a sense of humor.** Multipliers can laugh at themselves and self-deprecate, possibly because they’re not insecure about their own intelligence (their assumptions apply to themselves as well).

**4\. They possess intellectual curiosity.** They value imagination and see others as a source of learning. They ask a lot of questions, which is the most effective Multiplier behavior. (We’ll cover the other Multiplier behaviors in later chapters.)

##### Example: George Schneer

George, a divisional manager at Intel, was a Multiplier. He made everyone on the team feel smart and his team members said that working under him was the high point of their careers. One of his team members, Vikram, said that George got 100% out of him. Every business George ran was profitable.

#### Type #2: Diminishers

**Diminishers rely on their own intelligence.** They assume that:

  * People can’t improve.
  * Intelligence and capability are very rare.
  * They are one of the few people who have these rare traits.
  * Because these traits are so rare, it’s unlikely that their team includes very many people who have them.
  * Therefore, as a leader, they need to be very hands-on to make up for everyone else’s lack of capability and inability to improve themselves.



**Diminishers access only 20-50% of their team members’ capabilities—half as much as Multipliers** —because their behavior drains other people’s energy and shuts them down.

Diminishing is unsustainable—it’s an expensive waste of resources. The author believes Diminishers will eventually go extinct, either because they get fired or because they change their ways.

##### Diminisher Traits

Diminishers have a huge variety of traits ranging from lacking a sense of humor, to inability to consider different points of view, to overenthusiasm. The traits are so wide-ranging because, interestingly, **most Diminishers don’t diminish on purpose.** Many Diminishers have good intentions and don’t realize how their assumptions and behaviors affect others. Many of them weren’t trained as leaders and were promoted to management due to their skills or intelligence, so when they took the position, they thought they were supposed to be the smartest and that the people they managed were below them. Or, they’d spent so much time around Diminishers that they unconsciously started to mimic them.

##### Example: Fred

Fred (Shortform name), like George Schneer, was a divisional manager at Intel. Unlike George, he was a Diminisher. Fred had initially started as a scientist before being promoted into management, and he was very intelligent. However, he didn’t know how to amplify his team’s intelligence and relied on his own. Vikram worked for Fred after working for George and said that Fred only got around 50% out of him. He also said he never wanted to work for him again.

### The Importance of Multiplication

As we’ve learned, Multipliers get more from people. This is important in the following domains:

#### Domain #1: Resource Management

When faced with a problem or pressure to grow, companies have two options, the second of which involves multiplying and is most effective:

##### Option #1: Addition

**The addition approach involves adding new resources instead of leveraging existing ones.**(Shortform example: If you need 1000 units of effort to achieve something and you currently have 10 people giving 50% of effort (50 units each, so 500 units in total), you hire another five people giving 50% to reach 1000 units.)

People who subscribe to the principle of addition believe that their team is overworked, particularly their best workers, and thus must already be using all their effort—so they need more people to get something done. In fact, people can be overworked while not using all their effort. Diminishers exhaust people even though they only get half capacity out of them—burnout is caused less by working too hard and more by doing the same thing over and over without seeing any meaningful result.

Addition is costly because companies have to pay extra salaries.

##### Option #2: Multiplication

**The multiplication approach involves leveraging existing resources.** (Shortform example: If you need 1000 units of effort to achieve something and you currently have 10 people giving 50% of effort (50 units each, and 500 units in total), you get all of those people to give 100% (100 units) of effort to reach 1000 units.)

People who subscribe to the principle of multiplication believe that most people are being underutilized but can access their full potential under a good leader.

Multiplication is a competitive advantage, especially today when many businesses simultaneously face new problems and resource limitations—such as hiring caps—and need to find ways to do more with the same number of people.

**_Example: Tim Cook_**

When Tim Cook was COO of Apple, he asked the sales department to grow revenue without hiring anyone else. The sales department brainstormed for a week and found a way to make better use of what they already had. They asked for more effort from industry experts and the best salespeople, and they changed their sales model. Multiplying worked—their year-over-year growth was in the double digits.

#### Domain #2: Humanity’s Problems

Multiplication is important for individuals and organizations, but it’s also more broadly applicable to humanity as a whole. Our world has a lot of problems, such as failing schools, bad parenting, government collapse, climate change, and so on. To fix these issues, we need to harness as much collective intelligence as possible.
