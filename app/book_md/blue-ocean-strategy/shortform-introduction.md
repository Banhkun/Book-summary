## Shortform Introduction

In _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne argue that the solution to business growth and success is to operate in an uncontested market. They use the metaphor of a _blue ocean_ to represent an uncontested market, and they contrast it with a _red ocean_ , a marketplace where fierce competition has stained the water with the blood of the combatants. Their book provides a strategy for finding the blue ocean where your company can prosper.

### About the Authors

W. Chan Kim is a professor of business strategy and international management at INSEAD. He is co-director of the Blue Ocean Strategy Institute within INSEAD and also a fellow of the World Economic Forum. Renee Mauborgne is Kim’s former student and now colleague at INSEAD. In 2019, Thinkers50 ranked them the #1 most influential thinkers in the field of business management.

### The Book’s Publication

_Blue Ocean Strategy_ was published in 2004 by the Harvard Business Review Press. It was the authors' first book and a culmination of their work on the subject of “value innovation,” some of which they published in scholarly articles between 1997 and 1999.

In 2017, they published a sequel titled _Blue Ocean Shift_ , reiterating the central message of _Blue Ocean Strategy_ and providing additional insight based on the experience of companies that applied the strategy since it was first published.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical and Intellectual Context

From about 1980 to the early 2000s, most influential writings on business strategy focused on competition. The authors credit Michael Porter and his book _Competitive Strategy_ for ushering in this age of focus on competition, although many others contributed to it as well.

Against this backdrop, _Blue Ocean Strategy_ represented a new direction in business strategy, focusing on developing uncontested markets instead of beating the competition.

However, many of the ideas it presented were not entirely new. In _Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind_ (published in 1980) Al Ries and Jack Trout argued that the key to successfully marketing a product was to find or create an open market sector where your product would stand out as the clear leader. Functionally, this concept is very similar to _Blue Ocean Strategy._

Similarly, in 1991, marketing consultant Geoffrey Moore published _Crossing the Chasm_ , a strategy for introducing high-tech products into the mainstream market. Moore’s strategy could almost be considered a specific application of _Blue Ocean Strategy_ to high-tech products.

However, despite their functional similarities, Moore and Kim presented their respective strategies using very different analogies: Kim and Mauborgne’s blue ocean metaphor emphasizes an _absence_ of competition, while Moore illustrated his strategy using the D-Day invasion of World War II, focusing on the _conflict_ of competition. The different metaphors reflect fundamental philosophical differences between the two strategies.

#### The Book’s Impact

_Blue Ocean Strategy_ was well-received worldwide. It has sold more than four million copies and was listed among the best business books of 2005 by many influential publications, including _The_ _Wall Street Journal_ , _Business Week_ , and _Fast Company Magazine_. It is rated 4.6 out of 5 stars on Amazon and 4 out of 5 on Goodreads.

Many reviewers praised the book for addressing the problem of fierce competition with a strategy that made sense and was well presented. The visual metaphor of bloody red oceans representing fiercely competitive markets contrasted with pristine blue oceans representing uncontested markets resonated powerfully with many reviewers.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Despite the overall positive reception of _Blue Ocean Strategy_ , it was not without its critics. Critical reviewers often focused on the examples, saying they were merely anecdotes that were cherry-picked to provide an appearance of support for its principles. They asserted that there were no actual case studies of companies that had intentionally and successfully implemented the principles of the strategy.

Critics also pointed out that none of the ideas in the book were really new. Some reviewers went so far as to say that the only blue ocean the authors created was the one for their own book: They compiled well-known principles from the last 20 years of marketing strategy and rebranded it with a new visual metaphor that made them look superficially different from all the other market strategists of their day.

### Our Approach in This Guide

_Blue Ocean Strategy_ is organized into three parts (foundational principles, formulating your strategy, and executing your strategy). In this guide, we’ve reorganized content within the parts to group ideas more thematically.

Thus, in Part 1, we’ll discuss what constitutes blue ocean strategy according to Kim and Mauborgne, with additional perspectives from other business writers, such as Seth Godin.

In Part 2, we’ll explore the planning and analysis tools developed by Kim and Mauborgne and discuss their approach to discovering your company’s blue oceans. Again, we’ll augment Kim and Mauborgne’s perspective with reinforcing or contrasting perspectives from others, such as Geoffrey Moore, Al Rise, and Jack Trout.

In Part 3, we’ll discuss Kim and Mauborgne’s advice on how to execute blue ocean strategy in your organization, with additional tips from Adam Grant, Robert Greene, and others.
