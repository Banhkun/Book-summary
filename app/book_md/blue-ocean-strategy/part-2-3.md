## Part 2.3: How to Develop Your Business Model

By now you’ve brainstormed and vetted possible blue ocean strategies and you’re ready to get down to the nuts and bolts of what you’ll offer. Because your ultimate goal is a profitable business, Kim and Mauborgne propose developing your business plan in a strategic sequence:

  1. Be sure that your product delivers exceptional value to your target buyers.
  2. Set a price that will attract your target buyers.
  3. Figure out how you can reduce your costs to leave you with a desired profit based on your strategic pricing.



The authors emphasize that these are sequential steps—**you move to the next step only after it’s clear the current step is a success**. Furthermore, **no later step should strongly influence an earlier step**.

For example, suppose you come up with an idea for a product that offers unique value, and you determine that your optimal retail price is $100. However, you assess your costs and find that it will cost $150 to produce each item. Kim and Mauborgne don’t recommend that you solve this problem by going back and adjusting the first step of the process (creating a product that offers value), as doing so will leave you with an inferior product that doesn’t stand out in the market. Nor do they recommend that you adjust the second step (setting a strategic price), as this will make you less competitive. Instead, they advise that you focus on reducing costs, and if you can’t reduce costs enough to make your idea profitable, they advise that you simply start over with a new idea, as this one won’t work.

> **Comparing Business Models: Blue Ocean Strategy vs. Crossing the Chasm**
> 
> Moore’s business model from _Crossing the Chasm_ includes some similar steps, but also some additional steps that may be useful when you’re introducing a new product. Unlike Kim and Mauborgne, who assume you are already active in a certain market and teach you how to come up with a strategic product offering, Moore assumes you already have an innovative, high-tech product, and teaches you how to enter the market. His business model has four steps:
> 
>   * **Select a niche market for your product.** This is functionally the same as Kim and Mauborgne’s first step: If you’ve already developed a breakthrough product, the way you make sure it delivers exceptional value to your target buyers is to target the right buyers. Figure out who can get the most unique benefit from your product, and choose them as your niche market.
> 
>   * **Make thewhole product available.** In some cases, your product is only part of the whole solution that your customers are after when they buy it. For example, if you buy a microwave oven, you also need electricity in order to use it. Kim and Mauborgne don’t really address this step, and it’s not applicable to every product. However, if you introduce a product that requires other products or services, you’ll need to make sure your customers can get what they need to make your product work. For example, to sell hydrogen-powered cars, you’d need to make sure your customers would have access to hydrogen fuel, whether you sell the fuel yourself, or arrange for another company to sell it.
> 
>   * **Position your product.** “Positioning” is a marketing term for how potential customers see your product in relation to other alternatives. In blue ocean strategy, you’ve already laid the groundwork for positioning by comparing your product to alternatives on the strategy chart. You just need to make sure your marketing campaign communicates your product’s unique value effectively to your target customers.
> 
>   * **Select your distribution channel andset your price.** This correlates to Kim and Mauborgne’s first and second steps since you’ll evaluate the best way to have your product delivered as you evaluate your customer’s experience to make sure your product provides unique value.
> 
> 


### Step 1: Evaluating Your Customer’s Experience

Kim and Mauborgne assert that you should never assume customers will regard something as an improvement just because it’s a novel idea. Generally, customers don’t really care about the product’s originality or underlying technology. **They care about whether the product solves their problems** better than other alternatives.

(Shortform note: The Technology Adoption Life Cycle, or TALC, substantiates this principle numerically. Specifically, the TALC divides the total market for any new innovation into five categories of buyers. The “innovators'' value technology for its own sake, but they are the smallest group, making up only about 2% of the total population. The other 98% don’t care how novel your product is if it doesn’t improve their lives.)

#### The Customer Experience Scorecard

So, does your idea _really_ provide superior customer value? You’ve already prepared a blue ocean strategy chart illustrating the unique value that your offering provides, but now it’s time to dig deeper into the value it provides at every stage of the product life cycle. To do so, Kim and Mauborgne advise that you use what they call a “buyer utility map,” which is essentially a customer experience scorecard analyzing how your customer responds to your product in every stage.

The customer experience scorecard is a six-by-six table. The columns are labeled according to the six stages of the product life cycle: purchase, delivery, use, augmentation (expanding the product’s capabilities through accessories or upgrades), maintenance, and end of life.

(Shortform note: Depending on the product, the buyer experience cycle could be different from the six steps that Kim and Mauborgne present. In some cases, there could be an installation or assembly step in between delivery and use. In other cases, such as when the product is a one-time service, steps like maintenance and augmentation might not be relevant.)

The rows are labeled with characteristics rating the quality of the customer’s experience in six categories: efficiency, simplicity, convenience, risk, glamour, and environmental friendliness. As you consider each of these characteristics during each of the product’s life cycle stages, the authors invite you to ask yourself where the buyer would encounter problems or pain points. For example, how simple is it for them to purchase your item? How convenient is it to get it delivered? Are there disposal issues that create a problem for environmental friendliness at the end of life?

The boxes on the scorecard give you a tool to think through these questions systematically and record your answers. Kim and Mauborgne advise that your product should clearly create more benefit than the alternatives in at least one of the 36 spaces on the map, and the benefit it creates should be in different spaces than the competition.

A blank example of a customer experience scorecard is shown below.

**Customer Experience Scorecard**  
---  
| Purchase  | Delivery  | Use  | Augmentation  | Maintenance  | End of Life   
Efficiency  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Simplicity  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Convenience  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Risk  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Glamour  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Environmental Friendliness  |  |  |  |  |  |   
  
> **Different Ways to Use the Customer Experience Scorecard**
> 
> After you assess the customer experience in each box, Kim and Mauborgne are a little vague as to how you actually record your results on the map. Thus, different people have used the customer experience scorecard in different ways:
> 
> Some simply place an X in each box where there is a significant pain point with the product under consideration. Others use these pain points to identify areas of opportunity for creating blue oceans, and mark each of these boxes with a blue circle, while marking boxes the industry is currently focusing on with red circles.
> 
> Still others start by placing a circle or box of one color in each space where existing products offer significant buyer utility. Then they use circles or boxes of a different color to mark each space where your new product would offer significant utility. Finally, if there are any spaces where both products offer utility, they use plus or minus signs to denote whether your new product would offer more or less value than the alternative.
> 
> Some combine the above methods, using colored squares or circles to denote significant value for different products, and X’s to denote pain points.
> 
> Some use it to assess the buyer utility of a product idea quantitatively by assigning a numerical score in each space.
> 
> Finally, instead of using the customer experience scorecard directly, you could take the categories from the scorecard and use them to refine your blue ocean strategy chart. Recall that the strategy chart should show all the major characteristics that your customers actually care about. Anything that affects your customers’ experience is probably something they will care about, so ask yourself if efficiency, simplicity, convenience, risk, glamour, and environmental friendliness are adequately captured in the characteristics on your strategy chart. If any of them aren’t, add them to your strategy chart to ensure that the chart presents an accurate picture of value to the customer. This will also allow you to assess how your product stacks up against your competition in these areas.

### Step 2: Set Your Price

Now that you’ve figured out an offering that offers superior utility to the customer, you need to figure out how to price it. Kim and Mauborgne advise **setting your price to maximize the number of buyers** in your market. In other words, you want to select a price that will make your product attractive to as many potential customers as possible.

> **Comparing Pricing Strategies**
> 
> In _Crossing the Chasm_ , Moore identifies a number of methods you can use to set your prices.
> 
> **Customer-oriented pricing** is when you set your prices to match your target customers’ expectations, based either on how much tangible value your product provides to the customer (value-based pricing) or how your product compares to alternatives (competition-based pricing). Clearly, Kim and Mauborgne are advocating customer-oriented, competition-based pricing.
> 
> **Vendor-oriented pricing** is when you set your prices based on your own costs and business needs. Both Moore and Kim and Mauborgne advise against using vendor-oriented pricing.
> 
> **Distributor-oriented pricing** is when you set your price to motivate your distributors by making your product the most profitable one for them to sell. Moore advocates using distributor-oriented pricing because it makes it easier to sell your product through established, reputable distributors, who can give a new product credibility in the mainstream market.

#### Advantages of Pricing to Maximize the Number of Customers

The authors say that appealing to as many buyers as possible up front has several advantages over the common practice of starting with a premium price to attract early adopters and then gradually lowering prices to attract mainstream customers:

1\. Often, appealing to the maximum number of buyers maximizes profits, because in many industries, fixed costs (one-time expenses associated with launching your product) are high and marginal costs (ongoing expenses associated with delivering each unit that you sell) are low, so attracting more buyers will subsidize your fixed costs while not costing you much more per customer. This is particularly true in software and R&D-heavy industries.

2\. Many products benefit from network effects, where the value of the service scales with the number of users.

(Shortform note: Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh devote most of their book _Blitzscaling_ to these two points. They explain how the internet has driven marginal costs to near zero in many cases, and discuss the “first-scaler advantage” created by network effects. They point out that by growing quickly from the outset, you can reduce the risk of a competitor gaining this advantage before you do. This reinforces Kim and Mauborgne’s strategy of pricing for the masses up front.)

3\. Strategic prices help earn a reputation for your brand immediately, making it harder for others to copy your strategy and turn your blue ocean into a red one.

(Shortform note: According to Ries and Trout, market leadership is self-perpetuating in this way. They assert that it is almost impossible to displace a market leader, once people view them as such, because brand loyalty drives greater demand and their reputation makes it easier for them to raise capital for expansion and attract the best talent to their workforce.)

How do you actually set your price? Kim and Mauborgne prescribe a two-step procedure: First, you establish a price range by researching pricing for major alternatives. Then you select a price within that range based on how difficult it is for others to imitate your offering. Let’s consider each of these steps in more detail:

#### Determine the Right Price Range

Kim and Mauborgne advise that you start by cataloging the alternatives to your product so you can establish the range of prices that customers might expect to pay for a product like yours. They note that some alternatives may look different but serve the same function— for example, cooking your own food can serve the same function as eating at a restaurant. They also note that some alternatives may serve completely different functions but still achieve the same objective—for example, rock-climbing gear and video games serve very different functions, but they can fulfill the same objective of connecting with friends in a thrilling environment.

(Shortform note: When considering pricing, it may be worth considering _product alternatives_ as well, because your customers may consider them. Moore defines product alternatives as products with different purposes that are based on the same technology. For example, an electric egg beater and an electric drill are used for completely different things, but they are made up of essentially the same components: an electric motor, a power supply, a gearbox, a coupling mechanism to hold the drill bits or beaters, and so forth. Consequently, it makes sense that they should cost about the same.)

The authors advise that higher prices may increase the amount of profit per customer, but not necessarily enough to increase overall profit, if you make fewer sales. To help you zero in on the range of prices that will give you the highest total revenue, Kim and Mauborgne present a graphic tool they call the “price corridor map.” It’s a graph with price on the vertical axis and a measure of how similar or different the product is to yours on the horizontal axis. The more different a company is from yours, the further to the right it should lie on the horizontal axis.

Plot each alternative as a circle on the graph. Different alternatives will likely have different numbers of customers, so draw larger circles to represent alternatives with more customers and smaller circles for products with fewer customers.

According to Kim and Mauborgne, you can then use the distribution of circles on the graph to identify a horizontal band representing the range of prices which you would expect to earn the most total revenue.

Here’s an example:

![blueoceanstrategy_pricecor.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/blueoceanstrategy_pricecor.png)

##### Shortform Commentary: Another Way of Visualizing Your Optimal Price Range

Kim and Mauborgne’s graph shows expected revenue only indirectly: The size of the circles correlates to the number of buyers, while the position of each circle shows the price, so to get the total revenue of any alternative, you would multiply the price by the number of customers.

To identify the range of prices that maximize revenue, a different kind of graph might be more suitable. Specifically, for each alternative, you could first multiply the price by the number of customers who buy that particular alternative to calculate the total revenue. Then, you could plot the revenue on the y-axis against price on the x-axis, and fit a bell curve or polynomial approximation to the data. The curve shows you the relationship between revenue and price, which is what you need to know to select the price range that will yield the most revenue.

For example, suppose you have the following list of alternative products:

**Offering** | **Unit Price** | **User Base** | **Revenue**  
---|---|---|---  
Alternative A  |  $10.00 |  1000000 |  $10000000  
Alternative B  |  $20.00 |  200000 |  $4000000  
Alternative C  |  $25.00 |  1000000 |  $25000000  
Alternative D  |  $25.00 |  25000 |  $625000  
Alternative E  |  $30.00 |  100000 |  $3000000  
Alternative F  |  $35.00 |  500000 |  $17500000  
Alternative G  |  $40.00 |  400000 |  $16000000  
Alternative H  |  $45.00 |  14000 |  $630000  
Alternative I  |  $55.00 |  5000 |  $275000  
Alternative J  |  $65.00 |  5000 |  $325000  
Alternative K  |  $75.00 |  10000 |  $750000  
  
Your graph would look like this:

![blueoceanstrategy_pricecoralt.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/blueoceanstrategy_pricecoralt.png)

This graph allows you to see the expected revenue at a given price point directly. However, the one thing it doesn’t show you that Kim and Mauborgne’s original graph does is how similar each alternative is to your product. Admittedly, buyers are more likely to compare your product with alternatives that are more similar to it. But product similarity is sometimes difficult to quantify. Thus, Kim and Mauborgne’s “price corridor map” may offer advantages for _intuitive_ assessment of your ideal price range, while this graph facilitates a _numerical_ assessment of what price range will generate the most revenue.

#### Specify a Price Level Within Your Price Range

Now that you have a price range, Kim and Mauborgne advise setting your price based on two factors:

  1. The defensibility of your product
  2. The relative benefits of scale



According to Kim and Mauborgne, the **defensibility of your offering** depends on:

  * Legal protection through patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property
  * Exclusive assets or capabilities that make your offering difficult to imitate



(Shortform note: Author Thomas L. Friedman argues that patents have become less relevant today, because many new inventions become obsolete faster than you can get a patent on them. It typically takes four to five years for the patent office to process and grant a patent. This shifts the emphasis of defensibility more toward capabilities that are difficult to replicate.)

According to Kim and Mauborgne, the **benefits of scale** depend on:

  * The significance of network effects (how much your offering becomes more attractive as your user base grows)
  * The ratio of fixed costs to marginal costs



(Shortform note: As Hoffman and Yeh explain, there can also be corresponding costs that limit your scale. First there is the human limitation: Maybe your product becomes more beneficial as more people adopt it, but if it also requires more personnel to support it as the user base grows, this benefit comes at a cost. Hoffman and Yeh point out that the complexity of managing a team grows exponentially with the size of the team, so the fewer employees it takes to support a given number of customers, the lower the costs of scaling up. Second, are the limitations of your infrastructure. This influences your ratio of fixed to marginal costs, because the more you spend on production infrastructure up front, the more you can drive down the marginal cost of production, but at the outset you have a finite budget for infrastructure.)

Kim and Mauborgne argue that **the more defensible your product is, the higher you can set your price, but the greater the benefits of scale, the lower you’ll want to set the price** , to accelerate mass adoption.

(Shortform note: Arguably, scale is part of defensibility, because of the first-scaler advantage. If your product has significant network effects, then having a large user base increases its value relative to alternatives with fewer users, making it harder for them to compete with you. Even without network effects, the larger your operation, the more expensive it is to replicate.)

### Step 3: Account for Costs

Once you have your strategic price, Kim and Mauborgne advise you to calculate your target cost by deciding what profit margin you want and applying it to your chosen price. They argue that you **must not let costs dictate prices, nor should you lower your product’s benefits to match its costs**. Doing either will jeopardize mass adoption. Instead, they advise that you aggressively manage your costs to meet your target price. In doing so, you’ll create a product that is more profitable and more difficult to imitate. If you _cannot_ meet your strategic price and maintain an adequate profit margin, they say your idea won’t work and you need to go back to the drawing board.

(Shortform note: Kim and Mauborgne’s directive to figure out your target price first and then manage your costs to achieve it could be considered a business application of Stephen Covey’s directive to begin with your goal in mind. Beginning with a clear understanding of the desired end-state (or in this case the retail price) allows you to chart a course to it and assess its feasibility more definitively.)

As we discussed earlier, blue ocean innovation generally involves reducing or eliminating features that your customers don’t care much about (while adding a unique blend of features that they value). This culling of features up front helps you keep costs down.

Additionally, the authors recommend three more sub-strategies that will help you maintain a profit margin at your strategic price:

**Reduce operational costs.** There may be new manufacturing processes or materials that offer a cost advantage over traditional ones. Similarly, there may be more cost effective ways of providing services.

  * (Shortform note: Some companies are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline their business operations and thus save costs. AI can perform many payroll and invoicing functions, as well as helping to manage customer relations, and can cut down the need to employ costly workers to do somewhat routine jobs.)



**Offload production and distribution activities to capable partners.** Kim and Mauborgne say this effectively lowers fixed costs and increases marginal costs. They also point out that it spurs competition among companies trying to win your contract, which drives down prices.

  * (Shortform note: Moore also advises partnering with companies who can take on some of your operations, but he cautions against partnering __ with multiple companies that would be in direct competition with each other, arguing that they’ll be more willing to work with you if you work with them exclusively. In other words, once you select a partner, trying to cut costs further by then partnering with one of their rivals on a different task can backfire.) 



**Change your pricing structure,** such as going from paid to freemium, or from whole-purchase to partial shares or subscriptions. If a customer only buys a portion of the product up front, instead of the whole thing, you can distribute the cost of the product across multiple sales. This allows you to meet your strategic price for each sale, even when you couldn’t sell your product, as a complete unit, for that price and still make a profit.

  * (Shortform note: Obviously, even if you defer or distribute your costs over multiple sales, you still need to make a profit in the end. However, the lifetime revenue per customer may be less obvious with these pricing models than with a one-time sale of a complete product up front. Patrick Campbell cautions that many software-as-a-service companies fail because their lifetime revenue per customer is too low in relation to the cost of acquiring each customer, and advises that your revenue per customer needs to be at least three times the cost of acquiring each customer for a subscription service to be viable.)
