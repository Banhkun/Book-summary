## Part 2.2: Formulate Your Strategy With Visual Aids

Now that you’ve brainstormed ideas for creating a blue ocean and you understand the tools at your disposal for exploring blue ocean strategies, let’s discuss the mechanics of developing your high-level strategy. Kim and Mauborgne break this process down into four phases, each of which uses visual tools or strategies to help you properly evaluate your options:

### Phase 1: Examine Your Current Situation

Before you can develop a strategy for transforming the market, you need to get a firm, clear understanding of the current state of the industry and how your company fits in. To do so, the authors advise you to draw a blue ocean strategy chart (discussed earlier) showing the current state of your product and the industry, and to fill out an action table to think through how you might formulate a plan to differentiate your product. They recommend appointing separate teams to investigate different opinions on the relevant characteristics of competition.

(Shortform note: This initial blue ocean strategy chart could be applicable to your marketing strategy as well as your product strategy. Al Ries and Jack Trout assert that understanding your current positioning, that is, how people view your product or company, especially in relation to the competition, is the first step toward positioning your product for success. Furthermore, they observe that people outside your company usually don’t view your company or product the way you do, corroborating Kim and Mauborgne’s assertions about overcoming denial. As you uncover the truth, the blue ocean strategy chart that you prepare here should concisely present how your product compares to alternatives in the eyes of your prospective customers, and thus fulfills the first step of market positioning strategy as well.)

### Phase 2: See Customer Problems in Person

Kim and Mauborgne say exploring customer problems _in person_ is a crucial step to provide inspiration for new offerings, so that you can see for yourself where your product’s strengths and weaknesses are. They recommend talking to customers, former customers, potential customers, and competitors’ customers, as well as watching people use your product. They also recommend that you personally try out the available alternative products. By visually seeing for yourself how your customers are responding to and using your product, you can identify how current offerings are _overserving_ customers (forcing them to pay for more than they need) as well as how they are _underserving_ them (creating pain points).

Based on your findings, Kim and Mauborgne recommend that you (or your team) draw several new blue ocean strategy charts representing possible new offerings, each with a unique combination of characteristics to increase, decrease, eliminate, or create value.

(Shortform note: Psychological research corroborates Kim and Mauborgne’s recommendation to meet with customers in person. As you explore customers’ problems, nonverbal communication provides you valuable insight into what they’re feeling as they use the product, which helps you identify their values and pain points so you can determine what characteristics to increase, decrease, eliminate, or create. Robert Greene reports that as much as 65% of communication in a conversation is nonverbal, and people tend to present their _feelings_ almost entirely through nonverbal communication.)

### Phase 3: Seek Input

Kim and Mauborgne recommend presenting your possible blue ocean strategy charts to management, employees, customers, and potential customers and asking for their input. They recommend doing this in a large, participatory meeting in which all decision-makers can examine and comment on the strategy charts and action tables you’ve developed. Keep track of which strategies your stakeholders favor or oppose, and their reasons—you can even use sticky notes or colored stars to help people visually mark their preferences. End your meeting by synthesizing a final strategy based on the commonalities and strong points of all the possibilities.

> **Inclusive Versus Exclusive Strategy Meetings**
> 
> While Kim and Mauborgne emphasize making this strategy meeting very inclusive: It should be open to a broad range of stakeholders, such as employees and potential customers. Others, such as Moore, have advised almost the opposite, limiting the people in strategic decision meetings to the minimum possible number of stakeholders—only those who could veto the decision if they disagreed with it.
> 
> Both approaches have their pros and cons. The fewer people you need to get agreement from, the faster you should be able to reach a consensus. In some cases (such as a small start-up trying to get its first product to market so it can become financially self-sustaining), this ability to move faster could be a significant advantage.
> 
> However, the more people you include, the broader the consensus will be when you do reach a decision. This might be a more significant advantage. For example, if you have to change the direction of an established company to implement a blue ocean strategy, building a broader consensus might help to build momentum for the change.

### Phase 4: Communicate Your Strategy

Kim and Mauborgne recommend distributing copies of your blue ocean strategy chart to your team, showing your “before” and “after” strategy curves on the same page so that people can clearly see the change in direction. They point out that it’s important for your whole organization to understand the change because, going forward, you’ll only support projects that support your new strategy.

(Shortform note: A _Harvard Business Review_ article emphasizes that companies can’t grow if they don’t communicate their strategy and goals to employees. For best results, they recommend keeping your message simple but meaningful, showing how your strategy is driven by insight into the market or customer needs, and remaining visible and accessible to your employees. Kim and Mauborgne’s approach lends itself well to meeting these recommendations, since the blue ocean strategy chart presents meaningful strategy information simply, is derived from analysis of customer needs, and is easy to disseminate, fostering visibility.)
