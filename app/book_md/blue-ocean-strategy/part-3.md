## Part 3: Get Your Organization On Board

Now that you have a strategy, it’s time to execute it. In Part 3, we’ll discuss Kim and Mauborgne’s advice on executing blue ocean strategy within your organization, dealing with common hurdles, and achieving alignment with partner companies.

### Engage Your Team

Kim and Mauborgne advise that you should keep your team informed of your blue ocean strategy as you develop it, because **you need your team to mobilize your strategy**. They emphasize that you need to communicate clearly, because everyone on the team needs to understand the strategy in order to do their part effectively.

The authors further advise that you need to **_communicate_ _more_ with those who are _less involved_ in the strategic decision making**, to circumvent anxiety and distrust that could undermine execution of your strategy. They point out that when strategic decisions are made behind closed doors, and everybody knows something big is coming but nobody knows what it is, they tend to get scared. They may become anxious about job security, or the stability of their position within the organization. The authors warn that this anxiety can foster distrust and skepticism, which in turn fosters poor cooperation when your new strategy is unveiled. They say that if the distrust runs deep enough, employees may even band together to sabotage your strategy, in hopes that its failure will usher in a return to the old status quo that they were comfortable with.

(Shortform note: In _Give and Take_ , Adam Grant argues that trust depends heavily on _generosity_ , and thus generosity enhances networking, which is, in large part, a process of building trust between people. He advises that to cultivate a generous personality, you should start by giving others the benefit of the doubt. Most of them will reciprocate, building mutual trust. Similarly, he says you can cultivate generosity through powerless communication: You can make yourself more approachable by asking questions, seeking advice, and signaling vulnerability.)

#### Stick to Fair Process

Kim and Mauborgne assert that not only do you need to communicate your strategy, but you need to do it in an equitable manner, because **people care as much about the fairness of the process as they do about the ultimate outcome**. If they feel listened to and respected, they’ll more likely go along with a decision, even if they personally disagree with it.

(Shortform note: In _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Ross and Tahl Raz observe that people will often go out of their way to oppose anything they see as unfair, even if it means making irrational choices. This is what you are trying to avoid: If people perceive your blue ocean strategy as an unfair change in the direction of the company, they may reject it in spite of its merits.)

The authors identify three elements of fair process:

  1. **Involve** people by asking for their input early in the process and inviting them to discuss other ideas.
  2. **Explain** the reasons behind your decisions when you make them, addressing how you considered the input that people gave you.
  3. **Be clear** about what people should expect in terms of job security, changes to roles and responsibilities, and how employees will be evaluated in their respective roles under the new strategy.



> **Workplace Fairness Criteria**
> 
> Gwen Moran of _Fast Company_ identifies six defining characteristics of a fair workplace:
> 
>   * Rules for promotion, compensation, performance review, and disciplinary action are clear and are applied uniformly.
> 
>   * Similar cases are given equivalent treatment, but each case is considered individually. For example, an employee with a legitimate disability may not be held to the same standards as a healthy employee.)
> 
>   * All employees are given an equal chance to be heard.
> 
>   * Employees are given credit for their ideas.
> 
>   * Managers or senior employees are available to mentor new employees on the rules.
> 
>   * Employees feel like the company cares about their well-being.
> 
> 

> 
> Kim and Mauborgne’s directive to involve people in the process and ask for their input correlates to Moran’s principle that all employees have a voice. Letting them discuss each other's ideas also relates to Moran’s principle of giving people credit for their ideas. And getting their input helps to show the company cares about them, consistent with Moran’s final principle.
> 
> Kim and Mauborgne’s directive to explain your reasoning fits into Moran’s principle that senior personnel should be available to help new hires understand how the company operates, or in this case, to help everyone understand the company’s new strategy.
> 
> Kim and Mauborgne's directive to be clear about what to expect is functionally identical to Moran’s first rule, namely that rules are clear and applied uniformly.

### Overcome Organizational Hurdles

As you engage your team in first developing and then implementing your blue ocean strategy, Kim and Mauborgne say you’ll likely face four hurdles, which we’ll explore in the remainder of this chapter.

#### 1\. Recognition Shortfall

Kim and Mauborgne observe that stakeholders are often skeptical of the need for strategic change. Thus, to make strategic changes, you first need to convince them of the gravity of the problem. To do this, the authors recommend showing them the problem firsthand, rather than relying on impersonal numbers and metrics. Arrange for them to meet dissatisfied customers in person, or to get their hands on the product and wrestle with its shortcomings personally.

(Shortform note: Before you can make the problem personal for your stakeholders, you must become personally acquainted with it yourself. In _To Sell is Human_ , Daniel Pink argues that one of the keys to success in selling is to see yourself as serving your customers: You serve them by selling them something that will make their lives better. In this case, you’re “selling” your stakeholders a strategy to solve their problem of business stagnation.)

#### 2\. Capital Shortfall

Kim and Mauborgne point out that even if your team agrees with the need to change, your company might be restricted by a resource shortfall—money, time, or trained staff to make changes happen. This makes it hard to devote resources to new innovations, especially if managers are competing with each other for whatever resources they can get. To alleviate the problem, the authors advise you to **consider where your resources are earning the highest and lowest value** per dollar spent, so that you can maximize your returns by shifting resources around.

For example, maybe your company produces instructional videos on a variety of topics. It takes you an average of six hours to produce a cooking video, eight to produce an automotive repair video, and twenty to produce a home improvement video, but each video earns about the same returns. Thus, to increase profits and free up manpower for new initiatives, you cut out home improvement videos entirely and shift your focus heavily toward cooking videos.

(Shortform note: In _The 48 Laws of Power_ , Robert Greene echoes this principle and generalizes it, saying that the key to moving forward is focusing on what will generate the greatest benefit. He applies this not only to physical resources but also to relationships and alliances. In addressing the “resource hurdle,” we’re talking mostly about freeing up internal resources to begin progress on your blue ocean strategy, but as we move on to the political hurdle and aligning external partners later in this chapter, remember that this principle of focusing your resources where they’ll generate the highest returns applies to alliances as well.)

The authors also recommend “horse trading” resources (such as office space, manpower, or equipment) between teams to allocate them more efficiently. **Ask your teams about their needs, and shift resources around so that everybody wins.** This works because when departments are competing for whatever they can get, it usually results in inefficient allocation of resources between them.

(Shortform note: Also consider repurposing resources to get the most out of them as well. Building on the horse trading analogy, famous old-time horse trader Ben Green once mistakenly purchased a large number of mules that turned out to be too small for the farm work he meant to sell them for. However, he ended up turning a significant profit from them when he found a mine owner who specifically needed mules that would fit in confined spaces to pull ore carts. By the same token, if resources are distributed inefficiently, you may also have machinery that’s being used, but not for the most beneficial application.)

#### 3\. Initiative Shortfall

Even after you’ve convinced people of the need to change, and aligned resources with your vision, summoning the motivation to _make the change_ can be a hurdle in itself. According to Kim and Mauborgne, the way to build motivation is to focus your attention on the key influencers in your organization. If you can get them moving, they’ll get the rest of the organization moving. Once you’ve identified your influencers, the authors advise making their actions highly visible. This maximizes their impact and also holds them accountable to each other, preventing pockets of demotivation from forming.

(Shortform note: In _Perennial Seller_ , Ryan Holiday says the key to effectively influencing the influencers in your industry is to see things from their perspective. Influencers are typically people who have earned a reputation for recommending things that are genuinely valuable. They want to maintain that reputation. Thus, if you can show them how your strategy is beneficial to them _and the people that look up to them_ , they’ll become advocates for the changes you propose.)

Kim and Mauborgne also point out that a massive strategic vision can be daunting, and advise breaking your strategy down into small, actionable blocks, rather than making a top-down presentation of grand ideas and leaving your underlings to figure out how to implement them.

(Shortform note: In _Tiny Habits_ , Dr. BJ Fogg proposes that the key to changing a person’s behavior is making the change easy enough. This is based on his behavioral model, which predicts that a person performs an action whenever they have an opportunity to do so and the combination of their motivation and ability exceeds a certain threshold. Thus, if the task is hard, they won’t do it unless they’re extremely motivated, and personal motivation can be fickle. But if you make the task easier, increasing their ability to perform it, then they don’t need as much motivation.)

#### 4\. Cooperation Shortfall

Kim and Mauborgne observe that organizations often have internal battles to get things done and warn that skeptics who resist your strategy can rob the movement of momentum. They recommend doing three things to mitigate this threat:

**1\. Add a “consigliere” to your strategic management team**. As the authors explain, a consigliere is a person who knows the inner workings and politics of your company from firsthand experience. It’s someone who can provide you with valuable insight regarding who is likely to support or oppose your plan and advice on how to swing corporate politics in your favor.

(Shortform note: In _The 48 Laws of Power_ , Robert Greene emphasizes the importance of gathering intelligence through “spying.” He says that knowing your opponents’ secrets allows you to predict their behavior and ultimately control them. He suggests that if you engage with people in a friendly, interested manner, in a social setting, they will often reveal their interests, plans, and even weaknesses. If you are too well-known as the backer of the coming changes for opponents to open up to you directly, your consigliere can serve this function of finding out how people _really_ feel.)

**2\. Mobilize a broad base of support** before your detractors can get organized. This means finding out who your supporters and detractors are likely to be and getting your supporters on board with your plan.

(Shortform note: In _The 48 Laws of Power_ , Greene advises that timing is everything. If the opportunity to make strategic changes hasn’t arrived yet, keep a cool head and wait for it patiently, but when the time comes, and your vision gathers momentum, implement it decisively and be prepared to ride out reactionary opposition.)

**3\. Understand your opposition’s concerns** , and present solutions or supporting data to address them. Aim to present solutions that will allow everyone to be satisfied, but also prepare to counter the likely objections you’ll get from your detractors—anticipate their objections and collect facts and rationale for overcoming them.

(Shortform note: In _The 48 Laws of Power_ , Greene asserts that it’s easier to convince your skeptics through demonstrations than by arguing with them. They may doubt the validity of your data or your proposed solutions, but they can’t argue with actual results. If their objections aren’t valid, sometimes just making a pretense of addressing them in your strategy will pacify them for the time being, and when their concerns are never realized, they’ll think you must have addressed them adequately.)

### Align Your Partners

Finally, there may be stakeholders external to your organization that you need to align with your vision in order to make your blue ocean strategy a success. To reinforce the importance of this consideration, the authors cite the examples of Napster and Apple’s iTunes Store.

In its day, Napster was clearly a blue ocean venture. Kim and Mauborgne point out that it offered unique digital music-sharing capabilities with clear user value (free music). It also was in a position to benefit from network effects and had a clear first-mover advantage with over 80 million users. However, the ultimate success of Napster’s strategy was contingent on the cooperation of record label companies. As the authors report, Napster’s management failed to realize this, and instead antagonized the record labels. Ultimately they retaliated with insurmountable lawsuits, and Napster was forced to shut down its service in 2001.

Kim and Mauborgne describe how, two years after Napster shut down, Apple partnered with the five major record labels to offer their content digitally through the iTunes Store. Because Apple recognized the importance of getting these external partners on board, it was far more successful than Napster could be.

(Shortform note: The original iTunes Store offered a similar (though not identical) strategy curve to Napster’s service. Because of this, it’s easy to isolate the difference in how each company managed relations with the record label companies as the key difference that determined Apple’s success over Napster’s, illustrating the importance of aligning your external stakeholders. Moore echoes this message, pointing out that business partners and allies are essential to your success, because the product you produce is usually only a piece of the complete solution to the problem your customers want to solve, and it’s up to your allies to supply the other parts of the solution.)
