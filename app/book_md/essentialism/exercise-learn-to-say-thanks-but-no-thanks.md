## Exercise: Learn to Say Thanks, But No Thanks

Many of us are reluctant to say no to others because weâ€™re afraid of creating conflict. But we need to say no to nonessential activities in order to we say yes to the most important things. The key is saying no gracefully by rejecting the activity, but not the person.

* * *

Think of a recent request that you agreed to, but that left you feeling resentful or taken advantage of. Why did you agree in the first place?

What was your trade-off? What more important activity did you have to put off or eliminate to meet the request?

How could you have said no, so that you felt satisfied about doing the right thing without hurting the relationship long term?

What boundary can you set in advance that would help you say no or eliminate the need to say no to this person or this type of request in the future? How would you explain the boundary to others?
