## Part 3: Eliminate the Nonessential

Once you’ve explored your options, the next critical consideration isn’t which one you should say yes to, but which ones you’ll say no to.

Once you know what you want to get rid of, the question is how best to do it. Because we’re bombarded with so many nonessential activities and opportunities, with new ones appearing constantly, we need systematic ways of cutting the excess.

Returning to the closet example, once you’ve sorted the contents (explored the options) and decided which things to get rid of (made choices), you still need to take the actual step of elimination. It’s not easy — you still may be hesitating on a few items.

This chapter suggests ways that make it easier to say no to, or eliminate, nonessential things so you can focus on the vital few. And if you say no the right way, you’ll actually receive greater respect from your colleagues, bosses, and others.

### Clarify Your Purpose

The first category of options to eliminate are those that don’t align with your purpose, that is, with what you want to achieve. Of course, to do this you need to be radically clear about what your purpose is.

A surprising number of people can’t answer the question of what they want to achieve in their career in the next five years. Similarly, many companies don’t or can’t clearly state their purpose or goals. They think a “pretty clear” statement is good enough. However, anyone who’s had an eye exam knows there’s a big difference between lenses that help you see somewhat better and those that provide absolute clarity.

The same kind of difference exists between a fairly clear purpose and a clear one, whether for individuals or companies.

#### Teams that Lack Purpose are Divided

Clarity of purpose consistently predicts how well people will do their jobs. When teams lack absolute clarity about what they’re trying to achieve, their motivation and cooperation lag. People become frustrated and waste time on nonessentials. No amount of training in teamwork and communication will make a team succeed if the members are unclear about their goals and roles.

There are two common outcomes when teams aren’t clear on their purpose: members play politics and everyone pursues his or her own agenda.

**Playing politics**. Instead making their optimum contribution to the group’s goal, team members vy for the manager’s favor or attention by doing such things as undercutting peers, trying to look important, or echoing whatever the manager says or seems to want. These things are both nonessential and counterproductive.

When we lack clear personal goals and values, we behave similarly, making choices that are political or competitive. For instance, we focus on nonessentials like having a nicer car or living in a nicer area than someone else does. Essential activities, such as family relationships and health, get short shrift.

**Everyone for himself**. When teams lack purpose, members pursue their own interests. Their pursuits may conflict with other members’ activities. When many people pursue different activities, neither the members nor the team make their optimum contribution and the team’s results fall short. In contrast, when teams are clear about their purpose and members perform at their optimum levels, momentum builds and the whole — the collective contribution — is greater than the sum of the parts.

#### Define Your Personal Purpose

In personal life, pursuing five majors in college doesn’t result in a degree, and working many different jobs in different fields doesn’t constitute a career track. Just as a team can’t succeed when its members aren’t unified by a shared purpose, individuals can’t succeed when their activities aren’t directed toward a single goal. On teams and in your personal life, you must decide your intent or purpose, the vital thing you’re trying to achieve that’s distinct from the many nonessential options and opportunities you could pursue. It should be specific and measurable.

**Deciding your purpose makes many further decisions unnecessary or makes them easier**. For instance, deciding on a specific profession like law or medicine eliminates myriad options and sets a future course. Once a critical decision is made, subsequent choices fall into alignment while other options become moot.

When the British prime minister appointed Martha Fox Lane to be the UK’s first “Digital Champion,” she had to establish a purpose. Avoiding a typical vague mission statement, she came up with a clear, measurable intent that motivated and empowered her team: get everyone in the UK online by the end of 2012. Her clear purpose made it easy to separate nonessential from essential activities.

Here are a few guidelines for coming up with a similarly clear purpose for companies and individuals:

**Focus on substance over style.** When developing mission or purpose statements, it’s tempting to get stuck in debates over wording or succumb to cliches and jargon. Instead, focus on answering the essential question that sets the stage for everything else you do: **what’s the one thing you want to be the absolute best at?**

**Define success** : The second key to crafting a clear statement of purpose is answering the question, **what will success look like?** If you can’t define success in a way that’s measurable, your statement won’t inspire anyone to achieve it. That’s why many grandiose statements (for instance, eliminating world hunger) fail to motivate.

Actor Brad Pitt came up with a concrete and inspirational purpose when he formed an organization to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. It was “to build 150 affordable, green, storm-resistant homes for families living in the Lower 9th Ward.” It answered the question of how the group would know when it had succeeded.

During the 27 years that anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela spent in prison, he honed an essential intent to the exclusion of everythng else, including resentment: eliminating apartheid in South Africa. He not only succeeded but went on to become the country’s first black president.

### Say No Gracefully

Most people are reluctant to say no to others. We’re afraid of creating conflict, disappointing someone, angering our boss, or missing an opportunity.

But saying no when it’s aligned with a clear purpose or intent is powerful. For example, when a bus driver demanded that civil rights activist Rosa Parks give up her seat on a segregated bus, she said no. Over the course of attending civil rights meetings, she’d developed a clear purpose: she wouldn’t suffer that kind of humiliation again. That purpose drove her to act.

Of course, you won’t necessarily change history when you say no, but you can make a difference by standing your ground. In fact, by saying no to something nonessential, you’re often saying yes to something far more important.

When self-help author Stephen R. Covey bumped into an old friend after making a presentation in San Francisco, the friend invited Covey and his 12-year-old daughter, who was traveling with him, to dinner. Covey graciously declined because he’d planned activities with his daughter for the rest of the evening. That “no” — with which Covey opted for the essential over the nonessential — gave his daughter the memory of a lifetime.

Saying no in the moment, as Covey did, can be difficult if you’re unclear about what’s essential. Clarity gives you the strength and the rationale to reject what’s unimportant. Covey was certain of his intent to spend the evening with his daughter, while Rosa Parks’ moral clarity gave her strength to remain in her seat on the segregated bus.

#### Fear of Awkwardness

Saying no makes us uncomfortable because it’s socially awkward. We prefer to get along with others — conformity and cooperation are traits that helped humans survive in the early days, and they’re still ingrained.

There seem to be only two options: say no and endure the immediate awkwardness or say yes and regret it much longer. However, you can learn to say no gracefully, and even get people to respect you for it in the process.

#### Tips for Saying No

  * **Remember, you’re rejecting the decision, not the person**. Rejecting someone’s request isn’t the same as rejecting them. Separate the two in your mind. Then communicate your decision clearly but also kindly. You may want to reject the request without using the word no. For instance, you might say, “I would love to do it, but I’m overcommitted right now.”
  * **Remember the trade-off.** Remembering what you’d give up to say yes makes it easier to say no. 
  * **Think of it as a transaction**. In a sense, the other person is selling something — for instance, a cause, an opportunity, or social interaction — in exchange for your time. Considering what’s being sold may help you think more objectively about whether to buy it. 
  * **Accept that you might be temporarily unpopular**. When you say no, the other person may be disappointed or angry. However, the anger usually doesn’t last. In the longer term, the other person may respect you more for demonstrating that your time is valuable, which is more important than popularity.
  * **Don’t leave them hanging**. Most people would rather have a definitive no than a noncommittal response, such as, “I’ll try to be there,” when you know you won’t. Being frank is more respectful. Besides, delaying a no makes it more difficult for both of you.



#### Creative Variations

Since essentialists say no a lot, it helps to have a repertoire of ways to do it. Here are a few to start with:

**1) Employ the pregnant pause** : When someone makes a request, pause and wait for them to fill the silence, or just wait a few beats before saying no.

**2) Use a gentle rejection** : Say “No, but…” For instance, “I’d love to but I have other plans; let’s try it next month.”

**3) Buy some time** : Saying something like, “I’ll check my calendar and get back to you,” gives you time to think and ultimately reply that you’re unavailable.

**4) Use email auto-responses** : Many people are accustomed to receiving email auto-responses when others are on vacation or holidays. You can use them more broadly. They’re handy because they don’t offend — you aren’t saying you don’t want to reply, just that you can’t right now. Indicate that you’re tied up with a project and temporarily inaccessible.

**5) Make them prioritize** : When your boss makes a request on top of previous requests, ask which one you should prioritize. Make clear that something else will have to give way.

**6) Use humor if it fits the occasion** : For instance, if someone asks you to participate in a game or athletic activity, poke fun at your lack of skill.

**7) State what you’re willing to do** : If someone asks for something and you want to help but can’t do what they asked, state what you can do instead. For instance, “I’m willing to loan you my car, but I can’t drive you to the airport Tuesday.”

**8) Suggest someone else** : If you know of someone else who might want to help, convey your regrets while suggesting another name.

Being able to say no effectively is a leadership skill you can learn. Start by learning a few basics and practice until you become an expert.

### Cut Your Losses

We all find ourselves in situations where we’ve invested in something but it’s not paying off. Still, we don’t want to concede and waste the time, money, or effort we’ve already invested. For example, we sit through a movie we hate because we paid for it or we keep waiting when our doctor or lawyer is late rather than rescheduling the appointment. Similarly, people stay in bad relationships or continue gambling to win their money back.

Companies do the same thing, often suffering huge losses. For instance, although the Concorde jet was the fastest passenger plane in the world, it was a financial failure. It lost money for more than forty years, yet over that time the French and British governments continued to invest in it.

It’s human nature to respond this way — **the more you invest (sunk costs), the harder it is to pull the plug on a commitment.** However, as an essentialist, you need to say no or “no more” to losing propositions and commitments. Here are some commitment traps to avoid:

  * **The ‘endowment effect.’** This is our tendency to overvalue things we own and place less value on things that don’t belong to us. For instance, when you rent a car, you don’t wash it before returning it because you don’t value it like you do your own car. We have this same tendency when it comes to nonessential activities, as well as belongings. When we feel we own an activity, it becomes harder to uncommit from it — for instance, your commitment to volunteer at a bake sale seems hard to get out of when you’re the one who organized the event. 
    * **Tip** : for an activity, ask how hard you’d try to get in on it if you weren’t already involved. For a possession, ask how much you’d pay for it if you didn’t own it. For an opportunity, ask, if you didn’t have the opportunity, how much would you sacrifice to get it. If the answer is “not much,” you know how much you truly value that possession or opportunity.
  * **Fear of wasting something.** Many people have an aversion to wasting time, money, or anything that might have value somewhere. We’ve been trained this way since childhood. Abandoning a losing project feels like you’ve wasted your investment. However, by not letting go of a bad choice, you doom yourself to wasting even more.
  * **Reluctance to admit mistakes**. We have to admit mistakes before we can move on. By remaining in denial we continue to circle pointlessly, like people (before Google) who couldn’t stop and ask for directions because they couldn’t admit to being lost. (This is the epitome of a nonessential activity.) 
    * **Tip** : you shouldn’t be ashamed of admitting a mistake because you’re acknowledging that you’re smarter now.
  * **Forcing something to work.** When you’re invested in something that’s not working, it’s tempting to keep trying to force it to work, which of course is a waste of effort. 
    * **Tip** : to break the pattern, get a neutral second opinion. An objective observer’s opinion that it’s a lost cause can make us feel better about giving it up.
  * **Not questioning the status quo**. We have a tendency (called the status quo bias) to keep doing something because we’ve always done it. For instance, companies keep using old systems that have long outlived their effectiveness without questioning them. 
    * **Tip:** one solution is to apply the technique of zero-based accounting (starting from scratch rather than working from last year’s budget). Apply the technique in your life this way — don’t base your time on existing commitments; assume they don’t exist and ask which ones you should include today. From scratch, justify everything you do.
  * **Making casual commitments**. Don’t make spur-of-the-moment commitments, like when a friend mentions a new restaurant she wants to try and you say you’ll go with her. It’s easy to fill your calendar with commitments added on the fly while chatting with someone. 
    * **Tip** : pause a few seconds before answering a request to give yourself time to consider whether it’s essential. If you have second thoughts about a commitment you’ve made, it’s better to apologize and back out than to do something nonessential.



**To test the value of an ongoing commitment or activity, scale back or stop doing it for a short time to see whether it makes a difference** or whether anyone even notices. If there’s no initial reaction, wait a bit longer; if there’s still no reaction, eliminate the activity. An example is the regular reports that managers produce, pulling together data — sometimes their value erodes over time to the point that no one even looks at them.

Of course, getting out of a commitment or investment is harder than not committing to something that’s nonessential in the first place. You feel guilty reneging or going back on your word. But essentialists get comfortable with admitting mistakes and cutting their losses because it’s crucial to making your highest contribution — and they focus on making better choices in the future.

### Think Like an Editor

Part 2 discussed how applying the skills of a journalist can help an essentialist explore options and discern what’s significant. Applying another set of journalistic skills — those of an editor — can help you identify and eliminate the nonessential, which in essence is what an editor does.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey of Twitter thinks of his role as being the chief editor of the company.

Because there are many things the company could be doing, he decides which ones to do, then edits out or eliminates the rest.

A good editor, whether in film or in writing, eliminates everything except what needs to be there. Editing is a true essentialist craft. Here are some other ways editing embodies the principles of essentialism:

  * **Editing involves trade-offs:** Instead of trying to fit in every detail, character, or plotline, an editor asks how each will make the book or film better by contributing to the central theme. It’s difficult for a writer to eliminate creative work that took great effort to produce. But the discipline to do so is crucial to the craft. Stephen King stressed the necessity of ruthlessly eliminating your favorite passages, pages, or chapters: “Kill your darlings, even when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler’s heart, kill your darlings.” In work and life, removing the nonessential, no matter how appealing it might be, allows you to focus on your central theme.
  * **Practicing editing helps you execute effortlessly** as an essentialist**,** or achieve your optimum contribution,**** by removing anything distracting or unimportant. One book editor described editing as an attempt to make life effortless for the reader, that is to make the book’s most important message as clear as possible. Similarly, editing the nonessentials from your life makes all your choices more effortless.
  * **Editors enhance** or add life to a creative work by intentionally subtracting the extraneous. They fully reveal the characters and plot by choosing the right supporting details. In life, purposeful editing can help you enhance your contribution by allowing you to focus your energy on the most important activities and relationships. 



You can apply four basic principles of editing to the process of editing out the nonessentials in your life.

**1)** **Cut nonessential options**. Cutting options is part of decision-making. Part of the word decision in Latin (cis) means to cut. When making decisions, deciding to cut options, especially attractive ones, is difficult. But eventually, each cut brings satisfaction because every second you gain can be applied to something better.

**2)** **Condense**. In editing, when you condense writing you’re making it do more with less (fewer words). Every remaining word must now do more work, becoming more important. In life, condensing also allows you to do more with less. You can eliminate many pointless activities and replace them with one meaningful activity. At work, maybe you can skip unimportant meetings so you have more time to prepare for the most important meeting. If you condense your belongings to live in a smaller apartment or house, many items such as furniture can serve more than one purpose. Just as the important words in a text contribute more to the text’s meaning when you edit out the fluff, your actions make greater contributions toward your goal when you cut out the nonessentials.

**3)** **Make corrections**. With a sense of the overall purpose of a work, an editor corrects grammar, logic, and facts. Similarly, in your life, compare your activities with your central purpose and make any necessary course corrections.

**4)** **Exercise restraint**. The best editors know when to make changes but also when to exercise restraint and leave things alone. In life, leaving things alone or taking a wait-and-see approach can be the wisest course. For instance, you don’t need to be the first to respond to every email thread or to comment at a meeting.

Nonessentialists only edit or cut back when they get overwhelmed. But waiting too long to eliminate nonessential activities and tasks can force you to make drastic cuts that aren’t necessarily what you would prefer. Editing nonessentials from your life thoughtfully and as a matter of routine is more effective.

### Set Boundaries

**Boundaries have virtually disappeared in our nonessentialist culture**. Technology and interconnectedness have erased the line between work and personal life and work has flowed into personal time. You’re expected to be available to work at all times. Meanwhile, others also make demands on your personal time.

Nonessentialists believe they don’t need boundaries because they can do everything. They see drawing lines between work and personal life as getting in the way of their productivity. But they eventually become spread so thin that they’re no longer productive.

As an essentialist, however, **setting boundaries is part of the process of saying no so you can pursue your highest contribution**. It’s uncomfortable to set boundaries for work and you can feel like you’re paying a high price for doing so (for instance, undercutting your career). But often, in the long run you’ll garner respect and benefit your career by focusing your limited energy on what’s really important.

**The price for not pushing back is that demands will keep encroaching to the point that you won’t have any boundaries at all** — and others will set your agenda. The trade-off is that you lose your ability to choose what’s most essential in your life.

Clear boundaries, however, empower and liberate you to pursue your interests. First, they allow you to eliminate nonessential demands. They’re also proactive — they free you from having to say no by preempting future demands because others have learned where your lines are.

#### Push Back Against People Who Ignore Your Boundaries

Still, there are people who simply don’t recognize boundaries and constantly make demands on your time. Think about how often your weekends are consumed by someone else’s agenda. People who lack boundaries distract you from your purpose and make their problems your problems. Here are some guidelines for dealing with these kinds of people:

  * **Don’t accept someone else’s problem**. There’s nothing wrong with helping someone else on occasion, but some people want more than that: they want you to do their work or solve their problem for them. When you do it, you’re enabling them by taking from them their ability to solve it. At work, people often try to shift their problems to you. For instance, a colleague may request your input on a proposal she hasn’t made any effort to develop. You could refuse or agree to look at it later when she’s fleshed it out. Forcing her to solve her own problem benefis both of you. Of course, setting and publicizing your boundaries ahead of time will prevent this kind of situation. 
  * **Have a plan for handling repeat offenders**. When there’s a person who repeatedly distracts you, prepare how you will deflect him in advance. Make a list of the types of requests and activities from him that you’ll refuse unless they align with your agenda. Do this for all of your repeat offenders. To identify people who regularly impose on you, write down any times when you feel resentful or taken advantage of by someone.
  * **Create an agreement**. If you’re going to be working or interacting with someone who violates or lacks boundaries, draw up a social contract. For instance, if you’re tasked to work with an incompatible colleague, establish up front what you’re trying to achieve, what’s important to each of you, and what you will and won’t do. This will keep you from wasting each others’ time.



With practice, setting and enforcing your limits will become increasingly easier.
