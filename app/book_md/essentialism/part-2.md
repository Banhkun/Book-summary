## Part 2: Explore Options

**Essentialists explore and weigh a broad range of options in order to identify the vital few**.

While nonessentialists like to jump on the latest opportunity, essentialists take the time to find out what else is out there. Because they’re going to go big on just a few things, they want to make sure they’re choosing the right things.

To discover what’s essential, **you need five elements: space to escape and think, time to listen and observe, opportunity to play, time to sleep, and selective criteria for making your choices.**

In our do-it-all culture, these things are often seen as unnecessary distractions. For instance, we hear bosses and colleagues say things like, “Fun is a luxury we can’t afford right now.” Or, “We don’t have time for (blank); we have work to do.” Space to explore and think are the antithesis of the thoughtless busyness that surrounds us. But in reality, they’re critical to sorting the important from the trivial matters that swamp us.

### Space to Escape and Think: Get Away from the Routine

Essentialists create space for exploring and pondering options. It can be a physical space, for example, a room that’s conducive to creativity or free from distraction. Or it can be a mental space, a block of thinking time created by eliminating email, phone calls, texts, and other interactions for a certain period.

With our devices and constant connection, we’ve eliminated any chance of being bored, but we’ve also lost the time needed to think and process. Without smartphones and laptop computers, people used to sit around the airport or in the doctor’s office with nothing to do but stare into space and think.

Yet the busier things get, the more we need to build thinking time into our schedules, so that we’re choosing rather than reacting. We need to escape to focus and concentrate. Unlike what some may think, **focusing doesn’t mean obsessing about an issue or question; it means exploring countless possibilities.**

There are many examples of the benefits of creating space to think:

  * Isaac Newton spent two years working in almost solitary confinement on _Principia Mathematica_ , his ground-breaking work on universal gravitation and the laws of motion. 
  * The author of this book blocked off eight hours a day to write, 5 a.m. to 1 p.m., with no emails, calls or appointments. By creating space to explore, think, and write, he got the book done faster and gained control over how he spent the rest of his time. He also reads from classic inspirational literature for the first 20 minutes of each day in order to broaden his perspective and learn from ideas that have endured for hundreds of years.
  * Jeff Weiner, CEO of Linkedin, began scheduling two hours of blank space on his calendar daily because he didn’t have time to think between back-to-back meetings. It’s helped him take charge of his day, instead of being at the mercy of others’ schedules and priorities. He focuses on big-picture questions, such as what the company will look like in a few years or how to better meet customers’ needs. 
  * While CEO of Microsoft, Bill Gates took a week off twice a year to read and think about the big picture.



Whether you invest minutes or hours, it’s important to get away from your day-to-day pressures and think.

### Time to Listen and Observe: Look for Significance

Fully exploring options involves more than just gathering information. It requires making sense of that information by noticing connections, piecing together the whole from the parts, and understanding what really matters.

The best journalists do this — they not only report information, they determine what it means and why it matters. Writer Nora Ephron recounted a lesson from a high school journalism teacher. The teacher assigned students to write the lead for a story about a trip by local teachers to a day-long colloquium about teaching methods. A number of famous people were scheduled to participate. The students all began their stories with the facts of the event, especially the notable people attending. However, the teacher pointed out that they had missed the significance for their audience, the students: there would be no school on Thursday. Ephron realized journalism wasn’t just about repeating facts, but also figuring out the point.

You can apply the following skills of journalists to make sense of information.

#### See the Context

Journalists try not to get bogged down in minor details but see the bigger picture instead. You can take the same approach in your work and personal life. Look for the lead or the significance. Connect the dots so you can see trends. Step back and look at the issue as a whole.

In 1972, Eastern Airlines Flight 401 crashed in the Florida Everglades, killing more than 100 passengers. Crash investigators were puzzled at first because they couldn’t find any external contributing factors, such as weather, or any significant mechanical problems. It turned out that the pilots had focused on a malfunctioning nose gear indicator light (the nose gear itself still functioned properly) and didn’t notice until it was too late that the autopilot function had been deactivated. The crew focused on an insignificant thing and missed the bigger problem — the altitude of the plane.

#### Look Beyond the Obvious

Determining what’s important requires filtering out the unimportant or irrelevant facts, options, and opinions competing for your attention. When meeting with sources, _New York Times_ columnist and author Thomas Friedman filters out the noise in order to listen for what’s not being said or what’s being said quietly. Nonessentialists half-listen while preparing to say something and miss the point. Or they’re distracted by the loudest voices. Like journalists, **essentialists are keen observers and listeners who can see past distractions and inconsequential details and zero in on the significance.**

Here are a few additional techniques to further sharpen your ability to filter observations and locate the most essential information:

  * **Keep a journal.** Look for the lead in your day or week; write the headline**.** Don’t write too much at first, so you’re not discouraged from keeping up with it. Every few months, re-read your entries, looking for patterns and trends.
  * **Get first-hand information.** Sometimes, you can get a better handle on an issue by taking a field trip. For instance, when a Stanford University design class needed to design a low-cost incubator for use in developing countries, they visited India for first-hand information. They learned that most babies were born in homes lacking electricity, so they designed an incubator that could keep a baby warm using heat from water. By getting into the field, they were able to learn the essential details for designing a useful product.
  * **Seek a fresh angle**. Mariam Semaan, a journalist from Lebanon, tries to bring a fresh perspective to topics or shed light on them in new ways. To do this, she reads everything she can about an issue in order to understand it in depth and spot what’s missing from others’ reporting.
  * **Clarify the question** you’re trying to answer. You need to be sure you understand what you’re trying to accomplish before you can weigh options and make decisions. 



### Opportunity to Play: Use Your Imagination

Play is something we do for the joy of doing it rather than for a specific result — whether it’s flying a kite, creating something, or dancing. It might seem unimportant, but it’s essential in many ways. Play can improve health, relationships, learning, and organizations’ creativity. It stimulates the brain to solve problems.

We weren’t taught how to play as children — we picked it up naturally. But as we got older, we picked up the message that play was a waste of time; we should be working and studying instead. However, play remains important as we grow older. It opens our minds and allows us to explore, come up with new ideas, or reimagine old ones.

Play is integral to essentialism because it enhances exploration. **Play helps broaden the range of options available to us by allowing us to see new possibilities and connections.** Also, it’s an antidote to stress — stress undercuts productivity and can shut down the creative part of the brain. Play can even improve the executive function of the brain, the part that plans, prioritizes, and analyzes.

“All work and no play” is ingrained in most workplaces. However, a few companies are learning the value of play to spark creativity. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo initiated an improvisational comedy class to stretch people’s minds. Other companies promote play with their physical environments. For example, at Pixar studios, artists’ offices may be decorated as Western saloons or with Star Wars figures. Desk toys spark creativity, although they may seem like trivial distractions to the nonessentialist.

### Time to Sleep: Invest in Yourself

One of the most common ways we undermine our potential is by not sleeping enough; we steal sleep time to work more and fit more activities into our busy schedules. Our nonessentialist culture encourages this thinking by treating sleep as a burden or a waste of time that could be spent more productively.

In fact, **research shows that a good night’s sleep makes us _more_ productive, not less**. A study of violinists quoted by Malcolm Gladwell in his book _Outliers_ found that the best violinists practiced more than students who were merely good did. But after practice, the next most important factor differentiating the best from the good violinists was sleep. The best averaged 8.6 hours (about an hour longer than the average American). They also napped longer than average. Researchers concluded that with more sleep the top performers were able to practice with greater concentration. So while they practiced more, they also got more out of their practice because they were better rested.

Another researcher likened having a sleep deficit to drinking too much alcohol — he said pulling an all-nighter or sleeping only four or five hours a night for a week creates an impairment equivalent to a blood-alcohol level of 0.1%.

Getting a full night’s sleep, on the other hand, may increase brain power and enhance problem-solving ability, according to a German study. **While we sleep, our brains restructure information, creating new neural connections that open the way to new solutions to problems.** If we’re running short on sleep, research shows that a nap can boost creativity.

Sleep allows us to function at our optimum level. High achievers like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recognize this. He says eight hours of sleep makes him more alert and energetic all day. Google provides “nap pods” for employees, a message to employees that sleep is a priority.

While some people can survive on fewer hours of sleep, many of them are just used to being tired and have forgotten what being rested feels like. While a nonessentialist thinks one less hour of sleep equals another hour of productivity, the essentialist knows that the opposite is true — _one_ _more_ hour of sleep equals _even more_ hours of much higher productivity.

(Shortform note: for a popular book on the benefits of sleep and tips on how to get better sleep, check out our summary of Why We Sleep.)

### Selective Criteria

To make any decision, you apply criteria, whether you’re conscious of the criteria you’re using or not. Nonessentialists and essentialists treat this process differently. Nonessentialists use implicit and broad criteria when choosing how to spend their time. For example, they think, ”If other people in the company are doing it, I should be doing it.” “When someone asks me for a favor, I should do it.”

Many decisions stem from outside pressure to do what you feel is expected. In the social media era, we’re highly attuned to what others are doing, but trying to keep up is impossible given the infinite number of activities, most of which are nonessential but still time-consuming.

Implicit criteria don’t lead to the best decisions — those that allow you to make your highest contribution — or even to rational choices. But they add to your already full plate. The essentialist answer is to**use _extremely_ selective and specific criteria to determine what’s most important**. The word extremely is important because, as noted previously, there usually are many good or mid-level options. Essentialists choose only the absolute best.

This is a key essentialism principle, critical to the process of exploring options. The closet-organizing example shows how extreme criteria work. While sorting your clothing, if you base your decisions on a broad standard of whether there’s a chance you’ll wear something at some point in the future, you won’t get rid of much. However, if you apply a more selective standard — “do I really _love_ this?” — you can more easily eliminate the nonessential. You can do the same with other choices in your life.

TED speaker Derek Sivers advises using this test to decide on options — if you feel an absolute, total conviction to do something (if your reaction is, “hell, yes”), then do it. **Anything less should get a thumbs-down.** He applies it to hiring decisions, often rejecting many good or even excellent candidates to wait for the perfect candidate.

#### The 90 Percent Rule

One useful technique for extreme selection is the 90 percent rule. As you consider your options, identify the single most important criterion for deciding. Rate each option between 0-100 percent on that criterion. **Reject any option that you rate lower than 90 percent.**

This method requires making trade-offs. You’ll have to reject good options and have the discipline to wait for the perfect option. If you use overly broad or vague criteria instead, you’ll end up agonizing over a lot of similar, mid-level options and commit to too many. Applying concrete numbers to your options forces you to make decisions consciously and logically, rather than haphazardly or on the basis of pressure or someone else’s agenda.

Besides keeping you from making the best decisions, having too many or overly broad criteria can frustrate employees. For example, one company had three criteria for deciding what projects to undertake, but over time the standards broadened and blurred to the point that the practical standard was doing anything a customer requested. Team members felt overworked and morale dropped because by doing everything, they lacked a sense of purpose. Further, the company didn’t stand out in its market. But when they got rid of the many mid-level projects and focused on the most interesting and distinctive work, employees felt empowered to make choices and focus on their optimum contributions.

The furniture maker Vitsoe uses stringent criteria in at least two ways. The company offers only one product, the 606 Universal Shelving System, which it excels at producing. Also, its hiring process is highly selective and deliberate. The standard for hiring is whether the candidate will be an absolutely natural fit. Steps include a phone screening, interviews with multiple people in the company, a trial run for a day, more interviews, and maybe an offer. If the team isn’t absolutely sure about a candidate (if she isn’t a clear yes), the answer is no.

#### Unexpected Opportunities

Being disciplined and selective is more difficult when it comes to opportunities that pop up unexpectedly, as opposed to the ones we choose to go after. For instance, someone might offer us a side project that would generate easy cash or they ask us for help with a task that we enjoybut that doesn’t pay. The temptation is strong — how can we say no to an appealing project for friend or one that would bring in extra money? By saying no, we might be missing out. We wouldn’t have gone after the project had it not turned up, but it seems easy to say yes. However, opting for the easy reward could well mean having to say no to a more meaningful one. Or it could detract from making our highest contribution to an essential thing.

Here’s a process for applying selective criteria to pop-up opportunities:

  * Describe the opportunity in writing.
  * List three minimum criteria the options would have to meet in order to be considered.
  * List three optimal or extreme criteria the options would need to pass to be accepted.



If the opportunity doesn’t meet your minimum criteria, you don’t even have to move on to the next step of listing your extreme criteria — the answer is no. If the opportunity passes the first set of criteria but doesn’t meet two of three extreme criteria, reject it.

#### Put Your Search Engine to Work

Applying specific, stringent criteria to decisions is like using a search engine — the more specific you are in defining your search, the more relevant the results you get. For instance, searching Google for a “good restaurant in New York City” would return much less useful results than the more specific “best Indian food in Manhattan.”

You can apply this way of thinking to other searches for options. For instance, if you’re considering a change of career, rather than thinking in general terms about potential good career opportunities, you could ask yourself what you’re passionate about or where your talents could make a significant difference.

In any decision, apply extremely selective criteria to narrow your options to one truly outstanding option, to which you can most enthusiastically say yes.
