## Exercise: Give Yourself a Buffer

You never know when something unexpected will pop up and threaten to sidetrack your pursuit of what’s essential. You can wait until something happens and react or you can take the essentialist approach and prepare by giving yourself a buffer.

* * *

Think of an upcoming personal activity — for instance, a vacation or business trip, a home improvement project, or a major purchase. What potential challenges might you encounter?

What kind of buffer could you create to make the activity go smoothly? How could you create that buffer?

Now think of an important work project and approach it as a risk management strategist might. Ask: What are the risks, what is the worst-case scenario, and what might the impacts be (human and financial)?

In your general life, what kind of buffer or buffers would reduce your risks and make you more resilient to setbacks?
