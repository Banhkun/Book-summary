## Exercise: Change Your Habit

The reason it’s difficult to change a bad or nonessential habit is that the habit is reinforced by a powerful mental loop consisting of a cue, routine, and a reward.

* * *

Think of a nonessential activity that’s become routine for you, but that’s counterproductive. What is the cue that triggers the routine or behavior?

Describe your routine and the reward that reinforces it.

What more important activity can you replace the counterproductive one with?

How can you repurpose the cue to direct you to the new activity and make it routine? What reward will reinforce it?
