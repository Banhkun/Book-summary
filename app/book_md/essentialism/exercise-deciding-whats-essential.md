## Exercise: Deciding What’s Essential

Many people don’t reach their optimum contribution level because they believe everything is important. However, only a few things are essential. To practice the skill of identifying the vital few, start by applying it to everyday decisions. When it’s second nature, apply it to bigger things.

* * *

Think about the coming weekend. List the things you want to accomplish. Prioritize them.

Choose the “vital few.” What makes them important? What can you eliminate to ensure that you get them done?

Try the same exercise with your daily tasks at work. Make a list and prioritize them.

Which few things contribute the most to your employer’s essential purpose? What can you eliminate to ensure you achieve these things?

How do these few vital things dovetail with your essential purpose for your career and your life?
