## Exercise: Embrace Language Innovation

Pinker takes a functional approach to language, arguing that its purpose is to help people communicate ideas clearly, and people naturally modify language to communicate better. Therefore, we should be open to new language conventions. Use these exercises to explore the potential benefits of adapting to new modes of language.

* * *

Write down a few recently invented words or slang terms that you use regularly, but that aren’t considered suitable for academic or more formal writing. For example, “YOLO,” “situationship,” or expressions like “That movie gave me all the feels,” and “My dog has the zoomies.”

For the words and phrases you listed above, write down why they might have integrated into your vocabulary. Do the terms provide a faster way of communicating an idea, or do they communicate something that other words don’t? Was it something that other people started saying, so you adapted accordingly?

If you were to create a new word or expression and use it in a casual conversation, how would other people react? How would they interpret a word or phrase they’re encountering for the first time?

If there are any new popular words or phrases that you _haven’t_ adopted yet, reflect on why you might feel resistant to them. Has this guide changed how you feel about embracing recently invented words or phrases? Why or why not?
