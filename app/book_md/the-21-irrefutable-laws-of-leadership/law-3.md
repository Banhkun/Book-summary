## Law #3: Leaders Develop Leadership Ability Over Time

Are people born leaders? Leadership ability is based in skill, not inherent talent. **Leadership can be learned over time, and that willingness and ability to learn is what separates leaders and followers.**

There are five phases to developing leadership:

  * **Ignorance.** You don’t know that leadership is important yet.
  * **Awareness and incompetence.** You’ve recognized that leadership is valuable and important, but you don’t know how to do it yet. You realize you need to learn.
  * **Daily, targeted learning.** You research leadership. You read, speak with other leaders, attend conferences, etc.
  * **Practice.** You’re now in a leadership position and practice the laws of leadership daily. You become a good leader.
  * **Muscle memory.** Leadership is now second nature. You lead automatically, according to your instincts.



**There are no shortcuts to applying this law**. Learning to be a leader is a process, not an aha moment. While one-off conferences and formative single experiences contribute to learning, there are no timesaving tricks. Learning to lead requires _committed practice_.

### Example of Successful Application of the Law:

As a child, Theodore Roosevelt was weak and timid. He had asthma, bad eyesight, and was small for his age. Sound anything like the cowboy president who once gave a one-hour speech immediately after being shot? **Roosevelt learned to _become_ a leader, and he did it over time.**

When Roosevelt was 12, his father told him that he was smart but his physical weakness was holding him back. Roosevelt began**training his body and mind _every day_**. He practiced martial arts, weight-trained, and played a variety of sports. He went to Harvard and held a variety of civil service positions before becoming president.

Roosevelt continued his daily practice while president and accomplished many things, including winning a Nobel Prize and helping the US become a world power. Even after his presidency, he never stopped learning. He led a scientific expedition to Africa and explored Brazil’s River of Doubt. When he was found dead in his bed, there was a book under his pillow. He squeezed learning into every last moment of his existence.

(Shortform note: Unlike in other chapters, no failed application is given.)

### Leadership Actionables

**The best leaders invest in their followers, so as a leader, you should create opportunities for your followers to learn this law alongside you.** Create a culture that values personal growth and leadership development, and facilitate development activities such as getting trainers for your followers, or sharing your own expertise as a mentor. When you create an environment where growth is valued, it will exponentially increase. And this growth culture will start attracting high-potential people.
