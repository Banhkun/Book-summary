## Exercise: Learn to Trust Your Intuition

Everyone is intuitive in their area of strength. Once you’ve learned to trust your intuition in one area, you can start developing it in leadership.

* * *

What is your greatest strength?

Imagine you’re doing an activity that involves your greatest strength. You come up against a problem. What do your instincts tell you to do?

Now, reflect on your instinctive reaction. How did you arrive at it? Did you “read” situations, resources, trends, people, or yourself? Did you know what to do because you’d seen the same problem many times before?
