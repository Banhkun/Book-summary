## Introduction

**Everything that you do in life involves other people** , whether it's running a business, playing a sport, pursuing a hobby, or simply being with your family. **To most effectively interact with others, you need leadership skills.** In _The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership_ , John C. Maxwell outlines rules to follow to increase your leadership abilities.

To be most effective, **you must apply all 21 laws** when acting as a leader. However, no one is good at everything. (Even John C. Maxwell says that there are five he hasn’t mastered.) **Assemble a leadership team (Law #11)** containing people who excel at the laws you struggle with. That way, there will always be someone on the team who can effectively apply every single law.

There are four concepts to keep in mind when learning, practicing, and applying the laws:

  * **Every single one of the laws is attainable**. You’ll find some of them easier to learn, and others harder, but all are within your reach if you work hard enough.
  * **The laws are non-cumulative**. You don’t have to learn them in any particular order, and even once you’ve learned just a few, your leadership ability will increase.
  * **The laws can’t be ignored.** If you follow the laws, you’ll be a successful leader, and people will follow you. If you don’t follow them, or ignore them, there will be negative consequences.
  * **The laws are the building blocks of leadership.** Once you’ve learned the laws, you must practice them throughout your life.



(Shortform note: The original edition of _The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership_ was published in 1998. This ten-year-anniversary edition drops two laws (combining the principles with other existing laws) and adds two new ones. Some of the examples are also updated from the original edition.)
