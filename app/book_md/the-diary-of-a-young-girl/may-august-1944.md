## May-August 1944

**During the final months of their time in the Annex, talk of an impending invasion by the Allied forces had the Annex buzzing.** While they all hoped for a quick liberation, the residents argued with one another about when and how the Allies would enter Amsterdam. For example, Mr. van Daan once snapped at Mrs. van Daan for saying that she didn’t believe in his invasion predictions, and that the Allied campaign should have been further along.

### May 1944

The Annex suffered a severe loss after Mr. van Hoeven, the man who helped deliver potatoes to the residents, was arrested for hiding two Jews in his home. **Anne lamented the state of the world and questioned the purpose of war.** She hated that good people were being arrested for helping others while those driven by hatred were free to roam the streets and persecute others. She felt desperate and suffocated as their time in hiding continued without a clear end in sight. Even on more light-hearted days, the stress of isolation and fear of discovery put Anne in a constant state of anxiety and depression.

#### Holding Onto Daily Life

**As the war continued outside of the Annex walls, the residents and helpers tried to continue with their daily lives:**

##### Helpers

  * Mr. Kleiman recovered from his stomach illness enough to visit the Annex and return to work. 
  * Bep got engaged to her long-term boyfriend, but the residents didn’t approve of the engagement. They believed that Bep didn’t truly love her fiance, and that he held her back from her true potential.



##### The Cats

  * One of the warehouse cats, Boche, disappeared. Anne presumed that the cat had likely died or been eaten by desperate people. 
  * Mouschi (another of the warehouse cats) began peeing in the attic because her litter box hadn’t been cleaned. Her urine seeped through the floor and dripped into the barrel of potatoes.



##### Education

  * Anne kept busy by reading and writing. She worked through works such as the Bible and _Palestine at the Crossroads_ and wrote short stories such as “Cady’s Life.”
  * The residents of the Annex took part in a variety of educational courses to keep themselves occupied. Mrs. van Daan, Otto, and Edith studied English and read. Margot and Anne studied a variety of courses including languages, mathematics, and history. 
  * Anne nearly lost all of her writing and schoolwork after someone spilled a vase of carnations onto them. While she almost had a breakdown, she managed to salvage most of her work by hanging the pages out to dry.
  * Anne wanted to learn more about her parents’ backgrounds and loved listening to their stories. Otto was born in Frankfurt to a wealthy family and enjoyed the benefits of wealth throughout his childhood. However, his family lost their wealth following WWI. Edith was also well-off growing up and enjoyed going to private balls and parties throughout her youth. Anne and Margot didn’t grow up wealthy and were amazed by the lavish lives their parents used to live. 



##### Relationships Between Residents

  * After a few weeks of drama, Dussel apologized for his behavior following the break-ins. The residents celebrated his birthday in peace and gave him some meaningful gifts.
  * One of the employees of the warehouse, Mrs. Broks, asked Mr. Kugler to use the office in the afternoons. Not able to think of a good excuse, he agreed. This meant that the residents wouldn’t receive potatoes at lunchtime and couldn’t be visited by their helpers during the day. 
  * The residents enjoyed joking with one another. For example, because Dussel used the bathroom frequently and consistently, Anne put a written timetable on the bathroom door stating when Dussel could use the bathroom and when he couldn’t. In another instance, Mr. van Daan told a dirty joke about Adam and Eve that had the entire Annex laughing. 
  * After a disagreement, Mrs. van Daan tried to punch Peter. Peter laughed off her assault and grabbed her. He easily overpowered her. While she laughed for a moment, Mrs. van Daan was very upset with her son’s insolence and had Mr. van Daan scold Peter for his aggressive response. 



#### Otto and Peter

After talking with Peter, Anne decided to tell her father about their relationship. **While Otto seemed okay with it at first, he wasn’t comfortable with Anne becoming physically and romantically involved.** He told Anne that she would have to show more restraint because Peter may get the wrong idea about Anne’s affection and try to get physically involved with her.

**In response, Anne wrote her father a letter protesting his suggestion to stay away from Peter.** In the letter, she claimed her independence and said that she no longer needed the support of either Otto or Edith. Peter made her happy, and she wanted to continue her relationship with him. She told her father that she’d either have to forbid her from visiting Peter altogether or accept that she was going to spend time with him.

Her father was saddened by Anne’s note and told Anne that it was the most hurtful letter he’d ever received. He believed that he and Edith had always supported Anne. While he ultimately forgave her for her words, he was upset by Anne’s lack of gratitude. Anne felt guilty about giving her father the letter. **However, she stood behind what she said and wanted to continue her relationship with Peter independent of her father’s approval.**

#### Shortform Note: The War

**As the cost of living spiked in German-occupied cities, so did the crime rates.** Food and basic necessities became unaffordable because of inflation and a lack of well-paying work. Frequent thefts, murders, and break-ins became the norm as desperation took hold of the Dutch people. In addition to the rise in crime, anti-Semitism began to spread through the Dutch citizens. People began to blame the Jews for the Nazi occupation and claimed that they were turning on their helpers by giving them over to the Germans.

**In addition to domestic issues, the Dutch began to grow angry with the English for not doing more to liberate Holland.** Anne was confused by this frustration. She believed that the English owed nothing to the Dutch. In her mind, they were fighting to protect their own people and didn’t want to risk severe British losses. The Queen and Prime Minister of the Netherlands (who were hiding in England) spoke to the people of Holland through radio transmissions and assured them that liberation was coming soon.

### June-August 1944

**From fights over butter to dealing with the cats, the residents of the Annex continued to struggle with life in tight quarters.** Though hope for liberation had most of them optimistic about the near future, the residents continued to bicker with one another. These fights were intensified by increased anxiety because of aggressive air raids. To deal with the horrifying sound of constant gunfire, Anne would run up and down the stairs to drown out the noise.

As their isolation continued, Mrs. van Daan started to have fits of hysteria. She’d talk about being shot, imprisoned, or hanged and even talked about suicide. She’d cry one moment, then try to laugh it off the next. Anne believed many of Mrs. van Daan’s issues stemmed from her loneliness. Because no one gave her the attention she needed, she started to break down. Anne tried to take her seriously but struggled to do so because a lot of her issues came from a place of self-pity.

**As the residents struggled, the helpers of the Annex continued to have problems of their own:**

  * Mr. Kugler was called up for another work detail.
  * Mr. Klieman continued to struggle with his stomach issues.
  * Bep fell into depression because of the stress surrounding both the Annex and her wedding.



Despite the many struggles they had throughout the summer, the residents did manage to get their hands on a large number of strawberries and peas. This alleviated many of their food woes and gave them a bit of security.

#### Insecurities and Fears

**Though she had become more confident in herself, Anne still struggled with her insecurities.** The adults of the Annex often accused her of being arrogant, and their words made Anne question what she was doing to deserve such a title. She was her own harshest critic and reproached herself for her seemingly unattractive behaviors.

In addition to her insecurity, Anne was concerned about her relationship with Peter. She knew that he liked her, but **she felt like something was holding their relationship back.** While she appreciated his friendship, she wanted more. She was still desperately in love with him and couldn’t go a day without talking to him. Peter was more closed off than Anne, and she wanted to continue to break through his hardened exterior.

She feared that their fast movement toward intimacy hindered their relationship. She thought that their discussions about sex and their shared kisses actually prevented them from having a deeper relationship in which they talked about more serious things. She regretted the way their relationship had developed and worried that she may never develop the meaningful connection that she wanted.

#### Thoughts and Musings

**In the summer months, Anne began to philosophize about a variety of topics, ranging from pianists to liberation movements:**

  * **Anne enjoyed talking about famous figures.** For example, she talked about the life of famed pianist Franz Liszt and his flings with a variety of women. She believed he was a true artist who cared about his creations as much as his cognac.
  * As the Allies advanced towards Amsterdam, a pocket of the Dutch population began to spew anti-British sentiments. They didn’t want to be occupied by another world power and expected the British to liberate them then leave.**Anne didn’t agree with these sentiments.** She believed that the British were going above and beyond their responsibilities as allies, and that the Dutch should be grateful for the Allied assistance.
  * **The longer Anne was isolated in the Annex, the more she fell in love with nature.** She desperately wanted to be back in the world and went out of her way to catch glimpses of trees, the moon, and other images of nature. Looking to nature helped her feel calm and hold onto hope for eventual freedom.
  * **Anne questioned the place of women in society.** She hated that women were viewed as inferior to men and were expected to carry out “wifely duties” instead of developing a life for themselves. She appreciated that some countries had begun to give women more rights and educational opportunities, but she believed that the stigma against women was still alive and well.
  * After Peter joked about becoming a criminal, **Anne thought about the nature of morality and ambition.** She believed that everyone had the ability to stay true to their convictions if they worked hard enough, and she hoped that everyone would take the time to make choices based upon their views of “right and wrong.” She also believed that everyone needed to have goals that they worked towards because, without goals, she thought people would become lazy and search for the “easiest” way to live. 
  * When reflecting on the way that she had been raised, Anne developed some opinions about child-rearing. **She believed that children had to be taken seriously and treated as individuals.** She hated when her parents would tell her that she’d “grow out of it” or relate her experiences to “other girls.” Also, she believed that, while parents could guide their kids in a certain direction, children had to make discoveries about their goals and morality for themselves. 
  * **Anne believed that the younger residents in the Annex had a more difficult time than the adults.** This is because the adults had time to develop opinions and convictions in a more normalized world. On the other hand, the younger residents had to find their beliefs and dreams while faced with the grim realities of war and isolation. 
  * **In her final diary entry, Anne talked about the two sides of her personality.** She felt like a walking contradiction with one side of her being more sarcastic and carefree while the other side wanted deeper and more meaningful connections. She was afraid that people would mock her if she showed her more vulnerable side, and she only let that part of her personality emerge when she was alone. 



#### Shortform Note: The War

**In the summer months of 1944, Allies made significant advances into German-occupied territory.** The United States entered the European front with the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, the British advanced into Bayeux, France, and the Russians launched an offensive on the Eastern front. These advances led to increased excitement for liberation amongst those under occupation.

**Morale within the German forces began to falter.** In-fighting spread to the highest-ranked members of the Nazi military, leading to an assassination attempt on Hitler led by a German general. Following this attempt, Hitler ordered that soldiers were to kill any suspected traitors on sight.

#### August 4, 1944 and the Aftermath

**On August 4, 1944, the Annex was raided by the SS.** It is believed that someone tipped off the authorities to the hide-out. The helpers of the Annex were arrested (with the exceptions of Miep and Bep):

  * Mr. Kleiman was released early due to his poor health and remained in Amsterdam until his death in 1959. 
  * Mr. Kugler escaped imprisonment in 1945 and immigrated to Canada. He lived in Toronto until his death in 1981.
  * Bep lived in Amsterdam until her death in 1983.
  * Miep lived in Amsterdam for most of her life. Her husband, Jan, died in 1993. She died in Hoorn in 2010.



Dussel, the Franks, and the van Daans were sent to concentration camps:

  * Mr. van Daan was gassed to death in Auschwitz in late 1944.
  * Mrs. van Daan was sent to 5 different concentration camps. Her cause and time of death is unknown.
  * Peter was forced to make the “death march” from Auschwitz to Mauthausen. He died on May 5, 1945. The camp was liberated three days later. 
  * Dussel was sent to 2 concentration camps. He died in December 1944 in Neuengamme. 
  * Edith died in Auschwitz in January 1945 of hunger and exhaustion.
  * Margot and Anne were both transported from Auschwitz to Bergen-Belsen. A typhus epidemic was likely the cause of their deaths. Their time of death is unknown.
  * Otto was the only resident to survive the concentration camps. He was in Auschwitz when it was liberated by the Russians. He lived in Amsterdam until 1953, then moved to Birsfelden, Switzerland. He remarried and dedicated his life to sharing his daughter’s diary with the world.
