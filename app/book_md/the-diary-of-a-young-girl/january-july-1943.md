## January-July 1943

**While Anne and her “Annex family” tried to hold onto hope, growing frustration and resentment led to constant fighting between the members of the household.** The conflicts inside the home were intensified by constant fear as WWII continued to rage on throughout Europe. Anne’s fights with her mother, the van Daans, and Dussel began to escalate. She cried herself to sleep often and couldn’t understand why they constantly felt the need to point out her shortcomings.

Her mother would often tell her that she should behave like her sister, Margot. However, Anne knew that she wasn’t anything like her sister, nor did she want to be. She thought Margot was too timid and weak-willed. Anne wanted to be outspoken, not passive. She wanted to get some distance from them, but, given the circumstances, had nowhere to go.

### January-March 1943

**As the new year began, the residents had to deal with a number of issues such as:**

  * **New Owners:** Near the end of February, the building housing the Annex was sold to a new owner without the knowledge of Mr. Kugler or Mr. Kleiman. Fortunately, Mr. Kleiman was in his office when the new owner and architect arrived. He showed them the building, but he claimed he had left the key to the Annex at home. The new owner didn’t ask any questions, and the Annex residents remained hidden.
  * **Gunfire:** At night, planes would battle overhead in vicious air conflicts known as dogfights. At the time, the constant gunfire put Anne and the other residents on edge. Anne would crawl into her father’s bed for comfort, and Mrs. van Daan would be close to tears. Though the antiaircraft guns were loud, Anne said there was nothing worse than the sound of machine gun fire.
  * **Rats:** The Annex residents discovered rats in the attic after they heard the sound of scurrying above their heads. Peter went to go check it out, and, in the dark, accidentally put his hand on a rat. The rat proceeded to bite him. This caused quite a bit of bleeding, and it frightened Peter.
  * **Burglary Scares:** One night, the Annex residents heard noises coming from below and quietly huddled together to see if they could hear anything. The family had used the office that night to listen to an English radio broadcast and forgot to change the station and move the chairs back to the tables. To avoid arousing suspicion should the police investigate the break-in, Otto and Peter made their way to the office armed with a hammer, but they didn’t find any burglars. They fixed the chairs and changed the station, then returned without incident. Though they considered that the noise may have been coming from one of the neighboring companies, the fear that occurred from the experience had everyone on edge. 



#### Gratitude and Holding Onto Hope

As their time in the Annex continued, the residents of the Annex listened closely for updates on the war and hoped for a quick Allied invasion and liberation. Throughout the day, they would try to keep themselves occupied with other tasks, such as education or reading, and would make jokes to lighten the mood.

**As the war raged on outside of the Annex, Anne thought about how fortunate she and her family were to have support and a place to hide.** She sympathized with the people facing the Nazi threat directly and expressed gratitude that she was able to avoid that fate at the time. She compared her experience in the Annex to the people still out on the street:

  * Where she had a quiet and safe place to live, others were being torn out of their homes and either sent to camps or left homeless.
  * Where she had clothing and food, others were left in the cold with only a thin shirt and no way to get resources.
  * Where she and her family could think about “after the war,” many were trying to survive on a day-to-day basis.



#### Shortform Note: The War

**As the war raged on, various countries and organizations discussed getting involved to push against the Nazi forces.** For example, bishops encouraged parishioners to take action against the Nazi invasion and countries such as Turkey talked about dropping their neutral status to join the Allied push. These efforts gave the people of Holland hope as the German occupation continued.

The Allies upped the frequency of their bombings in Germany. This included tactical attacks in Nuremberg, Munich, and Berlin. German radio programs brought on wounded soldiers from both these attacks and the invasion efforts in Russia to discuss their injuries and their pride for the Nazi party. These broadcasts were heard by people across German-occupied territories in an effort to rally public opinion against the Allies.

**In Amsterdam, resistance movements began appearing.** They targeted important Nazi strongholds and structures such as the Labor Exchange and the County Clerk’s Office. These movements showed that the local population was not going to continue to accept German occupation silently.

### April-July 1943

**Anne often wondered what life was going to be like after the war.** While her family wasn’t overly concerned with class or manners while in hiding, she wondered if their way of life would ever return to normal. She thought that things such as using the same cloth for a table cover and not changing the sheets lowered their position in society.

**A few members of the Annex voiced their opinions on the war and outside conflicts:**

  * Mr. van Daan was well-versed in politics and predicted that the war would last until at least the end of 1943.
  * Mrs. van Daan wanted to purchase false IDs and get away from the conflict altogether. 
  * Otto was always an optimist and tried to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
  * Dussel tried to involve himself in conversations about the war and politics, but, according to Anne, would usually just make things up as he went along.



On the health front, Anne had to drop her shorthand course because her poor eyesight was preventing her from being able to perform necessary tasks for the class. The residents of the Annex discussed how they were going to get her the glasses that she needed. One idea was to sneak her out to an ophthalmologist, and, while this idea was ultimately rejected, it made Anne long to return to the outside world.

#### Friends of the Annex

The helpers of the residents of the Annex did their best to provide resources and information on a regular basis, including food, books, presents, and medicine. **However, because of health issues and other obligations, there were times that they were unable to offer their assistance.** Mr. Kleiman suffered from medical conditions and had to have surgeries. Miep and Bep tried to juggle work, life, and support all while avoiding rousing suspicions from Nazi forces. Worst of all, Mr. Voskuijl discovered that he had cancer.

Though Mr. Kleiman and Mr. Kugler always tried to keep Otto informed and involved in company matters, there were occasions where circumstances made that impossible. In one example, Otto’s company had a meeting with a very important client from Frankfurt. Because he couldn’t be there, Otto reviewed important information with Mr. Kleiman before the meeting. However, Mr. Kleiman fell ill and couldn’t attend the meeting. Mr. Kugler had to run the meeting without the proper information. Otto listened through the walls to the important meeting, fearing that his business may be at risk.

#### Tension and Fear

**As time went on, the fights between Anne and Edith continued.** One night, Edith told Anne that her father was busy and that she’d like to be the one to listen to her prayers that night. Anne rejected her mother because she didn’t want to pray with someone she didn’t want around because it would be hypocritical. Her mother was crushed, and, the next day, her father barely spoke to her and gave her disappointed looks.

Anne and her mother weren’t the only ones fighting. **The adults also got into intense arguments that caused rifts in their relationships.** Though Anne didn’t describe the details of the fights in her diary, she did describe incidents that incited frustration from the residents. In one instance, they discovered that Dussel had been keeping a secret food stash hidden away despite the fact that food had become harder to come by. Dussel defended his stash as “his property” and promptly ridiculed the efforts of the people that were helping them while in hiding because he believed they weren’t doing enough.

In another fight with Dussel, Anne asked if she’d be able to use the table they shared two afternoons per week so she could study in peace. Despite being respectful in her request, Dussel rejected it. He claimed that he needed it for his studies, then called the coursework Anne was doing unimportant. While Anne tried to reason with him on multiple occasions, it didn’t help. She eventually had to ask her father to intervene and help them make an arrangement.

Anne’s father showed his support and tried to relate to her struggles by writing her a poem for her birthday. In the poem, he explained that he knew that she was struggling with people always arguing and nitpicking her actions. Through some humor, he empathized with her frustration and insisted that their time in hiding would not be in vain.

**In addition to the heightened internal tensions, constant air raids had everyone on edge.** One night, Anne was so terrified of the gunfire that she packed up her bags in preparation to leave should the building be destroyed. However, her mother informed her that, should that happen, they’d have nowhere to go.

**Crime rates rose due to the war, and the warehouse had a break-in.** Thieves stole checkbooks, cashboxes, and ration coupons. Mr. Kugler believed that the burglars were the same ones who had attempted to break-in six weeks earlier and failed.

#### Shortform Note: The War

As rebellious actions such as sabotage and worker strikes popped up across Holland,**the Germans began to take action to attempt to restrict and control the Dutch citizens:**

  * Nazi leadership required all Dutch college students to sign a statement that stated they sympathized with the German efforts and supported the “New Order.” Students who refused were sent to concentration camps.
  * The German troops began taking radios from every home in the region to prevent resistance propaganda from getting out. 



**In addition to the domestic conflicts, dogfights broke out between Allied and German forces and the city was bombed relentlessly.** When Allied soldiers were forced to eject from their planes, German ground troops would fire at the helpless pilots parachuting to the ground rather than take them prisoner. After a particularly heavy bombing, over 200 people were confirmed dead, and it took the locals days to dig out all of the bodies. Another bombing caused parts of the city to light on fire and enveloped the horizon in a thick cloud of smoke.

On the international front, the Allied forces landed in Sicily and pushed into Italy against Mussolini.**After weeks of conflict, Mussolini was overthrown by King Victor Emmanuel III and removed from power.** This was a major win for the Allies and removed a German ally from the conflict.
