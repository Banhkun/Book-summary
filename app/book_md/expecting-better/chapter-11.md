## Chapter 11: The Baby’s Gender

About half of couples choose to learn about their baby’s gender before birth.

You can find your baby’s gender through a maternal blood test (soon after pregnancy), CVS test (first trimester), or in ultrasound (typically around 20 weeks).

If you don’t want to put your baby's gender to chance, you can dictate your baby’s gender through sperm sorting, then artificial insemination/IVF.

(Shortform note: fun fact - sperm sorting is done through FACS, or fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Also, “family balancing” is the polite term for gender selection.)

Things that don’t work to discover or influence the baby’s gender:

  * Timing conception does not influence baby gender. 
    * Some believe that Y sperm (leading to males) are fast swimmers but die off quickly, so if you want to have a girl, then have sex earlier. This is called the Shettles method. There is no evidence that this works.
  * Some believe female fetuses have faster heart rates. This is a myth: fetal heart rate does not differ between genders.
