## Chapter 6: Foods to Avoid and Not

Pregnant women are commonly recommended to avoid a long list of foods - raw eggs, raw fish, cheeses, deli meats, to name a few. The general fear is that food illnesses can bear a risk to the fetus.

Oster argues that **many food illnesses are actually no riskier than when you’re not pregnant**. But two forms are, and are worth avoiding.

### Foods Commonly Avoided that are Fine

Typical food poisoning is caused by _Salmonella_ , _E.coli_ , and _Campylobacter_. These pathogens cause diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, but do not usually affect the fetus.

For foods more at risk of harboring these bacteria, like raw eggs, raw fish, and shellfish, use your standard caution. Chances are you haven’t gotten food poisoning more than once a year, and this isn’t going to get more likely when you’re pregnant.

### Foods to Avoid

Oster acknowledges two illnesses that are harmful:

#### Toxoplasmosis

Toxoplasmosis affects 1 in 1,500 babies and causes mental retardation, blindness, and epilepsy. Acute toxoplasmosis in the mother has a 30% chance of infecting the baby.

You can get toxoplasmosis from **undercooked meats, dried/cured meat, and unwashed vegetables and fruits**. Cat litter is actually less likely than the above dietary sources.

If you already have toxoplasmosis (25% in the US do), then there’s no risk to your baby.

#### Listeria

Listeria affects 1 in 8,000 babies and, in 10-50% of pregnant women who are infected, can cause miscarriage, preterm birth, stillbirth, meningitis, and neurological problems. The mechanism seems to be infection of the placenta, which triggers defense by the mother and expelling the placenta.

The sources for listeria outbreaks are sporadic and unclear, with sources in ice cream, cantaloupes, celery, and deli meats. Oster noticed a pattern in **queso fresco**(Mexican soft cheese) and **deli turkey meat** and chose to ignore those.

Listeria grows well at fridge temperatures, so if you want to be safer, chuck out anything that’s been in the fridge for too long

### The Best Fish to Eat

Fish have two competing effects on the fetus:

  * **High mercury lowers IQ.**
    * A 1 ug/g increase in mercury sampling causes a decrease of 0.7 IQ points. In other words, the average American woman and the highest mercury-exposed woman produces a 3.5 IQ point difference in kids.
    * Predator fish and long-living fish (listed below) have the highest levels of mercury. The former eats other fish harboring mercury, and the latter accumulates mercury over a long lifetime.
  * **Omega-3 fatty acids increase IQ.**
    * Increasing DHA fatty acids by 1 g/day would increase IQ by 1.3 points.



The solution is to eat high omega-3 fish with low mercury. **The best fish to eat are: salmon, herring, sardines, pollock, and mackerel.**

**The worst fish that you should AVOID are: orange roughy, canned tuna, king mackerel, grouper, shark, and swordfish.** These contain low omega-3 but have high mercury.

These fish are somewhere in the middle: tilefish, halibut, sushi-grade tuna, flounder, and snapper.
