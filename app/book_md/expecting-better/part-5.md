## Part 5: Labor and Delivery | Chapter 18-19: Giving Labor

Here’s a timeline of labor:

**First Stage** : Dilation (few hours to a few days)

  * Early Labor: 1-3 cm (least pain)
    * Mild and infrequent contractions
    * Sometimes not even noticeable over weeks(!)
  * Active Labor: 3-7 cm (more intense)
  * Transition: 7-10 cm (horrible, but quicker)
    * Contractions can come every 2 minutes and last 90 seconds



**Second Stage** : Pushing (few minutes to a few hours)

**Third Stage** : Placenta (short)

Generally, labor progresses at an average of 1 cm of dilation per hour, but this rate can be slower in early labor (2 hours without any change in dilation) and speeds up near the end (going from 7 to 10 cm in < 90 minutes).

If the cervix doesn’t open quickly enough, you can be given Pitocin to induce contractions or a C-section if the baby’s heart rate is dropping.

C-sections happen in 30% of births in the US, but they are not the preferred mode of delivery since they entail slower recovery. Once you have a C-section, you’ll be recommended to have C-sections for future babies. Vaginal births after C-section may increase infant complications and maternal hemorrhage.

### Baby Position

Babies are normally delivered head-first. Coming feet-first is called breech, and it carries risk of oxygen deprivation to the baby or injury to the skull. Thus, most breech babies are delivered via C-section.

The direction a baby is facing can change throughout pregnancy - at 28 weeks, 25% of babies are in breech; by delivery, it’s only 3-4%.

The baby’s position can also be manipulated in the womb through external cephalic version, where the baby is manually turned to normal position. This is usually done after 37 weeks, since before then most breech positions resolve naturally.

### Should You Epidural?

An epidural is an analgesic injected into the spine during the first stage of labor. It drastically reduces the pain of labor to virtually no pain, and it helps the mother get rest for the physically demanding pushing part of labor.

Epidurals are very popular and are used in about 66% of births in the US.

For the baby, epidurals don’t have big differences in APGAR score, fetal distress, or NICU time. The epidural does raise the risk of a maternal fever during labor, which could prompt doctors to administer antibiotics to be safe and thus expose the baby to antibiotics.

Cons of an epidural:

  * Increased risk of forceps or vacuum extractor in delivery
  * Greater use of C-section for fetal distress
  * Longer pushing time (15 minutes)
  * Greater use of Pitocin in labor to compensate for slowing in contractions
  * Higher chance of baby facing up at birth (possibly due to less walking)
  * Greater chance of maternal hypotension
  * Longer recovery postpartum
  * Increased chance of fever in labor
  * 1/200 epidurals cause a wet tap, where the needle goes into the spinal fluid and causes a headache for a few days



Oster ultimately chose to deliver both children without an epidural.
