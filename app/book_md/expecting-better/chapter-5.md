## Chapter 5: Miscarriages

**A minority of pregnancies end in miscarriage, and there’s largely nothing you can do about it. 90% of miscarriages in the first trimester are due to chromosomal problems at conception.**

Here’s the risk of miscarriage by week:

Week  | Chance of miscarriage   
---|---  
6th week  | 11%   
7th week  | 7.2%   
8th week  | 5.8%   
9th week  | 3.3%   
10th week  | 3.2%   
11th week  | 1.9%   
  
The 6th week is the second week after your missed period, and often the time of the first prenatal visit when you get an ultrasound. It has the highest risk of miscarriage, between 10-15%. After week 12, the risk is 1-2%.

It’s common to announce after the first trimester (roughly 12 weeks), but the risk of miscarriage decreases substantially by week 9.

Other factors affecting miscarriage:

  * Women with a previous miscarriage have a miscarriage chance of 25% in first trimester, compared to 4-5% for first pregnancies or women with a previous successful pregnancy. 
  * Age increases miscarriage rate: women below age 20 have a miscarriage rate of 4.4%; women aged 20-35 have a miscarriage rate of 6.7%; and women over 35 have a 19% miscarriage rate.
  * IVF pregnancies have miscarriage rates of 30%, vs 19% for natural pregnancies.
  * Vaginal bleeding signals increased risk - 13% of women with bleeding have miscarriages, vs 4.2% without.
  * Lack of nausea signals a higher miscarriage rate.
  * Low levels of progesterone may contribute to miscarriage.
