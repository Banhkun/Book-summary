## Exercise: Address Your Shame

One major component of developing empathy and overcoming shame is practicing critical awareness. This exercise will prompt you to identify and critically analyze one of the identities that cause you shame so you can understand and overcome your negative beliefs around it.

* * *

Describe a recent experience with shame and the identity you were being associated with that triggered you. (For example, maybe someone pointed out a hole in your shirt and you felt ashamed over looking poor.)

Now, consider which “negative” characteristics of that identity lead to shame. (For example, people might look “poor” by wearing old or dirty clothes, having messy hair, having poor hygiene, or owning outdated technology.)

What identity does society pressure you to adhere to instead of the identity you described above, and what are the characteristics of this identity? (For example, instead of being “poor,” society expects you to look “upper-class” by wearing new, fashionable clothes, always having a stylish hairstyle, and owning the newest technology.)

Finally, consider why these expectations are unfair—who benefits from them and who suffers? (For example, wealthy companies and individuals benefit from these expectations because people feel pressured to spend their money on new clothes and technology to be seen as worthy. Middle- and lower-class people suffer from this expectation because they feel pressured to spend their modest income on unnecessary things so that others see them as “good enough.”)
