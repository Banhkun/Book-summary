## Exercise: Reflect on Your Teamwork

Most of us use teamwork almost every day, whether it be at school, work, or home. Sutherland advises that team members should be allowed the freedom to choose their assignments and direct their actions and that teams should be kept small—no more than nine members. Reflect on some experiences you’ve had working with others.

* * *

Think of a team project you had to complete in which you weren’t allowed much freedom. Now think of another team project in which you and the other team members had more say in how to complete it. Which of these was more fun, challenging, and effective? Do you think a team can have too much freedom?

Have you ever worked on a team with over ten members? If so, how did it go? Was there a lack of communication amongst the team? Did you ever feel out of the loop? Did any in-groups form in which you felt left out?
