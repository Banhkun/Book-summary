## Exercise: Examine Your Experience With the Waterfall Method

Weâ€™ve all probably used the Waterfall method at some point in our lives. As Sutherland says, it's an extremely common strategy that has been used for decades. How well has the Waterfall method worked in your experience?

* * *

Think of a time when you used the Waterfall Method, or something similar, to tackle a project. This could just be a simple project you did yourself or something you did with a team. When planning, did you include every task you needed to complete? Did you estimate how long each would take? How long did the planning process take?

Now think of the process of putting the plan into action. Did everything go according to plan? Did the project take more or less time than you expected? What things changed during the process? Which tasks were added and which were eliminated?

Looking back on the project, how would you have done things differently? Do you think extensive planning saved or increased time spent on the project?
