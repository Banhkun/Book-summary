## Exercise: Find Inspiration for Activism

Doyle says that identifying the issues and causes you care most about can be a method for directing your activism. Letâ€™s look at some questions that can help guide you toward action.

Think of the many issues that are facing our world today. Make a list and choose one issue to focus on.

What emotions do you feel when you think about this issue? How do these emotions inspire you to become more involved?

What step can you take _today_ to be more involved in these causes?
