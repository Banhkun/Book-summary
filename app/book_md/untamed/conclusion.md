## Conclusion: Reconstruction and Rebirth

The four pathways we have discussed helped free Doyle from captivity. As these four paths converged, they empowered Doyle to reconstruct her life to reflect her truest self in four ways:

  * **The Pathway of Embracing Emotion:** By feeling difficult emotions, she can face the future confidently knowing that her difficult emotions will help her grow into the person she needs to become. Doyle built a new purpose based on empathy and activism. 
  * **The Pathway of Embracing Intuition:** By accessing her intuition, she can understand herself more deeply and feel secure when making difficult decisions. Doyle formed a new understanding of her inner self. 
  * **The Pathway of Embracing Imagination:** By envisioning and articulating her deepest desires for the future, she can rewrite her story so that these imaginings can become her reality. Doyle built a new marriage based on imagination. 
  * **The Pathway of Deconstruction:** By deconstructing prior beliefs, she can separate herself from social structures and institutions that do not reflect who she is and what she believes. Doyle built a new family, faith, and worldview based on consciousness rather than complacency. 



Doyle now lives according to her wildness—her primal self. This primal self was the person who had been there all along, waiting to be free. She has made a promise never again to abandon herself. She will practice self-love and always trust her instincts.

> **Doyle’s Continued Commitment to Her Pathways**
> 
> Doyle stays true to herself as she continues to follow the pathways we have explored in this guide—she’s found concrete ways to live into each:
> 
>   * She has a post-it note on her mirror that reminds her to “feel it all” and embrace her emotions.
> 
>   * She continues to be guided by her intuition as she engages in activism through Together Rising and raises money for causes close to her heart.
> 
>   * Doyle lives the life she imagined for herself with Abby. Together they co-host the We Can Do Hard Things podcast in which they are honest about their daily struggles and how they try to support each other on their respective journeys to construct their truest lives.

### Doyle’s Advice for Rebuilding Your Life After Captivity

Doyle’s experiences have taught her a great deal about how to rebuild life on her terms, and she calls her readers to do the same. She asserts that the world needs more wild women, and suggests four ways you can begin rebuilding your life to align with your truest self.

**1) Let go of your old assumptions, beliefs, worldviews, and social conditioning.** Be committed to holding on to nothing but the truth. Start a journal to reflect on how your ideas about gender, sexuality, family life, religion, and race have been influenced by society’s messaging.

(Shortform note: Committing to letting go of old beliefs and writing about your social conditioning can be overwhelming if you try to tackle too many beliefs at once—focus on just a few of these beliefs at a time. In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins provides a useful process for addressing just a few damaging beliefs at a time. He suggests writing down all of your beliefs and then identifying the ones that have had significant negative impacts on your life. Robbins says that you then choose just two of these negative beliefs—and focus on thoroughly deconstructing each one. You can revisit this lexercise as needed until you deconstruct each negative belief on the list.)

**2) Be willing to lose the things in your life that are good enough.** When you create a more beautiful vision of your life, you should never compromise that vision by tolerating the things that are just “good enough.”

(Shortform note: There’s some debate around the value of “good enough” things. While Doyle encourages you to reject “good enough,” other authors argue that you should _embrace_ it. In _Good Enough_ , Kate Bowler suggests that the expectation that your life should be in a state of constant pursuit of “the best” is an unrealistic goal—and this commitment to only the best can make it harder for you to handle setbacks or disappointment. Bowler says that you should instead embrace the “good enough” life. This means striving for what is possible today, while acknowledging that there may be setbacks in the future that you may not be able to control.)

**3) Be willing to disappoint people who don’t understand your new priorities or see your vision.** Trying to please others will compromise your reconstruction.

(Shortform note: Being willing to disappoint people often involves getting rid of people-pleasing tendencies—which can be stressful for you and trigger unpleasant reactions in others. In _The Disease to Please_ , Harriet Braiker suggests focusing on being considerate of others—that is, listening to them attentively and considering their views—while sticking to your vision and asserting your perspectives. This balance helps the people in your life not feel alienated from you and come to terms with their potential disappointment about your decisions.)

**4) Write new messages to yourself about what you believe and who you are as a person.** These new messages can be expressed in a journal or carried deep within you. Revise these messages as needed on an ongoing basis for the rest of your life.

(Shortform note: In _The Success Principles_, Jack Canfield says that you should begin the process of writing new messages to yourself by writing down the things that make you happy. Reflecting on what you write down is a great way to better understand who you are and what defines you as a person. The combination of a positive focus and a deeper understanding of yourself can empower you to create optimistic messages for the future.)
