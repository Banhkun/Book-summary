## Exercise: Learn From Your Anger

Doyle says that you can learn a lot from anger—such as where your boundaries are or what your core beliefs are—if you approach it with curiosity. In this exercise, you’ll reflect on an angry experience with curiosity to see what you can learn.

* * *

Describe the last time you felt angry at someone.

Reflect on _why_ you felt this anger—how were your boundaries or core beliefs challenged?

How did you react to this anger?

If you had approached your anger with curiosity, how might you have reacted differently, and what do you think you might have learned?
