## Pathway #4: Embracing Deconstruction

We have now explored embracing emotion, embracing intuition, and embracing your imagination. We’ve learned how these pathways can release you from a state of captivity by showing you how to live free of society’s restrictive messages. Now that you are following these pathways, you can examine areas of your life where emotion, intuition, and imagination are suppressed. By deconstructing those areas, you can let these powerful aspects of yourself shine.

_Deconstruction_ requires dismantling old beliefs and practices inherited from your culture, giving you a clean slate upon which to reconstruct a new life that better reflects your current values and goals. (Shortform note: Deconstructing your beliefs not only allows you to create a new life that’s more aligned with your values, but also allows you to more easily engage in change and creativity. In _Think Again_ , Adam Grant says that the crucial ability to rethink your beliefs allows you to develop new solutions and ideas for breaking free of old mindsets.)

In this chapter, we'll explore how Doyle deconstructed her beliefs and practices about marriage, motherhood, and family in creating her new life with Abby. We'll also discuss how deconstructing these areas of her life prompted her to examine her beliefs around religion and racism.

### Deconstructing Marriage, Motherhood, and Family Structure

As Doyle embarked on a new relationship with Abby and began to rewrite her vision for the future, she examined the life she had been living and saw that it was limited, narrowly defined, and based on society’s expectations. **Doyle’s conditioning provided the framework for her life, but she realized that her true, wild self was too dynamic and vibrant to be confined by this framework.** She began reconnecting to her true self by examining the foundational beliefs informing her life and then sought to create new ideas that better matched the life she wanted for herself.

(Shortform note: Deconstructing your foundational beliefs is an essential step to living your most authentic life, but you may not feel ready for it. Experts concede that it can be a tough process—requiring you to examine your deepest self closely, let go of things you’re attached to, or confront unpleasant emotions. However, the happiness and freedom you gain from the process is well worth the struggle.)

#### Original Beliefs

During her life in captivity, Doyle adhered to the cultural mandates that women should be quiet, pleasing, agreeable, and self-sacrificing. She believed that the best way a woman can love the people in her life and her community is to be selfless and put her desires last. In her life, this showed up in three ways:****

  * **She tried to be a dutiful wife**. She went through the motions of sex and intimacy while neglecting her desires. 
  * **She tried to be a selfless mother.** She operated under the assumption that the way you show love and devotion to your children is through self-sacrifice. 
  * **She maintained a traditional marriage and family structure.** She believed that her children’s well-being depended on maintaining a traditional family structure, which she had to preserve at the expense of her happiness and fulfillment. (Shortform note: Many women—like Doyle—stay in unhappy marriages for their children, but studies show that children often suffer when their parents are in conflict, feeling insecure in the tense home environment.)



> **Pursuing a Balance: Selflessness and Self-Care**
> 
> Doyle criticizes the societal expectation that women should be selfless, but you may not be ready—or willing—to completely reject this aspect of your nature. In that case, you might take a slightly different approach: cultivating a balance between selflessness and self-care.
> 
> Selflessness can help you serve others, be more empathetic, and tune into the needs of those around you. In marriage, tuning into your partner can create intimacy, and empathically connecting to the needs of children can foster their well-being. But as Doyle notes, being _too_ selfless has many negative consequences, especially when it drives you to neglect your own needs. By balancing your selflessness with rejuvenating self-care practices, you can both honor your needs and fuel yourself for the necessary emotional work of caring for the people in your life.
> 
> There are numerous practical ways that you can bring self-care into your life: You can keep a journal, play your favorite music and dance, take a 10-minute nap, eat your favorite food, take a walk, or get a massage. You can also set aside parts of your day as sacred time just for you (for example, when you’re drinking your coffee or winding down after work). Taking this time for yourself will allow you to balance your needs with the needs of others.

#### New Beliefs

Doyle's new love for Abby—and for her "true self" that emerged—forced her to question everything she believed. She realized she needed to make significant changes in three areas where she held restrictive beliefs: **marriage, parenthood, and family structure.**

##### Marriage

**Doyle deconstructed her beliefs about what it meant to be in an intimate relationship**. In her new relationship, she experienced a sexual awakening that allowed her to tune into her desires. She abandoned the idea that she must be pleasing and performative—instead of forming a new belief that she deserves _to experience_ pleasure in her intimate relationships.

(Shortform note: While many women think that putting their partner's needs before their own is the “right” way to be intimate, rethinking these beliefs can lead to more _fulfilling_ intimate relationships. One way to become more aware of your desires is to check in with yourself before being intimate with another person. A self-check-in helps you assess what you want from the experience and express your desires.)

##### Parenthood

**Doyle deconstructed her beliefs about what it meant to be a parent.** As she pursued a new relationship with Abby, Doyle’s primary concern was for her children and for the upheaval that they would experience in their lives. She realized, however, that although the changes may be disruptive, it was important for her children to see their mother living her most authentic, fulfilled life. She wanted to model happiness and fulfillment for them rather than self-sacrifice—she decided to demonstrate how to change direction unapologetically.

(Shortform note: Many authors and researchers agree that seeing happy adults provides important benefits for children. In _Modelling Happiness_ , Reen Rose says that when children see adults being curious, pursuing new ideas, and engaging in enjoyable activities, they witness both what it looks like to be happy and also learn skills (such as resiliency, bravery, and confidence). These skills will help children to pursue their own happiness as they mature.)

##### Family Structure

**She deconstructed her beliefs about family structure.** She realized that family structure can diverge from a nuclear family and still provide love, support, and stability. She rethought her assumption that she should maintain the nuclear family at all costs and discovered that a healthy family structure evolves and changes to fit the needs of each of its members.

(Shortform note: Doyle’s assumption that the nuclear family should be maintained at all costs likely comes from societal messaging that this family structure is “best”—but studies show that _any family that provides love, protection, and support is "best."_ A larger societal trend towards accepting a wide range of family arrangements mirrors Doyle’s experiences. Research shows that an increasing percentage of the American population accepts and supports non-traditional family structures.)

### Deconstructing Institutions and Belief Systems

In addition to deconstructing her ideas about marriage, parenthood, and family structure, **Doyle also reexamined her beliefs about religion and race.** She realized that she had been participating in cultural practices and belief systems that did not reflect what she believed true about herself and the world.

#### Deconstructing Religion

When Doyle was a young mom in the early 2000s, she became involved in her local church—only to find that the church was primarily focused on opposing homosexuality and abortion. When she questioned the pastor about his approach, he told her to trust the church’s teachings. After this experience, Doyle joined another church that didn’t force her to check her critical thinking and intuition at the door or defer to the judgment of powerful men.

Doyle reflected on her experience with her first church as she continued to deconstruct her ideas about religion after meeting Abby. The experience had given her a first-hand perspective of how religion can negatively impact women’s lives—she realized how important it is to deconstruct the views handed down by authority.

> **The Challenge of Leaving Your Congregation**
> 
> During her early church experience, Doyle saw how her viewpoints were easily ignored and disregarded by powerful men. Many women have spoken out against injustice in their congregations after having similar experiences.
> 
> Two notable women who have written extensively about religious deconstruction are authors Sarah Bessey (_Out of Sorts_) and Rachel Held Evans (_Searching for Sunday)_. They point out how patriarchal power structures within the church discourage open dialogue and debate and promote conservative political ideologies.
> 
> Like Doyle, Bessey and Evans both experienced leaving their congregations, deconstructing their beliefs, and finding new faith communities. Their work expands on Doyle’s ideas by exploring the difficulty of leaving a faith community and the bravery required to deconstruct your faith—especially as doing so requires letting go of a central support system for many women. The sense of isolation and alienation that comes with leaving your congregation and faith can be challenging, and you may feel that community support is necessary for your journey. If you need support, Bessey and Evans founded an online community for people actively deconstructing their faith that can help you during this difficult transition.

##### Doyle’s New Beliefs About Religion

Today, Doyle believes that following Jesus’s teachings should not involve taking a hardline stance on political issues. (Shortform note: This stance mirrors the views of many people who have left their congregations, citing disagreement with their church’s views on homosexuality.)

**Doyle rejects the idea that the church is a necessary intermediary between individual believers and the divine.** Instead, she believes that she has personal access to God and doesn’t require an intermediary or interpreter. As a result, she no longer views organized religion as necessary for loving God or each other.

(Shortform note: Doyle’s conclusions align with recent studies that have found an increasing lack of confidence in organized religion. Many people no longer see organized religion as a necessary part of their faith journey and instead have developed a more personal approach to spirituality. Doyle has also chosen this path and is currently not affiliated with any religious organization, and instead explores her spirituality by practicing meditation (as discussed in the previous section).

#### Deconstructing Racist Beliefs

In addition to rethinking her relationship with organized religion, Doyle also rethought her perspectives on race and civil rights.

After the election of Donald Trump in 2016 and the demonstrations that followed, Doyle was inspired to talk about the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s with her family. Her younger daughter asked if their family would have joined in the marches and demonstrations for civil rights if they had been alive in the 60s. Before Doyle could answer, her older daughter responded that they wouldn’t have—because they weren’t participating in the civil rights demonstrations occurring in the present day.

Doyle realized her daughter was right. Although she believed deeply in the cause of civil rights, she was not personally taking any concrete action, such as demonstrating for change or speaking out in solidarity with those fighting for racial justice. **It wasn’t enough to profess support for racial equality; she had to become personally involved.**

> **Avoiding “Slacktivism” and Taking Real-World Action**
> 
> Although there are many similarities between the Civil Rights Movement of the ‘60s and the civil rights demonstrations of today, the influence of social media is one major difference. The new ability to passively participate in social causes online can sometimes lead to what some call “slacktivism”—expressing interest or support (liking a page, sharing, retweeting information) without taking on much personal risk.
> 
> Doyle and her daughters may have _thought_ they were actively supporting civil rights because it is easy to passively engage with causes online and express support without publicly demonstrating. However, they realized that professing your support isn’t enough because change comes from connecting with others and taking action. One way to make the leap from engaging online to engaging offline is to meet in person with others who support the cause you’re interested in. Meeting with other activists helps you establish personal, real-world connections that can encourage you to take concrete, meaningful action.

##### Taking Action and Being Called Out

Doyle believed that the first step to becoming more meaningfully involved in this cause was to educate herself about racism and explore her relationship with it.**** She learned about police brutality, the preschool-to-prison pipeline, and other issues the African American community faces. She began to see racism as a deep-rooted issue that poisons American society on all levels. (Shortform note: Doyle doesn’t mention which books or authors she read as she was becoming educated about these issues. If you’re looking for a place to get started, there are many reading lists online, such as this one put together by Ibram X. Kendi, anti-racism expert and author of _How to Be an Anti-Racist_.)

Doyle realized that racism had surrounded her throughout her life. As a child, she watched police shows that depicted African Americans as criminals and heard racist jokes and comments—yet she never saw this as “wrong” and didn’t speak up. After educating herself, she realized that these racist jokes and negative depictions of African Americans in the media were expressions of American racism, unacknowledged by white people and yet pervasive.

(Shortform note: Doyle may not have recognized what she saw as racism because what she saw didn't fit her idea of “real” racism. In _How to Be an Anti-Racist_ , Ibram X. Kendi explains that there are two kinds of racism: overt and covert. Overt racism involves acts of aggression or violence between individuals—likely what Doyle was raised to believe was “real” racism. She didn’t realize at the time that covert racism is “real” racism too. Covert racism involves institutionalized racist policies and practices throughout society. Doyle’s experience watching police shows exemplifies how covert racism can be communicated and normalized through the media—so that many can’t even see racism even when it’s right in front of them.)

As she became aware of the pervasiveness of racism, Doyle felt inspired to lead discussions and raise awareness about the issue. She was criticized and called racist for assuming she had a right to take a leadership role in the movement, however. Some felt it was important for white women to take a step back and let people of color who were already leading the movement take center stage.

**She realized that when others called her racist, they were right—** her assumption of a leadership role represented racist beliefs inside of her. But she still believed it was important to be brave and show up to conversations about race—even though her prejudices would be on display. She concluded that it’s better to take a risk and speak out on this issue than be silent and complicit in the racial status quo.

> **Consciously Avoiding White Defensiveness**
> 
> Doyle willingly admits to the racism within her so that she can participate in productive discussions. Doyle isn’t defensive or over-sensitive as she comes to this conclusion—an unusual reaction, according to Robin DiAngelo (_White Fragility_). DiAngelo claims that it is more common for white people to become highly defensive when confronted with their racism.
> 
> This is an unfortunate reaction—white defensiveness in conversations about race can effectively shut down communication, and it wrongly refocuses everyone’s attention on the defensive white person rather than the needs of the African American community. To combat this tendency towards defensiveness, DiAngelo says, **white people should not view the accusation of racism as a personal, moral failing but rather as a result of their ongoing complicity in the racial status quo**. Realizing society's role in creating racist beliefs can clarify that racism is not so much a personal accusation as a social responsibility that needs collective attention.
> 
> DiAngelo also agrees with Doyle that it is better to be criticized than to be silent. He emphasizes that white people should acknowledge their complicity while still being open to discussion. In practical terms, this looks like white people staying out of leadership roles in conversations about race, instead listening attentively to those who have suffered and developing a better understanding of what is _actually_ needed of them.
