## Exercise: Reflect on Your Conditioning

Doyle received messages from society that told her what to be—pleasing and agreeable, self-sacrificing, attractive to men, able to repress emotions and desires, and deferential to the opinions of others. In this exercise, you can reflect on your experiences and compare them with Doyle’s.

* * *

What kinds of social conditioning did you experience as a child? How were these messages communicated to you?

How have these messages affected you? How have you changed yourself in order to fit into other people’s ideas of who you should be? (Example: You felt pressure to achieve academically—as a result, you went from being a relatively carefree child to an anxious teenager who feared failure.)
