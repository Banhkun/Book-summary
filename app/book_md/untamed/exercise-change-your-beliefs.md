## Exercise: Change Your Beliefs

Doyle achieved freedom from her captivity by systematically deconstructing her beliefs and assumptions. In this exercise, you will reflect upon the beliefs you’ve adopted and how they’ve changed over time—and you’ll identify which beliefs may need deconstructing.

* * *

Choose one of the following topics: gender roles, parenting, religion, or race. What were you taught to believe about this topic?

How have these beliefs changed over time? What caused this change?

What beliefs do you have today that need to be deconstructed or reexamined?
