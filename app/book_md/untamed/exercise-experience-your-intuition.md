## Exercise: Experience Your Intuition

Doyle developed an approach to self-reflection that involves connecting to a deeper version of herself and asking this inner self for guidance. In this exercise, you can reflect on Doyle’s methods and consider how you might incorporate her practices into your moments of self-reflection.

What kind of self-reflection methods have you used in the past (for example, journaling, prayer, meditation)?

What about Doyle’s approach appeals to you? How do you think you might incorporate it into your life?
