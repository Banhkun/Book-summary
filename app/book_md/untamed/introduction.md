## Introduction: Captivity and the Pathways to Freedom

Do you ever feel that there is a more authentic, primal self within you waiting to be free? Author, public speaker, and activist**** Glennon Doyle has felt this way, too. She used to feel like a wild animal in captivity—conditioned not to feel, think, or trust herself until she learned **how to break society’s rules, upend cultural expectations, and rebuild her life.**

### Doyle’s Inspiration: The Cheetah

Doyle’s inspiration for the book came when she took a trip to the zoo with her family. She observed a majestic female cheetah tamed by her keepers and trained to chase a stuffed animal around her pen. Doyle identified**** with the cheetah because she also felt that she had been held in “captivity.” She’d learned to chase the “stuffed animals” of domesticity and conformity rather than pursue her instincts and intuition. Society had conditioned her to deny her true, undomesticated self.

As Doyle made this connection, she saw the cheetah looking out past the fences of her enclosure—remembering her wildness.

Considering the parallels between the cheetah’s experience and her own, Doyle realized that captivity is the universal experience of women. Like this female cheetah, women have been made captive—their primal instincts intentionally suppressed and devalued by society.

> **Comparisons Between Doyle’s Cheetah and the Wild Woman Archetype**
> 
> Doyle uses her cheetah metaphor to explore how women lose connection to the primal version of themselves when they become conditioned by the expectations of their society. Doyle’s discussion of women’s inherent “wildness” and their need to return to their primal state is not necessarily new—.Jungian analyst and storyteller Clarissa Pinkola Estés claims these concepts are as old as civilization. Estés explores the historical and cultural background of these ideas in _The Women Who Run With Wolves._
> 
> Estés analyzes myths and fairy tales to reveal common themes and characters that serve as mythological archetypes in stories throughout the human experience. In these stories, the “wild woman” is a commonly-explored figure who resists civilization and lives in touch with nature and her soul. She often lives on the fringes of society, is not bound by its rules, and speaks the truth. Estés says that reading about these figures can help women recognize these qualities in themselves and remember their primal nature.

#### Received Cultural Messages

As a child, Doyle was creative, sensitive, imaginative, and intuitive. As she reached adolescence, however, Doyle started receiving and internalizing damaging cultural messages about what a woman should be: **pleasing and agreeable, self-sacrificing, attractive to men, able to repress her emotions and desires, and deferential to others’ opinions.**

Doyle abandoned her unconstrained childhood self to conform to these expectations and began bottling up her emotions, distrusting her intuition, and dismissing her imagination—this messaging took away her freedom and put her in the cage of society's expectations.

As a result, she constantly sought approval from others and suffered from low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. These societal expectations so completely consumed her that she was domesticated and lived in a state of captivity by age ten. (Shortform note: Doyle’s experience aligns with research that indicates that age 10 is when children start to internalize the gendered expectations that society communicates to them.)

> **Why Social Messaging Disproportionately Affects Girls**
> 
> Doyle describes how she was susceptible to the messages of her culture and internalized them at an early age. One of the reasons Doyle was so affected by this messaging is that humans place a high value on social acceptance and are therefore constantly observing the behaviors of others to guide their behavior.
> 
> In _Influence_ , Robert Cialdini describes “The Social Proof Principle,” which states that when people are unsure of how to behave, they base their behavior on the behaviors of others in the group. Social proofs can be a way to cope with insecurity and pursue social acceptance.
> 
> Adolescent girls can be particularly susceptible to social proofs because they are more sensitive to rejection or social disapproval than boys. As a result, manufactured social proofs—social proofs deliberately created to manipulate behavior—disproportionately affect girls. A pervasive example of manufactured social proofs are the messages in advertising that aim to convince girls that they are not good enough. These kinds of manufactured social proofs can have long-lasting negative consequences, including anxiety, depression, and insecurity—all of which Doyle has struggled with throughout her life.

### Pathways Out of Captivity

After her experience with the cheetah helped her reflect on her life, Doyle identified the "pathways" that had allowed her to escape captivity. **To regain their freedom, she says, women must rediscover the wildness within them.**

Doyle argues that you must embrace the qualities taken away or diminished during captivity to live in your primal state. By understanding what was taken away during captivity, you can recognize and unlearn your social conditioning.**** Doyle introduces **four pathways to help you identify and recover these lost capacities and instincts.**

  * **Pathway #1: Embracing Your Emotion** —numbing your emotions has stopped you from being able to express your feelings. This pathway encourages you to embrace and express your emotions to be fully human. 
  * **Pathway #2: Embracing Your Intuition** —the tendency to look to others for validation has diminished your ability to tap into your intuition and trust your decisions. By following this pathway, you can learn to explore your intuition through quiet reflection.
  * **Pathway #3: Embracing Your Imagination** —the social message that you must accept—and be nothing but grateful for—your current reality has diminished your ability to imagine a new reality. Embracing your imagination will help you create a better, more vibrant life.
  * **Pathway #4: Embracing Deconstruction and Reconstruction** —your ability to deconstruct your existing beliefs and rebuild a new life for yourself has been taken away by society’s interest in maintaining the status quo. This pathway helps you deconstruct your old ways of thinking so you can rebuild your life around emotion, inner knowledge, and imagination.



As we explore these pathways, we’ll tell Doyle’s life story in parallel, revealing how she’s traveled these pathways in her own life and navigated her way toward the vibrant, liberated life she lives now.

> **Women’s Liberation: From the ‘60s to Today**
> 
> Doyle’s pathways to freedom share many similarities with the ideas that developed during the women’s rights movement in the 1960s and 70s. Betty Friedan was a feminist leader during this period focused on women’s liberation.
> 
> In the early 60s, Friedan experienced a sense of dissatisfaction and purposelessness as a homemaker raising children—an experience similar to Doyle’s captivity. She realized many women shared her experiences of being confined to the home and feeling unfulfilled, so she sought to find ways to liberate women like herself.
> 
> Friedan realized acknowledging their shared experiences was an important first step toward progress and action. She therefore wrote _The Feminine Mystique, _which explored this shared female experience __ and exposed the cultural forces that kept women oppressed. In her book, Friedan suggests concrete courses of action, such as rethinking what it means to be a woman and breaking free of social restrictions by pursuing educational and career opportunities.
> 
> Friedan’s ideas about liberation are more focused on direct actions women can take toward liberation, while Doyle focuses more on examining and reinventing your mindset. Still, both Friedan and Doyle agree that rethinking what it means to be a woman is necessary to make progress and pursue fulfillment.
