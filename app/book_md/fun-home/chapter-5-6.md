## Chapter 5-6: Isolation and Disorder

The town of Beech Creek had a strange hold over Alison’s father’s family. In fact, in the small town of only 800 residents, there were 26 families that shared the last name of Bechdel. **Alison later suggested that her father may have killed himself in part because of his perceived inability to escape the small-minded town.**

Similar to the isolation of Beech Creek from other communities, Alison experienced isolation within her own home. Her parents were both artistic. Her father had the house to fix. Her mother played piano and rehearsed for her productions. When she tried to interact with either of them, they would often ignore her to focus on their work.**She describes her home as an artist's colony in which each member of the family became consumed by their passion, but in isolation.**

### OCD

**In addition to the disorder she felt within her household, Alison also developed an actual disorder at the age of 10.** Initially, her obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) involved counting the drips in the bathtub. She couldn’t turn off the faucet until the final drip count was an even number and not a multiple of 13. Soon, her behaviors intensified:

  * She couldn’t cross through a doorway without counting the number of edges on the flooring. If the edges didn’t add up to an even number, she’d have to change the standard of counting (adding a groove in the floor or a metal strip to her counts).
  * Next, she began to feel an invisible substance in every doorway. She’d have to push this substance aside before she could walk into a room so that she didn’t swallow or inhale it. If she couldn’t “clear” the substance herself, she’d have to chant a special incantation to clear the space.
  * She had to put her clothing in specific places and in specific ways. For example, her shoes had to be perfectly aligned and in a particular place. The right shoe represented her mother and the left shoe represented her father.
  * She had to kiss each of her stuffed animals in a particular order every night before bringing one of three animals to bed with her (at this point, it had been years since anyone had kissed her good night).



During her OCD phase, Alison started a diary. Initially, the entries were bland and straightforward.**However, she soon began questioning how she knew that everything she was writing down was objectively true.** She began writing the words “I think” in small letters between sentences. She soon developed a symbol to represent the phrase “I think” and began to cover her diary entries with it.**** The symbols covered up names and pronouns that referred to other people because she couldn’t confirm what they actually saw or thought.

In one instance, a bad car accident led to the Fun Home having three funerals at once. One of the people that died was a distant cousin who was exactly her age. Her diary entries that discussed those days were almost completely obscured by the “I think” symbol drawn over the entire entry**** because**she couldn't be certain of what other people were experiencing or seeing, and she had to satiate her need to be completely accurate in her diary entries.**

Slowly and with the help of her mother, she began to give up her compulsions. She would dictate her diary entries to her mother and developed dates by which she had to stop certain behaviors. Ironically, she was just as obsessive about kicking the habits as she had been with adopting them.

### The Summer of 1974

Alison experienced a chaotic summer in 1974 because of events in the country, in her community, and in her personal life. In the United States, the Watergate scandal was coming to a head. In her community, locusts had risen from the ground and infested the town.**In her personal life, Alison started puberty and her father got arrested for giving alcohol to an underage boy.**

#### The End of Childhood

**When Alison was 13, she got her first period in June.** At first, she didn’t mention it in her diary or tell anyone about this development, not even her mother. She hoped that ignoring it would make it go away. However, when she got her second period, she knew that she had to do something. For a while, she used tissue paper so that she could wait for the right moment to address her development. Though she almost brought it up on a few occasions, Alison didn’t tell her mother that she had gotten her period until around December of that year—**almost 6 months after her first one.**

#### Alison’s Father and the Police

**Alison’s father had a run-in with the police after an incident with an underage boy.** Her father picked up a 17-year old and told him that his brother had gone missing. The boy got in the car and they went looking for his brother. During their search, her father purchased a six-pack of beer and offered the boy a drink. After they drove around for a few hours, he dropped the boy off at his home. His brother, who hadn’t been missing in the first place, recognized the vehicle and immediately called the police.

Alison’s father was sent a summons and was charged with giving alcohol to a minor. Though Alison never knew the nature of her father’s relationship with the boys, **she later inferred that it was sexual.**

While in court, the magistrate focused solely on the alcohol charge and never brought up the nature of Alison’s father’s relationship with the two boys. The judge agreed to dismiss the charges if he agreed to 6 months of counseling. Alison implies that the nature of the sentencing had little to do with the liquor charge and more to do with the unspoken accusation:**a homosexual act with a minor.**

> **Oscar Wilde and _The Importance of Being Earnest_**
> 
> Oscar Wilde was an Irish playwright and poet responsible for many iconic works, such as _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ and _The Importance of Being Earnest.**He was also known to be gay.**_
> 
> **In _Earnest_ , Wilde makes sly references to homosexuality** including his use of gluttony as a metaphor for illicit desire and the inclusion of the address of a known gay activist. (Shortform note: “Earnest” was a slang term for homosexual in the late 19th century.) During the summer that her father was taken to court, her mother was in a production of _The Importance of Being Earnest_. **Alison notes the irony of her mother’s involvement in a show that has notable homosexual undertones while her husband actively engaged in homosexual activities.** In fact, during the summer, he even flirted with men from her mother’s cast.
> 
> Shortly after _The Importance of Being Earnest_ originally premiered, Wilde was put on trial for sodomy. **Alison compares Wilde’s trial to that of her father’s.** Where Wilde confronted his sexuality in the courtroom, her father never mentioned his. Wilde gave an impassioned speech that was met with applause from members of the court, while her father stayed relatively silent throughout his proceedings. Though Wilde became a symbol for the gay community, he was harshly punished for speaking out. On the other hand, her father stayed quiet but avoided severe punishment or humiliation. **Alison uses this comparison to inform why her father chose to stay silent and avoided taking a stand.**
