## Chapter 3-4: Sexuality and Marriage

**Alison began to explore her sexuality in college.** She checked out books from the library that discussed homosexuality and focused on the stories of lesbians. Her studies were both informational and erotic. She joined the gay union at her university and began dating her classmate, Joan.

She came out as lesbian in a letter to her family. Alison’s mother didn’t respond well. She sent back letters explaining her disapproval and why she thought Alison was making a dangerous choice. Though she said that she could live with Alison’s sexuality, her disappointment was clear, and Alison was shattered by the disapproval.

Soon after coming out, Alison’s mother revealed that her father was having affairs with men. Alison felt as if she had gone from the hero in her own story to the side character in her father’s drama. **Though she hoped her coming out would allow her to distance herself from her family because of her unique identity, she was pulled back into their lives** because of the realization that she and her father had an unspoken connection that linked them.

### Her Parents’ Marriage

**Alison’s parents met during a collegiate production of _The Taming of the Shrew_. **Alison compares the problematic plot of Shakespeare’s play to the reality of her parent’s marriage. In _The Taming of the Shrew_ , Katherine’s spirit is crushed by Petruchio. Later in their marriage, Alison’s mother was crushed by her father’s behavior.

Her father joined the Army after dropping out of his graduate program. While deployed, he began to fall in love with the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Inspired by the author’s focus on sentimentality and extravagant language, he sent Alison’s mother increasingly sentimental letters expressing his passionate love for her.

**However, this passion quickly faded as their marriage began.** Alison’s parents almost never showed affection for one another. In fact, Alison only remembered two instances of any kind of intimacy between the two:

  * They shared a small peck before her father left for a weekend trip.
  * Her mother put her hand on her father’s back once while watching TV.



Fighting was the norm in the household. Her father would take his anger out by destroying books and throwing things. In one instance, her father began to tear the pages out of library books while screaming at his wife.

**Adding fuel to the fire, Alison’s father would bring some of his male students home, give them books, and offer them alcohol.** He often focused on these boys more than he focused on his own family. For example, he once forgot to pick up his own son from Cub Scouts because he was too busy drinking and chatting with a high school student he brought into his library.

> **F. Scott Fitzgerald vs Henry James**
> 
> Alison compares her father to Jay Gatsby of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s _The Great Gatsby_. **Gatsby takes pride in his ability to create the illusion of class and extravagance.** He started as a farm boy but makes millions bootlegging alcohol. He uses this money to throw extravagant parties and hide his simple origins. Also, Gatsby uses his wealth to engage in an affair with Daisy (a married woman he had a relationship with before being sent off to fight in WWI). Daisy is Gatsby's true passion, even though his relationship with her is seen as unethical.
> 
> **Similarly, Alison’s father created the illusion of class and extravagance in the way that he renovated his house, particularly his library.** Though he lived in Beech Creek almost his entire life, he saw himself as above the rest of the local population. He used his home and education to hide his simple origins. Also, he used his home and alcohol to engage in affairs with young men. These young men were her father’s true passion, even though his relationship with them was seen as unethical.
> 
> On the other hand, Alison compares her mother to Isabel Archer of Henry James’s _The Portrait of a Lady_. Isabel leaves America for Europe hoping to experience a new life following her father’s death.**She marries, and although her relationship seems to start in a good place, her husband’s affection for her disappears quickly**. She later learns that her husband has been having an affair throughout the entirety of their relationship. At the end of the story, she stays with her husband despite his affairs for the sake of their child.
> 
> Similarly, Alison’s mother left New York to start a life with Alison’s father. **Though their relationship seemed to start in a good place, it soon began to fall apart as her husband’s affection for her disappeared quickly.** After they were married, Alison’s mother discovered that her husband was having affairs with multiple men throughout the entirety of their relationship. Despite this, she stayed in the marriage and raised three children with him.

### Inverts

**An old term for homosexual was “invert.”** The term implied that homosexuals behaved in a manner opposite to their natural sex. While that term isn’t an accurate description of all gay individuals, Alison noticed the accuracy of the term when describing her and her father.

For example,**** her father loved flowers and gardening, an activity typically associated with femininity. He would spend his time cultivating a variety of plants. Alison later compared this to his inclination towards cultivating his relationships with young men. Alison, on the other hand, hated flowers and preferred playing sports with her male cousins, an activity typically associated with masculinity.**** In fact, Alison wanted so badly to be masculine that she once tried to convince her brothers to call her Albert while they were out on a camping trip.

In another instance, she and her father were eating at a diner when a masculine-looking female truck driver entered the diner. Alison felt excited and envious seeing her. When her father noticed, he scornfully asked if Alison wanted to end up looking like her. Alison lied and said she didn’t, but the image of that woman stuck with her for years.

**Alison found herself intrigued by the female body where her father seemed disinterested.** On one camping trip, Alison’s father was given a risqué calendar. He didn’t even open the photo. Alison, on the other hand, sneaked a look and immediately felt shame for being interested in what was inside.

They did have one thing in common: they both enjoyed looking at masculine figures. **However, the reason for their enjoyment was different.** Her father wanted the masculine men. Alison wanted to _be_ masculine.

### A Double Life

**Alison’s father tried to live a double life: one in which he was the perfect family man, and another in which he followed his sexual predilections.** He would often take trips without Alison’s mother. He would bring his children and whatever boy was helping him with housework at the time.

For a while, this boy was Roy. He babysat the kids and helped Alison’s father with a variety of tasks. He accompanied them to the beach one year. After her father’s death, Alison found a photo of Roy taken during this trip by her father. In the photo, Roy is lying in bed wearing only his underwear. **At the time, Roy was 17.**

**She doesn’t blame her father for his behavior.** In fact, she wonders if she would have had the guts to be openly gay in the 1950s, or if she would have done exactly as her father had and made a life for herself pretending to be straight. Though discrimination against homosexuals still existed in the 80s, it was nothing compared to that of the 50s. For example, while she and her lesbian friends were once denied entrance to a bar because of their sexuality, the lesbians of the 50s had to deal with bar raids and cross-dressing rules.

> **Marcel Proust**
> 
> Marcel Proust was a critically-acclaimed French novelist active at the turn of the 20th century. Also, he was reported gay. **Like Alison’s father, Proust was obsessed with the beauty of flowers.**
> 
> In his book, _Remembrance of Things Past_(aka _In Search of Lost Time_), Proust describes a garden filled with beautiful flowers. When his narrator looks through the garden and sees a girl sitting within, he immediately falls in love with her. Alison suggests that his love wasn’t necessarily for the girl, but for her surroundings. Alison saw a similar trait in her father. **She believed that part of her father’s initial attraction to her mother developed because she lived on Christopher Street in New York City—an area known for its open LGBT community.**
