## Exercise: Reflect on the Games You May Play

Identify a game you’ve played (or experienced secondhand) and figure out how to overcome it.

* * *

Think back to a significant relationship in your life, like with a parent or past romantic partner. With the basic pattern in mind, can you recognize any games that you and the other played?

What stance do you think that you played from? Try to describe the deeply rooted belief, and reflect on what specifics in your life might’ve led you to play that game.

With a game in mind, consider how you might overcome that pattern. Remember Berne’s method: Find a pattern-breaking maneuver, and be cognizant of what would work for you specifically.
