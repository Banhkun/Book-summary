## Part 4.2: How Games Work

Now that we’ve defined games and looked at Berne’s categories, let’s clarify how they work. To clear up Berne’s clinical jargon, we’ve distilled out the basic pattern that games follow. Below we’ll explore their main characteristics.

#### You Play a Game From a “Position”

As we covered in our section on pastimes, a “position” is an unconscious, deeply held belief. If you hold the belief that “life is basically pointless,” you’ll behave in ways that reflect that belief, according to Berne. (Again, we’ll call these _stances_.)

You play any game in accord with such an underlying belief. It gives rise to a hidden motive, and that causes you to seek situations that reinforce the belief.

For example, the above belief might yield a game where Player A is always apathetic or depressed. A family member or friend tries to cheer him up, but Player A cynically refuses—“Don’t bother trying; are you even happy yourself?” His stagnant energy makes those around him less cheerful, “proving” to himself that “life is pointless, no one is happy anyway.”

(Shortform note: Dysfunctional relationship habits don’t necessarily come from just beliefs. For example, Mr. Vesuvius’ angry outbursts may come from brain trauma earlier in life. Berne also doesn’t account for the fact that genetic influences often underlie addictive patterns. All the same, the best way forward is often to focus on what we can control. When something is out of our control, like a genetic susceptibility to mental illness, our options are internal: Embrace your life’s difficulties, develop resilience, and be resourceful—which may mean reshaping your psychology despite physiological problems like, for example, repeated concussions from long years of football.)

#### The Basic Pattern of a Game

Though Berne doesn’t make it clear, we can infer that the basic pattern of a game goes as follows:

  * Player A holds some unconscious belief, and it gives them a hidden motive. Neither they nor the other players are aware of this motive. In general, the motive is to create an outcome that reinforces their belief.
  * Working from this belief, Player A tries to cause Player B to behave how they want. What A wants is for B to play into their game and prove their belief.
  * Player B typically responds by falling for the game. There may be some back-and-forth (remember deceptive exchanges), and B ends up proving A’s belief.
  * Player A now feels some kind of self-righteous validation. Their belief has been reinforced; A got the outcome they wanted.



On the other side, Player B plays their own game (remember that people play games that complement one another). A’s game also works to prove B’s, such that game players often help each other to keep playing.

Say Player A is complaining about an annoying coworker to gain validation, and Player B flares up—“God, can’t you stop being so negative for one day?” Here, Player A’s game of “I Can’t Believe Them” complements Player B’s game of “Toxic Positivity”; they mutually enable each other.

##### “It’s Just Too Hard”

Let’s illustrate the basic pattern with a simple game. “It’s Just Too Hard” occurs when Player A doesn’t want to do anything effortful, so he manipulates Player B into relieving him of responsibility.

Player A’s motivating force: an unconscious belief like, “I’m entitled to avoid responsibility.” The game goes like this:

  * Player B (typically A’s partner) asks Player A to perform some responsibility, like doing the laundry. Reluctantly he does so but does a shoddy job. 
  * Player B returns and notices that A did a poor job—her whites have been ruined because A didn’t separate out the darks. 
  * Angry, B confronts A about this. A argues that he doesn’t really know how to do laundry, so she shouldn’t have asked him. She should just do it herself.
  * With no good alternative, B relieves A of the responsibility. She’ll do it herself, because he can’t be relied on.
  * Player A has succeeded in avoiding responsibility, reinforcing his stance. Unconsciously, he now feels even more entitled.



(Shortform note: This is a real pattern that many women report experiencing (not just with laundry), called “weaponized incompetence.” In short, some men seem to underperform when asked to handle chores, like babysitting the kids, so that the woman has to take back the responsibility in order to ensure that the work is done properly. Berne’s model effectively describes the pattern (as above,) which speaks well of this part of his theory. However, note that it’s not clear whether weaponized incompetence is conscious or unconscious. It’s a gray area and likely varies from situation to situation. Berne held that games are unconscious, but it’s worth noting that he didn’t provide any empirical studies to support that assertion.)

#### Games and Ego States

Berne doesn’t directly state how ego states factor into games, so we’ve worked out a few connections to clear things up.

  * You play a game from a stance, so that belief is at play in the game.
  * Berne says that stances form in childhood, which is when both the child and the parent form. So it’s likely that we play games from those two states. 
  * Therefore games aren’t typically played from the adult ego state. Berne acknowledges that there are conscious, intentional games—like racketeering—but this book isn’t about those.



Earlier on Berne suggests that you “grow up” by getting your adult state into primary control, and throughout the “thesaurus of games” he describes games as coming from the child or parent. The above logic is possibly how he meant it, then.

Looking at these states is a way of breaking a game down, and making sense by looking at its parts:

  * If you notice that an interaction is composed of deceptive exchanges, you’ve found a game. Then you can look at how the participant’s states interact on the _surface level_ and the _psychological level_ : What appears to be going on, and what’s going on “under the hood”?
  * And if you can say, “oh, she’s operating from her child,” then you’ve begun to locate the psychological issue that underpins the game. We’ll see later how this helps in dismantling your own games.



#### Our Games Reflect Our Unconscious Life Paths

We’ve discussed how games arise from our stances—deeply rooted beliefs about the world and our place in it. These give rise to our games, and **our games, Berne says, determine how we’ll make use of the opportunities life gives us**.

He doesn’t explain that assertion, so we’ve worked out the logic below:

  * Your games are often ways of handling unresolved emotional issues. For example, A learns to play the fool because it amuses others and assuages his anxiety.
  * You default to living through your games in any close relationship, Berne holds. They’re your habitual ways of handling your partner’s emotions, too. For example, say B learned to interrupt women and explain how “wrong” they are, regardless of the topic. 
  * Any game pattern of yours, like B’s above, will play a role in any relationship you have. In fact Berne says earlier that games form nearly all of your close social time.
  * Relationships are key to success in everything from romance to business, so your games will determine how those critical parts of your life unfold.



So, Berne says, **your particular life path unfolds according, in part, to your games. Left unchanged, your life unfolds according to your games.** Berne says they “fill in” time while we wait for life to end. In this view, life is a march toward some final payoff—the finale of your life’s script. He argues that depending on the character of your games—whether they’re productive or counterproductive—you’ll live optimistically or pessimistically.

(Shortform note: Earlier, we discussed scripts on a smaller scale: We all inherit programming that determines the basic scripts our games follow. The larger, compound script—the sum of all your smaller scripts—is your life path. He doesn’t go into detail in _Games People Play_ , but later transactional analysts developed scripts much further. The basic idea is that we form core beliefs about the world in early childhood, and those beliefs determine how we navigate our lives. Think of that person who never accepts help—“Nah, I can handle it myself”—and how extensively such a basic relational habit characterizes that person’s life: It pervades all their relationships, and that unwillingness to be vulnerable may prevent intimacy from developing.)

### Games Serve Several Important Purposes

**Because real intimacy is either unavailable or too terrifying to us, Berne says, we spend most of the time in our serious relationships playing games.**

He argues that despite the negative aspects of games, they provide important benefits. They’re also a normal phase of psychological development—we all learn to play games, and growing past them is like a sapling becoming an oak.

Below, we’ve broken down the main advantages that games provide.

#### Games Keep Us in Balance

As we discussed earlier, **we all need social recognition to remain healthy. Playing games gets us that, because games are social.** Remember that any amount of social contact is better than none at all—it’s a biological concern. And so games maintain our baseline health even though they don’t support higher well-being.

Similarly, each time a game confirms one of your stances, it stabilizes your belief system. This confirmation helps you feel secure in who you are and how you relate to the world, Berne says.

(Shortform note: The implied argument here is that someone in solitary confinement would do worse than someone in an abusive relationship. There are caveats that Berne doesn’t mention: Solitary confinement may predictably drive you crazy, but abuse can escalate rapidly. Verbal abuse may suddenly become physical; a slap can become a gunshot. So when it comes to abusive situations, games may keep you alive _in theory_ , but real life is more complex than that. Further, a healthy degree of solitude can help you clear your mind, enrich your inner life, and work through tough problems without distraction.)

For psychologically unstable individuals, Berne states, the belief-stabilizing function of games is often essential to maintaining their sanity. If such an individual’s game is broken up, they may experience a serious existential crisis.

Say Player A believes that “All others _must_ show me respect.” One day, his kid steps out of bounds and A blows up on them. But the kid unexpectedly holds her ground, which challenges Player A’s whole self-image. Lacking the capacity to process this, A may “short-circuit” psychologically.

Because of this risk, Berne says, **always consider how stable you or another is before you try to break any games**.

> **Narcissism May Exemplify Unstable Game-Playing**
> 
> Many of those who display narcissism demonstrate Berne's warning about unstable individuals. Narcissists are prone to fits of rage, which often trigger when those close to them threaten the narcissist’s inflexible, fragile sense of self.
> 
> Some research has found that “vulnerable” narcissists lack much resilience, which seems to support Berne’s assertion. Yet the same study found that “grandiose” narcissism correlates positively with resilience, leading to greater mental toughness in people with an inflated sense of superiority.
> 
> A third variety, histrionic narcissism, seems to fit the bill. Histrionic narcissists are prone to rage and intense emotional drama, mainly when they feel they aren’t receiving the attention and validation they want. Berne might say: By denying them that stroking, you’ve threatened their fragile self-image and destabilized their existence.

#### Games Keep You in the Comfort Zone

Your games are habits: They’re second-nature patterns that you default to using. Developing beyond existing habits is typically uncomfortable, requiring both psychological and behavioral growth. **Games provide just enough satisfaction to keep us happy, so many never try to grow past them**.

For example, if you play “It’s Just Too Hard,” you may consistently avoid taking necessary steps in your personal development. Each time your game confirms that “It’s just too hard,” you get more comfortable with settling, and the discomfort of growth becomes even less appealing. This is an inner benefit of games: They keep you from having to live effortfully.

Games also help you avoid the external, real-world experiences that, according to Berne, you’re unconsciously afraid of. For example, “It’s Just Too Hard” might help you avoid developing some new skill—like practicing public speaking on-stage.

(Shortform note: Positive Psychology discusses how leaving the comfort zone is essential to growth, lending support to Berne’s implication that games generally keep us stagnant. On the other hand, our comfort zones are where we rejuvenate and relax. The key is to balance it: Push your limits, then rest, and gradually expand your capacities. In _The Art of Learning_ , Josh Waitzkin argues for an incremental approach to growth, as above. Just as you can overdo physical exercise and injure yourself, you might also cause yourself undue anxiety if you’re overly focused on changing. Healthy growth, Waitzkin argues, comes from a foundation of psychological well-being, which you can find by practicing acceptance of your emotions.)

#### Playing Games Structures Our Close Relationships

Your games substitute for real intimacy, Berne states. **Most of us either can’t handle intimacy or have no opportunities to experience it. So instead, we play games**. They’re rewarding enough to maintain our baseline health, even if they aren’t as fulfilling as intimacy.

The games you play in your closer relationships also give extra “advantages” in your casual relationships. Berne says that “Let’s You and Him Fight,” where a woman causes two men to fight over her, gives her two advantages. First, she gets to feel desirable. Second, she gets to chat about it with her friends—and that small talk is a secondary benefit of the game.

(Shortform note: While Berne doesn’t explain this in _Games People Play_ , outside sources describe his forms of social time—withdrawal, rituals, small talk, activities, games, and intimacy—as choices for interaction along a spectrum of intensity. When you’re less familiar with someone, you’ll order that social time with pastimes. When you’re more comfortable with someone, you may start to relate to them through activities. Games come into play as our main way of structuring our close relationships. Further along lies intimacy, which corresponds strongly with personal need fulfillment. This seems to indirectly corroborate Berne’s intuition that games constitute a lesser form of relationship.)
