## Part 4.3: How to Identify and Overcome Unhealthy Games

Now that we’ve explored the what, why, and how of games, let’s look at how T.A. can help you to identify and overcome them. Berne wrote mainly for clinicians, so this section of the book is highly analytical. We’ve extracted the principles and reframed them to be useful for your own personal growth efforts.

We’ll first look at where games come from, then at how to identify them. Once you can spot games, we’ll illustrate Berne’s approach to growing beyond them.

#### Games Originate in Childhood

There’s limited evidence for the origin of games, Berne says. However, he argues that games are passed down from parents to their children. This is usually unconscious. Most parents consciously teach operations, rituals, and small talk (for example, table manners), but children naturally absorb games, whether they know it or not.

According to Berne, **a family’s games are the emotional environment they create**. In other words, there are “currents” or patterns of emotion that repeat in a given household. These are the emotions of their games—think of Mr. Vesuvius, or similar narcissistic parental archetypes.

A child then picks up on how her family expresses emotions. She learns to play the same games by unconsciously imitating her parents, Berne says. Then, children start to deliberately initiate games in order to learn how they work. Little Vesuvius blows up at her brother, experiences the payoff, and thus learns the game.

By the time we’ve grown up, most of us have forgotten the games we learned to play. But because they come from childhood, Berne argues, we should consider the games we played as children to better understand the games we play as adults.

(Shortform note: Children do learn from what we do, and not just what we say. But it’s possible to raise emotionally intelligent kids—it boils down to being an emotionally mature parent, so that your kids model on that effective behavior. If a kid grows up in a game-free family, then perhaps they can skip games altogether. Yet most of us didn’t have that experience, and in that case, Family Systems Therapy can help. FST helps family members to express feelings, uncover old traumas, and heal from unhealthy coping mechanisms. This is an established, evidence-based approach to changing old patterns of thought and feeling that, if ignored, will continue to influence your behavior.)

#### How to Identify a Game

Berne writes that at his time, mostly destructive games were well-understood. People with more constructive games didn’t go to therapy, and there were still plenty of games that hadn’t been identified. He describes how to spot them—below, we’ve condensed and clarified his steps:

**Step #1:** Identify whether some social habit (yours or another’s) seems to fit the pattern of a game. Is there a concealed motive in play? Are the exchanges deceptive? Is there some dramatic ending, or a self-validating outcome?

**Step #2:** When you think you’ve found a game, test it by trying to break it. According to Berne, attempting to break a game pattern results in significant resistance. So if you notice substantial emotional resistance in you or the other person, you’ve likely found a game.

**Step #3:** If you want to better establish the pattern, look for more real-world examples of the same game. The more examples you find, the more evidence you have that the game really exists. Then, you can use Berne’s analytical framework to describe the game’s characteristics.

(Shortform note: Berne’s method here is fairly empirical: Find a pattern, test if it fits known characteristics of games, then gather evidence. But note that we’re all subject to patternicity, a cognitive bias where we tend to interpret information according to models we’ve already got in our heads. This tendency is widespread—for example, in _Black Box Thinking_ , author Matthew Syed recounts an interaction between __ the philosopher Karl Popper and the psychologist Alfred Adler (theorizer of inferiority and superiority complexes): Popper states that Adler confidently applied his theories to a child he had never met. While the model may have fit, Syed argues that to honestly develop a theory, you have to look for where it falls short. That failure clarifies the limits of the theory, offering the opportunity to improve it. Otherwise, it remains stagnant.)

#### Overcome Unhealthy Games by Disrupting the Pattern

Once you’ve identified a game, there’s one real key to overcoming it. **A game is a pattern, so you need an effective pattern-breaking maneuver.**

In Berne’s language, this is the “antithesis” (we’ll call it the _solution_), and it’s essentially an intentional use of disruptive exchanges. Games are reciprocal—the players go back and forth along the expected path of the game. So if you disrupt that sequence, you can break off the game’s flow. Below we’ve identified the characteristics of an effective solution:

**#1:** **An effective solution is tailored to the specific situation**. Games are general patterns, but every specific situation is distinct. You need to create a disruption that fits the game and the person playing it. A direct call-out might work for someone less invested in their game, while Mr. Vesuvius might need a calm, patient pointing-out of his pattern.

**#2: An effective solution disrupts communication _from_ the adult state. **Many solutions work by refusing to communicate from the ego state the player games from, instead speaking from the adult state. The players are often taken off-guard by this fair treatment.

Imagine you’re in a heated argument with your significant other when they suddenly pivot: “Hey, hold on. We’re getting nowhere like this, and I’d rather develop a compromise with you than fight. I’ll listen first—please go ahead.” Chances are, their rational mode would positively influence you, because…

**#3: …An effective solution snaps the player _back into_ their adult state**, Berne suggests. Back in that rational state of mind, it’s easier to see that you’ve behaved unconstructively. Berne notes that many of his patients experienced sudden relief, even laughter, after he broke their patterns.

(Shortform note: Berne gives a fairly shallow explanation of some solutions, saying for multiple tough games, like “Alcoholic,” that people need “preparation” (he doesn’t explain this) before receiving his antithesis. Some criticize Berne for failing to flesh out his solution methodology. His solutions address one aspect of a problem—psychological blockages—but don’t handle others, like the various neurological damages that can affect behavior. For example, significant brain trauma can lead to poor anger-management skills later in life, and that’s a physiological issue that can’t be treated by T.A. alone.)

**#4:** **An effective solution has finesse**. Bluntly confronting people’s games isn’t often the most effective approach. Instead, try to thread the needle. People’s emotions can be volatile when they’re playing games, so you need to be precise and mindful of triggers—your own and others.

This is especially true if you’re trying to help someone else end a game. Remember that some games keep their players psychologically stable. Berne states that you need to adequately “prepare” these people, but he doesn’t say how to do so. He seems to mean that less stable people need gentle therapy that builds up toward the pattern-breaker.

> **Break the Pattern or Slow It Down?**
> 
> Tony Robbins discusses a similar pattern-breaking method in Awaken the Giant Within, arguing that to successfully change your behavior, you first need to disrupt the old pattern. But his solutions _are_ often blunt—like mocking a man’s shoes to try to cure his suicidal thoughts. Some say that Robbin’s claims lack empirical support (and pose ethical issues,) but the parallel with Berne’s “antithesis” suggests that pattern-breaking techniques aren’t without merit—you just need to do it with care.
> 
> Let’s contrast this with the mindfulness-based approach to habit breaking, with the following model: A habit is a feedback loop, where completion of the behavior results in a reward that reinforces the loop. Imagine this loop as a whirlpool in a backyard pool. The more you push the water in one direction, the more momentum it gains. When we’re trying to change existing habits, it’s like trying to change the flow of all that momentum.
> 
> Berne’s and Robbins’s strategies are to disrupt the flow: Berne by confronting it with some degree of finesse, and redirecting it; Robbins’s by charging it head-on and breaking it up (one of his techniques involves “scrambling” old thoughts and feelings.) In contrast, the mindful approach is to sit with the flow of the water, not pushing it along, until it naturally slows from lack of reinforcement.
> 
> Each of these has its own strengths and weaknesses—Robbins’s technique might be faster than mindfulness, for example. In the end, what matters is to try them out, and keep what works while leaving what doesn’t. As Berne recommends, use strategies that work for you, considering your own history—which could mean that his methods aren’t right for you, or any given person.

Here are a couple of examples of pattern-breaking solutions:

**“Schlemiel”** is**** one of Berne’s chief examples. He describes the game and solution as follows:

  * Player A is a clumsy guest who seems to inadvertently spill things and damage the host’s property. A actually derives satisfaction from this. They believe “I am blameless,” and they want to get away with childlike behavior. Player B is the host.
  * When A causes a mess, they look to be forgiven. B must contain their anger and forgive them. On the surface, they must excuse “genuine” accidents to save face. On the psychological level, A’s child enjoys getting away with it. B’s forgiveness reinforces A’s belief and game.
  * **Solution** : To break the pattern, Player B must refuse to excuse A’s destructive behavior. B should directly call out the false accidents: “Go ahead and ruin my couch, spill on my carpet—just don’t pretend it’s an accident.”
  * A few things can happen next. If A adheres stubbornly to their game, Player B may make an enemy. Or, A may suddenly snap into awareness of their game. They shift from child to adult and genuinely apologize. 



(Shortform note: Note that the psychological community doesn’t recognize “Schlemiel” as a real psychopathology, and RationalWiki calls Berne’s classification of such games “arbitrary” and “lacking in empirical evidence.” While these are valid perspectives, we can still acknowledge Berne’s ideas as _helpful_ without being watertight truth. In this sense T.A. is more a conceptual framework, and less a proven reality—and the same goes for Berne’s solutions.)

**“See What You Made Me Do”** is another of Berne’s games. Player A is solitary and prone to snapping, and the other players are his family members. Berne describes it like this:

  * Player A often seeks solitude to do hobby or craft work. A family member comes to ask him something. His focus slips; he makes a mistake—a stray paint stroke ruins his work.
  * He now feels justified in shouting at that family member, “Look what you caused!” He blames the other, reinforcing his game and belief that “I am faultless; others are flawed.”
  * **Solution** : To break this pattern, you simply leave Player A alone. By declining to interact with him while he’s prone to shouting, Berne implies, you don’t give him the opportunity to play the game. 



(Shortform note: In this particular example, leaving Player A alone may lead to synaptic pruning: If he never uses that habit, the neurons may atrophy, and his behavior may actually change. But in most cases, Berne’s solutions don’t address the neural aspect of growth, like how substance abuse in young people can damage the brain’s myelin processes, making it harder to develop new habits (to be fair, neuroscience was young in the 1960s.) This is a major criticism of Berne: He didn’t develop a technique that created lasting change in the patient’s script or games. It’s possible the “script” metaphor had him thinking that you just need to rewrite childhood beliefs—but you can’t just “flip the script,” all in one go. Forming new habits, and changing your psychology, takes a long-term commitment to positive growth.)

### How to Analyze Games

We’ve seen now what games are, why they matter, and how they work. We’ve described how to overcome games with pattern-breaking maneuvers. Now, we’ll put it all together with an in-depth illustration of one game—“Good Vibes Only.”

After a description of the game, we’ll break it down with Berne’s analytical framework. This allows us to look more specifically at each aspect of the game, and we’ll also comment where Berne’s ideas have fallen out of date.

First, note that Berne describes two forms of game analysis:

**1\. Practical Game Analysis** addresses one specific instance of a game. You first identify the game as a general pattern and then gather specific background knowledge about the individuals involved. This enables you to assess the specific situation and tailor-make an appropriate solution.

You might know someone who plays “Wasn’t Me” (they won’t own up to the messes they make). If you don’t know their personal history, though, you can’t really understand their specific version of it.

(Shortform note: Keep in mind that Berne’s method is distinct from game theory, which considers how fully rational agents would act in pre-defined arenas. A classic example is the prisoner’s dilemma, wherein an interrogator incentivizes each of two criminals to confess (they’ll go free,) condemning the other to a long sentence. If both confess, both get sentenced; if neither do, they stymie the prosecutor. T.A., on the other hand, deals with non-rational agents—games in Berne’s sense are driven by emotion, not reason. And some argue that mathematical game theory is useless, because it deals with pure theory—logic-based analyses that depend on the theorist’s predefined premises. Berne, on the other hand, took on the messy challenge of describing complex, real-world phenomena. As he put it, the games T.A. deals with are “more real.”)

**2\. Theoretical Game Analysis** distills many instances of a game into a generalized pattern. According to Berne, you can use that model to identify a game all across the world, regardless of culture. However, Berne states that he didn’t study games across cultures, calling that a job for sociology.

(Shortform note: Berne’s Theoretical Game Analysis seeks to generalize game patterns and apply them all across the world—which can seem implausible, given the huge diversity of behaviors and lifestyles across cultures. But consider the notion of human universals, cultural traits that appear across the world. Donald Brown, an American anthropologist, originally proposed 67 universals, ranging from music-making to healing, burial rituals, and the notion of history. Many of these are more elemental (conflict, mediation, courtship rituals) than Berne’s games, but they may support the existence of common behavioral patterns across cultures. All the same, the modern ITAA seems not to have an updated list of games, global or not.)

### Shortform Example: “Good Vibes Only”

#### Describing the Game

“Good Vibes Only” is a variant of “Toxic Positivity.”

Player A is a regular guy who believes something like “Negativity is awful; just be positive!” He’s typically pretty happy, though the inevitable emotional lows throw him off.

Someone close to A, like a child or partner, struggles with depression. This is Player B. Player A and Player B live together, so A is often exposed to B’s low, heavy emotions.

He doesn’t much like this. A often gets frustrated with B, who tends to “kill his vibe.” But A is at heart a good person and wants to help B to be more positive. His motives conflict: A tries to help but gets frustrated with B’s persistent gloominess. A is impatient; he wants B better _now_.

This tends to worsen B’s situation. B doesn’t need quick-fix solutions; she needs empathy and patience. B gets upset when A tries to force her to “just be positive,” and they fight each time. Then they storm off in opposite directions, and A broods—“God, I hate how negative she is. Why can’t she just be happy?” At the same time, B feels even more alone.

Their fighting confirms A’s belief—negativity brings bad experiences—and reinforces his game. He’ll soon be back at it.

#### Analyzing the Game

With the game laid out, let’s break it down. Berne lists several items to analyze, which we’ve condensed into two phases—description and solution—for clarity. We’ll briefly explain each, then show where it applies to the game.

##### Describing the Game

**The Description:** First, describe the game in detail. Lay out the series of events and include any details you know of the player’s histories (trauma, parental influences, etc.). If it’s your game, try to view yourself objectively, taking time to reflect on your own psychological history.

Feel free to glance back at our description above to pick out how the game unfolds. Note also the specifics we’ve included about each player’s psychology.

**The Purpose:** Next, consider the player’s purpose: Why do they (or you) play this game? While the general aim of a game is to validate your beliefs, that validation has a specific character—vindication, reassurance, righteous triumph, and so on.

Berne doesn’t detail where these come from, but we can infer that they depend on how the player enacts their belief. In “Good Vibes Only” as above, Player A denies his own negative emotions. He’s actually very anxious, so he acts on the belief “Negativity is awful; just be positive!” in an impatient, fearful way. He seeks reassurance—that he’s right, that he’s OK.

**The Characters:** Now describe the characters required for the game. Remember that you play from a belief, and you enact that belief in a certain way. Each game requires certain “acts” in order to work. For example, “Alcoholic” is played with the Drunk, the Dealer, the Rescuer, and often an Antagonizer.

“Good Vibes Only” calls for a Gray Knight and a Depressive—respectively, Player A and Player B. A Gray Knight is someone who embodies the saying, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” A Depressive is an emotionally depleted individual, who’s usually difficult to help.

(Shortform note: Berne’s “roles” (above _characters_) have since been expanded by Bernd Schmid, a prominent figure in the European Association for Transactional Analysis (EATA). He holds that an individual is composed of their full range of roles. In other words, you are the sum of the many hats you wear—stressed-but-caring partner, ambitious freelancer, reliable friend, coffee evangelist, and so on. This is much like the theory of subpersonalities advanced by Jon Rowan, which states that distinct aspects of your personality come online to deal with different situations, like a social confrontation or when meeting someone new. Lastly, we might connect this to the idea that consciousness is an emergent phenomenon: It arises out of the complex interconnection of many parts—like your experience of being a “self” arises from many subpersonalities seamlessly interacting.)

**The Steps:** Several moves compose a game, and we can generalize these from enough samples. Berne says that each move provides recognition: Each is an exchange. He describes the moves in general terms, as below. These help you to identify the general pattern.

  * B’s low moods irritate A—Provocation
  * A offers some “cure” to B—Quick-Fix Offering
  * B refuses, or fails to rapidly get better—Noncompliance, or Failure to Heal
  * A gets frustrated, and tries to force the issue—Frustration
  * B gets upset, and they fight—Confrontation
  * Both split off, each to brood in their own way—Disengagement.



**Examples:** Many games originate in childhood, and finding the childhood form often helps to make sense of the adult game. “Hypochondriac,” Berne shows, follows from a childhood habit of playing up little hurts to gain benefits.

##### Resolving the Game

**Interpretation:** To better understand your game, reflect on what early experiences you’ve had that may have led you to form an unhealthy belief. Here Berne makes reference to Freud’s psychosexual stages, describing games as coming from things like “phobic sources” or “penis envy,” but this style of interpretation isn’t widely used anymore.

Instead, try to recall the significant experiences from your childhood, and think through what could reasonably follow. For example, the adult player of “Good Vibes Only” may have had a parent who got upset whenever they weren’t happy. So as a child, they learned that forcing yourself to be positive is how you avoid uncomfortable emotions. Now, they impose that same belief on others.

**Benefits:** Often we keep playing games because they feel rewarding, albeit shallowly so. Find these rewards and you’ll be better equipped to stretch beyond the comfort zone the game provides. Maybe you feel validated when you argue with your partner, or get pleasure from telling people how wrong they are—whatever it is, note them down (and prepare to give them up).

“Good Vibes Only” rewards the player with a feeling of superiority—“I get it, why can’t she? All you gotta do is be positive!”

(Shortform note: Behavioral psychology also involves identifying a bad habit’s reward. But they don’t use antithesis: Instead, the common strategies are to punish your bad behaviors (if you scroll too much, you have to work for 15 minutes more a day) or remove their rewards (it means no phone for a day). Behavioral psychology also holds that you need to form a positively rewarding behavior to take the place of the old habit. Berne doesn’t address this point, and _Games People Play_ stops short of discussing how to form new, healthier relationship habits. In Attached, authors Amir Levine and Rachel Heller argue that the key to a healthy relationship is understanding your attachment style—secure, avoidant, or anxious—and learning to communicate openly and honestly, like a secure attacher.)

**Solutions:** While Berne states that you can only fully understand a game in the clinical situation, we can still solve our own games. Games on paper aren’t quite the real thing—a theoretical description of a game necessarily compresses it—so don’t forget to consider your unique life circumstances when crafting a solution.

If you learned to play “Good Vibes Only” as a way to keep a parent happy, you might consider whether you’ve repressed your own negative emotions. A good solution could then be to show yourself that you don’t actually feel positive all the time, contradicting the belief and opening you up to a fuller experience of your own emotions.
