## Part 1: Introduction to Transactional Analysis

_Games People Play_ is about the many ways that we habitually relate to one another. **It describes Transactional Analysis (T.A.), Dr. Eric Berne’s approach to understanding social interaction** , and it shows how T.A. makes sense of everything from our ritual greetings to our unconscious social games.

In pioneering T.A., Berne broke from the established psychoanalytic methods of the time to pursue a theory of social psychology. He held an MD from McGill University, interned at Yale University School of Medicine, and spent over 15 years in psychiatric training.

Berne’s theory is a lens through which to look at our social habits. Among other things, it reveals the nature of the unhealthy patterns we enact in our relationships and lives. With the “games” framing, we can learn to identify and move beyond these destructive habits. We can take meaningful steps toward lives of greater intimacy and maturity.

_Games People Play_ was Berne’s breakaway 1964 bestseller, popular despite having been written mainly for other clinicians. It spent over two years on the New York Times bestseller list, and he followed it up with _What Do You Say After You Say Hello_ and _Sex in Human Loving_ before his death in 1970.

Transactional Analysis is fairly technical, so we’ve distilled it to the essentials. This guide provides mental models that will equip you to better understand and navigate how you relate to others. We also contextualize Berne’s ideas with contemporary updates to the science and introduce new examples where his have fallen out of date.

We’ve structured the guide as follows:

  * Part 1 breaks down Berne’s account of the forces that drive us to interact with one another. 
  * Part 2 looks at the exchanges that compose those interactions. 
  * Part 3 covers three simple forms of interaction—procedures, rituals, and pastimes.
  * Part 4 goes in-depth on games. 
  * Part 5 fleshes out Berne’s ideas on life beyond games and compares them to contemporary perspectives.



### A Brief Overview of Transactional Analysis

Think back to a romantic partner you’ve had, back to the patterns you fell into with each other. The relationship probably featured both healthy and unhealthy habits—you probably laughed, loved, and learned; you may have hurt, deceived, or let one another down.

These relationships, and the habits that compose them, are where games take place. But before we get to that, let’s sketch an overview of T.A. Berne’s approach was to study social interaction, and he often treated one or both partners in close relationships (though his theory goes beyond intimate relationships, too.)

**Your social habits, Berne noticed, offer hints about less-obvious parts of you.** Delving into them, analyzing what’s going on beneath the surface, was how Berne sought to identify and heal harmful underlying beliefs and the behaviors they fueled.

(Shortform note: Berne’s theory depends on the idea that unconscious thoughts and feelings influence our behavior. This is a direct borrowing from Sigmund Freud, whose influence is evident in the core ideas of T.A.—for example, Berne’s theory of personality has three parts (child, adult, parent) that seem to parallel Freud’s own three-part model (Id, Ego, Superego.) We’ll point out these connections throughout the guide.)

At its most basic, **Transactional Analysis rests on the idea that humans need _recognition_ from one another**—what Berne calls “stroking.” For example, when you greet your friend—“Hey there! / G’morning!”—you’re exchanging strokes. This is a primary benefit of relationships.

The above interaction is one “transaction,” or _exchange_ —a reciprocal social recognition. If you keep chatting with your friend, each additional back-and-forth is another exchange.

Depending on your state of mind, your interactions change in nature. Going back to that romantic partner, you’ve probably had an experience where you made some silly mistake, and your partner reprimanded you (we all get stressed out and overreact at times).

In Berne’s framework, talking down to someone means acting as a parent scolding a child, and a distinct aspect of your personality is in play. Berne gives three states—parent, child, and adult—and uses them to distinguish healthy interactions from unhealthy ones. We’ll go into all of this in detail later in this section.

> **The Early Years of Transactional Analysis**
> 
> Berne began developing the ideas that would become Transactional Analysis as early as 1949, in a series of six articles on intuition. “Stroke” and “Transaction” are two of the many terms Berne coined for this effort, and “Transactional Analysis” arose in the late 1950s.
> 
> In 1956, the San Francisco Psychoanalytic Institute formally rejected Berne’s effort to gain membership. This may have been because Berne’s ideas had begun to conflict with psychoanalytic theory, which sprung from the work of Sigmund Freud. That “stroking,” or recognition, is such a pivotal concept for Berne highlights how different his approach became: He began with the centrality of social life and relationships, while Freud prioritized the individual.
> 
> However it happened, that rejection led to Berne’s pioneering of Transactional Analysis, which otherwise might not have come to be. His 1950s seminar group developed the term, and that group evolved into the ITAA by 1964. While the psychoanalytical community still rejects T.A., the ITAA puts Berne’s idea into practice in business, counseling, and educational settings.

#### Transactional Analysis Underpins the Discussion of Games

Games are just one kind of interaction within Berne’s framework. They’re the focus of _Games People Play_ because they factor heavily into our close relationships and because many games can be destructive.****

Berne was a psychiatrist, so his chief concern was to heal his patients. Much of T.A. is about identifying and overcoming the sorts of unhealthy relationship habits that, for example, a young married couple might struggle with. It’s also useful for personal development, because it can help you see and change your own negative social habits.

**Real, authentic social living lies beyond games in what Berne calls _intimacy._** Intimacy is difficult for many people, he says, accessible only when we grow past our games. But games are a shallow substitute for intimacy, so it’s well worth the effort to outgrow them.

(Shortform note: As you read, keep in mind that older theories in psychology tended to over-pathologize human behavior, which isn’t always productive. Berne displays this tendency: Some of his interpretations of games feel distorted to fit his perspective, and others we would now recognize as issues with complex causes. For example, addiction has both a psychological component, like childhood trauma or low self-esteem, and a physiological component—the body becomes dependent on the substance you take. Berne seems to say that addiction is just a psychological problem, and doesn’t address its physiological aspects.)

### Our Hunger for “Strokes” Is at the Root of Social Interaction

Now that we’ve sketched an overview, let’s look at Berne’s account of the origins of social interaction.

He argues that **social interaction arises from an underlying "hunger" for physical and social contact.** This hunger begins in infancy as a need for “strokes”—literal for the infant, metaphorical for the adult—and remains linked to our mental and physical well-being throughout life.

First, we'll trace this need from infancy to adulthood. We’ll then discuss how it leads to what Berne calls “time structuring,” our mutual effort to fill our days with necessary social contact.

(Shortform note: Berne is known for using strict reductionism: He worked by breaking social behavior down to its (theoretically) smallest parts. Compare this to the holistic approach, originating in Gestalt psychology, which argues that you can only understand a whole by looking at how all of the parts go together. Combine the two and we reach a fuller perspective: Break an object down to its elements, then figure out how they relate. For example, you can’t understand a car motor by looking at its parts in isolation—you also have to figure out how they go together. Now do the same for the psyche: Identify its smallest elements, then explore how they compose the larger structure and its functions)

#### Infants Depend on Sustained Physical Contact

As infants, we need consistent physical attention from our mothers. Without sustained “stroking”—literal stroking, or head pats, peek-a-boo, and so on—infants don’t develop properly.

If an infant is neglected for long enough, her brainstem will experience nerve cell degradation. Without intervention this leads to death. So regular physical contact is a biological imperative for infants.

(Shortform note: Plenty of research confirms that infants need physical contact. It’s even been found that premature or otherwise unhealthy infants respond positively to light massage, suggesting that the nerve degradation Berne describes may be reversible. Going even further, varied stimulation like singing, playing games, laughing, and cuddling, has numerous benefits: They help the infant to develop early social and emotional competence and enhance their curiosity and appetite for learning. Even further, speaking and reading to babies can accelerate their language skills, leading to higher linguistic competence later in life.)

#### Adults Subsist on Social Recognition

Beyond infancy, our hunger for physical and social contact remains strong.

Unfortunately, Berne says, cultural conditioning discourages us from directly seeking a physical solution to this problem. As we age, we learn to make do with less intimate forms of recognition. By adulthood, the infant’s longing for her mother becomes a subtler need for simple social recognition—“Hi, how are you?” / “Good, thanks! You?”

Though we’ll no longer die from lack of touch, **social recognition (Berne’s “stroking”) remains vital to our well-being as adults**. Studies have shown that inmates who experience the prolonged social isolation of solitary confinement often develop physical and mental health issues. And even in laboratory settings, sensory deprivation can lead to temporary psychosis.

So, Berne infers, any kind of social interaction is better than none at all. This is why games still play a large role in our lives, despite often being unhealthy.

> **The Types of Strokes**
> 
> Beyond Berne’s work in _Games People Play,_ transactional analysts have delineated several different kinds of strokes. This can help us learn what kind of strokes, or recognition, we’re getting, and which we may need more of:
> 
>   * Do you get mainly _positive_ or _negative_ social contact?
> 
>   * Do you receive enough _unconditional_ support, or mainly _conditional_ recognition (“I love you no matter what” vs. “I love you because you validate me.”
> 
>   * Do you get mainly _verbal_ or _nonverbal_ strokes?
> 
> 

> 
> Interestingly, Gary Chapman’s book _The 5 Love Languages_ seems almost to extend right from Berne’s theory: Everyone needs strokes, Berne says; everyone needs a unique _kind_ of recognition, adds Chapman. Read our guide of The 5 Love Languages here to learn which styles of recognition you and your partner need: physical touch, words of affirmation, acts of service, quality time, or gift giving.

### We Work Together to Satisfy Our Shared Need for Recognition

Now that we’re grounded in this understanding of _why_ we interact socially, let’s look at what comes next: **Because we all need recognition, we build social interaction into our everyday lives**.

Berne argues that humans are naturally uncomfortable with inactivity, observing that when there’s little to do or nothing left to say, people get anxious. Imagine going on a first date where the conversation repeatedly fizzles out—few could stand the discomfort.

This malaise reflects our need for continual social contact: When the “strokes” stop flowing, we tend to get tense and uncomfortable. Berne argues that this discomfort is analogous to physical hunger, such that neglecting it is like starving.

Getting the needed recognition helps assuage our discomfort. So, Berne argues, we all unconsciously seek out interaction in order to stave off social starvation. And we all share this need, so our mutual seeking leads to everybody structuring their days around enough social interaction to stay “full.”

According to Berne, this is the point of social living: It helps us help each other with our need to be seen and heard, so that we all avoid emotional starvation.

(Shortform note: While Berne denotes both “recognition hunger” and “structure hunger” in _Games People Play_ , we can infer that the latter is an extension of the former. Berne doesn’t explicitly show that we hunger for _structure itself_ , but it’s plausible that structured interaction follows naturally from our hunger for social contact. Normal hunger for food is necessary for structured mealtimes, but we wouldn’t say that we _hunger for mealtime itself_. This is a case of “necessary but not sufficient”—hunger for social contact is necessary for structured interaction but doesn’t create it in and of itself.)

Consider your own immediate friend group. You likely have many shared interests and plenty of group-specific mannerisms. Berne calls these “pastimes” (for example, chatting about rock climbing gear) and rituals (like secret handshakes and inside jokes). These interactions, Berne would say, structure your days and fill you up with healthy social contact.

Without this social recognition, we’ll lapse into that social malaise—a hunger that can lead to physical and mental health issues.

(Shortform note: The Covid-19 pandemic effectively illustrates this dynamic. As the pandemic lingered longer than expected, many people began to experience depression and related mental health challenges—likely due to lengthy social isolation. Lacking much human contact, Berne would say, they experienced prolonged social hunger, which negatively impacted their health.)

> **Social Media as a Superficial Substitute for Real Relationships**
> 
> In Berne’s time, social media didn’t exist, and we weren’t yet staying up late to scroll feeds and talk with strangers online. If he were still around, Berne might notice that our rapid, always-there access to online socialization allows us to avoid our inactivity discomfort as much as we want.
> 
> But what if by stuffing ourselves with unfulfilling online interaction, we’re actually making ourselves less resilient to the discomfort we’re trying to avoid? Studies have found correlations between social media addiction, depression, and lack of resilience, while other research shows that close relationships contribute to emotional resilience. This suggests that online “strokes” are the emotional equivalent of potato chips, while real-life relationships are more like a well-balanced meal.
> 
> Again, Covid-19 illustrates this well—one study found that increased social media use during lockdown correlates with decreased mental health. But at the same time, the phenomenon of family Zoom calls led many to reconnect and bond. So it’s not necessarily screen time that’s unhealthy, but the kind of screen time. Scrolling Twitter is fundamentally distinct from family Zoom: In the former you sit and consume a deluge of unfocused information, and in the latter you have focused, face-to-face conversation—despite the screens between you.

### The "Three Ego States" Model of Personality

Let’s look now at Berne’s theory of personality. He proposes that three “ego states,” or distinct states of mind, compose the whole human personality. Consider how you might speak down to a friend who does something dumb. Here, Berne would say, you’re speaking from your “parent” state. The other two states are the adult and the child.

#### Defining Ego States

Let’s define these in more detail. Berne observes that people display different behaviors depending on the state of mind they’re in. That state of mind corresponds to a particular set of behaviors. For example, productivity habits correspond to the “adult” state of mind (that’s where rational behavior comes from, in Berne’s model). This pairing of mental state and behavioral repertoire is what Berne calls an “ego state.”

In our explanation below, we’ll use _P_ for “parent,” _A_ for “adult,” and _C_ for “child.”

(Shortform note: Berne proposed that each ego state corresponds to a network of neurons in the brain. This distinguishes him from Freud: Where Freud gave no proof for the Id, Ego, and Superego, Berne references the work of Wilder Penfield, a respected neurosurgeon. Penfield found that stimulating small areas of the brain caused patients to vividly relive past experiences, and he inferred that the brain records memory like a tape recorder. Berne took this model of memory and suggested that those “recordings” exist in three clusters—his “ego states.” So when inhabiting an ego state, you express its recordings of emotion and behavior. Penfield’s research doesn’t directly prove Berne’s theory, but it adds more credibility than Freud mustered.)

**Each ego state is an internally coherent system** : When you’re in mind state A, you’ll only perform behaviors from set A, Berne would say. When you’re in mind state P, you’ll act from set P of your behavioral habits, and so on.

For example, if you’re operating from the child state, you’ll likely joke around and engage in antics (the child’s forte is spontaneous emotion). In contrast, you’ll act more judgmentally when operating from the parent state (morals and values characterize the parent state.)

**Each ego state remains relatively segregated from the other two**. So if you’re in mind state C, it’s unlikely that you’ll act from behavioral set A. In Berne’s model, the adult, parent, and child don’t overlap.

Take the previous example again—when you’re in a playful mood, you probably won’t erupt in sudden anger. When angry, chances are you won’t want to sing or dance.

**Each ego state contributes unique strengths to a healthy personality**. Berne argues that each of the three states serves its own functions, and together they compose a complete personality. For example, the adult handles rational decisions, while the child provides spontaneity and excitement.

Let’s look more closely at where each state comes from and what they contribute to the personality.

##### Shortform Commentary: From Freud to Berne to Fodor

Berne’s ego states seem to parallel Freud’s tripartite model of the psyche. Freud held that the psyche (or personality) is composed of the Id (unconscious, animalistic urges), the Ego (the conscious mind), and the Superego (morality according to parental influences). Berne’s model is similar yet distinct, dividing the mind into three parts with discrete functions. In each section below, we’ll trace the parallels with Freud’s model, and note the differences.

Early psychologists’ idea to break down the mind into component parts also seems to precede the modular theory of the mind, first proposed by Jerry Fodor in 1983. The modular theory holds that the mind is made up of various “mental modules,” and they operate separately from each other (they call this _encapsulation_ ,) a phenomenon that Berne intuited with his notion of ego state segregation.

But the modular theory goes further: There are numerous proposed modules, with functions ranging from language processing (Wernicke’s area and Broca’s area) to visual processing. In addition, Fodor didn’t believe that modules were responsible for higher-level cognitive processes, like rational thought—which Berne attributes to the adult ego state. It’s also unclear whether beliefs affect mental modules à la Fodor. Take the Muller-Lyer illusion, below:

![gamespeopleplay-mullerlyer.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/gamespeopleplay-mullerlyer.jpg)

Even if you know that the lines are the same length, they still appear to be different. Based on this, theorists argue that beliefs do not affect mental modules. This differs from T.A., wherein a key stance is that beliefs underpin behaviors, thus are part of ego states. It’s possible that ego states are higher-level neural structures, while modules are lower level structures. The conscious “self” or personality could then emerge from lower-level neural functions.

#### The Adult

**Origin:** Each of us, Berne asserts, has a fully formed adult ego state within us—even when we’re still children. He observes that anyone, including children and the mentally ill, can act objectively under the right circumstances (though he doesn’t say what those are.)

**Functions:** The adult is your rational self. It activates when you need to act objectively. It generally corresponds to healthy, intellect-based adult functioning.

For example, the adult comes online when you need to do your taxes. Researching your deductions, calculating quarterly amounts to set aside, and budgeting monthly expenses are rational, objective operations. In Berne’s model, your adult does this work.

According to Berne, **the key to a healthy personality is to bring the adult into steady control**. As the source of reason, it can moderate the impulsive child and the often overbearing parent.

(Shortform note: Berne’s “adult” seems to parallel Freud’s Ego. Just as the Ego mediates between the Id and the Superego, the adult keeps the parent and child in line. Both also handle rational functions, like a cost-benefit analysis for an important business decision. Yet they differ in that Freud believed that “The Ego is not sharply separated from the Id; its lower portion merges into it...”—in other words, the Ego and the Id mix together. They interact like this: The Ego’s job is to fulfill the Id’s instinctual desires, like needs for food and sex, in a socially appropriate way. In contrast, Berne argues that the ego states _are_ sharply segregated from one another—the child might grab control from the adult, but they remain distinct entities.)

#### The Parent

**Origin:** As we grow up, we’re shaped by our cultures. Your parents, peers, and society pass down to you myriad ways of thinking, feeling, and acting—table manners, social etiquette, and so on. You inherit views on what’s good and bad, what you should and shouldn’t do; you learn a worldview and how to act in accord with it.

**This is where your parent ego state comes from: the influences of culture, tradition, and your own family elders**. You internalize them, and they become a part of you.

**Functions:** When you act from your inner parent, you behave as your parents would’ve. This part of your personality, Berne holds, knows how to raise a family. It also handles the routine aspects of life—like how you eat, how you spend free time, and how you work. You inherit all of these, and they’re habitual (read: automatic) by the time you’ve grown up.

Imagine that you’ve just adopted a puppy, and she pees on your shoes. Whether you scold her, comfort her, or try to discipline her, your habitual response comes from your parent state—from how your own parents would’ve acted.

Similarly, how you start your day, handle chores, and manage meals comes largely from your parents. So we’d say, “you’re acting from your parent” in those areas of life.

(Shortform note: Since Berne’s time, researchers have identified the phenomenon of automaticity—unconscious enacting of various habits. Berne seems to have anticipated this with his idea that the parent automates life routines. It’s true that children model heavily on their parents and other influences. All those inherited habits then become automatic through long repetition. Think—did you consciously develop your mannerisms, your way of carrying yourself—or did they just _happen_? It may be that we’re less aware of our default emotional habits than we’d like to think. After all, automaticity makes behaviors unconscious—so aspects of our personalities that we take for granted, like a passive attitude toward conflict, may actually be habits formed in early childhood.)

#### The Child

**Origin:** Each of us, Berne states, retains traits that we developed in childhood. These traits develop out of significant early experiences, like a best friendship or being bullied in school. Through such experiences, we form deep emotional impressions about how the world works. For example, we learn how to relate to authority or where we stand on the social ladder, and those early adaptations shape who we become.

Berne doesn’t mention any specific traits—they seem to vary depending on your unique experiences. For example, if you spent early childhood adventuring in the woods with your best friend, you’d probably develop a strong sense of independence and the ability to find your own path.

**Functions:** Berne states that the child is the source of your intuition and creativity. It can be impulsive, expressing spontaneous positive or negative emotion. He doesn’t go into more detail than this, except to say that **it’s the most valuable part of the personality**.

For example, when your favorite song gets you singing or dancing, or when you’re laughing at a joke only you get, that’s your child expressing itself. In contrast, your child may also lash out in fear when threatened. The child’s key trait is _spontaneity,_ regardless of the emotion expressed.

> **The Child and the Id**
> 
> Here again, Berne loosely follows Freud’s footsteps. Like Freud’s Id, the child is a source of unconscious drives, giving rise to all sorts of emotionally impulsive behaviors. And a child out of control can cause unconstructive behavior, just like the urge-driven Id.
> 
> However, they differ in that Berne takes a much more positive view of this largely unconscious, emotional aspect of the psyche. He sees the child as deeply valuable, giving us our creativity and love of life, whereas the Id is more like a blind, instinctual animal. In the elephant and rider metaphor, the Id is the elephant: A feeling-driven animal that seeks pleasure and avoids pain. But Berne’s child doesn’t fit that model—it’s more about _emotional expression_ , like spontaneous joy or anger, than animal needs.
> 
> (Related, our guide to Switch discusses strategies to leverage your emotional side—like envisioning tangible destinations and celebrating milestones—to reach success.)
> 
> **Early Experiences Shape Our Later Lives**
> 
> Recent research does support Berne’s claim that early experiences shape our adult personalities. Birth order, early emotional wounds, and poor adaptation to negative role models all carry over into our adult lives. Unless we address these, we can continue to operate from a damaged childhood mindset in our adult lives; much of Berne’s work was to find these dysfunctional adaptations and change them.
