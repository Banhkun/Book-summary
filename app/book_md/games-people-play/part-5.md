## Part 5: Learn to Grow Past Your Games

With our discussion of games complete, it’s time to look at what lies _beyond_ games.

In the final part of this guide, we’ll discuss the five brief chapters, which conclude Berne’s work. Each is relatively short, so we’ve opted to synthesize the main thrust of them into one part.

_Games People Play_ focuses on the games, but Berne also gestures beyond them. **Games are unhealthy and, Berne says, a shallow substitute for deeper human connection**. To transcend them, we must learn to show up with deep presence, express ourselves authentically, and embrace sincere relationships. Below, we’ll look at each of these in turn.

### After Games Comes Self-Sovereignty

Berne calls this advanced stage of personal development “autonomy,” and we’ll refer to it as self-sovereignty. It’s composed of three capacities, which together enable you to grow past game-playing. Beyond that compulsive drive, we can develop healthier connections with our emotions, understand and control our behavior, and live more fully.

> **Autonomy in Psychology and Philosophy**
> 
> Berne isn’t the first person to emphasize the importance of autonomy—it’s been an important concept for many thinkers throughout history.
> 
> In psychology, autonomy is one of self-determination theory’s core ingredients of intrinsic motivation. Edward Deci expanded earlier research, finding that autonomy, along with competence and relatedness, motivate us to do things for their own sake (intrinsic motivation). And when we lack autonomy, as when external pressures from work or relationships push on us, we tend to feel worse.
> 
> In philosophy, autonomy is a controversial topic. Thinkers such as Kant and John Stuart Mill used it to denote a sort of moral self-determination, while in political philosophy it’s an essential ingredient in how we conceive of our basic rights (if we aren’t autonomous, how can we enjoy liberty?).
> 
> Berne holds that autonomy is the highest form of psychological development, where you’re able to make free choices and live uninhibited by external pressures. This seems to reflect Kant, whose notion of autonomy was rational and fully self-willed.

As we grow up, parents and culture exert a heavy influence on us. According to Berne, this inhibits our natural ability to have honest, authentic relationships. Your parents teach you labels and categories for everything and teach you “proper” behavior, while education pushes you through a standard mold.

For example, Berne argues that children perceive raw reality—young eyes see a caterpillar without filters. But when your parents teach you, “That’s called a caterpillar, and that’s a butterfly,” they cloud your direct experience of the fullness of reality. In other words, concepts and judgments distort our perception.

Berne says that most adults have lost this capacity for direct awareness and need to recover it. He outlines it and two other elements that compose “autonomy” or self-sovereignty, and argues that **recovering these capacities leads to a more fulfilling experience of life**.

**Present Awareness** : This is the capacity to live in the here and now. To be aware is to see things directly, as they truly are and not how you were taught to see them. Cultivating presence gets you into a deeper relationship with your own direct experience, and Berne argues that you’re only as alive as you are present.

For example, say you’re working at your desk on a project report. If you’re worrying about the deadline, you’ve projected your mind off into the future. You’re somewhere other than your immediate experience. Berne would say that your partial presence means you’re only partially alive, since you aren’t genuinely there. Clear, present awareness is therefore an essential ingredient of a fuller life.

> Berne’s assertion that _you’re only as alive as you are present_ is provocative when combined with his notion of life scripts: The idea that we’re all acting out predetermined patterns, set way back in childhood. He seems to be saying that most people are hardly alive, if at all.
> 
> Yet this idea isn’t without merit. The researcher Samo Burja discusses “live” versus “dead” players—in short, some people or entities (like a government) are incapable of taking novel actions, while others are capable of doing so. In Berne’s terms, scripts rule some lives, but others have figured out how to live script-free. From a neural angle, we could say that existing, myelinated habits (like games) rule dead players, while live players are capable of carving new pathways. Insofar as mindful, present awareness is a powerful tool for habit change, Berne seems to be spot-on in this prescription.

**Freedom of Choice** : This is the capacity to express your genuine emotions and inclinations, uninhibited by parental and cultural conditioning. Berne calls this “spontaneity.” It means making the choices that are true to you, no longer doing what others think you should. When you break free of inherited ways of thinking, feeling, and acting, genuine self-expression becomes possible.

Consider the common phenomenon of corporate workers who realize, 20 years into their careers, that they never really wanted to do this. They wanted to write, or paint, or sail, or start their own business. Yet so many of us walk the “normal” paths because of how strongly culture conditions us. Breaking free of this, Berne argues, is a crucial step toward real self-sovereignty.

> Many of us in fact struggle with genuine self-expression, as Berne suggests. Yet according to positive psychology, it’s a critical aspect of personal development: Learning to express yourself authentically helps you to develop a well individuated personality, and learn about your own mind and values.
> 
> And at the same time, self-inhibition has been linked to addiction: An addiction develops when you suppress a need, like for a more intimate time with your partner, and replace that void with an easy, gratifying action, like binge eating or drug use. Berne’s stance is similar: Suppressing genuine self-expression perpetuates your games and, since games are positive feedback loops, this is almost a behavioral addiction.

**Sincere Connection** : This is the capacity to show up authentically in our relationships. Deeper, fuller connection becomes possible when you’re present and uninhibited. Berne calls this “intimacy,” and he believes that it’s the most rewarding form of interaction.

He argues that when you’re sincere, open, and present with someone, you’ll naturally feel affection toward them. Think of the raw, intimate experience of looking deeply into your partner’s eyes. Showing up like this, we make ourselves vulnerable. But when there are no games left to hide behind, a deeper, fuller connection starts to bloom.

> Berne characterizes intimacy as “the most perfect form of human living.” This sounds like Abraham Maslow’s notion of peak experiences, wherein you are fully, transcendentally immersed in the present moment. Yet it’s different in one key way: peak experiences are often yours alone, while intimacy requires another person. Our individualistic culture typically focuses on _personal_ achievement (we revere _personal_ development, and hardly think of _collective_ development).

ART International corroborates Berne’s view, having trained thousands to find more fulfilling relationships through authentic relating: A communication modality characterized by sincere self-expression and intimate connection—which Berne also held to be important. So, the idea that perfect living lies in _relationship_ isn’t so far-fetched—we are social animals, after all.

### Achieving Personal Sovereignty

Despite the weight of our parental and cultural conditioning, it’s fully possible to develop these capacities. Berne argues that because we have these capacities as children, we can always recover them. As children, we each decide how we’ll adapt to the influences of our parents and culture. Because this was (at some point) a conscious decision, Berne says, we can find it and reverse it.

For example, you may have had a parent who tried to determine your career path at a young age.__ Maybe they insisted you follow in their footsteps, or maybe that you become a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. That pressure inhibited your ability to choose for yourself, but you can return and undo the negative effects it had.

While Berne doesn’t say specifically how to undertake the necessary psychological and behavioral growth, he does give a sketch of the process. It’s possible, despite being a continual fight to overcome your prior conditioning. Below, we’ve distilled his recommendations into four steps.

**Step #1: Overcome parental influences.** First you have to identify and throw off the influence of culture and tradition. Often, the expectations of parents and society inhibit us from expressing who we really are. Consider modern-day Mormons, where children are born into a deeply traditional environment. A child who wants real autonomy needs to overcome the heavy influence of this immediate cultural background.

(Shortform note: In fact, Pew Research reports that 36% of Mormon-born people leave the faith, showing that it’s possible to overcome cultural conditioning. But Berne doesn’t address the counterargument: Oftentimes, strong community and meaningful connection to cultural roots are beneficial to personal well-being. Community connections can provide support when you’re struggling, give you purpose in the larger collective, and often share your values and beliefs. Berne is right that it’s important to seek a strong personal identity—if you don’t, you may experience low self-esteem, lack direction, and struggle to set boundaries—but that individuation shouldn’t cut you off entirely from community support.)

**Step #2: Shake off the expectations of others.** Berne doesn’t go into detail here, but we can infer that people who _aren’t_ trying to transcend their games weigh you down. So after addressing your cultural conditioning, shed the expectations of your immediate friends and acquaintances. Often, friends who don’t grow with you serve only to hinder your development.

For example, say you have a friend who’s always trash-talking her boss. She wants validation and encouragement, but giving it to her keeps you at that level. To grow beyond your _own_ games, you need to stop playing both yours and hers.

> **Social Circles Exert a “Network Effect,” Influencing Your Choices**
> 
> In contemporary self-help culture, it’s now a common notion that we need to leave behind people who don’t grow with us. Oftentimes, close friends can enable your bad habits, like drinking or being negative, because they do them too. Or as Berne would say, they enable you to keep playing your games.
> 
> Author and entrepreneur Jim Rohn famously said, “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” In other words, the people around us exert a large influence on who we become. And in fact, it’s not just the closest five: Research has found that second-degree (friend of a friend) and third-degree (friend of a friend of a friend) social connections influence the spread of obesity, though the strength of that influence diminishes the more distant the connection is.
> 
> This “network effect” may also affect behavior related to work, health, and educational choices. Further, this study argues that network effects may account for increasing social inequality. When members of a given social network adopt an advantageous behavior, like regular exercise, it spreads via the network effect. This creates a positive feedback loop: As more network members adopt it, the easier it is for others to join in.
> 
> While good for that network, this also widens the gap between them and other networks that lack the advantageous behavior. This sheds light on privilege: Those who start in a healthy, successful social network have a better chance of finding health and success than those born into social networks characterized by poor health and low socioeconomic mobility.
> 
> From Berne’s point of view, we could say that your network influences your games—and as we explained earlier, your games determine how you use the opportunities that come your way. If you inherit unhealthy, ineffective social habits from an unhealthy network, you’re at a disadvantage from the get-go. Berne’s advice, then, may help: Identify relationships that are holding you back, and lessen those connections (thereby lessening their influence on you via the network effect.)

**Step #3: Stop indulging in your games.** Games provide us easy but ultimately unfulfilling rewards. They’re more analogous to a chocolate bar than a soul-warming bowl of soup; you won’t grow healthy on games alone. Once you notice that you’re indulging in some self-validating behavior, it’s time to let go of that shallow gratification.

For example, it’s far easier to argue than it is to communicate productively. Argument lets us feel right for little effort, whereas effective communication is more difficult but more rewarding. To stop this, notice that you’re probably arguing to validate your emotions (and not for any rational purpose), and give up that indulgence.

(Shortform note: Opinions are split on indulgence. As a long-term habit, it can be destructive, as with drug or alcohol abuse, gambling, and so on. Yet other researchers have found that some indulgence is a good thing: If we’re always worried about control, plans, and the future, we can’t enjoy worry-free pleasures in the present moment. Consider also the phenomenon of dopamine fasting, where abstaining from pleasure-giving activities supposedly “resets” your brain, defeating your indulgent habits. But you can take this too far, as some did—they removed any and all pleasure from life, including social contact, delicious food, and eye contact. As Anna Lembke argues in Dopamine Nation, pleasure requires balance: We deserve to enjoy our lives, but excessive stimulation, like from a Tik Tok feed or porn, desensitizes you and reduces your ability to take pleasure in day-to-day living.)

**Step #4: Develop your self-control.** After the first three steps, shift toward developing control over your repertoire of behaviors. In other words, develop habits that reflect who you really are, and practice making only the choices that align with that. When you think, feel, and act how you genuinely want to, Berne argues, you can develop authentic relationships that transcend the influence of games.

(Shortform note: Here again, it seems like mindfulness would’ve been of great value to Berne’s theories. Practicing mindfulness helps us move from reactivity to response-ability, so it would theoretically help us to notice and disengage from those habits. We cover basic techniques in our guide to Mindfulness in Plain English, many of which complement Berne’s pattern-breaking method: For example, meditation develops your capacity to allow emotions and urges to pass without letting them control you. You could then use that skill to regulate your emotions when you start getting caught up in a game, and thereby maintain adult-state stability that helps to solve the issue.)
