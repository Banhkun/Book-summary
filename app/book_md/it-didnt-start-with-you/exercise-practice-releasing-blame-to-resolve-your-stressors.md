## Exercise: Practice Releasing Blame to Resolve Your Stressors

Wolynn says that—contrary to popular perceptions—our suffering is not due to a defect of character or culture. To begin healing, we need to stop blaming ourselves and others for the pain and distress we experience.

* * *

Describe a current stressor in your life that you attribute—at least in part—to a personal shortcoming. Don’t go for the biggest, most intense stressor. For now, choose something that you’d consider a “minor” pain or annoyance. (For example, maybe you don’t exercise enough or get enough sleep, or maybe you can’t seem to keep your house clean or pick your kids up on time.)

When you think about that stressor, what disempowering thoughts do you have about yourself? (For example, “I’ll never be good enough,” “I’m a terrible parent,” “Something is wrong with me,” or “I’m defective/dumb/inept/ugly/weak/lazy.”) What disempowering thoughts come up related to other people? (For example, “They’re arrogant/clueless/stupid/selfish…”)

Looking back at those disempowering thoughts, write down two or three different and _empowering_ ways to view yourself. Then do the same for others. (Really dig for generosity here. Remember: Wolynn says that your suffering didn’t start with you, which makes self-flagellation futile. True freedom starts with compassion.)

Now, what new insights and possibilities open up when you embrace empowering thoughts about yourself and others? How can you apply those insights the next time you face this particular stressor?
