## Introduction

**Why is it so hard for us to get along?_The Righteous Mind_** attempts to answer that question and better understand why hostile groups have different conceptions of what it means to be “right.”

Author Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist, uses examples from history and studies of human nature to explore why we hold the moral beliefs we do and why moral values differ so dramatically across historical, geographical, and party lines.

Haidt agrees with Bible verse Matthew 7:3—he says we are all often self-righteous hypocrites. To understand ourselves and reach some form of enlightenment, we must drop our own moralism and examine the world through the lens of moral psychology, which states that **people are governed by different moral frameworks.** Consequently, we have trouble understanding humans with moral frameworks that are different from ours. This leads to many of the large conflicts in the world today.

Consider whether you think these situations are morally wrong:

  * A family’s dog dies by no fault of their own and they’ve heard dog meat is tasty, so they grill it up to find out. No one sees this happen.
  * A man buys a chicken from the supermarket before dinner, but before cooking it, he has sex with it. No one sees this happen.



The first situation will probably seem a little less disgusting than the second, but if you’re a well-educated, liberal or libertarian, non-religious Westerner, you likely evaluated both scenarios with some nuance, believing that it’s not easy to place an obvious moral judgment on either case. (We’ll discuss _why_ you have trouble making these moral judgments later in the summary.)

However, if you do _not_ exist in one of these categories (you’re not a Westerner, or you’re religious), it’s likely that you think it’s simply morally wrong to eat your pet dog or have sex with a chicken carcass and eat it after. As you can see, **moralities are different across societies**. Once you understand this, it becomes easier to understand and empathize with different groups of people and their moral beliefs.

Haidt argues that morality is intuitive, not rational, and that our cultures shape these intuitive moral judgments. He builds this argument on three basic principles, which make up the three parts of the book:

  * Part 1 (Chapters 1-5): Morality is more intuitive than rational. 
  * Part 2 (Chapters 6-8): Morality is about more than fairness and harm.
  * Part 3 (Chapters 9-12): Morality “binds and blinds” us.
