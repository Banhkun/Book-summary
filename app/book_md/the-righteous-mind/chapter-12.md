## Chapter 12: How to Make Disagreements Respectful and Productive

People’s groupish behavior, along with their commitment to their moral matrices, can lead them into a blind defense of an ideology or a political party. This chapter is about how we can make better arguments and have more productive conversations with one another.****

**There’s significant evidence that we are understanding each other worse than ever. America is polarizing rapidly, with the gap widening between political opinions on the left and the right.** There’s been a decline in the number of people who self-identify as centrist and a corresponding rise in those who identify as liberal and conservative. So, how can we learn to talk to one another better?

> **A Note on Political Diversity:** This chapter will focus on the liberal to conservative scale and the psychology of “liberals” and “conservatives.” Many people in the U.S. don’t characterize themselves as a member of either major party and don’t reduce ideology to one dimension. Most people, though, are able to place themselves on the liberal to conservative axis, even if they don’t identify as a Republican or a Democrat.

### Finding Our Preferred Moral Matrix

Before we can understand how liberals and conservatives can talk to one another more productively, we need to explore how liberals and conservatives develop their ideology (or their understanding of how we should order society).

Political scientists thought for a long time that it was mostly your upbringing that determined your political ideology. But twins brought up in two different households are more likely to develop a similar ideology than unrelated siblings brought up in the same household. So, political ideology is at least partially innate.

There are three big steps in understanding how we form our ideology:

**1\. Genes create brain chemistry:** Scientists have found that liberals and conservatives have some different genes in their brains: These are mostly related to neurotransmitters that monitor and determine our response to fear or threat. Conservatives respond more strongly to threats of danger than liberals, whereas liberals are more interested in new experiences or novelty. This is one way that we move from genes to politics: Genes develop brains that respond differently to sensors in the world. In turn, these genes help to determine politics.

**2\. Different traits move children in different directions:** Personality and ideology develop based on innate and learned traits. We’ll discuss two here.

  * **Dispositional traits:** These traits are the same throughout your life, and develop based on your genes. Children who become liberals are often curious and verbal. Children who become conservatives are often neat and obedient.
  * **Characteristic adaptations:** These traits materialize through childhood as people face different circumstances and environments. For example, let’s say in a sibling pair, the boy is more obedient and the girl is more curious. If they go to a strict school, the boy will fit in much better. He’ll develop a different friend group and different interests than the girl, who will become socially disengaged in a way she would not have if she had gone to a less structured school. As they grow up, the girl goes off to college in New York, while the boy stays close to home and becomes a “pillar of the community.” His life has led him in 2008 to respond to John McCain’s messaging, where hers has led her to respond to Barack Obama’s. Neither of these children was predestined to vote for one of these candidates. But they had different dispositional traits which led them to different adaptations which in turn codified their ideologies. 



**3\. We create our own stories:** To make sense of our lives, we construct narratives. Even though these narratives are post hoc, they still shape people’s lives and the decisions that they make. Consider this story from Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards’ biography. He describes how when he was young, he was well-behaved and part of a choir. The choir, run by the school, frequently took him out of his classes to go to various recitals and competitions. But once he hit puberty, the choir director was no longer interested in the kids, and the kids in choir were all told they’d have to repeat a year of school, because they had missed so much. He told himself that he’d spend as long as it took trying to burn that ridiculous system to the ground. He told himself a story based on his experience that resulted in never voting for a Tory (a British conservative) who stood for that sort of authority without rebellion.

### Liberal and Conservative Stories

Conservatives and liberals in America also have different foundational stories about the country.

Conservatives since the Reagan era argue that America used to be a beacon of liberty, but liberals have attempted to ruin it by creating bureaucracy and tax burdens that stunt growth while also opposing faith and God. They took money from good, hard-working people and gave it to lazy people living on welfare while lionizing evil promiscuity and a “gay lifestyle.”

Liberals argue that there used to be dictatorial, oppressive regimes that governed the world, which virtuous people—through time and effort—overthrew. They then founded democracies and started fighting for equal rights for all, creating laws and government programs that could benefit everyone.

The conservative narrative is the heroic beating back of hordes attempting to overrun their lifestyle and the liberal narrative is the heroic triumph over those more powerful.

The conservative narrative relies on a little bit of the care foundation and a lot of all five of the other moral foundations. The liberal narrative relies on only the care, fairness, and liberty foundations.

Conservatives can more easily understand the liberal narrative because all of the foundations that the liberals rely on they rely on as well.

Liberals have a harder time understanding the conservative narrative because they can’t understand the foundations of loyalty, authority, and sanctity. They believe that these foundations are often immoral: Liberals argue loyalty to country leads to exclusion of immigrants and many non-white Americans. Belief in authority is congruous with belief in oppression. And sanctity is a religious argument that often provides the foundation for homophobia.

### Blind Spots

Liberals, though, have significant _blind spots_ when it comes to understanding conservatives. Just like liberals, conservatives are interested in creating the best possible society.

Haidt realized this while reading a volume of _Conservatism,_ a compendium of conservative thought.__ The conservative intellectuals in _Conservatism_(who Haidt believes are different from the modern Republican Party) argued much of what this book argues: Humans are imperfect and overconfident, and so we create theories of the world and morality based on reason rather than an understanding of history and humans’ intuition.

Conservatives argue that **people need outside constraints to behave properly and thrive.** Without them, people will cheat, and _social capital,_ or trust, will begin to decline.

Conservatives understand the value of **moral capital, or the resources necessary to sustain and grow a moral community.** Think about a commune without the religious aspect: Communes that promote self-expression and tolerance more than loyalty might attract more new members, but they would have a harder time surviving than those that live by strict regulations that better suppress selfishness.

Moral capital is a mixed bag. It leads to suppressing selfishness, but it also leads to suppressing dissent. You can often find it in fascist nations or cults.

However, when considering changes to society, always consider how they will change a society's moral capital. This is a blind spot for the left: It is why communist revolution often ends in despotism and why liberal reforms are often ineffective. Liberalism changes too much too quickly in the goal of bringing about freedom and equal opportunity. Conservatism can better preserve moral capital, but they fail to see the need for changes to our society to move with the times or protect the vulnerable.

#### Yin/Yang Politics

Sometimes, each side has points that the other can learn from. For the purpose of considering some of these points in modern American society, we’ll split up conservatives into social conservatives and libertarians, who have different ideologies and goals from one another.

First, we’ll identify the most sacred principle of liberals: caring for and freeing victims of oppression.

  * Resulting Sub-Principle #1: **Governments should reign in corporate superorganisms.** Corporations have grown so much that the only forces that are powerful enough to stop them are governments that can still tax them and divide them based on regulations. Corporations have one goal, which is to maximize profit for their shareholders, and so will do essentially anything to achieve that goal. Corporations operate in secret so that they can act more capriciously. If governments don’t make corporations operate in full view of the public, there could be consequences for the environment and for the most vulnerable in society. 
  * Resulting Sub-Principle #2: **Some problems are solvable by regulation.** When Americans started buying more cars in the 1950s and 60s, lead in gasoline made its way into the water and bloodstreams, harming the public and especially children. The Carter administration started phasing out gas with lead in it, and while the Reagan administration gutted the EPA and halted this effort, congressmen from both sides of the aisle in the 1990s completed the job. This led to lead levels in children’s bloodstreams dropping significantly and much better health outcomes, including higher IQs in kids. Additionally, studies argue that the phaseout could have been responsible for at least half of the drop in crime in the 1990s. Lead interfered with the development of kids’ brains, which led to higher crime rates. Rather than going with the cheapest option in the short term, government regulation solved some huge problems in American society. 



Libertarian counterpoint: **Markets work.** Imagine if we had the sort of multileveled, partially government subsidized and controlled system for buying groceries that we have for health care in the U.S. Premiums for buying groceries would go up, and there would be no way of properly regulating prices from the store. Some people wouldn’t be able to afford groceries, the store would have no reason not to charge absurd markups to the government, and before you know it, a can of peas would cost $30 for the government, with our tax dollars, to buy. It is only working markets that could provide healthcare at the lowest possible price, just as they do with groceries. There’s an open market for LASIK surgery, for example, which has driven prices down by 80 percent since the surgery debuted. We should listen better when libertarians talk about the “spontaneous order” of allowing people to choose. Liberals sometimes prefer the design of socialist economies, which can lead to utilitarian disaster, as people don’t cooperate in large groups when they think others are free riding.

Social conservative counterpoint: **Don’t destroy the hive to help the bees.** Large scale societies are already miraculous achievements. We’re products of multilevel selection, and we need groups to continue to succeed, even if some groups are exclusionary. If we destroy all groups, we destroy all moral capital. In one study, Robert Putnam found that ethnic diversity in communities leads to a reduction in social capital. Ethnic diversity reduces _bridging capital,_ or trust between groups, as well as _bonding capital,_ or trust within groups. Liberals’ wish to help those least fortunate often leads to changes that can weaken groups, traditions, and moral capital. As an example, allowing students to sue their teachers and schools has led to an erosion of authority in schools that harms the poor most.

### Finding Civility

Haidt offers three recommendations for improving bipartisan collaboration in government:

  1. Change how we run primary elections.
  2. Change how we draw electoral districts.
  3. Change how candidates can raise money. 



However, Haidt primarily focuses on how individuals who disagree can find civility and common ground. We live in more polarized areas than we used to—in 1976, only around a quarter of Americans lived in a county that voted overwhelmingly (by a margin of 20% or over) for one presidential candidate. By 2008, that number was almost half. These counties maintain distinct cultural differences. In the 2008 election, 89% of counties with a Whole Foods voted for Obama, while 62% of counties with a Cracker Barrel voted for McCain.

It’s easier to live with people who share our moral matrices, and as we’ve discovered people with the same moral matrices regularly have the same political beliefs. Even if we can’t find like-minded people in our communities, we can now easily find them online. We think increasingly that the other group is blind when talking about politics, but truthfully, _everyone is blind_ when discussing “sacred objects” like political candidates or policies. If we can remember our own blindness, though, we may be less inclined to judge the blindness of others. When you disagree with someone else on a moral or political issue, first consider which of the six moral foundations are at the heart of the issue. Then, try to practice empathy. If you have a friendly interaction with someone with different moral matrices, you’re much more likely to understand them better. You might not always change your mind, but you will respect their opinion more.
