## Exercise: Find Your Foundations

Given that everyone has different proportions of the “taste receptors” of morality and thus different foundations, it’s useful to understand what yours are so you can better understand what you care about and how your morality differs from others.

* * *

Think of something that happened to you recently, or that you saw on television or on the street, that you thought was immoral. Describe the event here.

Which of the five moral foundations did that event violate? Why?

Finally, think of activities that could violate the other four foundations.

Were some potential moral violations easier to come up with than others? Which ones, and why? What does this tell you about which foundations are most important to you?
