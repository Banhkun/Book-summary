## Chapter 10: The Group’s Influence on Morality

What situations bring out the 10% of us that’s bee rather than chimp? This section will help to answer that question and explain how “hives” of people coalesce. It will also give examples of specific situations in which we might be more likely to feel groupish.

So, in what ways can we be groupish in practice? Thousands of years of recorded history show that men at war are more willing to risk their lives for their comrades in the army than for any country or ideal. In the heat of battle, **the “I” turns into a “we,”** and if an individual dies, he lives on in the form of his comrades who survived.

**We are hive creatures, but only in certain situations. Our hivemind tendencies are conditional on our surroundings.** There’s a “switch” that will turn this tendency on and off—when it’s on, we’ll transcend self-interest.

### Interpersonal and Inter-Social Relationships

In order to flip that switch from off to on to off again, we must be programmed to be able to put the group first. Émile Durkheim argued that humans have a group of sentiments that allow us to exist as an individual and _another_ group of sentiments that allow us to exist as part of a group. These two groups of sentiments allow humans to exist on two different levels.

#### Interpersonal Relationships

The first level of sentiments allows us as individuals to coexist with other individuals. They include respect for others or frustration with others. These sentiments, which we’ll call _interpersonal relationships,_ concern the self. They are present when our switch is flipped towards thinking selfishly.

#### Inter-Social Relationships

The second level of sentiments are bonds between individuals and society. They allow individuals to not only exist within a group but also abandon the idea of the self in favor of the needs of the group. When we’re on the second level, we exist more like a cog in a machine. We’ll call these sentiments _inter-social relationships,_ and they are present when our switch is flipped towards thinking about the group, or the hive.

### How to Flip the Switch

There are certain strategies that can help humans move from self-interested chimp to group-interested bee.

  1. **Find Awe in Nature:** Maybe, while walking in nature by yourself, you’ve felt that your daily worries melt away and you feel only awe at what’s around you. This can make you think about new directions for your life or new values to practice. Ralph Waldo Emerson described being in nature alone as a spiritual experience that allows you to get in touch with a higher self and feel as if you’re part of something larger. 
  2. **Take “Durkheimogens”:** An Aztec practice involved taking hallucinogens to unlock this sacred realm and leave the gross, stressful world behind. These drugs, like ayahuasca or LSD, can help us have a transformative experience where we abandon our idea of the self and our daily concerns—for this, we could call them “Durkheimogens.” Many societies use hallucinogens as part of rituals that officially turn boys and girls into men and women—they are supposed to help connect participants with ancestors or gods. Studies show that hallucinogens can create unity between individuals that take them together and a feeling of unity towards the world, along with many other effects. Participants said these experiences changed their lives and their relationship to spirituality. 
  3. **Attend Raves:** Beginning in the West in the 1980s, large groups gathered together for raves, which included a combination of loud techno and trance music, youths mixing together and dancing communally to the music, and MDMA (the aptly street-named ecstasy), a drug that gives people more sustained energy along with more feelings of love. Tony Hsieh, the creator of Zappos, explained that when he attended his first rave, he felt swept up into a spiritual experience that made him feel a connection with everyone at the event as well as everyone in the universe. It also made him **lose his self-consciousness.** His “I” shut down and he found the “we.”



Of course, people flip the switch in lots of other ways as well. Anything from attending a political rally to meditating can do it. Usually, the effects last a few hours or days, but people do report life-changing experiences from these switch flips.

Students in particular are often doing things that flip the switch and allow them to find greater meaning than individualism. These activities include competing on teams, putting on a play, and volunteering.

### The Switch’s Biology

One biological mechanism that binds us to others is oxytocin, a hormone and neurotransmitter that prepares women for motherhood and provides other ways to motivate people into large groups. If you put a squirt of oxytocin spray into someone’s nose before a game, they’ll be more trusting. Additionally, our oxytocin levels rise when someone else shows us that they are trustworthy by keeping a promise. We are then more likely to repay their trustworthiness with trustworthiness of our own.

Levels of oxytocin also rise when people watch others suffering, feel empathy, and want to help. Oxytocin, though, only makes us want to protect our _group._ It doesn’t increase trust in any out-group.

Another biological mechanism that binds us is _mirror neurons_ , or neurons that fire when we see an action performed by someone else _._ Studies show that if we develop empathy for someone, we can literally feel their pain. For example, in one study, three people played a game: The subject, a player who was kind during the game, and a player who was selfish. Then, each of the players including the subject put their hands on the table, where they were shocked at random. Brain scans showed that the subject’s brain responded to observing the nice player being shocked the same way it responded to the experience of being shocked himself. However, when the selfish player was shocked, the subject showed much less empathy. This shows that we don’t “mirror” others indiscriminately. Rather, we mirror, and therefore empathize with, only those who share our values—in other words, those in our “hive.”

### Hives in the World

A modern corporation is the perfect example of a hive. It’s a superorganism where tasks are split up so that everyone is doing the action that contributes the most to create a greater whole. Corporations, according to the law, can act as individuals.

The benefits of corporations include the ability to scale up their production and pay their employees more while charging less for their products than smaller businesses (or “organisms”).

Some companies use various and complex carrot-and-stick approaches in an attempt to control their employees. This in turn makes them act in a Glauconian manner—they care much more about a promotion or looking good in front of the boss than actually doing work that helps the group. Companies should abandon this strategy and instead use the naturally hive-minded part of humans to their benefit.

To tap into employees’ hiving tendencies and create a cohesive organization:

  * Emphasize similarities rather than differences: Don’t call attention to differences in background among people. Rather, focus on the values you do share. 
  * Use synchrony to your benefit: Some Japanese companies, like Toyota, will literally start the day with synchronous exercise. Asking people to complete tasks where they’re all doing the same action together, like singing a song, will make employees help each other more. 
  * Use competition between teams, not people: Soldiers are united by a common enemy and risk themselves for their team. Similarly, healthy competition between teams at the company improves the relationships among teammates. 



The bottom line is, people should think of their employment as membership in a hive.

### Hives in Politics

To Americans, the most famous political moment that activated their belief in the hive is probably John F. Kennedy’s inaugural appeal to “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.”

The appeal to the hive, though, is certainly not limited to liberal politicians, or even ones who believe in democracy. It’s a natural fit for fascism—Mussolini used hivish appeals frequently to success in Italy. Fascists appeal to the nation as a superorganism in itself, where the individual becomes unimportant in service to national goals.

This might make you afraid of hivish philosophies. But lots of hive behavior, like dancing together and exalting each other, comes _naturally_ to humans and actually serves to break down social class and difference. Fascist rallies were more spectacles than anything natural like this, and they excluded many citizens from the hive because they served to reinforce class and difference.

The most successful nations are ones with lots of little hives that cross with each other—someone can be part of a family unit, a workplace, a sports team outside of work, and on and on. Nations with no hives, or those with one huge hive, are much more likely to break down, because they’ll either have no connections between their citizens or one huge connection that is tenuous.

Having some competing hives, America’s founders argued, actually helps to prevent tyranny. By existing in many small hives that compete with one another, we make sure that no hive gets too powerful. And the social capital that we get from participating in civil society—bowling leagues, church groups, and many other organizations—makes us smarter and generally more successful.

  * (Note: Haidt takes this argument from Robert Putnam’s 1995 essay and 2000 book “Bowling Alone.” Putnam continues in his argument to say that in America we are _losing_ a lot of this participation in civil society due to the rise of television as constant entertainment. As engagement in civil organizations goes down, we’re less successful.)



### The Pros (and Cons) of Groupish Behavior

In sum, we have evolved to cooperate with members of our group and prevail over members of rival groups. Given our groupish tendencies, it’s not surprising that tribal thinking is so prevalent in modern society. We were not made to love everyone equally and unconditionally—rather, we were made to feel kinship with and loyalty to those with similar traits, and our righteousness springs from this tribalism.

For some, this idea is a depressing one. But, as we’ve seen, a lot of moral good comes out of our groupish behavior. Without tribes, there would be no community and no cooperation. Our groupishness pulls us out of our self-interested individualism and, for many, provides a higher purpose.
