## Part 2: Morality Is More Than Fairness and Harm | Chapters 6-7: The “Taste Receptors”

In Part 1, we explored the rationalist principle that evaluates the morality of a behavior based on whether or not it causes harm. In Part 2, we’ll continue to question the validity of this principle and discuss the diverse foundations of people’s moralities.

Haidt argues that the rationalist’s narrow definition of morality is not only incorrect but dangerous. **The attempt to ground society in just one moral principle, like preventing harm, leads to societies that are both unsatisfying and potentially inhumane because they ignore so many other moral principles.** In fact, the righteous mind has six “taste receptors,” or foundational moral principles.

This section will first explain how popular Western theories about morality came to be and then discuss the different taste receptors and the principles associated with each.

### A Science of Morality

We’ll use a graph to understand how our current misconceptions about morality came to be. Levels of empathy are on the Y-axis and levels of systemizing, or the ability to analyze the rules of the system, are on the X-axis.

People who are autistic fall in the bottom right corner. They are high systemizers and low empathizers. The two people who created much of the leading ethical theory of Western philosophy are also in that corner: Jeremy Bentham and Immanuel Kant.

  * **Jeremy Bentham** , the founder of modern utilitarianism,**** proposed that one principle should govern all action and law: _utility._ Each law and each action should maximize gain to the community. Bentham had many characteristics of Asperger’s syndrome: For example, he was unable to see subtlety and variety in the motives of his fellow humans. 
  * **Immanuel Kant** believed that there had to be a singular “good” and thus a singular morality for all humans, regardless of cultural and individual preferences. Today, we describe Kant’s views as deontological, or based on the theory that you can (and should) use established rules, rather than an action’s consequences, to evaluate whether that action is moral. He developed the _categorical imperative,_ a single principle to guide all moral decisions: You should only act in ways that reflect what you would hope to be universal law. Kant was also a loner who was never married and would have been close to the right corner of the chart, although it’s less clear that he had tendencies towards autism. 



The problem with these two theories is not, of course, that these men may have been autistic. Rather, it is that their theories are based on systemizing without considering empathy as equally important—they were asking **how the moral mind _should_ work, not how it _does_ work. **

### The Foundations of Morality

In creating his own theory, Haidt examined normal social life and the challenges associated with it around the world. Then, he considered how people in different cultures deal with these challenges differently, and what they prioritize as virtues. Haidt found five foundations of morality, or “taste receptors.” Just as we all have the same five taste receptors but prefer different foods, we all have these same five moral foundations, but in different proportions. The foundations are:

  1. **Care/harm**
  2. **Fairness/cheating**
  3. **Loyalty/betrayal**
  4. **Authority/subversion**
  5. **Sanctity/degradation**



Each foundation has an adaptive advantage—in some way, each one helped humans succeed. Each also has triggers that existed generations ago and triggers that exist today. Finally, each foundation is associated with certain emotions and virtues. Find the characteristics of each foundation, or “taste receptor,” in the table below.

| **Care/Harm** | **Fairness/** **Cheating** | **Loyalty/** **Betrayal** | **Authority/** **Subversion** | **Sanctity/** **Degradation**  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
**Evolutionary Purpose** | To raise children and keep them from harm  | To work with others for mutual benefit  | To form groups that can stick together  | To create and sustain positive hierarchies  | To avoid disease or other harm   
**Universal Triggers** | When a child shows signs of pain or distress  | A cheater or someone who works well with a group  | An external conflict that the group has to deal with together  | Someone claiming authority or submitting to another  | People or animals carrying disease   
**Modern-Day Triggers** | A cute video, an animal at a rescue shelter  | Being faithful to your partner, shoplifting  | Any sort of organized team  | Respect in the workplace for superiors  | Concepts like fascism   
**Typical Emotions** | Empathy  | Frustration, thankfulness  | Pride, anger at a betrayal  | Esteem, terror  | Revulsion   
**Virtues Associated** | Generosity, sympathy  | Objectivity  | Allegiance to a group  | Acquiescence  | Restraint, faith   
  
Haidt didn’t discover the sixth foundation, **Liberty/oppression** , until later—we’ll explain it fully in Chapter 8.

To understand how the foundations work in practice, we’ll use an example of the Care/harm principle: You take your four-year-old to a hospital to have his appendix removed. You can watch through a glass wall, and you see him lying on the operating table unconscious while the surgeon punctures his abdomen. You might feel both relief knowing the doctor is saving his life and pain watching him get punctured. From Bentham’s utilitarian point of view, it would be irrational if you looked away in fear because you know the doctor is not harming your child. But from the point of view of Haidt’s “taste receptor” theory, it makes sense, because you have an emotional response to watching your child bleed, even though you know rationally the doctor is not committing violence on him. This shows that you are caring and empathetic and that the Care/harm principle is a powerful “taste receptor” for you.

### The Moral Grounding of Our Politics

This section will move through each of the principles and explain how they work in the context of American politics.

**1\. The Care/harm foundation** prioritizes the values of kindness and nurturing.**** Mothers spend so much time with their child inside of them, and their children need so much help to survive in their first few months (which leads mothers to spend a lot of time with their baby), that of course they’ll have some innate feelings towards their child. This is evolutionary—mothers who have an innate feeling of protectiveness and an understanding of distress or suffering in their child can better help their child survive. Evolution favors mothers in this respect, but the suffering of anyone’s own kin can create this same sort of foundation. People can feel attached to lots of creatures or objects that aren’t their biological children as well, such as animals or people in faraway countries.

  * In the U.S., liberals rely much more on the Care/harm foundation than conservatives. For instance, a liberal might have a bumper sticker to this effect, with a message like “Save Darfur” or “Peace” or even “Save the Planet.” 
  * The Care/harm foundation is part of the conservative morality as well, but it’s not as foundational. For example, conservatives might have a bumper sticker like “Wounded Warrior,” which asks for care for people who have sacrificed for the larger group. 



**2\. The Fairness/cheating foundation** prioritizes the values of rights and justice.**** We play “tit for tat”: We are nice to people who are nice to us. Many types of situations encourage this sort of cooperation. Coworkers will cover each other’s shifts or neighbors watch each other’s houses. They’re doing so because they’re happy that people trust them, and also because they believe they’ll get the same treatment back. When our kindness is not returned we become angry at the lack of reciprocity and feel cheated.

  * The left and the right are both concerned about fairness in American society but in different ways. The left is often angry that the rich don’t pay their “fair share.” The right argues that Democrats are trying to take money from Americans who work hard and give it to lazy people or illegal immigrants. Fairness is utter _equality_ on the left but _proportionality_ on the right (people are rewarded for their contribution to society). 



**3\. The Loyalty/betrayal foundation** prioritizes the values of patriotism and self-sacrifice for the good of the group.**** For thousands of years, humans created groups in order to fend off rival groups. This trait still exists within us strongly, especially within men, who are predisposed to create groups that can go to battle with others (men are just more likely to express their teamwork on a baseball diamond than at war these days). This creates an intense and innate sense of loyalty within all of us and a hatred of traitors, who are worse than enemies that are honorable, because they have given up the principle of loyalty.

  * The left has much more trouble using the loyalty foundation to their advantage because they often disparage nationalism and sometimes American foreign policy. Conservatives, who are more willing to tap into the loyalty foundation, will often call liberals traitors because they aren’t sufficiently behind “the team.” 



**4\. The Authority/subversion foundation** prioritizes the values of leadership, deference, and tradition. Authority given to people at the top of a hierarchy, like a king, also comes with responsibility. People in a hierarchy have mutual expectations of each other—we expect those at the top to protect those at the bottom while we expect those at the bottom to serve those at the top. The authority foundation looks up and down at the same time and helps people form good relationships with people above and below them in a hierarchy.

  * Again, it is easier for the right to adopt this foundation for their use than the left, because the left defines itself against hierarchy and the inequality and power structures that result. 



**5\. The Sanctity/degradation foundation** prioritizes the values of purity and sanctity.**** This foundation is based on the idea that, unlike mere animals, we have a soul. Sacredness helps us build communities around a shared principle—often that humans have a creator or creators who ask them to perform specific rituals to maintain honor. The cultures that rely on this foundation may be more likely to believe immigrants will bring disease or dishonor into their society. Certain actions are unacceptable because they are too dirty (like drinking straight from the Hudson River in New York City) and others are untouchable because they are too sacred (like a cross for Christians, or even the principle of liberty for Americans).

  * American conservatives talk about “the sanctity of marriage” or “the sanctity of life” much more than liberals. Religious conservatives especially rely on this foundation, as they are likely to view the body as housing a soul. 
  * However, the spiritual left uses the sanctity foundation as well. Think about New Age products that promise to clean you of “toxins.” In addition, factions of the environmental movement are sometimes concerned with symbolic pollution as well as material pollution. They discuss how industry and unfettered capitalism have degraded nature and man’s original state. 



From the time we are born, the foundations of our morality are in place. Think of the human brain like a book that had its first draft written while you were in the womb. None of it is complete, but there’s an outline in place. As you grow into adulthood, you start writing your book—you can change the outline, as you go, but most people don’t.
