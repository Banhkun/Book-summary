## Chapter 2: Communists and the Proletariat

Now that we’ve learned about the class struggle between the Proletariat and Bourgeoisie, what is the role of the Communists? The Communists support the Proletariat and want to forcibly overthrow the Bourgeoisie. **The defining feature of Communism is the desire to abolish bourgeois private property.** Bourgeois private property wasn’t made or earned by a bourgeois individual—it was made by many laborers working together. Therefore, property should be common.

### The Path Forward

Once the Proletariat have acquired political power, they’ll take the following ten measures. (Some of the measures along this path are unsustainable but unavoidable. Problems will iron themselves out naturally.)

  1. Abolish the ownership of land and put all land to public use. This will eliminate oppression and class conflict.
  2. Create a progressive or graduated income tax. This will spread wealth more equally among all members of the population and eliminate classes.
  3. Abolish inheritance. This will eliminate wealth being held by a few instead of distributed among everyone.
  4. Take away the property of emigrants and rebels. Emigrants who are living abroad and left possessions behind obviously aren’t currently using them, so they can be better used by the general population. Rebels who oppose the Proletariat also shouldn’t be allowed to have property.
  5. Create a national bank using state capital. Private banks simply hold money. A national bank could use money to improve social conditions.
  6. Put the state in charge of communication and transportation. If the state controls these things, rather than an oppressor, everyone will have access to them.
  7. Expand and improve the state’s control of infrastructure and land. Currently, people aren’t making good use of resources. The state can allocate resources in a way that most benefits everyone.
  8. Require everyone to work and require working conditions to be decent. This will result in everyone contributing to society.
  9. Decentralize jobs from cities by combining agriculture and manufacturing. This will reduce geographic inequity and make better use of resources.
  10. Abolish child labor, create public schools, and give all children free education. This will improve the lives of children.



(Shortform note: We’ve added explanations of each measure, based on widely-held interpretations.)

**Political power only exists to allow one class to oppress another.** The Proletariat will only briefly be the ruling class. After the above measures have been carried out and all class distinctions fade, political power will cease to exist.

### Responses to Criticism

The critics of Communism, such as the Bourgeoisie, don’t have a lot of ground to stand on. Communists can address all of their criticisms, particularly the ones about abolishment. **Many of the things communists want to “abolish” have already been abolished—by the Bourgeoisie—for the majority of the population.** For example, the only people who have private property are the 10% of the population that makes up the Bourgeoisie.

Here are some criticisms of Communists and how Communists respond:

  * **Communism encourages universal laziness.** If abolishing private property led to universal laziness, everyone would already be lazy, because wage-earners make up most of the population and don’t have any private property. 
  * **Communism destroys culture.** The Bourgeoisie have already destroyed the culture of the working class by viewing people as commodities.
  * **Communism attacks freedom.** The Communists oppose free trade because it leads to the exploitation of workers. They don’t oppose freedom in general.
  * **Communism destroys family structures.** Again, the Bourgeoisie has already destroyed the family structure. Proletariat children are exploited and forced to work.
  * **Communism erases national borders.** The Proletariat doesn’t have a country anymore—they’re not people, they’re commodities—so it's impossible to abolish something that doesn’t exist. The Proletariat is international and the main differences between people are class distinctions. Conflicts between countries will die out as conflicts between classes die out.
  * **Communism upheaves the educational system.** The Communists didn’t invent schools or the idea that society should have a hand in education. The Communists simply want school to be available to everyone, not just the Bourgeoisie.
  * **Communism makes women collective property.** This criticism is rooted in misdefinition. The Communists do want all property and tools to be common, but unlike Bourgeoisie men, Communists don’t consider women to be tools or property. In fact, the Bourgeoisie have done more to create a “community of women” than the Communists ever will—Bourgeoisie men regularly visit prostitutes and sleep with each other’s wives.
  * **Communism destroys religion.** Religion’s ideas and values normally change and evolve over time. Communism isn’t changing anything that isn’t already editable.
