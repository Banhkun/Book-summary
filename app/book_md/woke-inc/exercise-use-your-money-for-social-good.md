## Exercise: Use Your Money for Social Good

Ramaswamy claims that a growing number of corporations are participating in Wokenomics. Think of a time you noticed a company publicizing a progressive stance on a social issue.

* * *

Did the company’s advertised social engagement affect your decision to purchase from them (or not)? Have you ever switched to a socially responsible company from its competitor because of its progressive messaging?

Besides a company’s marketing, did you have any other source of information on the business’s philosophy or practices? If you knew that the company committed acts that went against your values, would this stop you from being their customer?

If there is a social cause you care about, what other ways can you help? What would these ways require from you (time, money, and so on)?
