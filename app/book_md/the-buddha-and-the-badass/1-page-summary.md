## 1-Page Summary

In _The Buddha and the Badass,_ Vishen Lakhiani sheds light on why so many employees dislike their work and why so many modern workplaces fail to adequately support their workers: They buy into hustle culture and the lie that it’s a prerequisite for success. Lakhiani, on the other hand, believes hustle culture is misguided and proposes a different way to go about finding success in work and life: by being both spiritually enlightened—calm, centered, and in tune with yourself—and disruptive: willing to shake things up to make work a fulfilling experience.

When you merge these traits, you transform your company into an unstoppable force, accelerated by passionate, happy employees who believe in your cause. In such environments, employees can grow and connect, and work becomes play.

Lakhiani is an entrepreneur and activist who also authored _The Code for the Extraordinary Mind_ and founded Mindvalley, a learning platform. In this book, Lakhiani mainly addresses entrepreneurs and business people, so most of the book is written in the context of ultimately establishing a business.

In this guide, we’ll first explain why hustle culture fails to make people successful or happy. We’ll then examine the two components of Lakhiani’s alternate proposal for a better workplace: enlightenment and disruptiveness. Finally, we’ll look at how to merge those two qualities to build the most successful and enjoyable workplace. We’ll supplement this with outside perspectives on creating a successful company and culture, and with comparisons between Lakhiani’s self-improvement advice and that of other thinkers.

### The Problem With Modern Work: Hustle Culture

Lakhiani writes that our vision of success in life is based on false information we’re fed from an early age: that you must work harder than everyone else, that you should try to make as much money as possible, and that your personal life must be sacrificed for your professional life. In other words, to be successful, you must _hustle._

(Shortform note: While the belief in hard work may have always been around, its manifestation as hustle culture only came about during the rise of the tech industry. Tech leaders promoted and continue to promote the idea that to achieve anything worthwhile, you must work long and hard and that doing anything else with your time is wasteful.)

However, he argues **this simply isn’t true: Success does not require laborious work and long hours.** And in fact, this misconception makes people 1) unhappy in life because they don’t have time for the people and activities they enjoy and 2) ineffective at work because they’re too busy to recognize if they’re striving for the right goals or if their work is actually helping anyone.

(Shortform note: The effects of the misguided belief in hustle culture can be summed up as _burnout._ Burnout is defined as a state of exhaustion and reduced productivity accompanied by a loss of your sense of self. Burnout can be caused by factors other than hustle culture: Sometimes, just being unclear on the expectations of your role can make you feel burned out.)

### A Better Way to Work: Be Enlightened and Disruptive

According to Lakhiani, to have success at work and in life, you must shed your belief in “hustle culture” and develop a new, dual approach to work: **Be both _spiritually enlightened_ and _disruptive_ of workplace norms**. This is what Lakhiani refers to as being both a _Buddha_ and a _badass_. When you’re both enlightened and disruptive, you work effortlessly—as if it was for fun. You’re also a great team player, excel in your roles, are universally loved, and can handle multiple responsibilities and tasks. You seem to be lucky and in good health and happiness all the time. In short, life and work are easy and enjoyable.

(Shortform note: Lakhiani’s description of an enlightened and disruptive leader might seem idealistic: Can anyone really have such a blessed life? Even if you’re extraordinarily lucky, you’re bound to run into setbacks at some point. Perhaps it would be more realistic to additionally describe an enlightened and disruptive person as being _resilient._ If you’re resilient, even when you run into inevitable setbacks, you maintain your effortless and positive approach to life by adapting to and bouncing back from them. Resilience also helps you grow personally, which is necessary to continue to be a good team player and to excel: If you’re not growing and learning, eventually, your methods will become outdated, and you’ll be outperformed.)

#### What Does “Enlightened” Mean?

As Lakhiani describes it, being enlightened means being calm and wise. You’re OK not knowing all the answers and you don’t need a concrete path to follow. You allow the Universe—or whatever higher power you believe in—to help you, rather than forcing events and outcomes.

(Shortform note: In Buddhist philosophy—which Lakhiani sometimes draws upon—through enlightenment, you attain nirvana, which is a state free from suffering, greed, anger, and delusion. While centeredness, flexibility, and wisdom can help you attain this Buddhist form of enlightenment, Buddhists don’t believe in a higher power or God, so that part of Lakhiani’s definition of enlightenment is his own.)

#### What Does “Disruptive” Mean?

When you’re disruptive, you challenge the idea that to succeed, you must work tirelessly. By doing so, you enact positive change for employees and colleagues. A disruptive leader treats each employee as an autonomous being with personal aspirations, which makes work feel fulfilling, turning it into an opportunity for growth and connection.

When it comes to making change through disruption, Lakhiani mainly addresses leaders because they have the ability to change the workplace more than lower-level employees do. But he adds that _anyone_ can be disruptive and make work better for those around them.

(Shortform note: There’s good reason to disrupt workplace norms and build a positive work environment: According to the authors of _First, Break All the Rules, _only 13% of global employees are engaged at work. The main reason for this low number is that workers have poor or even hostile relationships with their managers. If you’re a leader, you’re in the best position to mend those relationships by treating people fairly and kindly, thereby boosting engagement at work.)

We’ll next look at how to become spiritually enlightened and disruptive, and finally at how to merge those qualities to be optimally effective in the workplace.

### How to Become Spiritually Enlightened

According to Lakhiani, there are two parts to becoming spiritually enlightened. The first part is getting to know yourself well, and the second part is creating a routine that lets you continuously grow spiritually. We’ll look at both in this section.

#### Find Your Inner Identity: Your Values and Purpose

**The most important way** **you can become spiritually enlightened is by understanding your unique inner identity—what Lakhiani calls your _soulprint_ (like a fingerprint but for your _self_).** Your inner identity is made up of your values and your true purpose, writes Lakhiani. When you understand those aspects of yourself, you can live every day in alignment with them, which will give you the inner peace and contentment of enlightenment.

(Shortform note: In _The Untethered Soul, _Michael Singer adds that most people don’t understand their inner identities and the values and purpose that make them up. They therefore bounce between conflicting pursuits—perhaps one day feeling they should quit their jobs to pursue their passion for acting, and the next day feeling they should go to law school to have a respectable career. Understanding yourself, as Lakhiani recommends, can keep you from spending your life in this state of indecision.)

##### Values

Lakhiani writes that values are the beliefs you have that inform how you think and act, and these values are often shaped by big life experiences. The values you derive from your experiences are unique to you, and when you understand them, you can live by them.

He notes that _challenging_ life experiences tend to shape your values more than pleasant or happy ones. For instance, you might be more affected by losing an important contest you’ve worked hard for than if you won that contest, and the experience might be more likely to lead you to develop values that shape your thinking thereafter.

(Shortform note: Lakhiani writes that values specifically grow from important life events. But others feel that your assimilation of values happens in your day-to-day life. For example, Tony Robbins argues that your values are shaped by your family, friends, school, and culture over the course of your life. Robbins’ view of values also clashes somewhat with Lakhiani’s because if your values are influenced by other people, they’re not really unique to you and aren’t deeply aligned with your inner identity. However, this could arguably make life easier for you because you don’t have to find people or jobs that are perfectly in sync with your unique values.)

Lakhiani stresses that we often let ourselves be influenced by societal values because we believe doing so makes us more significant in the eyes of others. If you feel others will be more impressed if you attain wealth and prestige than if you spend your time making experimental art, you may end up valuing wealth over creativity.

However, he advises that you don’t let the values of others become _your_ values, as doing so will lead you down an unfulfilling and miserable path away from enlightenment. Stick to your own values instead. When you stop letting the opinions of others affect you and you see yourself as good enough as you are, you’ll have greater ease and more happiness in life.

(Shortform note: The tension between sticking to your values and wanting to fit in is something most humans have struggled with at some point in their lives. We all have an instinctive need to be accepted by others and indeed can’t help but be influenced, even on a neurological level, by the input of others. At the same time, we have a perhaps equally strong urge to be authentic and true to our needs and desires, despite what others may think of us. So how do we walk this line successfully? Perhaps the answer lies in being vulnerable. When we talk about our struggles with others, we encourage them to trust us because we’re not hiding anything. This trust allows us to do the things we want without fearing others will judge or spurn us.)

**How to Determine Your Values**

Lakhiani offers a way to determine what your true values are if you’re not sure of them:

  1. Pinpoint some terrible and some great moments in your life. Reflect on what you learned from those moments. 
  2. Note as many values as you can that emerged from those moments. 
  3. Group similar values together to create four categories. 
  4. Determine what unites the values in those categories, and give those categories corresponding names. 
  5. Once you’ve determined those four values, flesh out a short description of how those values inform your work and life. 



> **Changing Your Life Versus Changing Your Values**
> 
> Tony Robbins takes a different approach to living life according to your values. He doesn’t believe you should _uncover_ your existing values to live life according to them, but rather that you should _change your existing values to enable you to live the life you want_. In other words, Lakhiani advises changing your life based on your values while Robbins recommends changing your values based on your ideal life.
> 
> Robbins has also devised a five-step process for changing your existing values and value hierarchy to give you the life you want. Let’s look at the steps of both approaches and compare them.
> 
> **Step 1:** Robbins writes that you must first pick the values you’d need to become the person you want to be in the future—his perspective is to the future. Lakhiani, on the other hand, suggests looking _backward_ to find out which values have grown from your experiences.
> 
> **Step 2:** Lakhiani says to write down all the values from your life experiences, but Robbins says to eliminate less critical values from your list. Robbins’ focus is more on prioritizing certain values while Lakhiani wants you to be sure you’re capturing all your values.
> 
> **Step 3:** Lakhiani instructs you to group similar values into categories. Robbins instead asks you to create a hierarchical list of your values and assess how each value, and its place in your hierarchy, benefits you. It seems Lakhiani believes you can incorporate all values into your life while Robbins thinks you must prioritize them.
> 
> **Step 4:** Robbins says to consider the downsides of prioritizing certain values over others. Lakhiani asks you to assign names to your value groupings. These steps don’t have much in common, but they continue to reinforce the authors’ different approaches to value-setting.
> 
> **Step 5:** Robbins asks you to create a final hierarchical list of your values based on their priority. Lakhiani wants you to describe how your values influence your work and life. Lakhiani again is emphasizing the importance of existing values, while Robbins believes you must change your values and even order them to attain your ideal life.

##### Purpose

Your values inform your life’s _purpose_ —what the Universe wants you to do. Lakhiani advises that you stay aligned with that purpose and let it inform everything you do, and this will lead to spiritual fulfillment.

He writes that your purpose often manifests as an _intuition_ —an inner voice that nudges you in a certain direction—when you live according to your values. For example, based on your value of harmony and your love of science (which forms part of your inner identity), you might intuit your purpose is to use psychological research to help people be in greater harmony with each other. If you steadfastly follow this purpose, you’ll feel content in life.

(Shortform note: Lakhiani’s instructions on how to find your purpose are somewhat underdeveloped—he says you might intuit your purpose but doesn’t provide concrete actionables for how to find your purpose if your intuition fails you. Fortunately, other authors, like Simon Sinek, have written extensively about how to find your purpose. He advises you to compose a personal purpose statement, in which you articulate what impact you want to have on the world and the actions you’ll take to do that.)

#### Create a Morning Routine to Foster Spiritual Enlightenment

In addition to understanding yourself better, Lakhiani also recommends a specific morning routine that will support your constant growth and journey toward spiritual enlightenment. This routine takes up a considerable amount of time, but Lakhiani emphasizes that you _save_ much more time over the course of your day and life by investing in your wellness every day.

This routine begins with getting high-quality sleep. You can do this by using supplements, sleep trackers, and by meditating before bed. If you can improve the quality of your sleep, you’ll have to sleep less, which gives you more time for other pursuits during the day.

Once you’ve woken up, perform a six-step meditation in which you practice compassion, gratitude, and forgiveness, and envision your future life and your ideal day. End with a blessing to yourself (you can find this meditation on YouTube). After this, exercise. Next, eat a healthy breakfast, and finally, read an educational book to enhance your knowledge.

> **The Power of Mornings: Robin Sharma’s 5 AM Club**
> 
> Lakhiani isn’t the only fan of mornings: In _The 5 AM Club, _Robin Sharma writes that the first hour of your day is your most productive, so you should use that time to perform important growth activities. However, there are notable differences between the two approaches: While Lakhiani’s aim of creating a morning routine is to grow spiritually, Sharma’s aim is to achieve greater success in life. (Still, you’ll probably find yourself doing both if you follow either of their morning plans.)
> 
> What’s more, Lakhiani doesn’t specify a time to wake up, though he does provide some ways to get better sleep so you can get up earlier than you did before and still feel refreshed. Sharma on the other hand recommends a strict 5 a.m. wake-up time and provides a nightly schedule to follow to ensure you get the best sleep and can wake up by five.
> 
> Finally, the authors advocate different routines each morning. Lakhiani’s routine is looser and has no end time, while Sharma’s routine is strictly prescribed and should only take an hour. He says to exercise for 20 minutes, reflect or meditate for 20 minutes, and expand your knowledge by reading for 20 minutes. While there is some overlap, each routine will probably find greater appeal with different people.

### How to Become Disruptive

Now that you know how to move toward spiritual enlightenment, let’s look at the other side of the coin: how to be disruptive. Again, this means building a revolutionary workplace in which people can grow, feel important and valued, develop friendships, and contribute to meaningful work. This type of workplace stands in stark contrast to most other modern work environments, states Lakhiani. There are three parts to being a disruptive leader.

#### Set Your Company’s Values and Use Them to Attract the Right Team

The first step of setting up a disruptive business is to define the company’s values, which are based on your personal values. You must do this because **when your company has clearly defined values, applicants who have the same values and the ability to bring them to life will want to work for you**. And when your company is composed of people with shared values, it’s far more likely to succeed.

(Shortform note: Some disagree with Lakhiani’s belief in the power of value statements. While corporate value statements may paint a pleasant picture of the company, often, the pressure to maximize profit wins out over adherence to nice-sounding values like “teamwork” and “empowerment.” And it looks like employees are actually _leaving_ companies for this reason, not wanting to be part of a corporate system that exists only to maximize shareholder value. So even if a company truly means to act on its values, employees may be so disillusioned that they don’t take that promise seriously and don’t apply.)

Define and share your values in two ways:

**Manifesto:** Create a manifesto outlining what your company stands for and what values it has. Be aware that some people will dislike your manifesto, and that’s OK. The main point is that your manifesto takes a strong stance so that it attracts the people who _do_ share your values.

**Your Reason for Existing:** In addition to a manifesto, communicate _why_ you exist. You must communicate this because your “why” is what candidates connect to emotionally, and emotions drive human decisions far more than logic does.

(Shortform note: With these two value declarations, Lakhiani is in a way trying to help you speak both to the minds and hearts of job applicants. A manifesto is akin to a thesis statement about your business, and it aims to logically persuade someone that what you’re doing is valuable. It thus makes sense that not every manifesto will appeal to the logic of every person. A reason for existing, on the other hand, is a deeper expression of core values that are meant to resonate emotionally—comparable to a story.)

#### Define Bold, Forward-Thinking Goals

To lead a disruptive company, you must **develop big, bold goals for it** , insists Lakhiani. Unfortunately, most people and leaders are conditioned to aspire to modest goals. But to accomplish something great, you must set audacious goals and constantly update them to be _even_ more audacious. If you don’t, your company will languish in mediocrity.

(Shortform note: Some feel that mediocrity isn’t such a bad thing. Being content to perform at an average level frees you from the uncomfortable pressure to always be the best. Being average also means you get to enjoy life’s pleasures because you’re not always straining to become better. You enjoy better mental health because you don’t always see yourself as falling short of big goals.)

Ironically, the bolder your goals are, Lakhiani argues, the easier they are to achieve. This is because when your goals are inspiring and audacious, people with the right skills and enthusiasm will be excited by your cause and want to join it. To have such big, bold goals, Lakhiani warns that you must not be too rational. Otherwise, you’ll start hedging and reducing the scope of your goal to something more manageable.

(Shortform note: While pursuing audacious goals may seem risky, in _Principles: Life and Work, _Ray Dalio seeks to assuage your fears about going after lofty goals. He writes that when you set a lofty goal and start pursuing it, new avenues and actions will become clear to you, but you’ll only see those avenues and actions if you set the goal in the first place. This argument may appeal to the more rational goal-setters who don’t want to throw themselves into the pursuit of a highly ambitious and uncertain goal.)

Lakhiani provides two tips on attaining goals:

**Tip 1** : Always speak of your project 10 years down the road to indicate the goal you believe it will achieve in 10 years. Express this goal as if it were already a reality—doing this makes it more likely to happen.

(Shortform note: If you’re not sure of where you want to be in 10 years, consider asking first how much money you want your company to be making at that time. Once you know this, you can think of other, related goals. And others agree you should talk about them as if you _know_ you’ll meet them: Doing this forces you to become more self-aware and thus more specific about how you’ll achieve your goal.)

**Tip 2** : Don’t be afraid to fail at achieving your goal. If you’re afraid of failing, you won’t think expansively enough to create a bold vision. Lahkiani specifically recommends that 50% of your goals should have a 50% chance of failing. Within your company, you should also strive to set goals that succeed only 60 to 80% of the time. If you have a success rate higher than that, it means your goals aren’t big enough.

(Shortform note: A different take on this advice is to set goals that are 10 times bigger than what you initially think is feasible. Grant Cardone proposes this goal-setting method, but, unlike Lakhiani, doesn’t account for the possibility of failure. He believes that if you set huge goals and invest great effort into accomplishing them, you will. Perhaps a compromise between the two takes would be to set 10x bigger goals and assume that 50% of them have a 50% chance of failing.)

#### Foster In-Sync Thinking

Once you’ve hired people who believe in your goals and values, you should then foster an environment where they can easily experience what Lakhiani calls _brain coupling_ : **being totally mentally in sync on an idea or project**. This improves the efficiency of your organization because people can make decisions faster, and it makes employees happier because they feel connected to and understood by co-workers.

As a leader, you can foster in-sync thinking by getting rid of hierarchical communication structures within the company. Let every employee approach any superior, no matter how senior they are. This allows ideas to travel freely between everyone.

(Shortform note: Lakhiani uses the term “brain coupling” to indicate a general sense of being on the same page as someone else. But it’s also a scientific phenomenon in which the brain activity of two people will align when they’re speaking with each other—such that if one person is describing an event she witnessed, the brain of the person listening will respond neurologically as if he witnessed it also. In other words, through speech, two peoples’ brain patterns sync up. This means speech is the main way people can brain couple, making Lakhiani’s recommendation to improve communication by removing hierarchies scientifically valid.)

Lakhianai also recommends encouraging in-sync thinking using the _OODA_ model of decision-making, created by John Boyd, an airforce military strategist. This decision-making model emphasizes speed over accuracy and encourages team members to quickly make decisions without over-analyzing or fully weighing the pros and cons. Though this might allow for more _bad_ decisions, the team will make more _net good_ decisions (in its original use, OODA led air force pilots to fire more bullets overall. This meant a higher percentage of misses, but an even higher percentage of hits than when not using OODA).

In OODA, you don’t wait for perfect information, but quickly forge ahead with the information you _do_ have to make a decision. Once you’ve made a decision, you restart the OODA process to determine if it led to a desirable outcome and change your approach if necessary. When an organization uses OODA, it gets more done faster, which allows the team to move forward in-sync as a whole.

OODA stands for:

  * Observe (Identify a problem or opportunity. For example, if you own a fitness center, you might observe that your older clients don’t sign up for classes.)
  * Orient (Consider what you know and how you might solve the problem. You might determine that hiring older fitness instructors could encourage older clients to attend classes.) 
  * Decide (Collectively agree on a solution. You’d bring this proposal to your team and quickly get their input and assent.)
  * Act (Carry out the solution. You’d hire the older fitness instructors. Then, you’d start OODA over again: Observe if this approach worked and re-orient if necessary. For example, if this doesn’t bring in older clients, you’d scrap the idea. Or if older clients only sign up for yoga classes, you’d hire older fitness instructors to teach only yoga classes.)



> **Alternative Approaches to Decision-Making**
> 
> OODA helps you make a decision quickly __ as a group and then pivot or adjust based on the decision’s outcome. But what if you have to make a decision that doesn’t allow you to pivot or adjust afterward? What if it’s more important to be accurate than to be fast? This could be the personal decision to have kids or a business decision to sell your company—once you’ve made these decisions, you can’t go back on them.
> 
> For such big decisions, it might be better to follow Peter Drucker’s five-step decision-making process. Drucker’s approach is geared toward high-level executives, whose decisions have broad ramifications and generally need to be good rather than expedient. In general, he encourages such executives to make only a few critical decisions and to standardize the less significant choices (perhaps even using OODA). Additionally, he recommends making decisions slowly and deeply considering the requirements it must meet. Use conceptual and strategic thinking when reflecting on the problem, not practical problem-solving. That serves you in OODA-appropriate decisions but not in personally significant decisions.
> 
> Let’s now look at Drucker’s approach and see how it differs from OODA:
> 
> **Step 1:** Assess if the decision is common or special. If it’s a common decision, you can use a standard approach (again, this could be OODA). This isn’t a part of OODA because that process assumes the decision is standard.
> 
> **Step 2:** Decide what the goal of the decision should be and what the constraints on it are. This is arguably similar to “Orient” in OODA—though orienting should likely take less time.
> 
> **Step 3:** When considering what to do, always try to do the _right_ thing, rather than simply make an agreeable compromise. Drucker asserts that you often will have to compromise, but if you start from the ideal outcome and make concessions from there, you’ll end up with a better decision than if you don’t even try to attain the best outcome. In OODA, there’s less emphasis on making the right decision and more emphasis on making _a_ decision. You figure out if that decision was right after having made it.
> 
> **Step 4:** To implement the decision, decide who you need to tell about it, who and what are the next steps, what powers the people implementing those steps must have, and how to measure your success. OODA doesn’t elaborate on this step to this degree, though conceivably, you should also think through these next considerations in the “Decide” phase.
> 
> **Step 5:** Decide how you’ll collect feedback to know if your decision worked. This corresponds to starting OODA over again: Once you’ve made your decision, you “Observe” if it worked.

### How to Merge Spiritual Enlightenment With Disruption

Now that you know how to separately be enlightened and disruptive, let’s look at how to merge enlightenment and disruptiveness in the workplace to turn work into an enjoyable and fulfilling pursuit for you and your employees.

#### Develop a Mission and Rally Employees Behind It

To merge enlightenment with disruption, Lakhiani advises that you **develop a mission to improve the world that will keep employees motivated**. People naturally need missions to fuel their efforts. Without a mission, they have no reason to care about what they’re doing.

This mission should specifically be aimed at positively impacting others. Ask yourself how you can help humanity through what you’re doing—perhaps by providing affordable, sustainable clothing to people around the world. State your mission clearly so both applicants and consumers see what you stand for. Lakhiani notes consumers also expect companies to develop social and political perspectives and to act on those perspectives, so stating your mission is important commercially, as well.

> **Encouraging Different Interpretations of Your Mission**
> 
> Others agree that every company should have a mission to motivate employees, but in _The Fifth Discipline_ , Peter Senge adds that different workers might interpret or approach the mission in different ways, which can be good: It can present you with ways of harnessing your mission you may not have otherwise thought of. For example, if your mission is initially to “Offer sustainable, affordable clothing to people around the world,” one employee might interpret this as selling clothes that have minor flaws at a high discount to reach low-income demographics. You could then incorporate that effort into your mission.
> 
> Senge says it might even be advantageous to note publicly that you solicit input from employees in this way. If consumers read that you not only care about the greater good, but also care about what your employees think, they might be more inclined to spend their money on your products.

#### Make Personal Growth a Top Company Priority

Lakhiani stresses that to make work so enjoyable and fulfilling that it feels like play, you must **create a work environment that’s completely geared toward helping employees grow as people**. Humans only feel happy when they’re improving themselves, so as a leader, make it your top priority to help them do this at work. Not only are your employees happier and more effective, but your business will reap the benefits of your employees’ self-improvement.

To encourage growth, let your team have their mornings to do what they want. This might be to invest in self-improvement projects, catch up on sleep, spend time with family, or go into work, if they choose. Lakhiani writes that at his company, meetings don’t start until 11:30 a.m., and it doesn’t matter to him when employees work, as long as they attend meetings and perform well. When employees have this time for themselves, they tend to be more engaged when they _do_ work.

(Shortform note: To help employees grow at work, you might have to first instill a growth mindset in them. A growth mindset is the belief that you can improve your abilities, and it’s critical in order to achieve any long-term growth in life. In addition to giving your employees mornings to grow on their own, you can also create a growth work culture that lets employees know you believe they have the capacity to improve. You can do this by being open to employees contradicting or challenging you. Doing this indicates you’re OK with being wrong and learning from mistakes and that employees can do this, too. A growth work culture also makes employees more committed and trusting, which compounds their happiness at improving.)

#### Ask Employees to State Their Life Goals, and Support These

In the same way you must stay true to your values (which we discussed in the first part of this guide), **you also want your employees to stay true to theirs so they can be their happiest and most effective selves** , writes Lakhiani. To encourage your whole team to stick to their values, have them publicly write out three life goals: the experiences they want to have, the ways they’d like to grow, and how they’d like to give back to the world. Knowing this helps everyone at the company support each other in achieving those goals.

(Shortform note: Being asked to openly share personal aspirations may seem like an overstep for some employees. Not everyone wants to bare their souls to co-workers. Lakhiani writes his advice based on his experience running his company Mindvalley, which has fostered a unique and intimate culture where such sharing is the norm. But if your company doesn’t have a highly open culture, making goal-setting exercises—and workplace social events in general—optional may be the best way to keep employees happy and effective.)

**Encourage Deep Personal Connections**

Next, **encourage strong personal connections between employees** , writes Lakhiani. This is important to do because personal connection is an evolutionary necessity for all humans, and we’re happier when we’re surrounded by people we like and who care for us. Connectedness also makes us more capable and confident because we can be authentically ourselves and have the support of others.

To foster such connections, Lakhiani proposes making friendships at work a priority. You can do this by hiring according to your values: People who share values are more likely to get along. You can also do this by hosting social events and initiating rituals—like daily gratitude sessions—during which employees can share intimately with each other.

> **Building Connections as an Employee**
> 
> Lakhiani’s advice is for leaders who have a hand in shaping company culture. But individual employees can also take steps to be more connected at work and thus increase their confidence and competence. This may be especially important if your company doesn’t explicitly hire according to its values and you may not have obvious common ground with co-workers.
> 
> For instance, you can eat lunch in a communal area, where you’re likely to run into new people. And you can even start your own interest group if your company doesn’t organize social events or rituals.
> 
> You can also become more connected by resisting the urge to overwork. In _The Happiness Advantage, _Shawn Achor says that many employees feel it’s better to avoid social interactions, both at work and after work, when they have a big project due. But while this may seem responsible, working during lunch and canceling after-work social events just makes you unhappy and thus less likely to succeed on the project.

#### Decide How You Want Your Life to Look Like Based on Your Identity

The final step Lakhiani recommends concerns your _personal_ merging of enlightenment and disruption. He writes that to realize your ideal life based on your identity, values, and purpose, you must disrupt how you think about yourself to establish new, constructive patterns of thought. He provides a three-step process for doing this.

**Step 1:** Describe your ideal day if you were exactly the person you wanted to be. Consider what you’d do in the mornings, what you’d look like, what your work would look like, who your friends are, and so on. Be as detailed as possible.

(Shortform note: What’s the distinction between visualizing your ideal day, as Lakhiani recommends, and _fantasizing_ about it? You visualize when you believe an event can happen in the future, and you _fantasize_ when you don’t believe that event can actually happen. Steer clear of fantasies in this exercise, as they won’t help you achieve a realistic future life.)

**Step 2:** Ask what sort of person you’d have to become to live this ideal day. Reflect on four dimensions and secondary factors of this person:

  * Well-being: Describe your physical health, mental health, and emotional health. Do you feel energetic? What emotions do you feel over the course of the day?
  * Creativity: How well can you access a state of concentration and enjoyment when working? How easy is it for you to focus on your goals? How clearly have you defined your purpose?
  * Material well-being and life control: Are you financially comfortable? Can you handle your work and personal projects? Do solutions to problems come easily to you?
  * Relationships: Do you have mutually beneficial relationships with friends and co-workers? Are there people who care about you? Can you be authentically yourself?



(Shortform note: This step seems as if it would elicit the same answers from all humans. For instance, when asked to think about future physical health, everyone would say they want to be in _good_ health. No one wants to be in poor or average health. Similarly, everyone wants to be able to focus well, be financially well-off, and have good relationships. The key to making this a valuable exercise step is perhaps to consider each category more globally and neutrally, asking yourself to simply describe your well-being, creative life, material well-being, and relationships. This makes room for more individualized reflection and avoids simple binary answers.)

**Step 3** : Now, assume the identity of this person by asking yourself questions as if you already possess the above-listed traits. For example, if you wrote in step 2 that the ideal version of yourself has many caring friends, you might ask yourself: “Why do I have such deep, loving relationships?” Asking such questions forces your subconscious to answer them—this is an automatic reaction. In this example, your subconscious might answer: “Because I’m a compassionate, thoughtful friend and invest heavily into my friendships.”

When your subconscious answers such questions, you’ll notice more opportunities to live out those answers. For instance, you might meet someone new and have the chance to become a compassionate, thoughtful friend to them. Lakhiani admits he’s not sure how this happens—if the Universe presents you with opportunities or if your brain simply becomes more attuned to such opportunities—but he’s confident that either way, this process works.~~ ~~

For each of the dimensions you listed in step two, write five to 10 such “why” questions.

> **Asking the Universe to Give Back: Comparing Lakhiani’s Approach to _The Secret_**
> 
> The third step of this exercise contains echoes of ideas in Rhonda Byrne’s _The Secret, _in which she discusses how to use the “Law of Attraction” to invite good things into your life. Both approaches place heavy emphasis on _asking_ as a step toward self-actualization, but they differ in the specifics of _where to direct your questions_.
> 
> In _The Secret,_you ask the Universe for what you want (“I want to be able to travel half the year”) and in Lakhiani’s exercise, you ask _yourself_ questions (“Why can I travel half the year?”). For Byrne then, you can place complete faith in the Universe and its ability to respond to your request. Conversely, for Lakhiani, you place faith in yourself: Your subconscious __ must __ provide your own response to your question.
> 
> However, once this is done, the two approaches may converge. Byrne believes the Universe conspires to fulfill your request, and Lakhiani believes this might be the case, too (though he writes that he’s not sure if it’s the Universe intervening or your brain becoming more attuned to opportunities). In essence, these two approaches are similar, save that Lakhiani has an intermediate stage in which you force yourself to explain how and why you’ll achieve your ideal life.
