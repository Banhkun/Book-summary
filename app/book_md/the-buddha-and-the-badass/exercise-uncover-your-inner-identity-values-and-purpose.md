## Exercise: Uncover Your Inner Identity, Values, and Purpose

Determine your inner identity, values, and purpose to start leading a more spiritually enlightened life.

* * *

Clarify your inner identity by listing eight to 12 important experiences you’ve had in your life. These should be events that significantly changed you or the way you see the world. They can be both positive and negative events, though, according to Lakhiani, negative events usually come with more personal growth and learning.

Now, for each of those eight to 12 life experiences, reflect on what values have emerged as a result. How did you grow or change your thinking in response to that life event? Write down one value for each experience. Then, group similar values into categories, and assign the category a name. (A category name might be something like “Love” or “Unity.”)

As Lakhiani says, purpose often comes to you in the form of an intuition, so it’s OK if you can’t suss out a purpose just now—you can return to this exercise when it’s become clearer to you.
