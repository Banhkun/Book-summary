## Part 4: Becoming a B and I

Now that you understand the four “cashflow quadrants” and the logic behind why it’s easier to generate wealth in the B and I categories, we can move on to learning _how_ to break into and succeed in the B and I categories.

To Kiyosaki, success in the B and I categories is as much about finance and business skills as it is being emotionally prepared to make big life changes, take risks, and maintain determination and flexibility.

In this chapter, we’ll start with Kiyosaki’s actionable advice for getting started in the B and I categories. Then, we’ll discuss the mental skills he says are just as important.

### How to Break Into the B Category

Kiyosaki recommends the B category because it’s a far likelier path to wealth than working in the E or S categories because you can take advantage of **other people’s time** to generate wealth.

Kiyosaki says you have two choices when trying to establish yourself in the B category: **create your own business system, or buy one that already exists.**

Kiyosaki offers four routes to owning your own system in the B category:

**1\. Find a mentor in the kind of business you want to enter.** Remember Kiyosaki’s warning about whose advice you take. Make sure your mentor has actually succeeded in the field you want to enter and isn’t just someone who gets paid to dispense advice. (You’d be taking advice about being a B from a person who is an E—not a good idea, according to Kiyosaki.)

If you can do it, finding a mentor is one of the best ways to learn how to succeed in the B and I categories. A mentor will help you sift through the noise and will teach you what’s really important. Not only will a mentor teach you what they know, they can also be a sounding board and a guide as you learn by doing. Be sure your mentor is successful in the field you want to enter, not a professional advisor you’re paying.

(Shortform note: Research shows that having a mentor makes you better at your work, happier doing your work, and more likely to move up in your career. Three-quarters of people say having a mentor would help them, but more than half of people don’t have one. Once you scour your networks for a good candidate, experts recommend starting small and asking for an informational interview first. If the first meeting goes well, have specific goals your mentor can help you achieve, and make follow-up plans to keep the relationship going and hold yourself accountable.)

**2\. Work for a company in the field you want to work in for 10-15 years.** After that amount of time, Kiyosaki says you’ll understand all the elements of that kind of business system and be ready to strike out on your own.

(Shortform note: The company you work for today could be your competition in the future. Even if your employer won’t be a primary competitor, you can learn a lot from studying competitors that sell to a slightly different audience, or that offer a different but related product.)

**3\. Buy a franchise**. In the above two strategies, you’re learning to build a business system. _When you own a franchise, the system already exists_. Your job is to make sure the people who work for you are running the system as best as possible.

If you go this route, you have to do it by the book. Franchises aren’t for people looking to be creative in business.

> **Pitfalls of Buying a Franchise**
> 
> In addition to having to follow someone else’s rigid rules for a business you own, there are a few other common pitfalls for franchisees:
> 
>   * **Hidden costs.** Make sure you’re aware of all the fees you may be on the hook for when you buy a franchise, in addition to the share of profits you have to pay back to the company you franchised from.
> 
>   * **Misleading success statistics.** Average revenue statistics may make your chances look better than they really are, because stand-out franchisees may be skewing a pool that actually earns much less. Franchises perform differently according to geography, so make sure you’re researching franchises in your area.
> 
>   * **Noncompete requirements**. You may be barred from working in the same business sector for a certain amount of time or for a certain period of time after you sell your franchise.
> 
> 


**4\. Try network marketing**. Also called multi-level marketing, network marketing**** is another way to join a _pre-existing business system_ , and it can be a good choice because you don’t need nearly as much capital (Kiyosaki says you can buy into a reputable network marketing organization for as little as $200). You also don’t need as much business acumen as you do when you buy a franchise, and the organization you work with can offer you valuable business education.

Network marketing gets a bad rap, but Kiyosaki says that if you can find an organization that aims to develop your business skills, leadership skills, and confidence, the experience can be well worth it. When you’re researching organizations, you should:

  * Make sure the organization is interested in developing _you_ , not in having you rope as many friends as possible into the organization so they can make more money in startup fees. 
  * Choose based on the quality of education and support they’ll offer you, not on the product. (But do make sure you believe in the product, so you’re doing work you can believe in.) 
  * Make sure you’ll be working with people you like and respect. 



> **Network Marketing Red Flags**
> 
> Some network marketing schemes are scams and can be classified as pyramid schemes. Like Kiyosaki alludes to, single-tier systems are safer than multi-tier systems, where top-tier salespeople make money off lower-tier salespeople and which can be pyramid schemes. Make sure you’re being paid from your product sales, not for recruiting others. Other red flags for pyramid schemes include:
> 
>   * **Claims of extremely high earning potential.** If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
> 
>   * **Pressure from promoters.** If anyone connected to the organization makes you feel like you’re under time pressure to make decisions or start working, they’re probably not reputable.
> 
>   * **Distributors buy more product than they’ll sell.** This is a sign that the way to make money at that organization isn’t directly connected to how much product you sell.
> 
> 


Note that **MBAs** are _not_ one of Kiyosaki’s four routes to owning your own business: They’re a great way to get technical skills and a “fast track” to high management, but don’t teach you the full picture of what it really means to run a B category business.

(Shortform note: MBA programs also value real-world experience in their application processes. It may pay off to get some business experience before pursuing an advanced business degree.)

### How to Break Into the I Category

**Investing is how you generate passive income. Passive income is the key to wealth and is essential for financial freedom.**

At its core, **investing is putting your money into things that you think will make you more money: assets**. Key to investing is _being good at investing._ As we learned in Part 3, risk comes from lack of information. According to Kiyosaki, the risk in investing is investing without enough financial literacy or good information. If you can manage risk by educating yourself, investing is nowhere near as scary as it’s made out to be.

##### Get Out of Debt, Raise Some Money

Very simply, you need money to be able to invest. If you’re in significant debt, especially with high interest, it makes sense to reduce or pay off all your debt before you start investing. According to Kiyosaki, debt management is an integral financial skill and is an important part of cashflow management.

Kiyosaki recommends this strategy for getting out of debt:

1\. If you have credit card debt, use only one or two cards and pay off all new charges each month.

2\. Earn an extra $150-$250 per month and use it to pay off one card. (Kiyosaki says if you can’t earn an extra $150 per month, the B and I categories are probably not for you.) Pay the minimum balance on all your other cards.

(Shortform note: Sethi notes that because your monthly minimum payment is a proportion of the balance, as you pay more and the balance decreases, so does your payment. If you keep making the same flat payment for the duration of your debt, you’ll pay it off faster and save money on interest.)

3\. Once you pay off one card in full, move on to the others. Continue until all cards are paid.

4\. Once all your credit cards are paid off, or if you don’t have credit card debt, use the same strategy with other debt, like your mortgage, car payments, or student loans.

5\. Once you’re sufficiently out of debt, use the money you were putting towards your debt toward your investments.

If you don’t have debt, **just put that extra $150-$250 per month toward your investments.**

> **Another Strategy for Paying Off Credit Card Debt**
> 
> Sethi offers an alternative (and more comprehensive) strategy for getting out of debt:
> 
>   * Add up your total debt. Make sure you have a big-picture view of everything you owe. Note the APR (Annual Percentage Rate, which means interest rate plus any fees you have to pay) and the minimum payment for each debt.
> 
>   * Decide whether to pay the card with the highest APR, which will save you the most money because you’ll save on interest, or the card with the lowest balance, to bolster your confidence by paying off a card quickest.
> 
>   * Negotiate a better APR. Your credit card company wants to keep your business.
> 
>   * Increase your monthly payments by diverting money from another spending category.
> 
> 


##### What Kind of Investor Should You Be?

Depending on whether you’re aiming for financial security, independence, or freedom, Kiyosaki has different investing advice for you.

**1\. The Client** is someone who pays a professional to invest their money. You put up the money, but you don’t make the decisions. While Kiyosaki encourages you to try to invest on your own, he says if you don’t have the will or the talent to do so, this is your path.

  * Make sure the person you’re paying makes most of their money investing, not off fees. Why would you trust someone to invest your money when they don’t even invest their own?



(Shortform note: Sethi agrees that unless you have a very complicated financial situation, hiring a financial advisor will cause you to lose money in fees while getting the same results you could learn to earn on your own. Sethi notes that mutual fund managers only “beat the market” 25% of the time. In addition to finding a no-fee financial advisor, Sethi says to make sure your advisor is a fiduciary—someone who is legally obligated to put your financial interests first.)

**2\. The DIY Investor.** You do your own research and make your own decisions about where to invest _your own money._ That is the key feature of the DIY investor and the key difference between this and the next level, the Capitalist.

  * DIY investors buy and sell their own stocks. In real estate, they buy, sell, and manage their own properties. 
  * To begin investing in the stock market, call stockbrokers and ask for their guidance, then open a small trading account. 



> **Ramit Sethi on Investing in the Stock Market**
> 
> Kiyosaki is shorter on specifics for investing than Sethi. Sethi recommends starting with stock market investing, beginning with mutual and index funds, or, if you’re willing to sacrifice some profit for ease, investing in target-date funds.
> 
> 1) Choose Your Own Portfolio
> 
>   * Start with mutual funds and index funds. A fund is a group of many different kinds of stocks and bonds that you invest in all at once.
> 
>     * Mutual funds are under _active_ management, which means fund managers choose which investments to include. Mutual funds can sometimes produce great returns for a 1-2 year period, but in exchange for having a human choose your investments, you have to pay a significant amount in fees. Kiyosaki does mention mutual funds, but only to say they’re risky.
> 
>     * Index funds are under _passive_ management, which means an algorithm creates a fund out of a section of the stock market, like the NASDAQ, which is a technology index. In the long term, Sethi says index funds are a better investment because they have very low fees.
> 
> 

> 
> 2) Invest in Target Date Funds
> 
>   * Instead of managing your own portfolio of stocks, bonds, and individual funds, you can invest using target-date funds. Target date funds are funds made of funds, and recalibrate as you get closer to retirement. 
> 


**3\. The Capitalist.** By Kiyosaki’s definition, capitalists straddle two categories: They’re both big-business owners _and_ investors. Whereas the DIY investor invests her own money, capitalists invest _other people’s money_. (Because they’re successful business people, banks and investors are more willing to loan them larger sums of money, which the capitalist invests.) You need to have the highest level of financial literacy to reach this level.

(Shortform note: You don’t need to be a capitalist to invest with other people’s money. You can get a personal loan to use to invest, but you’ll need to show you’re credible with a good credit score to get a good interest rate. You can improve your credit score by paying at least the minimum on your credit cards each month, working toward paying off your debt, and opening and closing new cards judiciously.)

##### Investing Advice

**1\. Invest in what you know.** Kiyosaki says that wealthy people don’t diversify their assets, and you shouldn’t either. He says it’s better to choose one, or just a few, investment categories so you can become deeply knowledgeable about them and make smarter investments.

(Shortform note: In _I Will Teach You To Be Rich_ , Sethi strongly advocates diversifying your investments across both asset classes, like stocks and bonds, and the type of asset within each class. For example, he recommends investing in stocks of both small and large companies and a mix of short and long-term bonds from different issuers. He says diversifying your investments allows you to balance riskier investments with safer investments, and that the way you diversify your portfolio matters more than exactly what is in it.)

**2\. Move Your Money.** Successful investors keep their money on the move. The concept of the “velocity of money” describes how your money should move: like an avalanche that grows larger as it picks up new assets.

(Shortform note: Technically, the term “velocity of money” means the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. The healthier an economy, the more money is exchanged as people spend more on goods and services.)

**3\. Don’t follow the crowd.** Don’t invest in something just because it’s popular. No one knows for sure what will be a good investment.

(Shortform note: Be particularly aware of possible speculative bubbles, where investors ignore rational valuations and invest based on logic other than intrinsic value. The classic example of a speculative bubble, as Burton Malkiel notes in _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_ , is tulip-mania in 17th-century Holland.)

**4\. Blue Chip Stocks Aren’t Safe.** Even though these stocks are generally considered less risky, they’re not invulnerable.

(Shortform note: Blue chip stocks are very large, well-established companies with good reputations for investor earnings. It’s a bad idea to invest _only_ in blue chip stocks, though, for the reason Kiyosaki gives above.)

### The Crucial Mental Skills for the B and I Categories

Now that we’ve covered Kiyosaki’s hard advice for breaking into the B and I categories, here we’ll focus on the soft skills central to the B and I categories and explain why Kiyosaki says **a good relationship to money, risk, and yourself is key to being able to generate wealth.**

#### Become Financially Literate

**As we noted in Part 4, ours is a world run by people who understand how money works. If you don’t, you’re vulnerable. People who understand how money works get their income from the B and I categories because they know it’s the best choice for generating wealth.** If you’re aiming to make your living in the B and I categories, it’s imperative to be fluent in money. Remember, you need to actively take charge of acquiring a financial education because it’s likely that your parents and education didn’t adequately prepare you.

1\. Learn by _doing_ , and by failing. Kiyosaki says the best way to learn in the B and I categories is by actually doing some business and investing. Making mistakes is an integral part of the learning process. When you make a mistake and then work to understand why it was a mistake, you’re doing some of the best learning.

(Shortform note: In business, learning on the fly never stops, because you have to adapt as the business environment changes in ways you may not ever be able to predict.)

2\. If it makes sense for you, continue in your formal education. Go to classes and seminars about topics that interest you. If you’re academically inclined, get a degree in a B and I field.

(Shortform note: But remember that an MBA may not be worth the money, especially in a post-Covid world.)

3\. Talk to people who do what you want to do or have information about your field. Do your own research. Read business news and newsletters. You need to understand the current market and legal environment you’ll be working in.

(Shortform note: When Kiyosaki wrote _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant_ , the internet was nowhere near as ubiquitous as it is now. Email newsletters can be a great way to learn about investing or a particular industry. They can also help you cut through the seemingly endless advice on the internet.)

4\. Learn history, especially economic history, because history repeats itself. By having some knowledge of history, you’ll be able to put the current moment in context.

(Shortform note: Many academics, business leaders, and government financial officials agree that both undergraduates and graduates need more training in economic history. They emphasize that students need to understand the frequency and magnitude of economic disturbances in the past, so they’re adequately prepared for their possibility in the future.)

##### Learn to Love Learning

Many people who excel in business, and many other fields, were poor students in their traditional education. According to Kiyosaki, school creates an environment where students are afraid to fail and failure is punished. “A” students never failed in school, and so they become adults who are afraid to experience failure. “C” students already got over the shock of not being the best every time. For that reason, _they’re more willing to take risks_ , which is key to success in the B and I categories.

(Shortform note: While there isn’t research to back up this business legend, other commentators add that “C” students are less likely to be perfectionists, which benefits them in business, where nothing ever goes perfectly. They also note that “C” students may have had lackluster grades because they devoted time to developing passions outside of school, which shows curiosity and determination. At the same time, Kiyosaki specifically notes that getting an MBA from an _elite_ institution is a good way to break into the B category. “A” students are more likely to find their way to a top-tier business school.)

Many skills important in business and money-making (and life in general) aren’t taught in school and are often more important than an A in advanced English or trigonometry.

Kiyosaki emphasizes that we need to learn to love learning, but that some of the most important learning happens outside of traditional education. It’s vital to figure out what _you want_ to learn about, and _how_ you want to learn about it. It may look nothing like sitting in a classroom.

(Shortform note: Kiyosaki name-checks Daniel Goleman’s book _Emotional Intelligence_. Goleman argues that success in life is determined only 20% by IQ and 80% by other factors. Emotional intelligence, which he defines as the ability to understand and govern your emotions, counts for part of that other 80% and is an important business skill.)

#### Get Over Your Fear of Money

Before you can make _any_ change to your financial situation, Kiyosaki emphasizes that you need to have a healthy relationship with money. Kiyosaki says fear of money—fear that you don’t understand it, fear that you won’t have enough, fear of taking financial risks, or a thousand other worries related to money—makes sense. Money is core to survival, impacts virtually every part of our lives, and is the difference between freedom and freefall.

But Kiyosaki says fear of money impairs our journey in two ways:

  1. Fear of money can cause us not to act at all. Kiyosaki says this is a particular issue for people transitioning from the E and S, who are used to the academic method of gathering as much information as possible before making a decision. This doesn’t work in the B and I categories, Kiyosaki says, because learning by doing is so important. 
  2. Fear of money causes us to make decisions based on emotion, not logic. Emotion-based decisions are rarely the best, or even good, financial decisions. 



> **Strategies for Overcoming Fear of Money**
> 
> In _Your Money or Your Life_ , Vicki Robin agrees that a core part of financial freedom is freedom from fear and worry about money. She argues that **by consciously connecting money to your values, purpose, and dreams, you can diffuse some of your financial anxiety.**
> 
> Sethi offers three ways to overcome financial anxiety:
> 
>   * **Trust your own judgment.** Not every financial risk or spending decision is a slippery slope to financial ruin.
> 
>   * **Know you can earn your money back.** Instead of thinking of your money as a stockpile you can’t dip into, remember that you often need to spend money to earn money, and that you _should_ be spending some of your money on things you enjoy.
> 
>   * **Don’t be over-afraid of wasting money.** Not every decision you make will be the most economical, and not everything you spend money on will be worth it. While you need to be conscious of waste, if you’re living a full and curious life and taking appropriate risks with money, you _will_ have to waste some money in the process.
> 
> 


#### Take Action, One Step at a Time

Learning to succeed in the B and I categories is a long process. But you’ll never learn, and never succeed, if you don’t try. In fact, Kiyosaki says on-the-job experience and especially mistakes are the best learning.

  1. Take baby steps. Move incrementally and build your wealth as you build your skills. Don’t bite off more than you can chew—you could lose it all. 
     * You’ll get positive reinforcement when you complete a small step. 
  2. Avoid paralysis by analysis. If you don’t even try, you’ll never ever begin to see benefits. You can’t have all the answers or full confidence before you start, because you need to learn by doing. No one has all the answers or full confidence all the time. 
     * This is a symptom of our no-mistakes-allowed education system and afflicts people with more education. 
  3. Think long term, don’t expect immediate results, and let the magic of compounding systems or money do its work. Know it’s a long game. 



> **Break It Down**
> 
> Kiyosaki emphasizes that the journey to financial security and freedom is a marathon, not a sprint. James Clear’s concept of “atomic habits” from his book by the same name is useful for breaking down a big undertaking into smaller parts. **Atomic habits are small (atom-sized) adjustments that are easier to start and will eventually compound into changed behavior.** Clear identifies three types of motivation that create different habits, which can all be useful when working up to big financial changes.
> 
> **Outcome-driven habits** form around a goal. While it’s crucial to set a goal, whether it be financial security, financial independence, or financial freedom, just working toward one large goal doesn’t necessarily integrate it into your everyday behaviors, or your sense of self.
> 
> **Process-based habits** form around a system. Thinking about your _habits as a network of actions that are inherently a part of the goal_ elevates the work __ and makes you more likely to stick with it. Instead of narrowly focusing on financial independence and how much you have left to earn and save before you achieve it, you could try to consider financial research, networking, and managing your investments as a core part of the process.
> 
> **Identity-based habits** form around your self-conception. Combined with process-based habits, this is perhaps the most effective kind of habit because it taps into your sense of self. You’re most likely to stick with habits like reading investment newsletters and taking on increasing amounts of managed risk if you decide those activities are _part of who you are_.

#### Believe in Yourself

Earlier in this guide, we discussed the importance of understanding the logic of the B and I categories; of _thinking_ like a B/I category earner. Kiyosaki puts equal emphasis on cultivating the emotional constitution to succeed in the B and I categories; on _feeling_ like a B/I category earner.

1\. Attitude and affirmations matter. If you think you’ll be poor, you’re more likely to be. **Set yourself up for success by _expecting_ to be successful **in the long run. At the same time, **expect disappointment.** If you’re not making a mistake or failing at least once and a while (and probably a lot more), you’re probably not taking enough action or enough risk.

(Shortform note: In _The Power of Positive Thinking_ , Norman Vincent Peale says you need to cultivate _belief_ in the face of a difficult undertaking, even if you have doubt. To cultivate belief, he says you need to genuinely want what you’re trying to accomplish, have a clear goal, and visualize the _best_ outcome, not just a good one.)

2\. **Have determination.** Succeeding in the B and I categories is a marathon, not a sprint. Your ability to succeed depends on your ability to respond to challenges without being knocked off your path. At the same time, **cut yourself some slack and practice self-care.** Because it is a marathon and not a sprint, you won’t make it to the finish line if you’re completely worn out.

(Shortform note: In her book _Grit_ , Angela Duckworth argues that between two people with equal ability, the grittier person will achieve more success, and that grit is a skill that can be honed with practice.)
