## Part 1: Why Wealth Matters

In _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant,_ Robert Kiyosaki argues that to generate wealth, _what kind of income you generate_ is more important than _how much income_ you generate, or what kind of work you do. Kiyosaki uses the stories of his now-famous “Rich Dad” (his friend’s father) and “Poor Dad” (his own father) to illustrate how different income _types_ lead to different results.

He divides income into four categories, which he calls “cashflow quadrants”:

  1. Employees (E)
  2. The self-employed and small business owners (S)
  3. Big business owners (B)
  4. Investors (I)



According to Kiyosaki, the first two income categories, employees (E) and the self-employed and small business owners (S), are usually dead-ends on the road to wealth. The other two categories, big business owners (B) and investors (I),**are the most conducive to accumulating wealth because those are the categories in which you can develop income-generating assets**. _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant_ is about moving from the E and S categories to the B and I categories, or at least adding I income to existing E or S income.

We’ll dive into the four income categories in Parts 2 and 3, but first you need to understand that wealth is about more than just money. In this section, we’ll explain why Kiyosaki says more wealth equals more freedom, why you don’t need to strive for billions to take advantage of the income generation strategies of the B and I categories, and why you shouldn’t feel guilty about wanting wealth.

### More Wealth Equals More Freedom

Robert Kiyosaki has been rich and has been poor. Rich is better, he says, because _the more money you have, the freer you are to pursue life on your own terms._

#### Money Is Time

It goes without saying how more wealth equals more time and greater resources. The more money you have, the less time you have to spend working for it. And the more money you have, the more money you have to spend doing what it is you want to do. To Kiyosaki, being able to spend all your time doing exactly what you want is freedom.

One of the key differences between Kiyosaki’s “Rich Dad” and “Poor Dad” is in the relationship between their career trajectories and the amount of free time they had. As Rich Dad, a businessman and investor, excelled in his career, he had more and more time to spend with his family and on his passions. As Poor Dad, actually an upper-middle-class public education official in the E and S categories, excelled in his career, he had to work harder and longer hours, because he was given more work and responsibility.

In summary, **the harder Poor Dad worked, the poorer he was in time. The harder Rich Dad worked, the more free time he gained.**

(Shortform note: Other authors offer different reasons to try to attain wealth. In contrast to Kiyosaki’s emphasis on the free time wealth brings, Ramit Sethi, who we’ll continue to reference throughout this guide, explains his concept of a “rich life” in his book _I Will Teach You To Be Rich_. A “rich life” emphasizes the specific reasons _you_ want to reach your financial goals—what particular things you could do with more money that would create a life that is fulfilling to _you_.)

#### Money Is Freedom

Freedom to spend your time the way you want isn’t the only type of freedom wealth brings. According to Kiyosaki, the ultimate goal of building wealth is a step further— _financial_ freedom. To Kiyosaki, **financial freedom means never _having_ to work again.** The financially free can do nearly whatever they want, whenever they want, because money is almost never an obstacle.

While Kiyosaki focuses on how to achieve 1-percenter, capitalist-level financial freedom, where all your time is yours and almost nothing is out of reach, he says **the principles he puts forward are equally useful for reaching financial _security_**. Even if you’re not willing to commit yourself to the risks and lifestyle it takes to achieve financial freedom, Kiyosaki thinks that, at minimum, you should strive for a life where concerns about money don’t dictate the way you live.

Ultimately, Kiyosaki wants you to **transcend job security,** where your life is defined by the dollar amount on your paycheck and the parameters of your day-to-day work. To Kiyosaki, if all you have is job security, all you have is job dependency.

> **Financial Freedom vs. Financial Independence**
> 
> In contrast to Kiyosaki’s focus on financial freedom, Sethi, and most of the personal finance community, stress the importance of “financial independence.” This is the point at which your passive income can pay for all your expenses and you no longer have to work. Financial independence offers more freedom, as Kiyosaki defines it, than financial security, because you no longer need to work.
> 
> When Kiyosaki talks about financial freedom, he’s usually talking about capitalist-level wealth. In contrast, financial independence _can_ mean 1% level wealth, but since it only means that your passive income is greater than your expenses, you can be financially independent with much less wealth. Some of this difference between “financial freedom” and “financial independence” is semantic, but it’s useful to know what these terms are most likely referring to when you hear them.

### It’s Good to Want Wealth

Kiyosaki says there’s no shame in wanting to be rich. For one thing, he says, more wealth means more freedom, and no one can be blamed for wanting freedom.

Some people argue that wanting wealth and taking part in our capitalist system is immoral. While Kiyosaki allows that our system has significant flaws that create inequality, he says it’s easier to beat the system by generating wealth than it is to change the system to make it fairer. There are many reasons Kiyosaki thinks wealth accumulation is actually moral:

  * Kiyosaki says there’s nothing particularly moral about being beholden to a job you hate, lack of funds, or debt. 
  * Because learning to generate wealth requires delayed gratification and living below your means, trying to become rich will teach you financial self-control. 
  * In fact, he says that by not striving at least for financial security, you set a bad example for your kids, who will inherit your attitude toward money. 
  * Kiyosaki argues that generating massive amounts of wealth is actually generous. 



> **Trickle-Down Economics and the Morality of Wealth**
> 
> Kiyosaki isn’t alone in asserting that accumulating wealth is a moral imperative. This belief is in line with the conservative theory of trickle-down economics. Trickle-down theory posits that the ownership class (also known as the asset-owning capitalists who are very successful in the B and I categories, which we’ll cover in Part 3), creates jobs for the middle and lower classes and therefore should be rewarded with lower taxes and less regulation.
> 
> Critics of trickle-down economics attribute it to growing income inequality. Instead of creating jobs, they say, giving benefits to the already-rich just makes them richer and deprives everyone else of resources they need. A 2020 London School of Economics study found that over 50 years in 18 wealthy countries, tax cuts mostly benefited the rich and had little effect on unemployment or economic growth. Many economists say tax cuts for the lower and middle classes are better for the economy.
> 
> While accumulating wealth may help you get out of debt, develop self-control, and teach your kids how to save, it’s unclear that the mere fact of _having_ wealth is a moral good.
