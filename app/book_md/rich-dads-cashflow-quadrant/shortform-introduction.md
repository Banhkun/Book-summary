## Shortform Introduction

Most people believe that the key to wealth is getting a “good,” high-paying job. But according to Robert Kiyosaki, the _type of income_ you generate is more important than the _type of work_ you do. Kiyosaki identifies four categories of income, which he calls “cashflow quadrants.” They are:

  1. Employees (E)
  2. The self-employed and small business owners (S)
  3. Big business owners (B)
  4. Investors (I)



Kiyosaki argues that generating income from the B and I categories, rather than the traditional E and S categories, is the best path to wealth: **Generate capital in business and invest it in assets so you can develop streams of passive income.**

Kiyosaki wrote this book for people who are, as the saying goes, **tired of working hard for their money, and not letting their money work for them.**

### About the Author

Robert T. Kiyosaki was born in 1947 in Hawaii. He is a motivational speaker, real estate investor, and the author of the best-selling personal finance book of all time, _Rich Dad Poor Dad_. The book held a place on the New York Times Bestseller list for six years and has been translated into more than forty languages. _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant_ is one of 14 books in the _Rich Dad_ series, which together have sold over 26 million copies.

Before becoming a personal finance author and personality, Kiyosaki developed the educational board game CASHFLOW and founded his brand, The Rich Dad Company, with his wife, Kim Kiyosaki. In 2006 and 2011, Kiyosaki published books on personal finance and entrepreneurship with Donald Trump. Kiyosaki maintains a public presence and continues to make headlines, commenting on personal finance and politics.

Sharon Lechter co-wrote _Rich Dad Poor Dad, Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant_ , and most of Kiyosaki’s other books in the Rich Dad series. She’s an accountant and a businesswoman and was appointed to a position on the President's Advisory Council on Financial Literacy in the Bush Administration. In the late 2010s, she sued Kiyosaki for cutting her out of her share of profit from their Rich Dad work and settled for $10 million.

### The Book’s Publication and Context

Publisher: Warner Books 

_Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant: Guide to Financial Freedom_ , published in 1998, is the sequel to Robert Kiyosaki’s 1997 blockbuster, _Rich Dad Poor Dad_. The _Rich Dad Poor Dad_ series is part of a movement in popular personal finance books away from offering techniques for living below your means and saving as a strategy for building wealth. Instead, the _Rich Dad_ books and others like it emphasize that to become rich, you need to learn to _think_ like a rich person. Rich people, according to Kiyosaki, understand that the key to generating wealth is generating passive income.

Kiyosaki’s politics, which inform and appear in his books, range between libertarian and conservative. His anti-taxation, anti-entitlement, pro-gold standard positions shape his books, including _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant._

The central principles in _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant_ and _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_ are the same: The best way to achieve wealth is to eschew prioritizing security and working hard at a “good job” in favor of cultivating boldness and learning to manage the risk of investing so you can create passive income. _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant_ uses the idea of four income categories to make clear how the _type_ of income you earn is central to generating wealth.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Many reviewers consider the _Rich Dad, Poor Dad_ books to be at least as much self-help as they are financial advice. Slate identifies the similarities the _Rich Dad_ books, including _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant_ , share with other popular self-help books, like _Who Moved My Cheese_ and _Fish_ :

  * A disclaimer that the advice given isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme. (In a weight-loss book, for example, an author would claim that the book isn’t about getting skinny quick but rather a holistic approach to health.) 
  * An emphasis on the idea that the rich (or confident, or happy, or some other desirable category) have information that the rest of us don’t have. 
  * An emphasis on the idea that the path to wealth (replace “wealth” with anything else you might want to accomplish) lies in going against the grain in some way. 
  * Information delivered as general principles instead of highly specific actionables. 
  * And, of course, a memorable schtick. 



Kiyosaki’s Rich and Poor Dads and their conflicting advice have indeed proved memorable and are often credited for the _Rich Dad_ books’ enduring popularity. Kiyosaki’s personal anecdotes about his own life and those of his Rich and Poor Dads feature heavily in _Rich Dad’s Cashflow Quadrant_. While written in an engaging everyman style, Kiyosaki’s anecdotes can be more entertaining than instructive: He often fashions his personal anecdotes as parables, though the average person would have an exceedingly hard time replicating his circumstances.

#### Critical Reception

The _Rich Dad_ books have appealed to millions. Many readers credit the _Rich Dad_ books with waking them up to the concept of passive income in the first place. Others appreciate Kiyosaki’s motivational persona, saying it inspired them to better manage their finances and learn about investing.

The books also have their fair share of critics, who are skeptical of the authenticity of Kiyosaki’s anecdotes and of the practicality of his advice. By Kiyosaki’s own admission, the books are less a step-by-step guide to achieving wealth than a readable, engaging rundown of the core concepts and values about money Kiyosaki says you need to rethink. The downside to that, and perhaps the most common critique of the _Rich Dad_ series, is that the books can lack convincing supporting evidence. Rather than offering considered arguments for his advice, critics maintain that he relies on platitudes, political talking points, and unverifiable anecdotes.

Beyond insufficient evidence, some reviewers criticize Kiyosaki for peddling controversial advice that can be dangerous for the novice entrepreneur or investor that the book targets. Among other contrarian claims, Kiyosaki argues that a 401(k) is a terrible investment and that your house is a liability, not an asset.

Much has also been made of Kiyosaki’s personal wealth. A common criticism of Kiyosaki (and other celebrity personal finance personalities) is that the bulk of his wealth comes not from his business investments, as he claims, but from his Rich Dad brand. Furthermore, commentators have long questioned whether the Rich Dad persona the brand revolves around is real; in 2003, Kiyosaki apparently admitted in a magazine interview that he didn’t see why “Rich Dad” had to be any more real than Harry Potter, though his books are clearly marketed as non-fiction.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Kiyosaki can be repetitive, and he introduces concepts circularly. We’ve cut through Kiyosaki’s sometimes meandering writing and anecdotes to more clearly represent his core argument.

We also provide context, opposing arguments, and consensus opinion for Kiyosaki’s more controversial claims and note when Kiyosaki’s evidence is based on political ideology. We will often contrast Kiyosaki’s advice with Ramit Sethi’s in his personal finance book _I Will Teach You To Be Rich_. While Kiyosaki’s advice is contrarian, overpromises, and has a decidedly conservative bent, Sethi’s represents the consensus opinion regarding what constitutes good personal finance advice for the average person.
