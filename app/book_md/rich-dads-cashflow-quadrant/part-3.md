## Part 3: Big Business Owners and Investors—Why the Way to Wealth Is in the B and I Categories

Kiyosaki says that while lower-, middle-, and even upper-middle-class parents teach their kids the out-of-date financial path we just outlined, rich parents teach their kids the income generation strategy of the B and I categories.

While in the E and S categories you generate income in exchange for the _work you do_ ,**in the B and I categories income comes primarily from _assets you own._ According to Kiyosaki, this is the surer path to financial freedom.**

In this chapter, we’ll lay the foundation for understanding how the B and I categories work. First, we’ll define how income is generated in the B and I categories, and discuss the traits you need to succeed in these categories. Then, we’ll review how B and I income is different from E and S income, and discuss _why_ B and I income is the way to wealth. In chapter 4, we’ll cover _how_ to succeed in the B and I categories.

### Big Business Owner (B)

People working in this category control not only a business, but a _business system_. If they leave, the work still gets done. People in the B category own their business and generate income by its profit, though they no longer do the day-to-day labor of making it function. Like in the S category, a B’s income is the profit from their business, but their profit is generally greater.

**Examples:** Mark Zuckerberg (who founded and owns Facebook), Bill Gates (who founded and owns Microsoft), and the owner of your region’s pizza chain are all in the B category because they own business _systems_.

> **The B Category vs. the S Category**
> 
> The distinction between S’s (small business owners) and B’s (big business owners) is subtle, in part because B’s often start off as S’s. For example, when a tutor sells her expertise and teaching abilities, she is her own product and her own business, which puts her in the S category. However, when the tutor becomes the owner of a tutoring company, she owns the _system_ that finds and trains tutors, connects students to tutors, markets the service, and takes care of logistics. The tutoring company owner profits from the work and time of the E category tutors she hires. She’s now in the B category.
> 
> Similarly, in the early days of Facebook and Microsoft, Zuckerberg and Gates, respectively, did the majority of the work themselves and received their income from that work—they were in the S category. As their products and services grew into systems, they earned more of their income from the work of others rather than their own day-to-day work. They entered the B category.

**Values:** People working in the B category are **delegators and leaders**. They must also possess superb business skills.

  * In the B category, you should enjoy finding the right people to make your system work. In essence, they will _be_ the system. 
  * You also need to have the people skills to manage others and bring out their best work, as it is the employees, not you, that will make the business run day to day. 



(Shortform note: “Organizational intelligence” is the ability to lead a complex organization in a particular direction and is a core skill for business leaders.)

##### Become a B So You Can Become an I

Kiyosaki sees the B category as a bridge to the I category. Most of us can’t go straight to the I category, because we don’t have enough money to invest yet, or the free time to spend on our investment strategy. You can generate money to invest and gain some free time in the B category.

(Shortform note: You only need to generate B category-level capital in order to invest if you’re aiming to be a capitalist. While Kiyosaki devotes a lot of space to advocating readers set their sight on that kind of wealth, you don’t need to own a B-category business to invest at a smaller scale, even if you’re aiming to “cross over” to living on passive income.)

### Investor (I)

This is Kiyosaki’s promised land, _where financial freedom really lies_. Investors commit money (called capital) to _something_ and expect to make a profit. Beyond the initial investment, they don’t have to work day to day like those in the other categories do. Instead, their livelihood comes in the form of **assets that generate passive income.** Examples of passive income include dividends from stocks, interest on bonds, and rental income. To attain financial freedom, you will nearly always need to have I category income, because that is how you develop the passive income that will make up your livelihood once you stop working.

**Examples:** Because you can invest with almost any amount of money, anyone can be an investor. Kiyosaki identifies three ways to use the I category:

  1. **Retirement investing.** Kiyosaki doesn’t actually include people who invest _only_ for retirement in the I category, because their investments won’t _replace_ their income. However, because of the decline in defined-benefit retirement plans, most people invest for retirement. 
  2. **Supplemental investing.** Remember, you can exist in multiple categories at the same time. You can be an E, S, or B and supplement that income with passive income from investments. 
  3. **Crossover investing.** Your goal is to “cross over” to a lifestyle where you live entirely on the passive income you earn from investments. If you cross over, you front-load your work. After you research and make your investment, all you have to do is monitor your passive income to make sure it’s performing well. 



> **Practicing Crossover Investing Through Retirement and Supplemental Investing**
> 
> Kiyosaki categorizes retirement investing, supplemental investing, and crossover investing as three separate investing types, but both retirement investing and supplemental investing can _turn into_ crossover investing:
> 
> Many new investors start with **retirement investing** primarily**** because it’s easy and accessible—many employers will take contributions directly from your paycheck, before you can spend it. If you consistently invest between 25% and 50% of your paycheck, in 20 years, you may find that you’ve “crossed over” and no longer need to work. Instead, you can live off the income from your investments. At that point, you can use the little-known Rule 72(t) to withdraw funds from your retirement account and avoid the typical 10% penalty for withdrawing funds before age 59½.
> 
> **Supplemental investing** also has the potential to get you to the “crossover point.” The bottom line is, the more of your E and S income you save and invest, the likelier you are to achieve **crossover investing.**

**Values:** The most important values investors must have are **comfort with risk** and**a desire to learn.** Since you own the means by which you’re making money (your assets), **you can mitigate risk by being as knowledgeable as possible about the risk you’re taking.** The real risk in the B and I categories is taking risks without enough information.

(Shortform note: An important part of risk in business and investing that Kiyosaki doesn’t mention is that for most people, risk tolerance changes over the span of a lifetime. According to Sethi, the younger you are, the more time you have to earn back losses. The older you are, the more conservative your relationship to risk should be.)

### Understanding Cashflow

Cashflow is an essential concept to understand both in terms of succeeding in the B and I categories, and it’s the central difference between the B and I categories and the E and S categories. **Cashflow is the total amount of money you earn and spend, and is the total of your income, expenses, liabilities, and assets.**

Income and expenses are simple as they sound. Income is the money you earn. Expenses are what you need to buy to survive that isn’t debt. Kiyosaki wants you to think of assets and liabilities as being equally simple.

  * **Assets give you money.**
    * **** Kiyosaki’s examples of assets: Capital gains, rental income, dividends, residual income from businesses. 
    * Remember, when you derive profit from an asset, it’s **passive income.**
  * **Liabilities cause you to lose money.**
    * Liabilities include debt, mortgages, and loans. Unlike expenses, liabilities are obligations that you must repay. 



(Shortform note: There are wider definitions of “asset” and “liability” than the ones Kiyosaki gives here. You can think of an asset as being anything of financial value that you own. A liability is anything you owe. Both individuals and businesses can have assets and liabilities. Jewelry or furniture can be considered a personal asset because you can sell them in exchange for money. A business liability might include heavy machinery that must be paid off.)

In the E and S categories, cashflow looks like this:

  * **Salary/Small Business Profit - Expenses = Income**



For an example in the E category, a teacher’s salary minus her living expenses equals her income. In the S category, a writer’s freelancing income minus her living expenses equals her income.

If you have liabilities in the E and S categories, your cashflow looks like this:

  * **Salary and/or Business Profit - Expenses and Liabilities = Income**



With liabilities, a teacher or freelancer’s salary minus her living expenses minus her student loans and mortgage debt equals her income.

In the B and I categories, cashflow looks like this:

**1\. Capital → Assets**

First, when you invest, you make an informed bet that your investment will be profitable. A profitable investment is an asset and will supply you with passive income.

**2\. Passive Income from Assets - Expenses & Liabilities = Income**

Once you have passive income, that, minus your expenses and your liabilities if you have them, is your income. **This is a fundamentally different way of making money.**

> **Not All Assets Are Created Equal**
> 
> The central difference between the E and S categories and the B and I categories is that B’s and I’s have assets, and E’s and S’s don’t. Some types of assets, though, are easier to convert to wealth than others.
> 
> You may own a company worth a million dollars, but if you’re not willing to sell it at a given moment, it’s impossible for you to access that million, making it an _illiquid asset_. Other examples of illiquid assets, which you can’t convert to money by selling for a set period of time, are annuities, venture capital, hedge funds, and private real estate investment trusts, or REITs. Experts say that if you invest in an illiquid asset, you should expect great returns in exchange for how inaccessible your money will be.
> 
> _Liquid assets_ , on the other hand, are accessible at any time and include stocks, bonds, savings accounts, and mutual and index funds.

### Understanding the Different Logic of the B and I Categories

Traditional thinking tells us that getting a “good” job is the way to financial security, and traditional education teaches us to think in ways that will help us be good at our E and S category jobs. According to Kiyosaki, working and earning income in the B and I categories requires new ways of thinking. Here, we’ll go over four major changes you have to make to your thinking to succeed in the B and I categories.

##### Difference 1: B’s and I’s Fundamentally Understand Money

According to Kiyosaki, there are two groups of people: people who understand how money flows and grows, and people who don’t. Those who don’t are usually in the E and S categories. People who are fluent in money 1) realize how important it is to be wealthy and 2) know that the best way to wealth is to be in the B and I categories. If you’re fluent in money, you’re at a big advantage.

(Shortform note: It’s harder, and more important, to be financially literate today than it was in the past. While your grandparents may have made most of their day-to-day purchases in cash and may have had pensions that required very little decision-making, financialization of the U.S. economy has meant saving, investment, and retirement options are now more complicated than they’ve ever been. Between 1950 and 2019, the financial sector’s share of the U.S. GDP rose from about 3% to over 20%.)

##### Difference 2: B’s and I’s Utilize “Other People’s Money” and “Other People’s Time”

In the E and S categories, you earn money from _your_ work and time. Earners in the B category generate wealth by using **other people’s time** and people in the I category can make money using **other people’s money**.

Remember that in the B category, you own a system that can run without you. A B category business owner makes money from the time and labor of the people who work for their business.

In the I category, you can use your own money to invest, but you can also invest with other people’s, or a bank’s, money. (Shortform note: That money will probably come in the form of a loan, which you pay interest on. You’re betting that the profit you can make from the borrowed money will be more than the interest you owe.)

> **Three Ways to Use “Other People’s Money” to Start a Business**
> 
> Other people’s money isn’t just for investing. It’s a common way to start a business, too, since most people don’t have enough capital on their own.
> 
> 1) **Borrow from the bank.** A line of credit in the form of a credit card can be a good choice because many cards don’t charge interest for the first year, allowing you some time to generate a profit.
> 
> 2) **Apply for grants and awards.** Be on the lookout for opportunities to acquire capital you don’t have to pay back.
> 
> 3) **Find an investor.** Investors are always looking for great new business ideas—yours could be the one they’ve been waiting for.

##### Difference 3: B’s and I’s Ask “Who Am I Making Rich?”

The fundamental question to ask yourself in the B and I categories is: Who are you making rich? In a capitalist economy, Kiyosaki says, either you’re getting rich, or you’re making someone else rich.

In the E and S categories:

  * Employees make more money for their employers than themselves.
  * People in debt make more money for their banks and credit card companies than themselves.
  * Taxpayers make a large chunk of their money for the government.
  * Consumers make money for the business they buy from.



In all these scenarios, there’s someone upstream from you profiting from your labor.

In the B and I categories, however:

  * **Business owners make money for themselves because their labor goes into a company they own.**
  * **Investors make money for themselves because they earn direct profit from their investments, which they own.**



If you’re not strategizing your cashflow to primarily benefit _you_ , you’re creating more wealth for someone else than you are for yourself.

> **Should B’s and I’s Make Money for Everyone Else?**
> 
> Many people, usually on the political left, believe **people in the B and I categories should make the government rich, so the government can help those who need it.**
> 
> Between 2008 and 2015, about 30 Fortune 500 companies paid nothing in U.S. taxes. While the Obama Administration lowered the corporate tax rate slightly during his presidency, the Trump Administration's 2017 tax cut lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, roughly doubling the number of major companies that paid nothing or less in taxes.
> 
> As of fall 2021, Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress are debating over the size of a post-Covid-19 spending bill that Democrats, who want to spend a larger sum than Republicans, say will be paid for primarily by increasing the tax burden on the rich.

##### Difference 4: B’s and I’s Know That Our Society Rewards Wealth

Kiyosaki argues that the wealthy play by different rules than everyone else. Kiyosaki identifies two ways our society rewards the wealthy for having wealth.

  1. As we discussed in Part 2, the B and I categories have a more favorable tax situation than the E and S categories. Kiyosaki says that middle-class taxes, often paid by people in the E and S categories, go to tax breaks for the rich, who are more often in the B and I categories. 
  2. Some tax-advantaged investments are only available to the rich. (Shortform note: Kiyosaki doesn’t name specific investments that are only available to the rich, but journalists with access to tax records have found that many of America’s wealthiest investors and business owners (including billionaire and PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel) use the humble Roth IRA, developed to help average Americans increase their savings, as one of their primary tax-advantaged accounts. While it’s true that most people have access to Roth IRAs, not many have access to the stock deals and assets that the rich use these vehicles to invest in.) 



> **How the Rich Stay Rich**
> 
> Wealth begets wealth because wealth begets power. The wealthy can better lobby politicians through their influence and donations. Since the 1970s, wealthy donors to conservatives in the U.S. have won significant tax and regulatory advantages that help the rich stay rich.
> 
> Wealth also begets wealth just because wealth begets wealth. Wealthy people can take bigger risks, which will return higher rewards, because they have a significant financial cushion to protect them if their investment fails. There are also thousands of ways wealth itself rewards and creates more wealth, including that:
> 
>   * The wealthy have better access to high-quality financial managers, who help them get high returns on their investments.
> 
>   * Wealthy people are more likely to earn high returns on their investments because of the size of their initial investment and because of the large proportion of their net worth that is liquid and can be invested. 
> 
>   * Wealthy people can access private equity and hedge funds, which yield high returns.
