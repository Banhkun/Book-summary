## 1-Page Summary

In 1988, the RJR Nabisco company was sold in a “leveraged buyout” (LBO) for $25 billion, making it the largest business transaction of the 20th century. The high value of the transaction, as well as the unusually competitive bidding in the LBO process, caught the attention of the press.

The buyout of RJR Nabisco represented a turning point in the use of LBOs. The press coverage revealed how LBOs can generate tremendous income for CEOs and finance companies, but they also can incur tremendous corporate debt that weakens the company. Increased public awareness of these issues caused LBOs to fall out of favor in the business community.

Wall Street Journal reporters Bryan Burrough and John Helyar covered the story of the RJR Nabisco buyout as it was unfolding and dug into the background of the various parties who were involved. In _Barbarians at the Gate_ , they present a detailed chronology of the LBO with colorful depictions and inside information on many of the people and companies involved.

In this guide, we’ll first discuss the mechanics of leveraged buyouts so you can better understand the controversy over the RJR Nabisco LBO. Then, to set the stage, we’ll relate the background of RJR Nabisco and its CEO, Ross Johnson, after which we’ll present a concise chronology of the buyout.

Throughout the chronology, we’ll show how the events that Burrough and Helyar recount illustrate principles found in other books, ranging from _The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing_ by Al Ries and Jack Trout to _The Art of War_ by Sun Tzu.

### The Basics: Leveraged Buy-Outs

Burrough and Helyar focus more on the drama of the RJR Nabisco buyout than on the mechanics of it, but they do explain LBOs in passing. In a typical leveraged buyout, **a team of executives takes the company private,** usually in order to gain a greater share of company profits, as we’ll elaborate on shortly.

> **Shortform Background: Key Business Terms**
> 
> There are some key business terms that are helpful to understand before we dive into the explanation of the LBO process:
> 
>   * **The Stockholders:** Publicly traded companies are owned by stockholders, with shares of stock equating to shares of ownership. Sometimes stockholders have the opportunity to vote on key issues affecting the company, but usually they have no _direct_ say in how the company is run, even though they own part of it.
> 
>   * **The Board of Directors: **A company’s board of directors acts as representatives of the stockholders. They govern the company at the highest level but generally are not involved in its day-to-day operations.
> 
>   * **The Management Team: **A team of corporate executives, typically led by a CEO, actively runs the company, directing day-to-day business operations. They report to the board of directors.
> 
> 


#### The LBO Process

In an LBO, the management team arranges to buy _all_ the company’s stock at a price agreed upon by the company’s board of directors. They purchase the stock**** using primarily borrowed money and use the company (and its assets) as collateral for the loan.

Thus, an LBO removes a company’s stock from the stock market and replaces its board of directors with a new board representing the company’s new owners. In principle, the new board could just be the management team, who would then be their own bosses. But in practice, the management team almost always partners with a financial consulting company, which usually acquires a controlling share of ownership in the company.

In addition to coordinating the transaction, the consulting company brings its own financial resources to the table. In most cases, partnering with a financial company is the only way the management team can acquire sufficient credit to borrow enough money for the LBO.

Finally, as the authors point out, LBOs are not a hostile business maneuver: The management team and its financial partners make an offer to the company’s board of directors. The **LBO only happens if the board of directors agrees to sell the company** to them on behalf of the shareholders.

> **Are LBOs Hostile or Not?**
> 
> There are differences of opinion about whether LBOs should be classified as a hostile takeover mechanism. In the form that Burrough and Helyar describe, LBOs aren’t hostile because a group internal to the company organizes the LBO and the board of directors approves it.
> 
> Other sources that describe LBOs similarly tend to draw the same conclusion, even arguing that LBOs are often used as a tactic to avoid a hostile takeover. This works because a hostile takeover often involves one company buying up more than 50% of the target company’s stock, giving them a controlling interest. LBOs eliminate the risk of this happening because they pull the company’s stock off the market.
> 
> But others identify LBOs as a hostile takeover method and describe LBOs more broadly as any buyout in which the assets of the company are put up as collateral to borrow the money to purchase it. So someone outside the company approaching the board with an LBO offer without the support of the company’s management would still meet the more general definition of an LBO, while also following the normal pattern of a hostile takeover.
> 
> It’s worth noting that hostile LBOs tend to be riskier because they lack the partnership between the management team and the financial backers who are buying the company. Without the management team on board, the transition to new ownership (and potentially new management) will likely be more disruptive to company operations. And without the management team’s inside knowledge of the company’s financial situation, there’s more uncertainty about how much the company is really worth.

#### Motives for LBOs

Why would a company’s executives prefer to share ownership of the company with a financial consulting firm and have a huge loan to pay off instead of having publicly traded stock? Burrough and Helyar give two reasons, both of which revolve around making more money.

First and foremost, they say LBOs became popular in the 1980s because they allowed executives to dramatically **increase their own income from corporate dividends** —the share of corporate profits that a company pays to its shareholders.

Second, interest payments on bank loans are deductible from corporate taxes, while dividends paid to stockholders are not. Depending on interest rates and tax rates, this sometimes produces substantial savings for the company after the LBO, increasing profits.

Burrough and Helyar also recount how the financial consulting firms that facilitate LBOs actively try to sell CEOs on these advantages. They do this because they profit from up-front fees for their financial services, as well as dividends on their share of ownership in the company once the LBO is completed.

> **Cash Flow Quadrants and LBOs**
> 
> Based on the motives that Burrough and Helyar discuss, LBOs are basically an example of how corporate managers can apply Robert Kiyosaki’s advice from _Rich Dad’s CashFlow Quadrant_.
> 
> Kiyosaki explains that there are four types of income, which he refers to as cashflow quadrants:
> 
>   * Wages you earn as an employee (quadrant E)
> 
>   * Profits you earn from self-employment (quadrant S)
> 
>   * Profits you earn from businesses or business assets that you own (quadrant B)
> 
>   * Interest you earn on your investments (quadrant I)
> 
> 

> 
> Kiyosaki argues that if you want to achieve financial security and freedom, you should focus on quadrants B and I, because income from these two quadrants is relatively passive, allowing it to continue compounding without your constant input. By contrast, income from quadrants E and S depends directly on your labor and thus is limited by the amount of time you can commit to it. Furthermore, he asserts that taxes will cut into your E and S income more severely because there are far fewer tax breaks available for E and S income than for B and I income.
> 
> So how do you transition from making most of your money from wages or self-employment to business assets and investments? If you’re a CEO or other member of a company’s management team, one option is to pursue an LBO. In the buyout, you transition from earning a salary as a manager to earning a share of the profits as a business owner. As Burrough and Helyar point out, this tends to increase your income dramatically and also creates an opportunity to write off more in taxes. As Kiyosaki points out, it also gives you more freedom, because as an owner, you could hire someone to do your job and continue to earn dividends while you spend your time however you want.

#### Junk Bonds

Burrough and Helyar go on to explain how **finance companies that facilitate LBOs often raise large amounts of money by selling what the authors call “junk bonds,”** or pay-in-kind (PIK) securities. These are high-interest bonds that pay the interest on the bonds in the form of more of the same kind of bonds, rather than in cash.

(Shortform note: In _The Intelligent Investor_ , Benjamin Graham defines “junk” bonds more broadly as bonds that must pay high interest rates to attract buyers because there is a significant risk that the company issuing them might run out of money and default on its bonds. He doesn’t stipulate that junk bonds would be pay-in-kind.)

### The Background: Ross Johnson and RJR Nabisco

Now that you understand how leveraged buyouts work, you’re in a position to understand the buyout of RJR Nabisco. But to help you see the whole picture and understand what made the RJR Nabisco buyout special, we’ll now discuss the background of the RJR Nabisco CEO who initiated the LBO, Ross Johnson.

#### Ross Johnson’s Philosophy

The authors recount that from practically the beginning of his career, Johnson’s philosophy revolved around two principles. First, he believed anything that wasn’t changing was stagnating and decaying. He would frequently change the organizational structure of his company, making sure that the company was always adapting and not becoming stagnant.

(Shortform note: Johnson’s perspective on change is controversial among business theorists. Many experts assert that you (and your company) need to be _capable_ of adapting because change in the business environment is inevitable, but few take it as far as Ross Johnson did. At the opposite end of the spectrum, in _Built to Last_ , Jim Collins argues that the idea that successful companies are always changing is a myth. Rather, he asserts that successful visionary companies are built on core principles that _never_ change. This contributes to their success by giving them continuity and stability, even as they adapt their non-core business activities to environmental changes.)

Second, Johnson believed in spending money liberally. He saw restrictive budgets as a cause of stagnation, which he went out of his way to avoid. Not only did he pay his executives higher wages than competing companies, but he also provided them (and himself) with extensive perks such as company cars and apartments, company-paid membership in exclusive social and recreational clubs, and personal use of corporate jets. Johnson was particularly adept at spending company money in ways that would build his network of social connections or endear him to board members or other important contacts.

(Shortform note: While many experts advise taking a more conservative approach to spending money than Johnson did, the _way_ he spent money arguably exemplifies John C. Maxwell’s 5th law of leadership, namely that leaders should serve others. Like former Costco CEO Jim Sinegal, whom Maxwell cites as an example of servant leadership, Johnson paid his staff above-average wages. He also went out of his way to see that his board members and other business associates were well taken care of.)

#### Ross Johnson’s History of Mergers

According to Burrough and Helyar, Ross Johnson grew up in a lower-middle-class family in Canada. He worked his way up the ladder at a food company called Standard Brands, where he eventually became CEO.

After Johnson became CEO of Standard Brands, he arranged a merger in which Nabisco acquired Standard Brands. Nabisco (originally an abbreviation of National Biscuit Company) was a leading food company, whose product lines included Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers. After the merger, Johnson again worked his way up to CEO and helped many of his executives from Standard Brands climb the Nabisco corporate ladder as well.

A few years later, as CEO of Nabisco, Johnson arranged a similar merger in which the RJ Reynolds tobacco company acquired Nabisco, creating the RJR Nabisco company. Once again, Ross Johnson worked his way up to CEO.

As CEO of RJR Nabisco, Johnson deployed his usual regimen of restructuring, among other things moving the corporate headquarters from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, to Atlanta, Georgia. Sales and profits increased while he was running the company, and Johnson had a good working relationship with his board of directors. He and his fellow executives had a fleet of corporate jets at their disposal and all the other perks to which Johnson was accustomed.

> **Infiltrate and Conquer**
> 
> Ross Johnson’s career exemplifies a business application of Robert Greene’s 31st strategy in _The 33 Strategies of War_ (a book whose premise is that strategies originally developed for military purposes can be put to good use in business and life in general).
> 
> Greene explains that when your enemy is so powerful that you can’t defeat them in open opposition, one strategy for taking them out is to join their organization and ostensibly work _for_ their cause, all the while secretly advancing your own agenda.
> 
> When Johnson was CEO of Standard Brands, he was in competition with Nabisco. Nabisco was the clear market leader, and it seems unlikely that Standard Brands could ever have displaced Nabisco as market leader through conventional competitive tactics, such as marketing and pricing. When Johnson sold Standard Brands to Nabisco, it might have looked like he was giving up to the competition.
> 
> But the acquisition gave Johnson and his staff managerial positions in the Nabisco company. And within a few years, Johnson was running Nabisco, along with his staff who had come from Standard Brands. So, for Johnson and his staff, selling out to a competitor allowed them to take over the competitor from within, when they couldn’t have taken it over by other means.
> 
> Johnson used essentially the same strategy in the acquisition of Nabisco by RJ Reynolds. In this case, Reynolds wasn’t a direct competitor because it was a tobacco company rather than a food company. But, this being the case, it represented an adjacent market sector that Nabisco couldn’t readily have broken into—much less dominated—any other way.

#### How and Why Ross Johnson Initiated an LBO

According to Burrough and Helyar, LBO consultants repeatedly contacted Johnson, asking him to consider a leveraged buyout and offering their services. Initially, Johnson was resistant to the idea because he feared that an LBO would force him to adopt a restrictive budget in order to pay off bank loans. Also, he didn’t want to trade his amicable board of directors for a group of finance-consultant partners who might be less inclined to let him run the company as he saw fit.

(Shortform note: Many financial advisers would likely feel that Johnson’s concerns about the pitfalls of debt were justified. Dave Ramsey in _Total Money Makeover_ , David Bach in _Automatic Millionaire,_ and Scott Pape in _The Barefoot Investor_ argue that if you have debts, you should brutally cut every nonessential expense to pay them down. They believe that until you’re debt-free, your budget for luxuries should basically be zero, and Johnson enjoyed having luxuries like corporate jets at his disposal.)

However, Burrough and Helyar speculate that Johnson grew restless, not finding enough avenues for continued change and improvement. He also became obsessed with the company’s stock price, which dropped to around $45 per share in an economic downturn and failed to come back up. In the end, Johnson agreed to try an LBO, seeing it as the only way to address the low stock price: If Johnson and his partners bought the company, the stockholders would get a big payout and then there would be no more publicly traded stock to worry about.

According to Burrough and Helyar, Johnson partnered with the finance firm Shearson Lehman because Shearson was willing to give his executive team more generous terms for their partnership than other consulting firms. Specifically, the new board of directors would be structured such that Johnson’s team had veto power. And Johnson's team would get 18.5% of the company’s dividends (almost twice the going rate), even though Shearson would put up _all_ the money for the LBO (most of which they would borrow from banks or raise by selling junk bonds).

Burrough and Helyar explain that Shearson Lehman was willing to accommodate Johnson’s terms because they felt they needed the LBO to establish themselves in the LBO consulting business. They were a relatively new company that had started out facilitating wire transfers, bought out the Lehman Brothers investment bank, and was now trying to get started in the LBO consulting business. Because of the size and value of RJR Nabisco, doing an LBO for Johnson would have propelled Shearson immediately to the top of the LBO-services market.

> **Positioning**
> 
> Shearson’s motive for working with Ross Johnson on unusually generous terms illustrates the concept of “positioning,” which marketing consultants Al Ries and Jack Trout discuss in _The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing_. As they explain, a company’s “position” in the market is simply how prospective customers perceive the company. For example, is it the market leader? Is it the alternative to the market leader? Is it an option that caters to a specific niche?
> 
> They assert that as markets mature, eventually every sector becomes a two-rung ladder, with one clear market leader and one clear rival to the leader, while the rest of the companies in that sector are relatively obscure and compete for just a tiny fraction of the overall market share.
> 
> Based on Burrough and Helyar’s account, it appears that at the time of the RJR Nabisco LBO, Shearson _wanted_ to be one of the top two in the LBO consulting market, but they weren’t, and they knew it. They believed that handling the largest LBO in history would provide a step-change in their market position, raising them from relative obscurity to one of the top few LBO companies in the minds of prospective customers. If they could establish a position on one of the top two rungs of the two-rung ladder, then in the long run, their increased market share would likely more than make up for lower profits on the RJR Nabisco LBO itself.

### The Bidding Contest for RJR-Nabisco

Understanding Ross Johnson’s background and philosophy makes it easier to understand why he managed the RJR Nabisco LBO the way he did, since competitive bidding is unusual in LBOs.

As Burrough and Helyar explain, usually people doing an LBO will carefully determine what the company is worth, estimate how much debt it can pay down, and secure funding commitments from banks before proposing the LBO to the board of directors. This makes it almost impossible for anyone else who might be interested in buying the company to come up with a viable counteroffer before the board reaches a decision.

However, Ross Johnson’s team didn’t do that. Instead, Johnson pitched the idea of an LBO to the board very early in the process, presenting it as a solution to the problem of their low stock price, and asking for their approval to move forward. He did this because he wanted to maintain his good relationship with the board, whether they approved the LBO or not. Besides this, Shearson didn’t think anyone else would be interested in buying the company anyway, given the lagging stock price and the public sentiment against tobacco companies.

> **Loss Aversion Bias**
> 
> In _Thinking Fast and Slow_ , Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman discusses biases in human thinking and how these natural biases can lead us to make irrational business decisions. Ross Johnson’s approach to the RJR Nabisco LBO appears to have been influenced by loss-aversion bias, which Kahneman explains as part of the “prospect theory” of how humans evaluate possible gain and loss.
> 
> According to prospect theory, you tend to focus on _changes_ to your situation, not on _expected end states_ , and you tend to see losses as more significant than gains. So, if you start with $1 million and end up with $2 million after a business venture, you’ll be elated because you gained $1 million, but if you start out with $4 million and end up with $2 million after a business venture, you’ll feel terrible because you lost $2 million, even though your net worth after the venture is the same in both cases.
> 
> Loss aversion bias arguably influenced Ross Johnson in three ways:
> 
>   * He may have been driven to pursue the LBO because he viewed stagnation (of the stock price, the corporate structure, and so on) as a type of loss, and thus felt he had to do _something_ to avoid the loss.
> 
>   * He accepted the idea of an LBO only in an unusually generous partnership with the financial firm that would handle it because he didn’t want to lose influence and perks in the company.
> 
>   * He approached the board unusually early in the LBO process because he didn’t want to lose his influence with the board in the event they disapproved of the LBO.
> 
> 


#### Competitors Emerge

Burrough and Helyar recount how the assumption that no one else would try to buy RJR Nabisco proved to be horribly wrong. When the board gave Johnson the go-ahead to pursue an LBO, he and Shearson proposed to pay $75 per share based on their initial analysis. This was published in a press release. A number of financial companies saw the press release and thought RJR Nabisco was worth a lot more than $75 per share.

(Shortform note: Lower-than-usual prices naturally attract attention from prospective customers. Sam Walton used this principle strategically to build Walmart into a retail empire, by selling some items at cost in order to draw in customers, and making a profit on other things they bought while they were there. But, in hindsight, Johnson and Shearson’s $75 bid was a strategic blunder: If they had offered a little more, the price might have not lured in other bidders and started a bidding war.)

##### Kravis

The Kohlberg Kravis company was a financial consulting firm that, according to Burrough and Helyar, had arguably invented LBOs and was unarguably the market leader in LBO consulting. They were among the first to react to the press release. After meeting with banks to discuss the value of RJR Nabisco and the availability of funding, they considered offering the board $90 per share.

Burrough and Helyar note that before Kravis reached a decision on how much to offer per share, someone leaked their meeting minutes to the press, and a newspaper ran a story announcing that they _were_ offering $90 per share for RJR Nabisco. Upon seeing the story, Kravis felt obligated to make the offer official in order to avoid confusion or bad press.

Kravis was at a severe disadvantage when it came to determining how much RJR Nabisco was worth because no one at Kravis had inside knowledge of RJR Nabisco’s operations. This was in contrast to practically all the other LBOs they had done, where they worked closely with the company’s executives. Shearson and Kravis considered partnering up instead of bidding against each other but were unable to agree on the terms of the partnership.

> **The Strategic Importance of Information**
> 
> In _The Art of War_ , Sun Tzu argues that espionage and intelligence-gathering are among the most important elements of fighting a war because understanding your opponent is crucial for strategic planning. Kravis’s situation illustrates how this principle can be applicable to business strategy as well as military strategy:
> 
>   * First an intelligence leak forced Kravis’s hand in making a competitive offer to buy RJR Nabisco.
> 
>   * Then, lack of inside information handicapped them when it came to determining how much was really safe to bid.
> 
>   * As we’ll discuss later, when Kravis finally did find an insider who was willing to discuss RJR Nabisco’s operations with them, that new information was what enabled them to place the winning bid.
> 
> 


##### Salomon

Burrough and Helyar report that a finance company called Salomon Brothers also prepared to make an offer to buy RJR-Nabisco when they saw the press release stating that Shearson had offered $75 per share. When they saw Kravis’s competing bid of $90 per share, they backed off.

After the partnership negotiations between Kravis and Shearson broke down, Shearson started looking for other partners to augment their financial resources for competitive bidding. At that point, Salomon entered into a partnership with Shearson. With Salomon’s backing, Shearson increased their offer from $75 per share to $92 per share.

> **Strategic Partnerships**
> 
> In _Crossing the Chasm_ , Geoffrey Moore discusses the importance of partnering with other companies so you can take advantage of each other’s capabilities. If you’re trying to bring an innovative product to market (which is the focus of Moore’s book), your corporate partners may be able to deliver supporting services or just establish your credibility in the marketplace in ways that you couldn’t on your own.
> 
> In the case of the Shearson-Salomon partnership, the primary capability that each company contributed was their credit, since one of the biggest challenges of pulling off an LBO is raising enough borrowed money for the buyout.

##### Forstmann

Forstmann Little, the second-leading LBO company after Kravis, was also interested in owning RJR Nabisco. Shearson and Salomon offered to partner with Forstmann, but after reviewing their financial analysis and proposal in detail, Forstmann declined.

According to Burrough and Helyar, Forstmann thought Shearson’s fees were excessive and their analysis wasn’t very good. Also, unlike most other LBO consultants, Forstmann eschewed junk bonds and thus objected to taking on partners who would sell junk bonds to raise money for the LBO.

Forstmann later partnered with Goldman Sachs, and they prepared to put in their own bid. But after doing their financial analysis, they decided they couldn’t safely bid more than $85 to $90 per share without resorting to junk bonds. Since they couldn’t top the highest bid that had already been placed, they withdrew from the contest without making a formal bid.

> **The Wisdom of Doing Nothing**
> 
> The way Forstmann handled the RJR Nabisco LBO, or rather declined to handle it, demonstrates an important business principle that can be easy to overlook: Sometimes the best strategy is to do nothing.
> 
> Books about building up your business often focus on the necessity of taking risks in order to reap rewards. They offer advice on overcoming your aversion to risk because excessive risk aversion can cause you to miss important opportunities. But it’s also possible to make the opposite mistake. In any given situation, you need to evaluate whether the opportunity is actually good enough to be worth the risk.
> 
> Furthermore, in the highly dynamic world of business and finance, you often encounter situations that seem to demand immediate action, whether it’s a natural disaster that disrupts shipping and causes certain stocks in your portfolio to plummet, or a chance to get in on a huge business deal (as in Forstmann’s case), or something else. The adrenaline rush that these situations elicit makes you feel like you need to do something, but in many cases the best thing you can do is actually to do nothing, riding out market fluctuations and passing up business deals that would be exciting and glamorous but not actually profitable.

##### First Boston

As Burrough and Helyar recount, the final interested party was the First Boston financial consulting firm. First Boston had been a market leader in mergers and hostile takeovers, until two of their executives and a number of their employees left to form a competing company.

They were still struggling to recover from the split when the RJR Nabisco LBO was announced, and they wanted to participate in the LBO mostly to save face: Since the RJR LBO was the largest LBO in history, and since it seemed like every other major financial firm on Wall Street was getting involved in one way or another, sitting on the sidelines would have made it look like the corporate schism had completely ruined them.

Burrough and Helyar note that First Boston got a late start assessing RJR Nabisco’s value, but found a clever way to save about $4 billion by taking advantage of an obscure financial mechanism to defer some taxes.

> **Moving on and Thinking Big**
> 
> First Boston’s entry into the RJR Nabisco LBO could be seen as an application of David Schwartz’s advice on dealing with setbacks. In _The Magic of Thinking Big_ , he asserts that to overcome a setback you should experiment boldly with new approaches until you find a path to success, instead of beating yourself up over it or assigning blame to factors beyond your control.
> 
> First Boston’s staff certainly demonstrated boldness and perseverance when they decided to tackle the biggest LBO in history at a time when their company was in turmoil. And in spite of the upheaval, they found a creative way to save money (the tax deferrals) on the LBO that would enable them to bid higher. As Burrough and Helyar remark later in the book, the way First Boston tackled the RJR Nabisco LBO _did_ help them to restore their reputation and shape up their company after the split, even though their bid ultimately didn’t win.

#### Formal Bidding

According to Burrough and Helyar, when RJR Nabisco’s board began receiving competitive offers for the company, they announced a formal bidding deadline of 5 p.m., November 18, 1988. By this deadline, Ross Johnson’s management team, supported by Shearson and Salomon, submitted a final bid of $100 per share. Kravis, still without access to inside information about the company, bid a more cautious $94 per share.

First Boston was unable to finish their analysis, much less secure financial backing of major banks by the deadline, but they submitted a preliminary proposal outlining how they hoped to offer between $105 and $118 per share. Since First Boston’s bid appeared to be the highest but was incomplete, the board voted to reject all the bids and announced a new deadline that would give First Boston a little over a week to finish their analysis and secure financial backing.

> **Deadlines in Business Deals**
> 
> The bidding for RJR Nabisco illustrates a couple of principles of negotiation that Chris Voss and Tahl Raz explain in _Never Split the Difference_. Voss and Raz assert that deadlines are one of the cornerstones of high-pressure sales and negotiation tactics. A looming deadline puts pressure on you to suspend your rational judgment and complete a transaction, make an offer, or accept the terms of an agreement. Deadlines work because of humans’ natural bias for loss aversion, which we discussed earlier: The deadline creates the impression that if you don’t act now, you’ll _lose the opportunity_.
> 
> However, Voss and Raz go on to advise that you should never let a deadline compel you to accept unfavorable terms in a negotiation or make a frivolous purchase. They assure you that in business and negotiations, deadlines are almost always arbitrary and negotiable.
> 
> Although the board of directors may not have intentionally been using high-pressure sales tactics, the bidding deadline did incentivize all the bidders to put in the highest bid they thought they could afford before the deadline arrived. And when the most attractive bid was incomplete, they readily extended the deadline.

##### The Second Round

Burrough and Helyar describe how Kravis spread a rumor that they might not bid in the second round, or wouldn’t raise their bid much if they did. But during this time, Kravis also finally found an RJR Nabisco executive who was willing to discuss its operations, especially avoidable expenses that the company could eliminate to improve profitability. Based on this new information, Kravis ended up bidding $106 per share in the second round.

Meanwhile, Johnson’s team bid $101 per share, not expecting much competition: They didn’t think First Boston would be able to pull off what they had proposed, and they more or less believed the rumor that Kravis wouldn’t bid again. They were wrong about Kravis, but they were right about First Boston. Although First Boston finished much of their analysis, they were unable to secure enough financial backing to convince the board that their bid was a viable option.

> **Strategic Misinformation**
> 
> We previously discussed how information and intelligence-gathering play a central role in strategy development, both for the military and in business. As a corollary to this principle, _misinformation_ can also be used strategically, as Kravis exemplified in the second round of bidding for RJR Nabisco.

> When Sun Tzu discusses espionage in _The Art of War_ , he describes five types of spies, two of which are specifically used for misinforming the enemy, illustrating the relative importance that he placed on strategic misinformation.
> 
>   * “Dead spies” are people loyal to you who gain your enemy’s trust and feed him false or misleading information at your behest. Tzu calls them “dead spies” because as soon as the enemy discovered he’d been deceived, he would typically have the false informants put to death.
> 
>   * “Reverse spies” are enemy spies that you’ve recognized as such. Tzu points out that you can leak false information to them in hopes they’ll believe it and pass it on, misinforming your enemy.

> Kravis, however, illustrates how the misinformation game in business is a bit subtler and less risky than it is in war. Burrough and Helyar note that Wall Street executives and their families all tended to run in the same social circles, so it was easy for Kravis executives to spread rumors just by dropping a few seemingly casual comments at social functions. And the RJR Nabisco executive who revealed the company’s avoidable expenses to Kravis didn’t have to worry about being beheaded for it, as Sun Tzu’s spies did.

##### The Third Round

According to Burrough and Helyar, Johnson’s financial consultants were surprised and outraged by Kravis’s high bid. Furthermore, upon analyzing Kravis’s bid, they realized that it employed less cash and more junk bonds than their own bid. Reworking their bid along the same lines, they determined that they could bid at least $108 per share. They demanded that the board extend the bidding again.

When the board ignored them because they were already working with Kravis to finalize details of the buyout, Shearson and Salomon issued a press release stating that they had increased their bid to $108. Once Shearson’s bid was published, the board felt they couldn’t ignore it. They paid Kravis $45 million in consulting fees for the work they’d already done on the details and reopened bidding.

Johnson, backed by Shearson and Salomon, made a final bid of $112 per share, while Kravis made a final bid of $109 per share. However, the board’s financial advisers determined that the real value of both bids was about the same because Shearson’s junk bonds carried a higher risk than Kravis’s junk bonds. Regarding the two bids as equal, the board voted to sell the company to Kravis.

Burrough and Helyar conjecture that the board chose Kravis partly because they had already started working with them after the previous bid, and partly because their sentiments had shifted against Johnson during the LBO process. Both LBOs in general and Ross Johnson’s proposed LBO in particular had drawn a lot of negative press. Many commentators argued that LBOs were motivated by executives’ greed and resulted in irresponsible levels of corporate debt. In particular, when the press found out about the exceptionally generous terms of Johnson’s partnership with Shearson, they portrayed Johnson as the epitome of corporate greed.

> **Why Johnson Lost RJR Nabisco**
> 
> Earlier, we discussed loss-aversion bias, and how Johnson exemplified it in demanding unusually generous terms from his financial partner (so that he wouldn’t lose any of his existing corporate perks if the LBO went through) and presenting the LBO to the board of directors early in the process (so that he wouldn’t lose his standing with them if they disapproved it). We could also infer that Shearson reworking their bid to increase it first to $108 and then to $112 and demanding another round of bidding was also motivated by loss-aversion bias, as they saw the LBO slipping through their fingers.
> 
> But as we’ve now seen, approaching the board early opened the door to competitive bids, and the generous terms of Johnson’s arrangement with Shearson generated so much bad press that it turned the board against him, prompting them to favor Kravis over Shearson. Thus, measures that Johnson took to _mitigate_ the risk of loss ended up contributing to the very loss he was trying to avoid.
> 
> Of course, the board was obligated to do what was best for shareholders, so they couldn’t arbitrarily sell the company to Kravis if Johnson and Shearson’s bid was higher. Both bids included a fraction of cash and a fraction of bonds in the price. Bonds carry a certain amount of risk that they may not pay out as much as their face value, so the board (or their financial advisers) had to estimate the _probability_ of the bonds paying what Johnson said they would. They could then calculate the expected value of the bonds by multiplying the face value by the probability of actually getting it. This is why the higher risk associated with Shearson’s bonds made the board consider the two bids equal, even though Shearson’s had a higher face value.

#### The Aftermath

Burrough and Helyar report that Ross Johnson accepted the loss of the bidding contest graciously and went into retirement. He asserted that both his actions in initiating the LBO and the ultimate outcome had been best for the company’s stockholders. Some of the stockholders, though, disagreed: RJR Nabisco stock had paid dividends, and the company was so profitable that stockholders were making money even when the stock price was low. So they were sorry to lose their stock even though they got a big payout when the company sold.

Kravis hired a new management team to run RJR Nabisco, restructured the company, and eventually sold it again. In the end, Kravis made only a small profit on the LBO, despite streamlining RJR Nabisco’s operations to increase the company’s profitability by almost 50%.

After the RJR Nabisco LBO, leveraged buyouts became much less popular. Burrough and Helyar believe this was due in large part to the negative publicity that LBOs and especially junk bonds received, which reached a peak during the RJR Nabisco buyout. Of the few LBOs that did happen after 1988, most were handled by Forstmann Little without using junk bonds.

> **After the Aftermath**
> 
> Ross Johnson’s retirement continued until 2016 when he passed away at the age of 85. As recounted in his obituary, he never regretted the RJR Nabisco LBO, despite losing the bidding contest and sinking his executive career. This seems to imply that his alleged convictions about doing the right thing for the stockholders were genuine—even if some of the stockholders disagreed with his perspective.
> 
> Moreover, throughout his retirement, Johnson enjoyed the fame that the LBO brought him, even though the publicity didn’t cast him in a particularly positive light. Not only did he become famous from the media coverage of the LBO itself, but the publication of _Barbarians at the Gate_ and the release of a movie based on the book further spread his fame.
> 
> As Burrough and Helyar report, the popularity of leveraged buyouts fell off after the RJR Nabisco buyout. They became relatively uncommon throughout the 1990s. However, that wasn’t the end of the story after all.
> 
> LBOs made a comeback in the early 2000s, and Kravis remained a leading finance consultant in the field, despite the less-than-stellar profits they made on RJR Nabisco. In 2006, for example, Kravis handled an LBO for Hospital Corporation of America that totaled $33 billion, making it 32% larger than the RJR Nabisco buyout. This trend of more and larger LBOs in the early 2000s continued until the economic downturn of 2008. Since 2008, LBOs have made another comeback, with the volume of LBOs in the 2020s exceeding all previous peaks.
