## 1-Page Summary

Are there people in your life you just can’t understand? Talking to them sometimes feels like they’re speaking a different language—and according to author Shelle Rose Charvet, in many ways, they are. In _Words That Change Minds_ , Charvet contends that each individual makes sense of the world in a unique way. When two people approach the same situation with completely different frames of mind, it can cause miscommunications, conflict, and animosity.

However, Charvet argues that **if you learn how another person thinks, you can consciously match their frame of reference and speak in a language they understand.** This is a powerful professional skill—with it, you can build cooperative relationships with coworkers, clients, and management, as well as influence them to help you achieve your goals.

Charvet is a professional speaker and founder of the Institute for Influence, an educational organization offering online training programs in communication and persuasion. Through this organization, she has trained hundreds of professionals in 30 different countries around the world to become more effective leaders and communicators.

We’ll begin this guide by describing the framework of mental habits people use to make sense of the world. Then we’ll outline each of the 14 mental habits that help you understand how to communicate with and influence others: the six mental habits that explain _why_ people act the way they do and the eight that explain _how_ they go about solving problems. We’ve rearranged the order of some of these mental habits, placing similar habits near one another to enhance flow.

In our commentary, we’ll help you apply Charvet’s insights into human nature with additional tips for use in the workplace. We’ll also offer counterpoints to some of Charvet’s claims about psychology from books like _Surrounded by Idiots_ and _The Extended Mind_.

(Shortform note: As Charvet acknowledges in the book, social scientist Rodger Bailey was the first to delineate this set of 14 mental habits—six explaining the “why” behind a person’s actions and eight explaining the “how.” He drew these habits from a broader list by social scientist Leslie Cameron-Bandler of 60 mental habits she calls “metaprograms.” Presumably, Bailey chose these habits from the greater list because they’re the most relevant and practical in a workplace setting. If you can motivate someone to work and let them work in the ways that suit them best, you don’t need to know any more about them to produce value.)

### The Mental Habits That Shape Communication

Charvet explains that her system of analyzing the way different people think and communicate is based on a field of psychological study called neuro-linguistic programming, or NLP. According to NLP, as people learn and grow, they “program” themselves with specific mental habits that determine how they judge situations and make decisions.

These relatively fixed mental habits cause people to consistently repeat the same behavioral patterns, so **if you understand someone’s mental habits, you can predict how they’ll act.** For example, if someone habitually focuses on the details of a task rather than the big picture of what they’re trying to accomplish, they may fixate on a to-do list item at work that doesn’t really matter.

(Shortform note: Motivational speaker Tony Robbins also bases his philosophy on neuro-linguistic programming. In his book _Unlimited Power_ , Robbins emphasizes that you have the power to “reprogram” your mental habits by adopting a new set of beliefs, intentions, and values. Robbins asserts that because mental habits determine how you act, changing them gives you the power to change your habitual behaviors and gain control over your life.)

#### How to Identify Mental Habits

How do you figure out what someone’s mental habits are? According to NLP, after someone develops certain mental habits, **they reveal these habits in the _language_ they use** to describe their thought processes and the world around them. For example, someone who habitually focuses on details will give an abundance of concrete information when describing a situation.

Charvet contends that by listening closely to the language someone uses when speaking, you can identify 14 mental habits that tell you everything you need to know to communicate effectively with that person.

(Shortform note: Charvet asserts that a person’s mental habits determine the specific language they use, but there’s some evidence that this process also works in reverse: The language we use shapes our mental habits. For instance, people who speak some Australian languages develop the mental habit of directional awareness—they can tell you which way is north or south at any time, even in total darkness. This is because directions are built into their language—the words they use to describe locations specify compass points like “northeast” and “southwest,” rather than relative terms like “left” or “right.” Speaking in these terms pushes their brains to devote more attention to directional awareness.)

Charvet notes a key difference between this theory and other personality profiles (like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or the Big Five personality traits): This framework acknowledges that **the same person utilizes different mental habits in different situations**. Identifying a mental habit someone uses doesn’t mean you’ve uncovered a core, unchanging part of their personality—you’ve just identified a situational behavior pattern that they’ll likely repeat in a similar situation.

> **Is Personality Entirely Situational?**
> 
> In _The Lucifer Effect_ , Philip Zimbardo further refutes the idea that people have fixed personality traits you can identify with a test or capture in a profile. He contends that personality as we know it is almost entirely malleable—in two different situations, you could behave like two totally different people. To discern which identity to adopt in a given situation, you look for identity cues: aspects of the environment that signify what behavior is currently appropriate. According to Zimbardo, this means that if you’re surrounded by enough powerful identity cues, you could adopt a totally new identity. In some cases, you could end up committing cruel, immoral acts that you normally would never dream of.
> 
> For example, when Zimbardo dressed undergraduate Stanford students as guards in a simulated prison and surrounded them with identity cues that made this situation feel real, they were willing to inflict cruel, degrading punishments on fellow students playing the role of inmates.

#### Mirror Mental Habits to Communicate Well

Once you’ve identified someone’s mental habits, **you need to mirror their linguistic style to effectively communicate with and influence them** , according to Charvet. Speaking in the terms people naturally use to think and communicate will make you seem more rational and convincing.

In the workplace, mirroring other people’s language will help you convince them that your ideas are valuable, avoid conflicts rooted in misunderstanding or perceived disrespect, and encourage the people you're managing or coaching to be more receptive to your advice. For example, if you notice that someone you’re mentoring talks a lot about how their work _makes others feel_ , you could influence them to stop being late for meetings by mirroring that kind of language: “The team and I get a bit irritated whenever we have to wait for you to get here.”

(Shortform note: In _The Charisma Myth_ , Olivia Fox Cabane recommends not only mirroring your conversation partner’s linguistic style, but also their gestures and body language. She contends that this subconsciously signals familiarity and warmth in the other person’s mind, making you more likable. While Charvet’s strategy is primarily focused on helping you communicate on a mental level, Cabane’s strategy helps you connect on an emotional level. Cabane’s advice will likely be equally helpful in the workplace—if your coworkers like you as a person, they’ll give more credence to your ideas, be less combative, and accept more of your advice.)

### The Six “Why” Mental Habits

The first six of the 14 mental habits reveal the reasons why an individual chooses to solve a problem (or not). For this reason, we’ll call these six the “Why” mental habits (Charvet refers to them as the six “Motivation Patterns.”)

The majority of these mental habits are based on a dichotomy between two opposites. According to Charvet, **this doesn’t mean that people are either one or the other** —rather, the habits form a spectrum, and individuals often fall somewhere in between. For example, while some people prefer to work with a team and others prefer to work alone, there are also those who equally enjoy working with others and by themselves.

> **Virtues of the Middle Ground**
> 
> The middle of the mental habit spectrum may be the most desirable, especially if you’re in a leadership role. In _The Dichotomy of Leadership_ , Jocko Willink and Leif Babin assert that every characteristic of a good leader becomes counterproductive when taken to the extreme. Thus, as a leader, you should attempt to strike a healthy balance between ideals in everything you do.
> 
> This may also apply to mental habits. For instance, a leader who can only work in collaboration with other people might struggle with tasks no one can help with (like writing reports to a senior manager), while a leader who can only work alone may struggle with tasks that require teamwork (like leading brainstorming meetings.)

#### Why Habit #1: Active or Passive

The first Why habit we’ll discuss refers to **someone’s readiness to spur themselves into action** : Are they _active_ or _passive_? (Charvet calls this the “Level” category.) Active people progress toward their goals as quickly as possible, while passive people tend to wait and analyze the situation until the perfect opportunity arises or someone else pushes them into action.

You can tell someone is active if they speak in short, direct sentences that emphasize simple cause-and-effect sequences, asserts Charvet. To communicate effectively with an active person, mirror this effect. For example, you could say, “We’re downsizing to keep this branch profitable.”

In contrast, passive people speak in long, often meandering sentences that highlight the subtle complexities of a situation. To break downsizing news to a passive person, you might say, “Although there’s great work being done in every department, it’s likely that we’ll start running a deficit unless we downsize to reduce our current expenses.”

> **Does the Workplace Need More Passive Introverts?**
> 
> This split between active or passive behavior mirrors the introvert-extrovert split Susan Cain describes in _Quiet_. According to Cain, extroverts tend to be more active and confident, while introverts are more passive and reflective. Like Charvet, Cain acknowledges that although we typically think of personality traits as fixed, no one is completely extroverted or introverted in all contexts. Rather, some situations will bring out more of your extroverted or introverted tendencies.
> 
> Cain argues that modern society views extroverted traits as “ideal” and underappreciates the unique, more subtle strengths of introverts—to everyone’s detriment. For instance, in the workplace, group brainstorming meetings are popular, yet studies show they often end up producing worse ideas than people who think alone.
> 
> Why is this? In these meetings, anyone can voice their opinion to the group, so the most active, extroverted people end up speaking more than anyone else. Because (as Charvet notes) active people tend to speak in shorter, more straightforward terms, teams give simpler ideas more credit than they deserve. People who tend to highlight useful complexities and nuance are generally more passive, so these ideas are less likely to be recognized by the group.

#### Why Habit #2: Positively or Negatively Incentivized

The second Why habit describes **whether someone feels more motivated by the promise of a reward or by the threat of negative consequences** : Are they _positively_ or _negatively_ incentivized? (Charvet calls this the “Direction” category.)

According to Charvet, someone who’s positively incentivized will frequently talk about their goals—what they want to achieve and add to their life. For example, they might excitedly tell you, “If this project succeeds, we’ll have the only product of its kind on the market.” On the other hand, someone who’s negatively incentivized will tend to talk about their fears and problems—what they want to keep out of their life. They would emphasize that “Unless we get this product to market quickly, we’ll fall behind our competitors.”

To influence someone to take action, talk to positively incentivized people about opportunities they can gain and negatively incentivized people about threats they should avoid.

> **Incentivize Yourself With Strategic Self-Talk**
> 
> Just as you would mirror the positive or negative language of others in an attempt to spur them into action, you can intentionally choose to think in the language of these mental habits to spur _yourself_ into action. This works because the words you use to think have a dramatic impact on your emotions and behavior.
> 
> The strategy you need will differ depending on the incentives you prefer. Positively incentivized people often push themselves too hard, as they hyperfocus on the potential rewards of accomplishing their goals. To avoid this mistake, regularly tell yourself that time spent on things that aren’t directly related to your goal—like sleeping and exercising—are valid forms of progress toward your goals, since personal health boosts your productivity. For example, think to yourself, “Going for a run this morning will help me design this website.”
> 
> On the other hand, negatively incentivized people may struggle to motivate themselves if there’s no immediate penalty for inaction hanging over their heads. In this case, you could reframe the situation and see inaction—a loss of momentum—as a threat that you need to avoid. For example, you could say to yourself, “I need to wake up at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow or I’ll never break out of this dull routine.”

#### Why Habit #3: Self-Validated or Validated by Others

The third Why habit refers to **how people decide what to do and how they assess if they’re doing it well** : They’re either _self-validated_ or _validated by others_. (Charvet calls this the “Source” category.) Self-validated people only want to work if they believe they’re successfully doing something important. People validated by others only like working if someone like a boss or coworker tells them they’re doing a good job at something important.

Self-validated people make frequent judgments about their work and the work of others: For example, they might say, “My presentation at today’s meeting went well. Although I was a little less organized than Justin, my visual aids got my point across well.” In contrast, people validated by others defer to other people’s opinions when judging someone’s work: “I think I had a good presentation today. Justin told me he was impressed, and I saw Michelle nodding a lot.”

(Shortform note: In _The Courage to Be Disliked_ , Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga argue that validating your own actions rather than deferring to the opinions of others is the key to happiness. They claim that because it’s impossible to perfectly fulfill everyone’s expectations of you, the only way to attain the self-esteem you need to be happy is to decide for yourself that your actions have value. For instance, if you frequently worry about what others will think before speaking up during meetings, you may want to instead make an effort to speak up whenever you have an idea that _you_ think is valuable.)

Charvet notes that because they’re so self-assured, persuading someone self-validated to change their mind can be a challenge. If you’re trying to influence them, make sure to**speak in suggestions rather than instructions.** For instance, you could say, “If you want your message to be as clear as possible, you may want to cut each of your presentation slides down to a couple of bullet points.”

People validated by others are much easier to influence—just strongly assert what you believe to be true or cite the standards of others: “You should keep your slides more concise. Michelle always responds well to a focused presentation.”

> **Are Self-Validated People Really Harder to Persuade?**
> 
> In _Surrounded by Idiots_ , Thomas Erikson offers advice that contradicts Charvet’s. When trying to influence confident, self-validated people (what he terms the “Red” personality type), he recommends directly arguing your case and remaining steadfast in your opinion. Self-validated people will more readily respect your advice and consider its validity if they see you’re willing to fight for it.
> 
> Additionally, he contends that people who typically defer to the opinions of others (the “Green” type) are often _more_ difficult to persuade if you’re trying to convince them to do something differently, since they’re accustomed to gaining the approval of others by acting within an established status quo. Thus, you’ll often need to prepare a thorough logical argument to get them to change their behavior rather than assuming they’ll do whatever you say. If Charvet’s tactics aren’t working, you may want to experiment with Erikson’s instead.

#### Why Habit #4: Reliable or Innovative

The fourth Why habit describes **how attached someone is to one specific way of solving a problem** : They’re either _reliable_ or _innovative_. (Charvet calls this the “Reason” category.) Reliable people identify one way to solve a problem and strive to consistently repeat their successes in the same way, while innovative people are always on the lookout for new and better ways to solve the same problems.

You can tell someone is reliable if they describe their actions as if they were out of their control, writes Charvet. For example, a reliable person would tell you “I had to stay six hours overtime last week to finish up that urgent project.” Innovative people, on the other hand, will dissect the factors influencing every decision they make and highlight the other choices they could have made: “I could have left that project for Monday rather than putting in extra hours, but I wanted my boss to see how dedicated I am. Plus, I thought it’d be nice to grab an overtime bonus before the holidays.”

To communicate effectively, mirror the other person’s view of problem-solving: Emphasize either the one right way to do something or the variety of options they have when approaching it.

> **How to Inspire Disempowered Workers**
> 
> Sometimes, people who describe everything in their lives as if they lack control don't _prefer_ to solve problems in a consistent way; rather, they may believe that they _lack the power_ to pursue new ways of solving problems. In the workplace, this belief can prevent employees from taking action in situations where they’d be more effective than anyone else, limiting innovation and hurting the organization.
> 
> In _Coaching for Performance_ , John Whitmore argues that to make employees feel empowered, leaders need to push them to set and complete their own goals. Additionally, whereas Charvet might recommend mirroring someone’s language, Whitmore suggests intentionally asking questions that lead them to answer with language that emphasizes how passionate and engaged they feel about their work. Getting an employee excited will help them take ownership of the work, which in turn will help them realize that they have the power (and responsibility) to accomplish something.
> 
> According to Whitmore, this often involves following broad questions about the work with more specific leading questions. For example, if you’re a mentor who asks your mentee a question like “What do you want to accomplish with this project?”, you can then prompt them to take ownership with the more detailed question of “What _more_ do you want to accomplish with this project?”
> 
> It makes sense that once an employee feels empowered, they’ll feel capable enough to pursue new ways to solve problems—if they’re a naturally innovative person at work, that is. Or they may be naturally reliable and still choose to solve problems in the same way. Either way, empowering them with decision-making agency will likely help them be themselves in the workplace.

#### Why Habit #5: Eager for Change or Content With Stability

The fifth Why habit we’ll discuss refers to **how often someone wants to upend the status quo** : Are they _eager for change_ or _content with stability_? (Charvet calls this the “Decision Factors” category.) That is, do they want to constantly shake things up in their life or keep things the same for as long as possible?

When thinking about the past, people who are more eager for change will highlight how much things have changed—they might say, “Running a nonprofit is much more fulfilling than my career managing restaurants.” Someone content with stability with the same résumé would focus on the things that stayed the same: “I’ve been a manager for the last 20 years.”

If you want to influence someone eager for change to do something, emphasize how exciting and new it is (“Going to college would be a whole new adventure for you!”). If they’re content with stability, emphasize how it’s similar to things they’ve done in the past (“I think continuing your education would really help you maintain your personal growth”).

(Shortform note: Research shows that people naturally become less eager for change and more content with stability as they age. Experts theorize this is because many older people settle into pursuits that require long-term investment—such as a lifelong career or raising children and grandchildren—and they shy away from change to protect the life they’ve built. Thus, if the language someone uses doesn’t overtly lean toward change or stability, you may be able to use their age to decide whether to influence them with more change- or stability-oriented language—at least until you get to know them better as an individual.)

#### Why Habit #6: Ideals

The sixth Why habit is a bit different than the other five—instead of existing on a spectrum between two types, people can express this habit in infinite ways. Charvet argues that everyone has a unique set of **_ideals,_ specific words that represent the things or attributes that are most important to them**. (Charvet calls these ideals “Criteria.”) For instance, if someone says they love their job because they’re working toward a noble mission and get to spend time with a supportive team, “noble mission” and “supportive team” might be two of their ideals.

(Shortform note: In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson contends that one major way you can improve your life is to intentionally choose your ideals. According to Manson, many people make themselves miserable by choosing to care about ideals that are out of their control, destructive, or untethered from reality—for example, the ideal of being the most well-liked salesperson on the team. He recommends choosing to care more about ideals that are controllable, constructive, and based in reality—for example, the ideal of taking personal responsibility for your life.)

If you refer to one of someone’s ideals using different words, it won’t mean the same thing to them. Charvet contends that a person’s ideals— _the words themselves_ —are tied to myriad emotional memories that give the words their motivating power. Thus, when trying to communicate with or influence someone, **only refer to their ideals using their exact words**. To return to our example above, you could convince that person to volunteer at your organization by emphasizing the _noble mission_ you and your _supportive team_ are looking to achieve.

(Shortform note: The fact that particular words represent a vast well of emotional memories shapes the way that corporations market their products. In _How Brands Grow_ , Byron Sharp contends that the purpose of advertising is to spread positive emotional memories related to a specific brand. Brand assets, including a brand’s memorable name and slogan, act as symbolic shorthand for all the pleasant experiences you’ve had purchasing from that brand. For this reason, when a brand changes its brand assets, it often backfires—for example, after the soda brand Sierra Mist changed its name to Starry, it severed its connection to the positive memories its customers associated with the specific words “Sierra Mist.”)

### The Eight “How” Mental Habits

The final eight mental habits explain how an individual does their best work after they’ve decided to solve a problem. We’ll call these the eight “How” mental habits (“Productivity Patterns,” in Charvet’s words).

According to Charvet, understanding How habits is particularly important for managers who need to assign tasks to team members, as these mental habits reveal individuals’ strengths and weaknesses in the workplace. To maximize productivity, **assign team members tasks that require them to think as they’re naturally inclined to think**.

(Shortform note: In _First, Break All the Rules_ , Curt Coffman and Marcus Buckingham recommend strategically building teams in which each member’s strengths compensate for the others' weaknesses. This way, teams can collectively accomplish tasks that a single employee can’t do on their own.)

As with Why habits, most How habits lie on a spectrum between two opposites, and verbally mirroring someone’s habit-driven language is one of the best ways to communicate with and influence them.

#### How Habit #1: Whole-Oriented or Detail-Oriented

The first How habit we’ll discuss describes **whether someone is more insightful when looking at the big picture or individual situations** : Are they _whole-oriented_ or _detail-oriented_? (Charvet calls this the “Scope” category.)

Whole-oriented people tend to speak in abstract, sometimes vague terms, writes Charvet. They might say, “We decided to move Brian to the sales team.” In contrast, detail-oriented people tend to describe concrete situations, sometimes in painstaking detail: “Last Friday, Trudy, Mark, and I met in Conference Room B and decided that Brian would be a better fit on the sales team because of how much he’s improved his people skills.”

Make sure to talk in terms of the big picture with whole-oriented people; otherwise, they’ll either get bored or feel overwhelmed. Likewise, speak in comprehensive, concrete terms with detail-oriented people, or they’ll become frustrated with your vague language.

> **Ideal Communication Is Both Whole-Oriented and Detail-Oriented**
> 
> Some experts contend that the most effective communication conveys a single “big idea,” yet has enough memorable concrete details to be easy to understand and retain. Arguably, this kind of communication is effective because it appeals to both whole-oriented and detail-oriented listeners: The big idea is broad and important enough to capture the attention of whole-oriented people, while the concrete details help detail-oriented people follow and readily recall the message.
> 
> In _How Highly Effective People Speak_ , Peter D. Andrei explains how to communicate in this way: Narrow down your big idea to its simplest form and leave out any details that aren’t necessary for understanding your thesis. This simplification risks alienating your detail-oriented listeners, so add rich sensory imagery that makes your ideas easier to remember and understand without making them any more complicated. For instance, if you’re pitching a new tech product, you could emphasize its elegant concept by detailing how sleek and modern you imagine its hardware and packaging will look.
> 
> Weaving your ideas into a story or anecdote is another way to make your ideas rich in detail without obscuring the big picture—for example, you could describe the first reaction someone may have when unboxing your new product.

#### How Habit #2: Level-Headed or Neurotic

The second How habit is a description of **how someone reacts to high-pressure situations** : Are they _level-headed_ or _neurotic_? Do they address intense events with cool, dispassionate logic, or do they frequently become emotionally overwhelmed? (Charvet calls this the “Stress Response” category.)

Charvet clarifies that unlike most of the other mental habits, this one isn’t revealed through the words someone says. **You can gauge whether someone is level-headed or neurotic by paying attention to how outwardly emotional they are while speaking** , especially when discussing a challenging situation. Level-headed people typically stay low-key and detached in conversation, while neurotic people visibly display emotions with their whole bodies—for instance, slumping their shoulders and collapsing into a chair when describing an exhausting day at work.

(Shortform note: Once you’ve concluded how level-headed or neurotic someone is, you can use this knowledge of their typical emotional affect to gain greater insights into what they’re thinking and feeling. In _What Every Body Is Saying_ , Joe Navarro asserts that after getting an idea of someone’s baseline body language, you can interpret deviations from this baseline as reactions to the current situation. For example, if a neurotic person flashes a subtle smile, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything, since it’s subdued compared to their expressive baseline. However, if a level-headed, typically reserved person smiles, it may indicate that they’re very excited about something, as this is an extreme expression compared to their low-key baseline.)

To influence level-headed people, take care to explain your point of view with airtight logic. To influence neurotic people, speak in emotional language that gets them excited to act.

(Shortform note: Arguably, if your message is emotionally gripping enough, you can get even the most level-headed people to throw logic out the window and act—especially if you’re stirring primal emotions like fear. Author and investor Peter Bevelin explains that the emotional parts of our brains are built to override the logical parts in response to danger. This is because our ancestors who reacted to danger emotionally survived, while those who thought more slowly and methodically were unable to react to danger quickly enough.)

#### How Habit #3: Team Player or Lone Wolf

The third How habit refers to **someone’s preferred level of interaction with other people** : Are they a _team player_ or a _lone wolf_? (Charvet calls this the “Style” category.) Team players do their best work in close collaboration with others—when they’re alone, they may struggle to focus and get things done. In contrast, lone wolves need their own space to do their best work and get distracted if other people are nearby..

To identify whether someone is a team player or a lone wolf, pay attention to how much they mention others when describing their tasks. Team players emphasize the actions of those around them: They might say “We launched our new ad campaign before the deadline we set for ourselves.” Lone wolves emphasize the actions and decisions they make as individuals: “I finished designing the full set of banner ads two months before launch day.”

(Shortform note: In _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Voss contends that people who use “lone wolf” language are giving away their low status in their organization, while people who use “team player” language are signaling their personal authority and decision-making power. This isn’t because people in power identify more with their team. Rather, they want to avoid prematurely committing themselves to any decisions that may restrict them later, so they imply that they need approval from another stakeholder. For example, a CEO might say to a potential investor, “We’ll strongly consider your offer” to avoid prematurely committing to a business partnership, instead of saying “I’ll definitely consider your offer.”)

If you’re managing a team, Charvet recommends that you make sure that team players have opportunities to collaborate with their coworkers while also making sure lone wolves have the personal time and space they need to do their work alone.

> **Counterpoint: Balance Collaboration and Privacy**
> 
> In _The Extended Mind, _Annie Murphy Paul challenges the idea that some people work best in collaboration while others are most productive alone. Rather, she contends that across the board, people think best when they have both: They regularly spend some time with collaborators and some time alone.
> 
> According to Paul, thinking alongside other people activates different parts of the brain than thinking alone, giving you more valuable insights. In particular, friendly debates with other people inspire everyone involved to be more rigorous in their thinking, resulting in more logically sound conclusions.
> 
> On the other hand, giving yourself time alone to think allows you to dive into complex, abstract ideas that would be difficult to grapple with in a busy environment. During this time, Paul emphasizes that total privacy is key, as the human brain is easily distracted. Even the smallest stimuli can disrupt your train of thought. With this in mind, Paul advises managers to avoid forcing their employees into permanently distracting open-office plans if they can help it.

#### How Habit #4: Interpersonally Aware or Self-Preoccupied

The fourth How habit describes someone’s **sensitivity to nonverbal signals when interacting with others** : They’re either _interpersonally aware_ or _self-preoccupied_. (Charvet calls this the “Attention Direction” category.) People who are interpersonally aware are constantly monitoring the emotions and thoughts of those around them, while self-preoccupied people are only aware of their own emotions and thoughts.

Charvet contends that you can differentiate interpersonally aware and self-preoccupied people through their body language: Interpersonally aware people will display animated movements and facial expressions, whereas self-preoccupied people will generally display a flat affect.

Because your thoughts and emotions have such an impact on interpersonally aware people, send friendly nonverbal signals to make them more receptive to what you’re trying to say. On the other hand, self-preoccupied people typically won’t pick up on these signals.

(Shortform note: When communicating with someone interpersonally aware, be careful: In _The Charisma Myth_ , Olivia Fox Cabane asserts that nonverbal signals are impossible to fake. The human brain is so proficient at intuiting other people’s true intentions that disingenuous attempts to act friendly will only make them feel uneasy. Thus, the best way to communicate with the interpersonally aware is to cultivate genuine feelings of goodwill toward them.)

> **Self-Preoccupied People Are Often Misjudged**
> 
> Some argue that society suffers because self-preoccupied people are scarce and often overlooked. In _Talking to Strangers_ , Malcolm Gladwell describes people who are “mismatched”—whose outward demeanor doesn’t match their true thoughts and feelings. Self-preoccupied people would fall into this category because they don’t convey the animated movements and facial expressions that people expect to see.
> 
> Gladwell contends that generally, people overestimate the degree to which humans are emotionally transparent. Consequently, they imagine that they have a much more accurate understanding of the emotions and thoughts of those around them than they truly do.
> 
> When someone misjudges another person’s internal world, yet has full confidence in their judgment, it can have devastating consequences. For example, Gladwell recounts the case of Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her roommate largely because other people judged her to be flippant and unsympathetic about the tragic death. However, she was innocent: She was only convicted because she was mismatched and likely self-preoccupied—she was disturbed by the murder, she just didn’t show it outwardly.

#### How Habit #5: Empathetic or Analytic

The fifth How habit we’ll discuss refers to **how much someone believes emotions are a part of their work** : Are they _empathetic_ or _analytic_? (Charvet calls this the “Organization” category.) Empathetic people see all their tasks as primarily emotional endeavors—the whole point of the work they do is to positively impact someone emotionally (clients, co-workers, or anyone else they interact with). Analytic people, on the other hand, choose to focus on completing meaningful tasks without regard for how those around them feel.

Charvet explains that when discussing their work, empathetic people will describe how it made them and those around them feel. Mirror this when communicating with them—you might praise an empathetic person by saying, “I loved your proposal to construct a new branch downtown, and the shareholders are going to love it, too.” On the other hand, when discussing their work, analytic people will simply describe the tasks they completed. You can appeal to them by similarly focusing on the work: “Your proposal is great. It’s very well-researched.”

> **The Virtue of Reasoned Compassion**
> 
> In _Against Empathy_ , Paul Bloom argues that the most effective and moral action is both analytic and empathetic—a “reasoned compassion.”
> 
> If you solely perform analytic tasks without regard for their impact on others, you risk inadvertently hurting someone. However, Bloom argues that solely focusing on how people feel also causes undue harm. For one, empathy for those around you can cause you to cultivate anger against people who have done them wrong, fueling aggression and even violence.
> 
> The solution, according to Bloom, is to use objective, analytical thought to solve problems and help other people. Rationally consider other people’s needs and emotions without fully immersing yourself in their emotional state and getting carried away by irrational feelings.
> 
> To encourage the people in your life to practice reasoned compassion, consider talking them into a more balanced approach using the language of their mental habit. For example, you could say to an overly empathetic person, “When you get carried away, it sometimes frightens the people around you. Could you try to express your feelings in a more reasonable way?” Alternatively, you could say to an overly analytical person, “When you don’t think about how your work affects others, it often undermines the purpose of those tasks.”

#### How Habit #6: Personal Standards

The sixth How habit describes **the behavioral standards someone expects themselves and others to meet**. (Charvet calls this the “Rule Structure” category.)

According to Charvet, people can have one of four possible types of personal standards: objective, subjective, external, and egocentric. People with _objective_ standards believe that certain behavior is objectively virtuous and desirable, judging everyone’s work (including their own) by the same criteria. In contrast, people with _subjective_ standards believe that what’s good for one individual might not be good for another, and they tend to avoid judging or intervening in the behavior of others.

People with _external standards_ need someone or something to tell them what behavior is appropriate or objectively good. They then apply these rules as objective standards for themselves and others. Finally, people with _egocentric standards_ do whatever they believe is best and completely disregard the behavior of others. They also disregard whatever standards others have for them.

Charvet recommends discerning someone’s personal standards by directly asking them how they would ideally behave at work, then asking how someone else should ideally behave at work. To influence someone, appeal to their personal standards. For example, if someone has subjective standards, you might say, “Attending this leadership conference might not benefit everyone, but I think it would serve you well.”

> **Comparing Personal Standards to The Four Tendencies**
> 
> In _The Four Tendencies_ , Gretchen Rubin outlines a similar system, profiling four different ways that people relate to personal standards. Rubin goes into more depth than Charvet on the topic of influencing people based on their personal standards—we’ll explain her strategies for each tendency.
> 
> Charvet’s concept of external standards closely aligns with the personality type Rubin calls the “Obliger.” Obligers fulfill the expectations of others but ignore any expectations they have for themselves. Rubin notes that Obligers are prone to burnout—they strive to fulfill so many external expectations that they exhaust themselves and lose the ability to fulfill _any_ expectations. Thus, when you influence an Obliger, be careful not to overload them with too many requests.
> 
> Charvet’s egocentric standards and Rubin’s “Rebel” tendency are similar in that it’s extremely difficult for other people to influence their behavior. Rebels defy both internal and external expectations—they do whatever they feel like and resist telling themselves that they “have to” do anything. If you need to influence a Rebel, Rubin recommends convincing them that following your expectation was their idea. To do this, you can present them with the negative consequences of _not_ following your expectations, prompting them to choose to avoid those consequences.
> 
> Charvet’s subjective standards align with Rubin’s “Questioner” tendency. Questioners set standards for themselves and challenge any external expectations placed on them. Both types of people resist when others tell them what to do. However, unlike Rebels, Questioners will heed your advice if you convince them logically that your expectations make sense.
> 
> Finally, Charvet’s objective standards and Rubin’s “Upholder” tendency are similar in that they prefer to do things the one “right way.” Upholders try to be the best they can be by meeting their own ambitious internal expectations as well as everyone’s external expectations. Because they try to do everything “perfectly,” Upholders sometimes struggle to prioritize the most important expectations. When trying to convince an Upholder, take care to emphasize which of your requests matter the most and they’ll fulfill those gladly.
> 
> As with Charvet’s personal standards, Rubin explains that you can identify someone’s tendency by asking them questions. She prefers more indirect questions than Charvet—for example, she says that if you ask someone how they feel about New Year’s Resolutions, their response and corresponding logic will reveal their tendency.

#### How Habit #7: Persuasion Style

The seventh How habit refers to **the kind of evidence people need to encounter before changing their mind about something.** We’ll call someone’s preference for one form of evidence their _persuasion style_. (Charvet calls this the “Convincer Channel” category.)

Charvet asserts that everybody has one of four persuasion styles: They find _visual evidence_ , _auditory evidence_ , _written evidence_ , or _experiential evidence_ the most persuasive. You can discern which persuasion style someone has by asking them how they came to a certain conclusion; for instance, you could ask how they determined that their current job was right for them. The evidence they used to reach their answer will correspond with one of the four persuasion styles.

To get someone to come to a certain conclusion after you’ve discerned their persuasion style, present them with their preferred form of evidence. For example, if you want to persuade someone that your restaurant is successful so they give you a loan for expansion, you can show them charts of your profits as visual evidence, practice a compelling business pitch as auditory evidence, show them customer reviews as written evidence, or let them taste your food as experiential evidence.

> **Counterpoint: Are Persuasion Styles a Myth?**
> 
> The idea that different people optimally absorb information in one of four different ways is also popular in the field of education. Since 1992, many educators have been taught to tailor their curricula for students with all four learning styles: visual learners, auditory learners, reading and writing learners, and kinesthetic learners (learning through direct experience). This set of four styles is known as the “VARK model.”
> 
> However, recent research indicates that presenting students with information matching their learning style doesn’t help them understand the information any better. Although students often prefer one form of learning over another, this preference doesn’t improve their learning results. Since people have to _learn about and understand_ the evidence you give them to be convinced, it’s possible that Charvet’s model of four persuasion styles is equally invalid.
> 
> Instead of spending the effort identifying and catering to someone’s persuasion style, you may be better off relying on tried-and-true persuasion methods that work for everyone. For example, the “foot-in-the-door” tactic takes advantage of a universal weakness of human psychology: the drive to behave consistently. If you can influence someone to make a small commitment, they’re significantly more likely to make a larger commitment later on to keep their decision-making logic consistent. For instance, getting someone to post on social media about your nonprofit makes them more likely to make a donation in the future.

#### How Habit #8: Persuasion Requirements

The final How habit also has to do with persuasion, describing **_how much_ evidence someone needs before they change their mind**. We’ll call this baseline of evidence their _persuasion requirements_. (Charvet calls this the “Convincer Mode” category.)

According to Charvet, people have one of four kinds of persuasion requirements: If someone needs to see evidence a specific number of times before believing it, they have _quantity-based requirements_. If someone believes evidence only after a certain amount of time has passed, they have _time-based requirements_.

If someone believes everything after encountering just one piece of evidence—or no evidence—they have _minimal requirements_. If someone never fully believes anything, no matter how much evidence they see, they have _strict requirements._(You can still persuade them to act a certain way, but they’ll never fully adopt your way of thinking. You’ll need to re-argue your point every time you want them to do something.)

You can identify someone’s persuasion requirements by posing a hypothetical situation and directly asking them how many times they would need to encounter evidence before coming to a conclusion about that situation. For instance, you could say, “If you were looking to partner with a marketing agency, how many times would you have to meet with them before making a deal?” Even if they don’t give an exact number, their answer will reveal their persuasion requirements.

To influence someone, fulfill their persuasion requirements—give them the amount of evidence or time they need to change their mind. For example, if the person giving your restaurant a loan has strict persuasion requirements, you can convince them to give you a loan by repeating the main points of your business pitch every time you meet with them.

> **Counterpoint: Persuasion Requirements Are Flexible**
> 
> Some psychology research suggests that persuasion requirements are less dependent on an individual’s personality than on the way evidence is presented. For instance, the well-documented _confirmation bias_ indicates that people generally have minimal requirements for conclusions that seem to align with what they already believe or want to be true, and they have strict requirements for conclusions that contradict their beliefs or identities.
> 
> Similarly, research shows that everyone may have both quantity-based requirements and time-based requirements, as long as you present evidence enough times over a long enough timeframe. The _illusory truth effect_ describes how any evidence becomes more convincing if you encounter it enough times. This is because evidence we encounter multiple times is easier to recall, and our brains falsely conclude that ideas that are easy to recall are more likely to be true. We’re also susceptible to the _spacing effect_ : Information is easier to recall if we learn it over a longer timeframe. This means that all evidence becomes more convincing if you present it over time.
> 
> Thus, rather than investing effort in identifying and fulfilling someone’s persuasion requirements, you may find more success by fulfilling all persuasion requirements as much as possible. Frame your evidence so it aligns with your target’s existing beliefs as much as possible, and be persistent in presenting as much evidence as you can over as long a timeframe as possible.
