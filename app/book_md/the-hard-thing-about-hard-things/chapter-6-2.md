## Chapter 6-2: How to Scale with Processes

When you’re at 5 people, you don’t need processes. Everyone communicates with each other by talking across a table, and decisions are made quickly. There is no politics because everyone can hear each other.

When your company grows, these problems become exponentially more difficult. You will need to build processes to keep people communicating, making good decisions, and sharing knowledge.

**How do you know it’s the right time to build in processes?** When adding on a new employee feels harder than adding more work to your existing employees; and when this feeling is preventing you from growing the team quickly enough to reach the company’s goals.

#### How to Build a Process, Generally

Here are the main principles of designing a good process:

  * **Define your ultimate goal.** In product development, the ultimate goal may be customer satisfaction, not number of features. In hiring, the ultimate goal is the number of _productive_ employees you gain, not the number of interviews you run.
  * **Define the steps that lead to the ultimate goal.** In hiring, the steps involve sourcing candidates, filtering candidates, interviewing, giving job offers, onboarding and training them, and retaining them.
  * **Measure how each step is performing.** You should be able to see which step is underperforming.
  * **Assign accountability to each step.** Someone should be responsible for each step’s performance.



For more on this, Ben recommends reading Andy Grove’s _High Output Management_.

### Minimizing Politics with Processes

In an ideal startup environment, people are rewarded based on merit, on their productivity and contributions. In contrast, politics rules when people get ahead on grounds other than merit. Someone might get promoted because of a personal relationship with the boss; someone might get a raise she didn’t deserve because she’s more aggressive about asking.

**When people get ahead with politics, it becomes a bad place to work.** The people who don’t play politics resent the people who do and the managers who fall for it. Even worse, they start emulating the political behavior because it works.

How does a well-meaning company eventually get polluted by politics? It starts at the top. Even if the CEO is not political, if she doesn’t enforce disciplined processes around how the team is compensated and promoted, people will be incentivized to play politics.

**The general solution to politics is 1) to hire people with the right kind of ambition (as we covered in the last chapter, and 2) to build good processes around important decisions.** If the structured process is followed religiously, people will know the way to get ahead is to do well in the process.

Another tactic is to **maintain your composure when someone brings something controversial to you** , like a complaint about another employee or a competing job offer. Don’t react impulsively and try to make the person feel better right away; stay firm in handling it as part of your usual process. Anything you say here can be used against you when it turns into gossip.

Below we’ll cover three situations to build processes around: compensation, promotions, and complaints.

#### Compensation

##### The Problem

An employee comes to you with a job offer from another company. The salary is higher than what you pay your top performer on the team, and this employee is not the top performer. You don’t want to pay her that much, but right now you can’t afford to lose her because her work is critical to hitting your roadmap.

**The bad shortcut is to match her offer and ask her to keep it secret.** You get to keep her while limiting the damage (or so you think).

In reality, news of this will spread. She’s already talked to colleagues at the company about whether she should take this obviously better offer; when she stays, they’ll have questions. If she doesn’t want to lie, she’ll have to tell the truth. Soon everyone will know the way to get a raise is to interview for other jobs and threaten with a better offer.

##### The Solution

Run formal performance review and compensation processes. Decide how you want to compensate people based on their contributions, and make sure that is followed with no exceptions.

If someone comes to you with a competing offer and threatens to quit, you should simply say that her compensation will be reviewed with everyone else’s, and exceptions won’t be made.

#### Promotions

##### The Problem

Your VP of sales comes to you and says he wants to be COO one day. He asks whether you agree he has potential for the role; you say yes. He asks what skills he should work on to be competent for the COO role, and you make a list. He leaves, and you feel happy that you’ve coached someone to build his career.

Soon the VP of marketing comes to you in a panic. She says that the VP of sales has announced that the CEO is grooming him for the COO position and that other people should get comfortable with reporting to him soon.

##### The Solution

Create a formal process around promotions for every employee and department. Make the processes consistent across the company.

First, **define the responsibilities of each level and the expectations of performance**. To be promoted to this level, a person must meet these criteria. Be as specific as possible in defining the criteria. You can even calibrate to current people: “must be as good at system design as Teri.”

Next, define a process for promotions. A standard process can look like this:

  * Managers propose their employees for promotion, with an explanation of how their candidate meets the criteria at the level.
  * The promotion committee reviews these proposals for every significant promotion across the company. At the meeting, the committee compares the candidate’s skills to those of people currently at that level. 
  * The promotion committee makes sure promotions are level across departments, so that sales doesn’t have ten directors while product only has two.



For senior executives, the promotion committee may involve the board of directors.

#### Complaints

##### The Problem

An employee brings in a complaint about her manager’s behavior. It’s news to you, but you listen empathetically and agree it sounds like pretty bad behavior that should be punished. You promise to look into it.

Soon, you hear rumors that you think the manager’s performing terribly and you’re set to fire the manager any day now.

##### The Solution

**If someone complains about another person’s behavior, get the two in the room and hash it out right there.** This will reduce miscommunication and politics. Usually it solves the problem quickly.

**If someone complains about another person’s _performance_** , then you usually have one of two reactions:

  1. You already know about the problem. In this case, you’ve already waited too long, and you probably need to fire the person she’s complaining about.
  2. You don’t know about the problem. In this case, stop the conversation, say you disagree with the complaint. Afterward, look into the performance of the person she was complaining about. If that person is doing fine, then you’ll need to look into the complainer and question her motives.



### Titles

A small startup doesn’t need titles, but as you grow, titles will become more important for a few reasons:

  * Employees want them to polish their resume. If they look for a new job, they want to be known as “Head of Sales,” not as “Sales Ninja.”
  * The team needs to know who does what in the company and what the org chart looks like. This also helps outside partners and customers interface with the right team members.



#### How Lofty Should Titles Be?

You have control over the names of the titles in your hierarchy. How you name these titles, and how they match up to competitors in the industry, is up to you.

On one hand, **Marc Andreessen supports inflating titles**. Like compensation, a title is part of a job offer, but a title is free. Therefore, give people loftier titles—a Director at another company might be Executive Vice President at yours. It’ll be one way to attract talent to your startup, especially if you can’t compete on compensation.

In contrast, **Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook supports deflated titles** —Vice Presidents at other companies have to join as Directors or Managers. The benefits:

  * Every new employee recalibrates when they join, and then have to rise to their original title through merit. This feels more fair to the team.
  * Business departments tend to have inflated titles above their engineering counterparts, and he wants to make product and engineering the core of the company.
  * He wants the org chart to be clear and meaningful. How does a firm operate if there are a hundred VPs?



Of course, Facebook has tens of thousands of employees and faces problems that your startup may not.

#### Enforcing Performance at Titles

The Peter Principle suggests that people are promoted to their “level of incompetence.” At that point, they can’t be promoted further, and they stagnate at that role. This is largely unavoidable because you can’t predict ahead of time how well someone will handle the promotion. However, the Peter Principle causes a few problems:

  * A poor performer at a level is demotivating to everyone else at that level. If there’s a bozo at the Vice President level, all the other VPs will wonder how he got that job and why he deserves the same level.
  * Everyone below that level will use the worst performer to ask for promotions. All the directors will look to the worst VP in the company and ask for a promotion once they exceed his performance.



**To avoid the Peter Principle, be deliberate about promoting people only after they have the skills required of the title** (we covered this earlier in the chapter). (Shortform note: Ben doesn’t explicitly discuss how to rid a level of poor performers, but the natural solution is to demote people who once had promise but now don’t meet the title’s expectations.)

### Not Everyone Scales

As your company grows, the job requirements for every manager changes. Being the company’s only salesperson is very different from running a 5-person sales team, which is in turn very different from running a 100-person global salesforce.

**Every time your company scales, people (especially executives) need to requalify for their job.** What used to work at a smaller stage may no longer work at a larger stage.

You may feel disloyal to an executive who has done a tremendous job to date. But you don’t owe her the job. You owe it to the rest of the team to build a world-class team, so that everyone has a better chance of succeeding.

This applies to you as well. As the company scales, you may not be the best person to run the company, and for the sake of the company you might need to replace yourself.

#### Scale Anticipation

As you ponder how your company will scale in the next few years, you may try to predict who on your team will work well at the larger scale and who will not.

Ben thinks this prediction is counterproductive, primarily because operating at scale is a learnable skill, not a natural talent. Therefore, **it’s hard to predict how someone will perform at a scale** they (and you) have never seen. For example, it was never clear whether Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates could scale beyond a small startup, yet they both learned to oversee tens of thousands of employees.

**Prematurely judging someone as incapable causes real damage:**

  * It will affect how you train them, thus causing a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you think certain people aren’t cut out for scale, then you won’t bother to coach them, which will make them even less fit for scale.
  * In the interim period, you will feel guilty working with them, because you suspect their days are numbered.
  * You’ll prematurely hire execs who are competent at larger stages. As we’ve covered, they’ll be useless for months until you hit that scale.



Instead, judge each person on the work they’re doing today. When it comes time to scale, evaluate what your company needs then and who can best do the job at that moment. Everything further in the future carries too little information to make good decisions right now.

### Organizational Design

As your company grows, how should you design how everyone fits together? Do you group people by functions (such as sales, marketing, product) or do you group by business line?

The general idea is that **people who report to the same manager communicate the most**. The farther away teams are in the org chart, the harder it is to communicate.

Every company needs its own organizational answer. Here’s how to design yours:

  * **Identify what knowledge needs to be communicated, and who needs to hear it.** For example, a product’s technical performance needs to be understood by engineering, product management, sales, marketing, and customer support.
  * **Identify what decisions need to be made frequently.** Examples of decision types include which features to build, how to announce product improvements, and personnel changes.
  * **Put the most important communication paths and decisions in one group.** This will improve productivity by reducing communication overhead.
  * **Decide who’s going to run the group.** Note how you should only pick the manager after you design the organization, not the other way around.
  * **Mitigate the communication paths and decisions you did not optimize for.** You can build processes that allow people in different groups to communicate and make decisions, even if they’re not in the same team.



### The Role of Human Resources

The HR department is like quality assurance for your people. Quality assurance doesn’t know how to produce a great product, but they sure can tell when something’s wrong. Likewise, HR can’t produce a great place to work by themselves, but it can tell when it’s bad.

An HR team will help your company in these areas:

  * **Hiring:** Is the interview process well-designed? Is it well-executed?
  * **Compensation:** Is your compensation competitive in the market? Is it fair internally based on performance?
  * **Training:** How long does a new hire take to become productive?
  * **Management:** Is the review and feedback process well-designed? Do people understand what is expected of them? How do you handle poor performers?
  * **Motivation:** Is your team motivated to work every day? Do you retain employees well?



When you hire a head of HR, look for these skills and qualities:

  * **Process design:** HR is all about good process design and methodical execution.
  * **Motivation to help the team, not get credit:** A great HR organization seeks to improve the company, not to get credit for it. This builds trust in HR throughout the organization, which in turn helps HR do its job better.
  * **Perception:** A good HR leader can detect people problems in the company before it becomes obvious.
