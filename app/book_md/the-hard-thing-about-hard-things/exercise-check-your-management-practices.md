## Exercise: Check Your Management Practices

Think about how you manage your team and compare it to the book’s best practices.

* * *

What metrics do you use to measure the performance of your team?

What is the ultimate goal your team is driving toward? Do the metrics signal progress toward this goal? Or do they measure something that’s only slightly related?

What is your perspective on one-on-one meetings? How could you make them more useful?

How frequently do you give feedback to your direct reports? Do you want to give feedback more or less than you currently do?
