## Chapter 6-1: How to Manage People

Once you hire the right people and train them, you’ll need systems in place to keep them productive and happy. You should also prepare to change your management practices as your company grows—what used to work with just 5 people working around a table will fail when you have 50 people.

This chapter covers an array of topics, from company culture to measuring performance to reducing office politics.

### Culture

**Culture consists of key values that define what your company does and how it does it.** Examples of key values include frugality, customer obsession, and beauty of design. Good key values meaningfully **distinguish you from your competitors**.

A strong culture is practically useful—it helps you **filter for hires who will fit** , and it **shapes the behavior of people** at the company.

Beyond just articulating vague cultural values, **implement a simple, scalable behavior that reinforces the key value**. Here are examples:

  * Frugality: At Amazon, Jeff Bezos knew that competing in the cutthroat online retail industry would require the lowest pricing, which required the company to save as much money on overhead as it could. He built the company’s first desks by buying a door and screwing legs into them. This reinforced the cultural value of frugality and how the employees are saving money to save the customers money. Even today, as one of the world’s largest companies, Amazon still uses door desks.
  * In service of entrepreneurs: At Ben’s venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the team’s cultural value is to be in service of the entrepreneur, not to be their bosses like other VCs. They consider it disrespectful and inexcusable to be late to a meeting with entrepreneurs, so they instituted a late fee of $10 per minute (being ten minutes late required paying $100 to the other person).
  * Innovation: In the early years of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg wanted his team to innovate quickly and avoid being stifled by caution. He adopted a slogan: “Move fast and break things.” This gave even young employees permission to innovate, even at the cost of stability.



These small actions reinforced the key cultural value across the company in a highly scalable way. Importantly, **they also change how people behave in the business** and how the company accomplishes its goals. In contrast, foosball tables and free snacks don’t actually drive how the business operates; therefore, they’re not part of culture, they’re just perks.

Note also how the cultural examples above are highly distinctive and thus inappropriate for other companies. A company based around beautiful design, like Jack Dorsey’s Square, would find door-desks abhorrent. This is OK—a strong culture helps you filter out people who don’t belong and wouldn’t be happy in your company.

### Focusing on the Right Metrics

To track performance, you will need to choose metrics. However, a poorly defined metric can cause people to optimize for the wrong thing and might even sabotage your efforts.

Horowitz recounts a few examples:

  * At Netscape, he focused the engineering team on metrics around schedule, features, and bugs. The team produced the desired features on time and with few bugs, but the side effect was that the individual features were just not very good.
  * In Opsware, the sales team consistently booked most of the quarter’s revenue at the end of the quarter. This made revenue feel unpredictable. In response, Ben designed an incentive for booking revenue in the first two months of the quarter. The side effect: The deals that would have been booked in the last month of the quarter were simply delayed to the next quarter, without raising total revenue.
  * At HP, business lines were judged by revenue and profit numbers. The side effect: Some business managers cut R&D to hit profits, but this crippled their long-term outcome.



Metrics have their place, but **be judicious about how you define and use them** :

  * Be clear about what your ultimate goal is and how that’s different from a short-term metric. It’s not about next quarter’s profits; it’s about your company’s profits over the next ten years. It’s not about shipping a quantity of features; it’s about building features that delight your customers.
  * Once you have your ultimate goals, design metrics that are consistent with them.
  * Anticipate the side effects of your metrics. Think about how people would exploit the roles to maximize their personal outcome at the expense of the company.
  * Think about qualitative goals you’re not measuring. How is your company doing relative to competitors? Are your customers happy? Is the team happy?



### One-on-One Meetings

One-on-one meetings are private meetings between a manager and her direct report. Compared to email or group meetings, they’re relatively informal and intimate, and thus provide a good avenue for communication.

Some people think one-on-one meetings are pointless, but they’ve usually been victims of bad ones. In reality, one-on-ones are fantastic opportunities to learn about problems, both in the company and with the employee. They’re also a place to bounce new, unformed ideas around before they’re ready for formal presentation.

Here’s how to run a one-on-one:

  * Adopt the mindset that **the one-on-one is a meeting for the employee, not for the manager**. As a manager, you should talk only 10% of the time and listen 90% of the time.
  * Ask your direct report to set the agenda and send it to you in advance.
  * During the meeting, try to read between the lines and draw out the important issues. The more soft-spoken the person is, the more important this will be. 



Here are questions that Ben likes asking in one-on-ones:

  * What’s our number one problem? Why?
  * If you were me, what would you do differently?
  * What’s the biggest opportunity that we’re not chasing?
  * Are you happy working here? 



### Delivering Feedback

(Shortform note: This section originally comes from Chapter 7.)

As a manager, you should constantly be evaluating people and giving feedback. As a CEO, you should have an opinion on everything in your company.

Constantly giving feedback has a few benefits:

  * It gives people ways to improve. In turn, this makes them more productive and makes them feel you care about their development. 
  * It makes personnel decisions easier, such as writing performance reviews and deciding compensation and promotions.
  * It makes it OK across the team to give feedback. If you model the behavior, your team will be comfortable sharing bad news and telling each other how to improve.



You should develop a personal style around giving feedback based on your own personality. However, here are general pointers that apply to everyone:

  * **Come from an earnest desire to improve the person.** When someone trusts your intentions, she will be much more receptive to what you have to say.
  * **Be honest.** Believe in what you say. People detect inauthenticity, and that kills trust.
  * **Customize the feedback to the person.** Some people are delicate; others are thick-skinned. Some people get the point right away; others need a message drilled in. Delivering the message the wrong way for the person will be counterproductive.
  * **Be clear, not vague.** Vague feedback is useless (“it’s good, just needs one more pass”). Point out precisely what needs work (“your conclusion is confusing because it doesn’t logically follow from the earlier slides.”)
  * **Avoid the “shit sandwich.”** This is a rookie manager tactic where you start with a compliment, give the feedback, then end with a compliment. Over time, your compliments will start sounding inauthentic, and you will sound rehearsed.
  * **Don’t be mean.** Don’t use feedback to bully someone or assert your dominance. If you come from an earnest desire to improve the person, this shouldn’t be an issue.
  * **Don’t embarrass someone in front of the team.** Some feedback can be delivered in a team setting, but embarrassing someone will cause her to resent you.
  * **Open up discussion.** Be open to the idea that you might be wrong. Encourage the person to share her opinion and argue where you’ve misjudged. Resolve the discussion so that you both understand the quality bar better.



### Balancing Creativity vs Accountability

As a manager, you want to **balance creativity with accountability**. You want to give people freedom to come up with new ideas and notice problems, but you also want to hold them reasonably accountable so their work doesn’t get sloppy. Conversely, you don’t want to be so tight on accountability that you stifle creativity.

Here’s an example situation: Say an engineer comes to you and points out a deep product problem that she estimates will take 3 months to fix. Everyone agrees the problem is worth fixing if it takes just 3 months. She later finishes the task, but it takes 9 months instead. **How should you react?**

  * If you praise her for her creativity, then other people who work hard to meet their timelines will feel their discipline is pointless. Work will get sloppier.
  * If you chastise her for taking triple the time she estimated, then people will learn that taking risks can be punished. It’s better to take the low-risk work that can be solved easily and on time.



But it’s not black and white. Each situation demands a different response. **How you should react depends on a few factors:**

  * **How difficult the task was:** The more complex and unpredictable a task, the more leeway you should give. Rearchitecting your technology is hard. Sending an email by a deadline is easy. The first should be given more flexibility than the second.
  * **How senior the person is:** More experienced people should be held to a higher standard of forecasting and results. For junior employees, slip-ups are learning opportunities.
  * **How appropriate the risk was:** Judge a person’s decisions whether they seemed sensible at the time, given the information they had. For the engineer in the example above, did the product problem really need fixing, or was it a low priority that she wasted 9 months on?



Adjusting your feedback this way will help balance creativity and accountability in your team.

### Freaky Friday Management

It’s common for two departments to clash with each other. The sales team might blame the product team for moving too slowly and falling behind competitors. In return, the product team might blame the sales team for bringing too many competing priorities. These conflicts can drag everyone down, especially if the two departments need to work together frequently.

When these problems are irreconcilable, Ben suggests the **“Freaky Friday” technique—have the department heads do each others’ jobs for a period**. This is named after the film _Freaky Friday_ , where a bickering mother and daughter switch bodies and have epiphanies about how difficult the other person’s life is; when they return, they have a newfound appreciation for each other.

Likewise, a department head who blames her colleague probably doesn’t appreciate the full extent of what the colleague has to deal with. Forcing her to take her colleague’s job will cast her actions in a new lens. After undergoing Freaky Friday, the two department heads will likely find more productive ways to resolve their conflict and bring harmony to both teams.

### Dealing with Bad Employees

Most companies try to hire the smartest people they can find. As we’ve seen, intelligence with the wrong kind of ambition can cause deep problems with politics and morale.

Intelligent people can also be poor employees in at least three other ways:

  * **The constant contrarian:** This person criticizes more than is productive. She nitpicks for weaknesses for their own sake and turns criticisms personal. She might do this because she feels disempowered (she has no other recourse to change things) or she’s a rebel as a fundamental character trait.
  * **The undependable flake:** This person can perform miracles in some times but be totally undependable in others. The volatility may have a serious root cause—Ben worked with an engineer who had bipolar disorder and abused cocaine.
  * **The abrasive bully:** This person is simply impolite and insults people easily. She causes people to simply shut down around her, stifling communication.



There are a few interesting patterns to these problems:

  * **The smarter the person is, the more damage they cause.** For the contrarian and bully, people actually trust their opinions and are intimidated in dissenting. They also probably do fundamentally solid work, so 1) you have more hope for their recovery, which makes you accept them for longer, and 2) you have less leverage to fire them.
  * **The higher up the person is, the more damage they cause.**
  * **You might hope for a miraculous recovery, but you may just have to fire the person.** Sometimes the root cause is so deep that you cannot fix it. A person can be on your team only if they can work with the team and be productive.



#### You Only Have Room for One

Sports coaches often have to deal with diva superstar athletes. They face a conflict—do they tolerate their bad behavior, thus possibly lowering discipline across the team; or do they enforce their rules, thus risking losing the superstar?

One approach is to **tolerate behavior from only one person**. Coach Phil Jackson, coach of the historic Chicago Bulls, said of the unpredictable Dennis Rodman, “There is only room for one Dennis Rodman on this team.” (Shortform note: You should make clear you are tolerating this person only because she is unquestionably brilliant and vital to the team, and still enforce a line that even this person cannot cross.)

### Management Debt

Software engineering has an idea of technical debt—if you take shortcuts now with hacky code, you incur a debt that has to be paid later through redesigning the software. Management has management debt as well—if you take the easy solution to fix a difficult situation, you will pay for it later.

Ben covers a few flavors of management debt.

#### Promoting Two People to the Same Role

Say you have two leading candidates for a senior role. They have complementary strengths and weaknesses—one’s great at the technical functions but a weak manager, and the other person is the opposite. **The shortcut is to promote both people to the same role** , thinking they can cover for each other’s weaknesses.

However, this causes problems with politics and accountability. Which members of the team report to whom? Which manager is responsible for which decisions? Can one manager override the other? And if the team performs poorly, who’s accountable? This lack of clarity will paralyze the team.

It’s better to promote one person to the role, then help her grow where she’s weak.

#### Not Running Performance Reviews

People need feedback to improve, and you probably know this. But performance reviews take time to run, seem “too corporate” for a startup environment, and risk offending people. So you choose not to run them.

Over time, you accrue the debt: People stay blind to their weaknesses and inevitably perform worse than their fullest potential. They might even get frustrated that they’re not getting feedback and guidance on how to improve.
