## Chapters 7-8: How to Be a Good CEO

To review advice from Chapter 4, being a CEO is unnatural. Humans didn’t evolve in a way that makes running a thousand-person company a natural thing to do. This also means people aren’t born CEOs out of the womb. It is a learned skill; even worse, it’s a skill that you can only learn by actually doing it.

**So when things go wrong, don’t beat yourself up too much.** Remember the earlier advice about how to get through the Struggle—don’t give up, talk to people, clarify your problems, and be decisive while emotionally attached.

But make no mistake, you do have the responsibility, and no one but you has the responsibility. **Every problem in your company is truly your fault** —you set the direction of the company, you hired the people to work on that direction, and you created the environment that the people work in. If you miss a growth target or lose a key customer or have a toxic work culture, it is your fault.

It is a lonely job. No employee, board member, or friend knows anywhere near what you know about your business, so you will have to make difficult decisions by yourself.

**But if you didn’t want this job, you shouldn’t have signed up for it. So learn how to do it better.**

### CEO Responsibilities

The most important responsibility of a CEO is leadership. You can measure a leader by the quantity and quality of people who want to follow her.

In practice, people want to follow **leaders who do three things well** :

  1. Know what to do—articulate the vision and make decisions
  2. Get the team to work on the vision
  3. Achieve results



We’ll cover each in more detail.

#### Know What to Do

Knowing what to do consists of two activities: articulating the vision and making decisions to achieve the vision.

##### Articulating the Vision

The vision is the story for what the company is capable of doing and why it’s exciting to work on. It’s also the strategy behind how the company can achieve this vision. It answers the deepest questions of why: “Why is this important to build? Why is the world better off because of our work? Why should I work here instead of anywhere else?”

A compelling vision has multiple benefits:

  * It gets talented people (who have the choice of working anywhere) to work for you. 
  * It retains those people when your company struggles. They could easily leave for another job, but they stay because the vision compels them.
  * It aligns the entire team to make decisions in the same direction.
  * It motivates the team.



The CEO is responsible for articulating the vision. She doesn’t have to have originated the vision, but she needs to be its spokesperson and protector.

Steve Jobs was a master at this, getting people to follow him to his computing company NeXT in the 1980s, then getting people motivated at the failing Apple when he returned in 1997. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos also frequently communicates the company’s long-term vision around customer focus, as he did in this shareholder letter in 1997.

##### Making Decisions

Just as engineers output code and marketers output advertisements, the CEO outputs decisions. **A good CEO makes high-quality decisions quickly.**

Making decisions requires a few key activities:

  * **Ponder the important questions** : What are we good at, and how do we get better? What’s the most important thing we’re not doing? What are our competitors doing? Is our company healthy? Is our team happy? 
  * **Gather information voraciously.** Get information broadly, from your employees, customers, competitors, and outsiders. Make information gathering a central part of your day, from private reading to staff meetings and one-on-ones. 
  * **Be bold.** You will never have enough information to make a decision with complete confidence. Your decisions may be unpopular with your team. You need to make them anyway. Often waiting to make a decision is worse.



#### Get the Team to Work on the Vision

A compelling vision is well and good, but to make it real, you need a team to build toward it. This means hiring great people, then getting them to do good work.

The best way to accomplish both is to make your company a great place to work, which has been the subject of the past few chapters. In review, a **great place to work requires these attributes of the CEO, the company, and the culture** :

  * People trust the CEO to take care of them. The CEO has the right kind of ambition—to push the team’s success over her own personal success. Over time, people come to see the company as their own and call it “my company.”
  * People are clear on what their jobs are and how success is measured.
  * People believe their work makes a difference to the success of the company and, by extension, to their personal success. The compensation scheme and promotion processes are fair and reward actual contributions, not politics.
  * They have as few barriers to getting work done as possible. They don’t have to deal with office politics and overly bureaucratic processes.
  * People enjoy working with the people around them. People clearly pull their own weight; the ones who don’t are regularly removed from the team.



#### Achieve Results

Having defined a vision and made progress toward the vision, ideally you’ve achieved the results you were looking for.

**But what are “good” results? It depends on the size and nature of the opportunity, which are idiosyncratic to each company.**

Therefore, you should **measure your results against your own company’s opportunity, not anyone else’s company**. It doesn’t make sense for a fruit vendor to grow as quickly as Facebook did. It doesn’t make sense for a hardware company to have margins as good as a software company. Hoping otherwise can be destructive.

#### Improve Your Weakness

All CEOs have different strengths and weaknesses along these three activities. A deep strength in one area can _temporarily_ compensate for another—a CEO with a blindingly bright vision can attract people even if the organization is a mess. A CEO who achieves results can be a less articulate communicator of the vision.

However, you should find your weakness and work on it.

### Ones and Twos

There are two types of managers:

  * **“Ones” are strategic decision makers.** They enjoy spending time reading and thinking, when they collect information about their employees, customers, and market, then come up with new strategic ideas. They’re comfortable making complex decisions on incomplete information. They tend to be flexible in changing goals.
  * **“Twos” are process runners.** They enjoy having clear goals and optimizing processes around these goals. They like progress and motion over sitting down and thinking. They get more anxious about big decisions than Ones do. They tend to be more rigid in keeping goals.



**Which type is best for a CEO?** Ideally, she has elements of both. A One CEO without any Two capabilities will create a chaotic company. A Two CEO without any One capabilities will slow down decision making. However, in practice, Horowitz says that most founding CEOs are Ones.

**Which type is best for executives?** Ideally, they’re a hybrid of both—they’re Ones when running their own teams, but Twos at the executive team level. For example, a head of marketing would take direction on the overall company direction and how marketing fits into it, then make strategic decisions for marketing within those constraints. These are **“Functional Ones.”**

**The best model for an executive team is a One CEO surrounded by Twos/Functional Ones.** This allows for fast decision making and clear goal setting at the top, which is then carried into execution by the company divisions. In contrast, having One executives report to a One CEO can cause friction when the One executives make conflicting decisions.

**This ideal model has a weakness—it makes CEO succession difficult.** You have a few choices, all of which carry risks:

  * Promote a Two executive to the CEO role: This leaves the company in charge of a process-oriented Two, which can slow down decision making and strategic flexibility. (Microsoft did this when replacing Bill Gates with Steve Ballmer.)
  * Promote a One from a lower level: This is riskier than promoting a top-level executive, since the person is often younger and less experienced. Expect turnover from executives who will feel rejected; this can be crippling for a small company. (GE did this when promoting Jack Welch in 1981.)
  * Hire a CEO from outside: Compared to promoting a CEO internally, this risks bringing in someone who has far less internal knowledge about the company and culture. The book _Good to Great_ suggests that internally promoted CEOs do better than external hired CEOs for this reason. (Shortform note: Read our summary of Good to Great here.)



CEO succession is always hard. The ideal is to promote an internal One to CEO and hope the transition goes smoothly.

### The Importance of Courage

To be a good CEO, you need to be both intelligent and courageous. Intelligence helps you find the right decision to make. Courage helps you execute the decision, even when it’s terrifying.

**Decisions can be terrifying for a few reasons:**

  * You don’t have enough information to know whether it’ll work. At best, you might have only 10% of the information that a business school case study has. 
  * The decision is unpopular with the team. While it may produce long-term benefits, it can cause deep short-term costs, such as layoffs of entire departments or rebuilding the company’s capabilities. You may face tremendous social pressure against the decision you want to make.
  * The consequences of making the wrong decision are severe. It might mean the life and death of your company. This only gets worse as the company grows.



Intel CEO Andy Grove faced all three. Through the 1970s, Intel’s main business line was in memory chips (employing 80% of its headcount), but in the early 1980s, Japanese companies began dumping chips at bargain prices. Grove knew the memory industry was done and jettisoned the memory business to go into microprocessors for personal computers. This was deeply unpopular at the time with both employees and investors, but it turned out to be one of the great decisions in business history.

**A courageous CEO makes the right decision, no matter how hard it is.** To paraphrase boxing trainer Cus D’Amato: The difference between a hero and a coward is not what they feel. They’re both terrified. But the coward runs away from that fear. The hero fights off the fear to do what she has to do.

Like any other skill, courage can be developed. You face decisions everyday between doing what’s easy, consensus, and wrong and what’s hard, contrarian, and right. Each time you make the hard choice, you will become a little more courageous.

### Peacetime vs. Wartime CEOs

Companies can go through peacetime and wartime periods. The company needs a different type of CEO in each period.

**Peacetime is when the company is handily beating its competitors and its market is growing.** It can focus on further expanding the market and on strengthening the company. The company values creativity and diversity of thinking.

  * An example is Google in the 2000s, when its search engine was so profitable and so competitive that it could carve out 20% of employee time on open projects and focus on blue-sky projects like broadening Internet access globally.



**Wartime is when the company faces an existential threat.** The threat is often external and can be caused by the macroeconomic environment, competition, changes in the supply chain. The company needs to do everything it can to survive and a limited window to do it. The company demands discipline and shuts down dissent that can compromise the mission.

  * An example is Andy Grove’s Intel in the 1980s, which faced fierce competition in its core memory business from low-cost Japanese suppliers.



**The CEO you need in peacetime is very different from the CEO you need in wartime.**

  * A peacetime CEO encourages creativity, dissent, and autonomy. A wartime CEO requires a militant focus on the mission and total agreement with the plan, and she micromanages to ensure it’s being executed.
  * A peacetime CEO spends time on open strategic thinking and builds contingency plans. A wartime CEO often knows they have just one shot to survive and focuses all her effort on that.



Most management manuals are written about successful companies in peacetime. Very few are about what wartime companies have to do to survive, and so many CEOs don’t have training manuals on being a wartime CEO (Ben points out Andy Grove’s books as the rare exceptions).

At any given time, **you need to know which situation you’re in and choose the right management style to execute it**. It’d be a mistake to emulate Google’s famous perks and flexibility when your company is going to go bankrupt in three months.

Can a CEO be a good peacetime and wartime CEO? It’s possible but difficult. They require entirely different actions, and you need to know which situation you’re in and which rules to break.

### Should You Sell?

At points in the company’s lifetime, you might get buyers who propose buying your company. On the one hand, it can mean more financial stability than you ever thought possible. On the other, it can mean letting go of the vision that compelled you to start the company in the first place and betraying a team that is still excited to chase that vision.

Necessarily, selling your company is part rational and part emotional.

#### The Rational Side

On the rational side, **answer two questions about your company** :

  * Is the opportunity still growing? Is the market bigger than anyone realizes?
  * Do you have a chance at being number one in the market? How hard will achieving this be?



**If you answer “yes” to both, then you should stay independent**. The reason is that you will estimate a lofty valuation for your company that likely no one will be able to meet, because your project relies on too many unknowns.

  * For example, early in its life, Google received acquisition offers for $1 billion. While an astronomical amount for any company, it grossly underestimated the ultimate value of the company (now 1000 times larger, at $1 trillion). The market Google now commands turned out to be far larger than the markets that potential buyers like Yahoo owned at the time.



These aren’t easy questions to answer. You may think the market is larger than it really will be. You may think you’re in one huge market, but in reality you service just a small market.

Your answers to these questions will change over time. Ben’s perspective on selling Opsware changed from beginning to end:

  * When they first received acquisition offers, Opsware had just 50 customers. But Ben thought there would be at least 10,000 target customers, and they had a good shot at being market leader. If they took 30% of the market, their valuation would suggest 60 times forward revenue to buy. No one took the offer.
  * Near the end of Opsware, the market had grown significantly, but competition was fiercer. Developments in virtualization technology also meant they needed to overhaul parts of their product, and he felt the team was tired. He decided it was time to sell for the right price.



#### The Emotional Side

There are emotional pieces to selling your company, from the commitment you made to the team to the personal commitments you make to your family. Ben suggests advice for two major pieces: your personal finances and your communication with the team.

**For personal finances, pay yourself a reasonable salary when the business might start attracting buyers**. During the startup phase, investors usually encourage paying the founders as little salary as possible to best incentivize growing a valuable company. However, when a business might be acquired, the attitude should shift—the CEO should be paid sufficient salary so she isn’t tempted to sell purely to make her bill payments.

**For team communication, be transparent about your decision process for acquisitions.** State that while your company has a chance to be number one in a large and growing market, then the company will stay independent. If not, it might be sold. When framed this way, the company owners and the staff are fairly well aligned. This transparency is better than dodging questions about acquisitions; your employees will take your vague answers however they like and start rumors.
