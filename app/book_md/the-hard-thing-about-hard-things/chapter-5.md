## Chapter 5: How to Hire and Train

The last chapter had advice on what to do when things go wrong. From here, Ben switches to positive advice on how to do things right. This chapter and the next will focus on people management, what Ben considers the most important part of running a business.

### Take Care of the People

**Take care of the people, and the products and profits will follow.** If you reverse the priorities, you’ll end up with a miserable workplace and possibly sabotage your success.

You can best take care of your people by making your company a good place to work. In Horowitz’s terms, in a good place to work:

  * People are clear on what their jobs are and how success is measured.
  * People believe their work makes a difference to the success of the company and, by extension, to their personal success.
  * They have as few barriers to getting work done as possible. A good work environment avoids office politics, infighting, and overly bureaucratic processes, which all get in the way of doing good work.
  * People enjoy working with the people around them. They don’t always have to like each other personally, but they respect that everyone is pulling their weight.



A poor place to work inverts all of these. People aren’t clear what their jobs are; they don’t know if their work means anything; their work gets stymied by dumb obstacles; and people despise whom they work with.

#### Is a Good Workplace _Necessary_?

Some might argue that a good workplace alone isn’t enough to build a successful company—there are plenty of workplaces with great cultures that failed because they failed to achieve product/market fit. Conversely, a good workplace isn’t necessary—there are companies with horrid cultures that still became massively successful.

So why build a good workplace at all? First, because good workplaces help during bad times. When your company starts failing, your team members will start questioning whether leaving is a better career and financial decision. In bad times, other than needing a job, **the only thing keeping employees around is enjoying their work**.

Second, having a good workplace is an end in itself. Even if your company fails, you can help people feel proud of the work they’ve done and the people they’ve worked alongside. This reputation will stay with you even after your company dies.

### Hiring

Every company wants to hire the best people they can find. Ben’s general advice:

  * **Hire for strength, not for lack of weakness.** You need people to do their jobs, not be inoffensive office fixtures that do little.
  * Focus on the ultimate goal—how many _productive_ people have you added? Don’t just fixate on narrow metrics like interviews conducted and hires made.



Ben’s advice focuses on hiring executives, but the principles can be generalized to hiring individual contributors as well.

#### Hiring the Right Kind of Ambition

Ambition comes in two flavors. **The wrong kind of ambition emphasizes a person’s personal success regardless of the company’s success. The right kind of ambition emphasizes the company’s success** , with the person’s success coming only as a consequence.

Hiring people with the wrong kind of ambition pollutes the company. These people are demotivating to work for—why work endless hours just to further the manager’s personal career? In contrast, working alongside people with the right kind of ambition is invigorating—everyone is working toward a mission that is larger than themselves.

You can screen for ambition in the interview process. **People with the wrong kind of ambition do these things:**

  * They use “I” when talking about successes, and “we” when talking about failures. When you probe further into successes, they often know little about the actual details.
  * They care about their personal compensation above details on how the company will win.
  * They talk about their career work in terms of personal stepping stones, such as “this was my consumer play” or “I wanted to build out my resume.”



People with the right kind of ambition do the opposite:

  * They use “we” when talking about successes and “I” when talking about mistakes/failures. They know minute details about how successes were achieved. They blame themselves for team mistakes.
  * They ask first about how the company plans to win. Their personal compensation comes second.



#### Hiring Executives

When you’re a startup, you may prefer to promote people from within.

So why hire senior executives at all? To move faster. They know how to do things that your company doesn’t know right now, and **bringing in outside knowledge will help your team learn faster and grow more quickly**.

  * For example, if you’re a product and engineering-focused team, no one on the team may know how to build a dominant sales force. While you can experiment and learn internally, an incoming VP of sales can accelerate the strategy far faster.



For any senior executive, consider how much of their job requires inside knowledge vs. outside knowledge. This will influence whether you should promote from within or hire from outside.

  * An engineering manager needs to understand your proprietary codebase, and this is more important and difficult than learning how to run an engineering team. It’s likely better to promote this person from within.
  * An enterprise sales manager needs to understand how to build a sales process and a sales team, how to run both with discipline, and how to target the right people in the target buyer. With this framework, they can sell virtually any product. It’s likely better to hire this person from outside.



##### Executive Hiring Process

In the last chapter, we discussed common root causes of failure in hiring executives, such as hiring for the wrong stage of your company and hiring for lack of weakness rather than strength. This often happens because **you are hiring people who do their jobs better than you can**.

Here’s a process for hiring executives to avoid those mistakes:

  * **Understand the job requirements well.** Interview domain experts and learn what makes them successful. **Even better, do the job yourself.** Be the acting VP of whatever department you’re hiring for. You may be scared that you know nothing about the role, but that’s exactly why you need to learn it.
  * **Make a list of job requirements.** What strengths are you looking for? What weaknesses can you tolerate? Note that different positions need different skills—a VP of sales may need to be a disciplined team manager, while a CFO may not.
  * **Write questions that test for these requirements. Write good answers to those questions.** We’ll cover examples for a VP of sales below.
  * **Assemble an interview team.** This should consist of two groups of people: 1) people who can assess the candidate’s functional performance, 2) people who can assess the candidate’s fit after joining. You can include people within or outside the company, including domain experts and board members.
  * **Assign questions to each member of the team** based on how well they can distinguish good vs. bad answers.
  * **Review the interview with each interviewer.** You can verify that the interviewer understands the criteria and how to grade the candidate.
  * **Call references yourself.** Beyond taking their evaluation, ask questions that will test against your hiring requirements.
  * **Make the final decision yourself.** Only you have the global view of the hiring requirements, the company’s needs, and the interview team’s scoring. Do not hire by committee.



##### Example Questions for VP of Sales

In an appendix, Horowitz provides sample questions for hiring the head of enterprise sales. They fall into a number of categories in job function, management skills, and general abilities.

(Shortform note: The questions here are framed as questions for the interviewer to score the candidate on, but they can be adapted to be questions posed to the candidate directly)

**Job Function**

  * Sales fundamentals: Does she know our company and product, our market, and our competition? Does she understand the difference between transactional reps and enterprise reps?
  * Sales process: Does she understand the components of a process (CRM, sales collateral, demos)? Can she develop her own sales process, or does she just run an existing one?
  * Hiring salespeople: How does she design her interview process? How does she find top candidates?
  * Sales training: How does she train people to execute the sales process? Does she have her own training materials?
  * Sales management: How does she enforce the sales process? How would she set up a compensation plan (spiffs, accelerators)?



**Management Skills**

  * Managing direct reports: How does she evaluate her people? How does she train them and continue to improve them? How does she promote people or fire people?
  * Making decisions: How does she go about making decisions? How does she gather information? 
  * Strategy: How does she plan strategy? How does she communicate this to the team?
  * Metrics: How does she decide what metrics to focus on? What are the side effects of focusing on these metrics?
  * Organizational design: How would she design her organization? Why?



**General Abilities**

  * Intelligence: How quickly does she “get it”? Beyond her immediate job, can she help with overall company strategy?
  * Motivation: Does she have the right motivations to join our company? 
  * Integrity: Is she honest or bullshitty?
  * Culture: Would I be happy working for her?



#### Hiring Executives from Big Companies

**Executives at big companies and executives at startups have very different working styles.**

In big companies, executives have lots of demands on their time, from departments they manage, to colleagues who want help, to customers and partners who want attention. Thus, big company executives are great at prioritizing, improving processes, and designing organizations. They don’t need to create as much as they need to filter, triage, and optimize.

In startups, nothing gets done until you do it. No one wants your attention, and the ball doesn’t move forward unless you push it. Therefore, startup executives need to be able to do the functional work well, know how to build a team from scratch, and know how to build processes from scratch. Startup executives need to create new directions themselves and push them forward.

Therefore, **a big company executive might be a poor fit for a startup**. He might land in your company and sit around waiting for things to happen. Then nothing gets done, and people resent his high compensation.

This isn’t a total dismissal of all big company execs. You just need to be careful when hiring them and when onboarding them.

**When interviewing a big company exec, ask questions that indicate awareness of the difference in job needs:**

  * “What will you do in your first month?” Look for people who have lots of initiatives they want to push forward. Beware of people who expect to inherit a list of ideas they just need to pick from.
  * “How will your previous work differ from work at our company?” Look for people who are aware of the differences in work style and pacing. Beware of people who think the jobs are identical.
  * “Why do you want to move from a big company to a small company?” Look for people who want to create things for themselves rather than merely oversee the creation. Beware of people who have narrow wants, like equity. 



**When you hire a big company exec, onboard them well to increase their chances of integrating:**

  * Make them learn about everything—your company, your product, the market, your competitors. Ask them to bring questions on a daily basis that you can answer. If they have no questions, consider firing them.
  * Make connections for them. Prepare a list of people they should contact in their first week or month, and ask for a report on what they learned in each meeting.
  * Make them create. Give them monthly, even daily objectives to ensure they’re not waiting for things to happen.



#### Hiring from a Friend’s Company

You likely have friends who run other companies that employ very talented people. You likely both have an unsaid agreement that you shouldn’t _actively_ poach each other’s employees.

But in practice, the more realistic situation is that your friend’s employee seeks you out without your company’s solicitation. This person interviews well and is a real standout, and you want to make an offer. What do you do?

It’s a trickier situation than on the surface. Realize that employees mainly leave when something is not going well; your friend’s company may be on life support, and your hiring a star employee may take away a key resource your friend needs at her weakest moment. Even worse, other employees at your friend’s company might see the defection and get the same idea, causing a vicious cycle.

Some people justify this with, “If her company is leaking employees, wouldn’t she rather the employees go to a friend?” This doesn’t compute as well as you think. Consider this analogy—if your spouse were leaving you, would you want him or her dating your close friend?

**Here’s how Horowitz advises you deal with the situation:**

  * If you would feel betrayed if a particular company hired any of your employees, you should not hire any of theirs. Make a list of such companies (it should be a small one) and require that before any team hires a person from this list, you need to give approval first.
  * If a prospective hire from this list of companies reaches the final round, tell him that you’ll be calling your friend his current employer before making this hire. If he doesn’t want this to happen, you can stop the hiring process and keep it confidential.
  * Talk to your friend before making an offer and get her OK.



### Training

**Training is one of the most valuable activities a company can do.** It is wonderfully high-leverage—each person spends 2,000 hours per year working for your company. Say you spend ten hours to train a group of ten people, who collectively work 20,000 hours per year; if you improve their performance by 1%, you have converted 10 hours of your time into 200 hours of extra team productivity.

Many companies think that since they hire such smart people, training isn’t necessary, that they’ll figure it out themselves. This is woefully misguided and a wasted opportunity. Companies also think that they don’t have time for training, but this is also short-sighted. Training is the very thing that makes people productive, so it is the _first_ thing to prioritize.

There are two types of training in a company: functional training, which provides the knowledge and skills to do the job, and management training, which trains managers to manage their teams.

#### Functional Training

In general, functional training should do the following:

  * Make clear the expectations of the job and how the worker will be evaluated.
  * Introduce the worker to the materials and systems she’ll be working with. (For example, a software engineer will need an introduction to the product, code base, and coding practices.)
  * Draw from the best functional experts on the team. Make training an honorable and respected job in the company, rather than grunt work.



Beyond these generalities, functional training should be customized to the job that needs to be done.

  * While leading a product management team at Netscape, Horowitz discovered that everyone had a different understanding of what the product manager role was. He wrote a document called “Good Product Manager/Bad Product Manager” that made expectations clear. For example, good product managers figure out what customers want; bad product managers focus on matching competitive features and focus on how to implement them.



Functional training should be a mandatory component of all teams in the company. You can enforce this by denying their requests for more people until you validate their training program. Likewise, for new employees, training should also be mandatory before they can start doing work.

#### Management Training

Management training prepares managers to lead their teams. It should do the following:

  * Make clear what tasks managers should be doing, such as one-on-one meetings, performance feedback, training, and goal setting. You should be the person teaching this course and setting these expectations.
  * Train managers on how to accomplish these tasks (for example, how to run a one-on-one meeting).
  * Enlist the best managers to teach the courses.



#### Onboarding Senior People

Senior executives bring a wealth of knowledge and experience with them, but they can also bring problems. Here are common issues and how to deal with them:

  * **Culture clash:** Execs are used to working and communicating a certain way, shaped by cultures as previous companies. You shouldn’t compromise your company’s culture for this person. Enforce your values and workflow.
  * **Politics:** Execs, especially those who come from big companies, may be used to playing politics. Watch out for these actions and don’t tolerate them.
  * **Lack of accountability:** If you can’t do the exec’s job, then you don’t know what good performance looks like, and you’re likely to be impressed with even mediocre work. Set a high bar for incoming execs—talk to domain experts and figure out what world-class performance looks like, then set the bar at this level.
  * **Insufficient performance:** An executive might have really impressed in the interview process but turns out to be suboptimal in performance. As CEO, you don’t have the time to personally do employee development for your executive team. Executives need to be performing at 99% right away; any executive you need to spend time developing is limiting your leverage and distracts from running the overall company. (This applies only to you and your executives; the rest of the company should still develop team members and refine raw talent.)
