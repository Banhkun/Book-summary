## Exercise: Confront the Struggle

Think about the last time you were in the Struggle to deal with future times.

* * *

What was the last time you felt like you were in the Struggle? What was happening? What did it feel like?

At the time, did you feel your struggles were unusual? Did you think that most other people in your position were succeeding? If so, what made you think this way?

Who could you have talked to to get better perspective on your struggle? Could you have talked to anyone else who was in that situation? How about sharing the problems with your team?
