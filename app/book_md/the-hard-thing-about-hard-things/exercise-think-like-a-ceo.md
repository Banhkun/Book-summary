## Exercise: Think Like a CEO

Review your tendencies and responsibilities as a CEO.

* * *

A CEO has a few major responsibilities: articulate the vision, make high-quality decisions rapidly, hire a team, get the team to work on the vision, and achieve results. Which do you feel you are weakest at?

What should you do in the next month to improve on this weakness?

Do you consider yourself more of a One or a Two? Why?

Look at the people who report to you. Which people are Ones, and which people are Twos? Does this distribution of people concern you?
