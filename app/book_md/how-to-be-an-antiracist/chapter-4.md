## Chapter 4: Cultural and Behavioral Racism

In addition to bodily racism and colorism, cultural and behavioral racism are types of common and sometimes subtle beliefs that contribute to racism today. Cultural and behavioral racism are related to how people act, both as a community and as individuals.

### Cultural Racism

**Cultural racism** is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities, the main idea being the **belief that there is a standard culture that is superior and the cultures of other racialized groups are inferior.**

Example #1: Enslaved Africans created the language of Creole in Haiti. Racist powers deem these languages mere “dialects” of the “standard” English that White people speak, and they attach negative connotations to these languages such as “broken” or “nonstandard.”

Example #2: Columnist Jason Riley condemned Black youth culture in New York because it “celebrated thuggery.” He thought that the baggy pants and loose shirts people wore glorified jail fashion. This belief suggests that certain ways of dressing are inherently superior to others.

**In reality, there is no hierarchy of cultures.** Cultures are different from each other, but none of them are superior or inferior.

#### History and Invention of Cultural Racism

Cultural racism started back in the Age of Enlightenment when Europeans decided their culture was the normal standard and everyone else’s was inferior or pathological.

**Enslaved Africans created new cultures in most European countries, influenced by what surrounded them and informed by their existing cultures.** African American culture was created by Ibram’s ancestors. They created the language of Ebonics by mixing ancestral languages with English, and they created African Christianity, which includes call-and-response, lively funerals, and Holy Ghost worship.

Culturally racist scholars see this culture creation as assimilation. They expect that if African Americans still had culture, they would use the same languages and traditions that the people in Africa do. However, outward displays of culture such as fashion or food are only one facet of culture. Culture is also based in internal values and philosophies.

##### The 1990s

Culture is always evolving, and **in the 1990s, Ebonics, hip-hop, and dressing “fresh” (stylishly) were part of Black New York culture.** This culture wasn’t always popular with parents and grandparents, who particularly disliked hip-hop because they thought its lyrics about thugs and sex, among other things, reinforced stereotypes and was a bad influence. Critics also thought that hip-hop reinforced stereotypes and that its content turned people into delinquents. If only the Black culture could become more “civilized,” one critic argued, racial inequities would cease to exist. But, as we know, cultures don’t produce inequities (policies do), and distinguishing between “civilized” and “uncivilized” cultures is a culturally racist activity—it implies that one culture is superior to another.

(Mainstream culture, however, appreciated Black culture enough to appropriate elements of it such as fashion, music, and language.)

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Cultural Racism

Ibram loved African American culture, which he first experienced in church. Strangers called each other brother and sister, the congregation called back at preachers, choir members swayed to the music, and funerals were full of life.

##### The Ave

Ibram also experienced culture whenever he visited the Ave, the intersection of Jamaican Avenue and 164th Street. Ibram’s generation didn’t care if adults or White people didn’t like their clothes or language. They wore baggy jeans, bubble coats, Nike Air Force 1s, or dangling chains. It wasn’t just about what you wore, either, it was how you wore it—experimentation was part of the culture. Shoes were especially important. Ibram and his friends would take measures to make sure the fronts of the shoes didn’t crease, such as stuffing them at night or wearing them with a sock rolled up over their toes to pad out the front. It wasn’t comfortable, but it was fresh.

The Ave was also full of hip-hop. Cars and stores would play music, people walking by practiced out loud, and people rapped on corners. Ibram considered hip-hop to be oral poetry, short stories, and adventure fantasy.

##### Southern Culture

In 1997, Ibram and his family moved to a predominantly White neighborhood in Manassas, Virginia. The first night Ibram was there, he was worried the KKK would show up because he’d heard plenty about Black people being abused in the South.

**When Ibram was fifteen, he believed in multiculturalism. He knew his own culture was legitimate. However, that didn’t stop him from looking down on the cultures of Southerners.** He thought their music was terrible, they couldn’t dress, and their basketball players were “scrubs.” He was arrogant, and this kept potential friends at a distance. Furthermore, he thinks his cultural elitism probably cost him a spot on the junior-varsity basketball team.

Ibram didn’t have the whole picture. He knew that generally looking down on a culture was wrong—he would never say Black people were culturally inferior. He would, however, judge specific Black cultures, and it took him two years to begin to respect the culture of North Virginia and make friends.

### Behavioral Racism

**Behavioral racism** is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities, the main idea being the **belief that individuals represent their entire race, and racial groups represent the behavior of individuals.**

Example #1: President Clinton claimed that no social program was going to be able to help Black people deal with absent fathers, welfare dependency, or pregnancy out of wedlock unless Black people first took some personal responsibility for getting themselves into these situations. Clinton’s ideas were racist because they suggested that the difficulties Black people faced were caused purely by their behavior, not by policy.

Example #2: In the 90s, Black parents held their children to a very high standard because both Black and White people held the idea that if an individual Black teenager did something wrong, it made the Black race as a whole look bad.

**The truth is, racial-group behavior doesn’t exist.** There’s no scientific evidence to link behavior and race—all theories are anecdotal and based on stories of individuals’ behavior. The actions of individuals can lead them to individual success, but group success depends on policy, not on any level of personal responsibility.

Additionally, **culture and behavior are separate.** Culture is a group tradition. Certain racial groups might share culture, but not every group within a race, or every individual member, participates in that culture.

#### History and Invention of Behavioral Racism

**Behavioral racism came into being in 1869 when Francis Galton (Darwin’s eugenicist cousin) tried to find a way to prove that Black people weren’t as smart as White people.** He couldn’t come up with a way to prove this, but two of his successors did—they invented an IQ test. Lewis Terman, a Stanford psychologist, tested Americans and found that IQ varied by race.

Eugenicist Carl C. Brigham, a psychologist at Princeton, took these results to mean that an intellectual racial hierarchy existed. **He later created that SAT, believing it would show that White people were by nature more intelligent than people of other races.**

##### “Achievement Gap”

By the 1960s, the idea that an intellectual hierarchy existed was dying out, but there was still a gap between White and Black students’ results on standardized testing. This gap was named the “achievement gap” and initiatives such as Race to the Top, Common Core, and No Child Left Behind were implemented to try to close the gap. However, these initiatives only amplified the importance of standardized testing.

**Standardized testing is a massively effective racist policy. It seems like a legitimate measure of intelligence, because it’s “standard” and relies on hard numbers, but it disfavors certain races.** Test-taking is an art, and most tutors and test-prep courses are in White and Asian communities, so many Black students don’t have access to them. Even if you’re very intelligent, doing well on standardized tests requires learning how they work. The “achievement gap” is a gap in opportunity, not intelligence.

##### The Cause of “Black Behavior”

Behavioral racists link all sorts of behaviors to race, not just studiousness. Behavioral racists over time have attributed “Black behavior” to three sources:

  * **Freedom.** In the years leading up to the Civil War, slavery advocates argued that without White oversight, Black people relapsed to their natural animal-like tendencies.
  * **Slavery.** Abolitionists argued that slavery had a negative effect on Black people and, among other things, affected their morals. As a result of enduring the debasement of slavery, they had become less human and didn’t know how to behave appropriately.
  * **Discrimination and segregation.** Later theorists argued that discrimination and segregation created harsh living conditions, which in turn created bad behavior ranging from low self-esteem to hostility.



In reality, “Black behavior” doesn’t exist, and even well-meaning attempts to explain “Black behavior” are damaging.

##### “Oppression-Inferiority Thesis”

The “oppression-inferiority thesis” is related to the last two possible “causes” for bad Black behavior. **This thesis states that oppression has negatively influenced the behavior of the oppressed.**

A recent example is the idea of post-traumatic slave syndrome, PTSS, which is allegedly the reason for poor parenting, defeatism, and Black “infighting,” just to name a few behaviors. Author Joy DeGruy wrote that many African Americans have PTSS, which was based on anecdotal evidence, not real science. In fact, real science shows that enduring trauma doesn’t always result in post-traumatic stress. For example, only 13.5-30% of soldiers returning from Afghanistan and Iraq have PTSD.

It was helpful for DeGruy to make the public aware of the trauma, but, again, **it’s important to keep in mind the differences between individuals and groups**. Some Black people have suffered trauma, but it’s inaccurate—and racist—to suggest that _all_ Black people are traumatized.

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Behavioral Racism

##### Academic Achievement

Ibram’s grades were low throughout much of high school, and because it was the nineties and he was a Black teenager, people put a lot of pressure on him.**They told him that his bad behavior reflected badly on the entire Black race.** His grandparents’ and parents’ generations were fond of using Martin Luther King Jr. to shame individuals by saying that they were throwing away everything he’d fought for.

**Part of the reason Ibram was checked out in the first place was racism—he’d gone to overcrowded schools**(often the result of racist school-zoning policies)**and regularly experienced racist abuse.** However, he, like every Black person, was expected to overcome all this, and if he couldn’t, it was _his_ fault.

##### Speech Contest

When Ibram was in his senior year of high school, a classmate, Angela, told him about the Martin Luther King speech contest. She convinced him to participate and he wrote a speech about “Black behavior.” Reflecting on the speech today, **Ibram thinks King would have hated it. It was a version of the shaming speeches directed at him from the civil-rights generation—it was about all the things that were wrong with Black youth,** such as their lack of interest in education, lack of ambition for anything besides music or sports, and unwillingness to do anything about people’s perception of them as frightening.

It may have been racist, but when Ibram showed Angela his speech, she loved it. So did the judges—Ibram won his high school competition and went on to compete at the county level. Winning made him feel better about himself and his academics. Ironically, he only escaped the behavioral racism of others by engaging in behavioral racism himself, against other Black people.

##### College

Ibram got into two colleges and decided to attend Florida A&M University (FAMU). He told people he chose it because it “felt right,” which is often what people say when they don’t want to look into their motives too closely. **Reflecting on the decision, Ibram realized he didn’t only want to be around other Black academic superstars; he wanted to get _away_ from those he viewed as badly behaving Black people.**
