## Chapter 5: Intersectional Racism

In previous chapters, we considered different types of racism. Now, it’s time to look at the intersections between race and other identities such as class, gender, and sexuality. Race is inextricably linked to these other identities, and bigotry towards any identity can have a multiplying effect on racism.

Because intersectional racism is made up of a combination of racist ideas and classist, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic ideas, **to be truly antiracist, we must also be anticapitalist, feminist, non-homophobic, and non-transphobic.** For example, to believe that Black Lives Matter, we must believe that the lives of _all_ Black people—be they poor, female, or queer—matter.

### Class Racism

Race-classes are combinations of race and economic class, for example, Black poor or “White trash.”

**Class racism** is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities between race-classes. Class racists **link race and economic class, support capitalistic policies that have a disproportionately negative economic impact on members of certain races, and use racist ideas to justify those policies.**

Although some people blame groups like the Black poor for their poverty, in reality, **economic disparities are the result of policies, not a result of the actions of individual members of races.**

Example #1: In 2017 in the US, the White poverty rate was a third of the Black poverty rate, indicating that Black poor people are affected by two sets of ideas and policies—those that disfavor them for being Black and those that disfavor them for being poor—while White poor people are affected only by the policies and ideas that disfavor the poor.

Example #2: Capitalist growth in Africa has benefited many foreign investors, but very few Africans. The majority of Africans in Sub-Saharan Africa, most of whom are Black, live in poverty, and as the continent’s wealth increases, its poverty rate also increases. In fact, by 2030, 9 out of 10 “extremely poor people” will live in Sub-Saharan Africa. This is clearly a systemic problem, not a problem with the behavior of individual Africans.

**When tackling any type of intersectional racism, it’s important to target both elements, or else inequity will remain.** For example, antiracist policies might eliminate economic differences between Latinx and Asian poor people, or middle-income Black and White people, but there would still be class differences. In the past decades, antiracist policies have made strides toward narrowing racial inequities, but economic ineqities have widened.

#### History and Invention of Class Racism

**Capitalism is inherently racist because racism and capitalism developed hand in hand.** Both came into being at the same time, during the slave trade. Enslaved people were sold for money, and then slaveholders used their labor to make money, power industrial revolutions, and finance empires.

##### What Is Capitalism?

Historically, and even according to defenders of capitalism who call everything from ending poverty to protecting the environment “anticapitalist,” **capitalism is the exploitation of people and the environment, and the freedom to prioritize self-interest over anything else.**

Some people, such as Elizabeth Warren, a US senator, define capitalism differently. Warren defines capitalism as a market that has rules, and the rules are critical to her definition. Some people call her anticapitalist because they don’t like her rules. Ibram agrees that the system she describes might help reduce inequity, but he doesn’t think the system should be called capitalism because it doesn’t match the more accurate definition of capitalism above.

##### Antiracist Anticapitalists

Communists or socialists, while they’re not capitalist, aren’t necessarily antiracist. For example, in 1901 the Socialist Party of America wouldn’t take an anti-lynching position because it didn’t want to lose racist White supporters.

In the 1920s, Writer W.E.B. Du Bois started reading Marx, saw that the Great Depression had a larger effect on Black than White poor people, saw that the New Deal wasn’t helping the inequity, and wrote about antiracist anticapitalism, inspiring others to start looking into the divides between class and race.

The antiracist anticapitalists went into hiding or prison in the 1950s, when fear of communism was at its strongest, but they came out in the 1960s and have reappeared today, for example, in the Occupy and Black Lives Matter movements.

##### Culture vs. Cycle of Poverty

Over the years, many people have tried to explain why people are poor. The real reason is policy—**policy creates an environment in which no matter how well poor people behave, it’s difficult for them to escape poverty.**

However, plenty of people came up with other incorrect racist and classist explanations. In the 1960s, Oscar Lewis, an anthropologist, thought that poverty was related to culture—children raised by poor parents copied their behaviors, which resulted in the children also being poor. Other people thought poverty was related to welfare—welfare annihilated dignity and turned people into “animal creature[s],” according to Barry Goldwater, a US senator.

Black sociologist Kenneth Clark addressed the culture of poverty in 1965 in his book _Dark Ghetto_ using the oppression-inferiority thesis. In earlier times, people thought slavery or segregation were responsible for bad Black behavior and inferiority. Clark wrote that now poverty and “ghetto” life were responsible. Kenneth Clark was aware of racist policies in existence at the time, but he subscribed to class racism. He thought that because _he_ had escaped the ghetto and become wealthy, Black people who hadn’t were inferior, and their inferior culture kept them in poverty.

As opposed to the culture of poverty, t**he cycle of poverty accurately roots poverty in policy** —it’s policy, not culture, that causes exploitation, lack of opportunity, and low income.

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Class Racism

When Ibram moved to North Philadelphia to attend Temple University for graduate school, he chose to live in Hunting Park, which was allegedly one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in Philadelphia. It was part of the “ghetto.”

Ibram wanted to live there because he had the idea that poor Black people were the most authentic Black people. In his mind, poverty, criminality, sex, and gambling in an urban setting were the defining features of the most authentic Black community. At the time, he thought culture started at the bottom and filtered up, and he wanted to be more authentic himself. He now realizes that in identifying the culture of one race-class as superior to another, he was being racist.

### Gender Racism

Race-genders are combinations of race and gender. For example, Black women and White men are two race-genders.

**Gender racism** is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities between race-genders. Gender racists **link race and gender and arrange these race-genders into a hierarchy.**

Example #1: Black men are 50 times more likely than White women to go to prison. This statistic is a result of two sets of policies and ideas: 1) those related to race (the stereotype that Black people are more dangerous than White people) and 2) those related to gender (the stereotype that men are more dangerous than women).

Example #2: The average wealth of a single Black woman is $100, while for a White woman, it’s $42,000. Even though all women are affected by sexist ideas and policies, Black women are additionally affected by racist ideas and policies.

**Gender inequalities are the result of policies, not the actions of individual members of races.**

#### History and Invention of Gender Racism

In 1991, Philomena Essed, a scholar, came up with the term gendered racism. She noticed Black women had to deal with both sexism and racism and that it was impossible to consider them in isolation. Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, a critical race theorist, expanded on this idea and came up with the term “intersectionality.” She wrote that **while sexism and racism are linked in real life, they’re rarely addressed in policy.**

Though gender racism wasn’t named until 1991, it had been affecting people for far longer. For example, in 1965, a government report stated that nearly 25% of Black families were matriarchal (and therefore “broken,” in the words of the media). The author of the report said these matriarchies resulted in a host of negative consequences, including the emasculation of Black men. Following the author’s lead, others suggested Black women should mend their broken families and help empower Black men by being submissive toward their husbands, returning them to their rightful place at the head of the family. The government report also promoted the idea that Black men had been more affected by racism than Black women.

In the 1970s, Black feminist groups formed. **Black women had to create their own spaces because in Black spaces, they had to contend with sexism, and in feminist spaces, they had to contend with racism.** The most antiracist queer space of the time was the Combahee River Collective, which formed in 1974. The organization’s goal was for Black women to be seen as equals to any other group.

##### Black Single Mothers

Gender racism particularly affected Black mothers. In the 1970s and 1980s, the public became worried about the growing percentage of Black single mothers. Some said that having a father around, even if he’s abusive, is better for children than being fatherless. Others suggested that a child can’t thrive without the income of two parents. Assumptions such as these didn’t take into account the various reasons single mothers are single—the fathers are dead, in prison, or dangerous.

In 1994, Charles Murray, a political scientist, got the word out that 68% of Black children were born into single-parent households. Murray attributed this to the “welfare system,” and liberals such as Ibram’s parents attributed it to sexual irresponsibility, poverty, disengagement from Christianity’s pre-marriage abstinence, or disregard of opportunities. None of this was accurate—the higher percentage was due to married Black women having fewer children, not single Black women having more.

##### Negativity for Everyone

Gender racism results in negative consequences for everyone, not only certain race-genders such as Black women. For example, here are the effects on White women:

  * **The “ideal woman” standard.** The sexist idea that the ideal woman is weak and the racist idea that the ideal woman is White combine to create the idea that the extra-ideal woman is White and weak.
    * For example, this idea resulted in hatred of Hilary Clinton, who is a strong White woman.
  * **Controlled sexuality.** If hypersexual Black women are the ultimate evil, then to be good, White women have to be the opposite—virtuous. Striving to be virtuous represses their sexuality. Additionally, when it was illegal for Black men to be with White women, this controlled women’s sexuality as well as Black men’s.
  * **Defense of male abusers.** Gender racism is the root of the reason people defend sexual assaulters such as Trump or Bill Cosby—they think they’re defending White or Black people, respectively.



Gender racism also affects men of color:

  * **Feelings of inferiority.** The racist idea that Black men aren’t real men and the sexist idea that “real men” are strong combine to create the idea that Black men are weak.
  * **Negative perceptions.** Racist ideas of Black people being more dangerous, combined with sexist ideas of men being more dangerous, combine to form the idea that Black men are extra dangerous.



#### Ibram’s Experiences With Gender Racism

##### Childhood Ideas About Gender

Ibram’s initial ideas on gender were shaped by his parents. They didn’t raise him to be sexist, but they didn’t train him to be a feminist either. Ibram’s parents didn’t always adhere to traditional gender roles—for example, when Ibram’s parents got married, the pastor recited the traditional wedding vows that included husbands loving their wives and wives obeying their husbands. But Ibram’s mother refused to agree to obey him, which shocked both the pastor and his father. His father asked if she would be all right with changing the vow to “submit one to another.”

However, sometimes his parents demonstrated sexist ideas. His mother called his father the head of the family, and he would lead while she submitted.

##### Meeting Kaila and Yaba

**Ibram started to reevaluate his ideas about gender at Temple University when he met Kaila,** a strong lesbian woman who was ahead of him in the doctoral program. Together with Yaba, another strong woman, Kaila led the program’s discourse. Whenever a homophobic, patriarchal, or racist idea came up, the two women went after it.

Ibram was terrified of them and tried to avoid them because he was worried he’d bring up an offensive idea and be called on it, but he also admired their confidence and intelligence. He read the books they brought up and tried to learn more about gender racism because he wanted to change his ideas.

**Kaila and Yaba broke all the stereotypes of homophobia and the patriarchy—they weren’t sex-crazed, they weren’t abnormal, and they didn’t hate men or want female supremacy.** They showed Ibram that it was power and policies, not specific groups of people, that were the problem.

### Queer Racism

Race-sexualities are combinations of race and sexualities, for example, Black gay men and White lesbian women.

**Queer racism is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities between race-sexualities.** Queer racists **link race and sexuality and arrange these race-sexualities into a hierarchy.**

Example #1: In the US, on average, transgender women of color have a life expectancy of 35 years because they face so much transphobia and racial violence.

Example #2: 7% of children raised by White heterosexuals live in poverty, while 14% raised by White male same-sex couples live in poverty, and 32% raised by Black male same-sex couples live in poverty. This statistic is a result of two sets of policies and ideas: 1) those related to race (policies favor White people over people of color), and 2) those related to sexuality (policies favor straight people over queer people).

**Queer inequalities are the result of policies, not the actions of individual members of races.**

#### History and Invention of Queer Racism

**Racism and homophobia have been related throughout history.** In 1897, Havelock Ellis, a British physician, popularized the word “homosexual” in his first book about sex and wrote that sex was related to race. He was a biological racist and thought that there were biological differences between heterosexual and homosexual people as well. He didn’t condemn homosexuality—he thought it was a “congenital physiological abnormality,” not a crime—but he did, however, believe that all people of color are born criminals.

At the time, racist doctors were comparing the clitoris of White and Black women. White women supposedly had “bound together” clitorises, which meant they were more civilized. The “free” clitoris found in Black women meant they were wild and animal-like. These doctors suggested that the “free,” or abnormally prominent, clitoris was related to homosexuality.

The combination of the queer racist ideas that Black people are more hypersexual and queer people are more hypersexual suggested that Black queers were the most hypersexual race-sexuality, and you could identify these people by their prominent clitoris.

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Queer Racism

##### Childhood Ideas About Sexuality

Like Ibram’s ideas on gender, his ideas on sexuality were shaped by his upbringing. His parents didn’t raise him to be homophobic or sexist, but they rarely talked about queer people.

##### Weckea

Ibram had two close friends at Temple University, Weckea and Raena. One day, Raena told Ibram that Weckea was gay. Ibram wasn’t comfortable with homosexuality and thought Raena might be trying to break up his friendship with Weckea.

**Up until this point, Ibram held some stereotypical beliefs about Black gay men, such as that they were reckless, sex-crazed, and performed feminity.** (Performing femininity or masculinity refers to authentically expressing gender, as opposed to acting.) Weckea didn’t fit into Ibram’s stereotypes at all—he was private and performed masculinity.

Ibram was faced with a choice—maintain his homophobia or maintain his friendship with Weckea. Ibram chose Weckea and began dismantling his homophobia. He let his stereotypical beliefs go and learned from Weckea how to recognize homophobia in others.

Also, as Ibram had done with race as a child, he acknowledged his gender and sexuality. He identified as a cisgendered (his gender identity is the same as his birth sex) heterosexual Black male, and being cis, male, and hetero came with privilege he could use to support people of other sexualities.
