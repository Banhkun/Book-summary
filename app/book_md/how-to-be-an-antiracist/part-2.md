## Part 2: Types of Racism | Chapter 2: Biological and Ethnic Racism

There are several different types of racism, some of which intersect with other identities. Chapter 2 covers biological and ethnic racism, and subsequent chapters cover other types.

### Biological Racism

**Biological racism** is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities, the main idea being the **belief that 1) there are biological or genetic differences between races, and 2) these differences make one race superior to another.**

Example #1: A 1991 survey revealed that 50% of respondents thought that Black people had “more natural physical ability.”

Example #2: A generally held belief is that Black people are naturally good at improvisational decision making, which makes them good at basketball, rap, and jazz, and bad at astronomy, chess, and music.

**There are no biological or genetic differences between races.** Racial ancestry doesn’t exist. However, ethnic ancestry _does_ exist—people who are from the same regions usually have similar genes, and these groups of people are called populations. Contrary to what most people believed, geneticists discovered that the populations within Africa are more genetically different from each other than they are from other continents’ populations. For example, genetically, Western African ethnic groups are more similar to groups in Western Europe than Eastern Africa.

#### History and Invention of Biological Racism

There’s not a lot of historical or cultural support for biological racism—the Bible says that all humans descended from Adam and Eve, which suggests that all humans are the same, as does the American value of “all men are equal.”

However, biological racists wanted to find biological differences between racial groups so that they could arrange groups into a hierarchy. They came up with four theories:

**Theory #1: The Curse of Ham.** After surviving the Great Flood in his ark, Noah planted a vineyard, got drunk, and fell asleep naked in his tent. One of his sons, Ham, saw his father naked and told his brothers Shem and Japheth. His brothers avoided seeing Noah naked by walking backward into his tent and covering him. When Noah woke up, he was furious that Ham had seen him naked and cursed Ham’s son Canaan and his descendants to be the slaves of Shem. Writer George Best suggested that Canaan and his cursed descendants were the ancestors of African people. This theory lasted until the 19th century.

**Theory #2: Polygenesis**. Polygensis is the theory that each race has its own creation story and is a different species. Indigenous people aren’t mentioned in the Bible, so some White Christians wondered if they had descended from someone other than Adam—and if one group could come from “a different Adam,” then maybe Black people could have too. This idea was heresy, but some slaveholders preferred it to the Curse of Ham theory.

Polygenesis was debated through the Age of Enlightenment. People like Thomas Jefferson denounced it while people like Charles Darwin embraced it.

**Theory #3: Natural selection and eugenics.** Natural selection and eugenics acknowledge that all people come from the same ancestors, but suggest that not all people are equal. Darwin came up with a theory that the White race was naturally selected and the other races would either assimilate, be enslaved, or die out. Darwin’s half-cousin Francis Galton tried to speed up this natural selection via a transatlantic eugenics movement. He came up with policies that killed members of non-White groups and encouraged White people to reproduce with only each other.

**Theory #4: Biological adaptations as a result of the slave trade.** In 1988, Black researcher Clarence Grim suggested that African Americans have higher blood pressure because only the individuals who could tolerate high levels of salt had survived drinking ocean water during the Atlantic voyage to America. (Consuming large quantities of salt can increase blood pressure.) This was never proven and Grim didn’t come up with the idea in a lab; he thought of it while reading the fictional _Roots_.

**It took until Nazi Germany’s genocide for the academic community to move away from the idea of biological racism.** It took longer for this idea to permeate the general population.

In 2000, Bill Clinton announced that geneticists had finished surveying the entire human genome and discovered that humans share 99.9% of their genes. In spite of this proof, people still tried to find ways to justify biological differences between races. For example, segregationist Writer Nicholas Wade believes that the 0.1% difference in genes is race-related and that there’s a genetic component to behavior.

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Biological Racism

**Growing up in the 90s, Ibram saw biological similarities, such as hair texture and nose shape, between himself and the other Black kids in his class.** He also saw physical differences between himself and the White kids, and adults taught him that these differences weren’t simply superficial; they were related to the type of human he was.

In third grade, Ibram’s class was mostly Black. There were a few Latinx and Asian students and three White students, and the teacher subtly gave the White students preferential treatment. She wouldn’t punish them when they committed the same offenses other students had been punished for, and she would call on the White students even when others had their hands up.

One day, a quiet Black girl in the author’s class raised her hand. This was unusual—she was normally shy and rarely participated in class. The teacher noticed she had her hand up but ignored her. When a White hand went up, she called on that person instead. The Black girl was clearly upset that she’d been ignored, and Ibram was furious.

His class went to chapel service and after, Ibram refused to leave. His teacher ordered him to leave—she didn’t ask him what was wrong or why he was refusing to leave—and when that didn’t work, she called the principal. Racist teachers give misbehaving kids of color orders and punishments rather than empathy. The principal tried to order Ibram to move and again he refused to. Eventually, she sat down next to him and let him speak. He explained what had happened with his classmate and the principal said she would talk to the teacher. The teacher did improve, but Ibram switched schools the next year.

**Ibram never believed that biological differences made any group superior**(a biologically racist idea),**but he _did_ believe biological differences existed **(also a biologically racist idea).**** In this way, he held both racist and antiracist views at the same time.

### Ethnic Racism

**Ethnic racism** is a combination of racist policies and ideas that causes and maintains racial inequities between racialized ethnic groups, the main idea being the **belief that there’s a hierarchy within races—certain ethnic groups within a race are superior or inferior to others within the same race.**

Example #1: European colonizers decided that there were “Five Civilized Tribes” of Indigenous people. The Seminole, Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee were civilized, and all the other Indigenous ethnic groups were wild.

Example #2: The ethnicities African American and Indian are both racialized as Black. A 1999 study found that West Indian immigrants thought African Americans were lazy and lacking family values, and the African Americans thought West Indian immigrants were selfish and arrogant.

The truth is, **there is no hierarchy of ethnicities.** Ethnic groups are different from each other, but none of them are superior or inferior.

#### History and Invention of Ethnic Racism

**Ethnic racism comes from the slave trade—certain enslavers had favorite ethnic groups and thought these groups made better slaves than others.** Most American planters thought Ghanaians made the best slaves and Angolans the worst. The reasoning was invented—one Frechman attributed the strong work ethic of captives from Ghana to the fact that that part of Africa is barren, so people who live there have to work hard to cultivate the land to survive. Allegedly, because Angola had fertile land, it was easy to find food without working hard for it, so Angolans were naturally lazier. However, Angolans were the most traded ethnic group and the first to arrive in the US.

Some ethnic racism may also stem from the idea that continental Africans allegedly enslaved “their own people.” However, **Africans who enslaved other Africans didn’t see everyone in Africa as belonging to the same group** —as we learned, the Portuguese made up the concept of race, and it wasn’t globally accepted until around the 20th century. Africans who were involved in the slave trade weren’t selling members of their own ethnic group, they were selling other Africans, who were just as different to them as White people.

##### But Immigrants Do Better Than African Americans

Because inequities _between_ races tend to be very obvious and inequities _within_ races less so, racist policies that create inequalities within groups are less contested even though they can be just as bad as the inequalities between races.

For example, when studies began to reveal that Black immigrants, on average, have a higher family income than African Americans, people wondered why, and then made up their own justifications. For example, a 1996 _Economist_ commentator wrote that Black immigrants are more hardworking and entrepreneurial than African Americans. Therefore, according to the commentator, racism couldn’t have a hand in the difficulties of African Americans because Black immigrants were Black too, and they were doing fine. African Americans were struggling because they were lazier and less motivated.

However, when Black immigrants are compared to immigrants from other racialized groups, the racism that people like the _Economist_ commentator challenged rears its head again. Black immigrants are the most educated group of immigrants to the US, but they earn less than non-Black immigrants and have the highest rate of unemployment.

**Black immigrants being more successful than African Americans doesn’t have anything to do with their ethnicity, it has to do with the fact that they’re immigrants.** People who choose to immigrate are usually people who are ambitious and resilient or have a lot of resources. Ambition, resilience, and resources make it easier to succeed.

##### Immigration Laws and Racism

Even though some people inaccurately believe that Black immigrants are superior to African Americans, there were periods of US history where racist power didn’t want _any_ people of color entering the country.

Policies included the Chinese Restriction Act (1882), Emergency Quota Act (1921), and President Coolidge’s Immigration Act (1924) that restricted the immigration of non-White people. Coolidge and his supporters thought that only White immigrants could keep America “American.”

In the 1990s, the Immigration and Nationality Act (1965), the Refugee Act (1980), and the Immigration Act (1900) were supposed to make up for the Coolidge-era policies by encouraging immigration to the US from non-European countries. The new policies did increase immigration, and by 2000, the Latinx immigrant population was 14.1 million (compared to 4.2 million in 1980) and in 2015, Black immigrants made up 8.7% (three times as high as the 1980 number) of the country’s Black population.

Now, 100 years later, Jeff Sessions and other American politicians are trying to go back to the Coolidge era. Sessions said that the current immigration numbers are as high as those of 1924 and that, as in 1924, the US should limit immigration again.

#### Ibram’s Experiences With Ethnic Racism

Ibram has had plenty of experience with ethnic racism over the years. When he was younger, he held ethnically racist ideas that he later realized were a problem.

##### Eighth Grade Class

In Ibram’s eighth grade class, everyone was made fun of for something. Because of his large head, Ibram was nicknamed Bonk, after a cartoon character with a ridiculously large head who headbutted his enemies.

**Another student, Kwame, was Ghanaian, and the class made fun of him for being an immigrant.** They likened him to Akeem, a prince from a fictional African country who comes to Queens to find a wife in the movie _Coming to America_. Throughout the movie, characters make fun of Akeem by suggesting that Africa is uncivilized and things like wearing clothes must be a new experience for him.

##### In the Neighborhood

Ibram also experienced tensions between ethnic groups in his neighborhood. Ibram’s neighbors were a Haitian immigrant couple with sons Ibram became friends with. While the parents were polite, they kept Ibram at a distance. He thought it might have had something to do with the fact that at the time, **African Americans were exhibiting bigotry towards Haitian immigrants.**

##### Where Are You From?

**People often assume Ibram is an immigrant because ethnic racists assume that as a successful writer and professor, he can’t be African American.** When he answers that he’s from Queens, his father is from New York, his mother is from Georgia, and that he’s a descendant of enslaved Africans, the questioners give up. They either think he’s an exception, or they lecture him about how lazy his ethnic group generally is.
