## 1-Page Summary

Do you feel like you’re stuck in the wrong life wasting your time on things that don’t satisfy you…but don’t know how to make positive changes, move forward, and feel happier?

Many authors have tackled this subject. While they all take different approaches, they seem to agree on one thing: **Knowing your values and living in alignment with them is key to feeling satisfied and happy with your life.**

In Shortform’s Master Guide, we’ll examine and compare what experts have to say about living your best life, compiling advice from a range of authors, including a poet, a former Vedic monk, a holistic psychologist, life design professors, happiness experts, _and_ self-help authors.

We’ll first explain what values are and their role in how satisfied—or unsatisfied—you feel with your life. Then, we’ll explore how you can clarify your values—and, crucially, how to start living in alignment with them and get your life moving in a happier, more meaningful direction.

### Part 1: Why Aren’t You Living Your Best Life?

First, let’s explore why you might struggle to feel satisfied with your life. According to multiple authors, many people feel unsatisfied with the direction their lives are moving in because they’re not clear about their values.

According to former Vedic monk Jay Shetty (_Think Like a Monk_), your values are the core beliefs that you choose to live by—they determine who you want to be and how you treat yourself and others. They shape how you think, color your perceptions, motivate your behavior, and guide your decisions. In sum, **your values determine who you are and what you need to feel happy**.

#### How Values Impact Happiness

Shetty claims that values allow you to understand the meaning underlying everything you do—**the degree to which you live in alignment with your values determines how meaningful your life experiences feel to you**.

In _Designing Your Life_ , Stanford professors Bill Burnett and Dave Evans put it this way: Satisfaction comes from living coherently—**it’s easy to find meaning in what you do and feel good about the direction of your life when your priorities and behaviors are aligned**. On the other hand, when your actions and goals don’t reflect what’s important to you, you’re more likely to feel internal conflict that hinders your ability to feel good about what you’re doing.

#### Why Your Current Values Aren't Making You Happy

You might feel that you _are_ living your values, but still feel unhappy with your life—why is that? In _101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think, _poet Brianna Wiest suggests that **you’re likely living according to values that aren’t actually _yours_**. According to her, you never consciously chose your beliefs and values. Rather, you subconsciously adopted the beliefs and values of your family, your friends, and your culture.

She explains that these adopted beliefs and values influence your entire worldview: how you judge the world, your place in it, and the circumstances you face. In other words, everything you’ve ever thought of as good, bad, right, wrong, beautiful, or ugly has simply been a reflection of the way other people have influenced you.

Maxwell Maltz (_Psycho-Cybernetics_) explains it like this: You’ve been “hypnotized” by others’ words throughout your life. As a young child, you were impressionable and prone to believing what others said about who you are and what beliefs you should live by. You accepted their opinions and beliefs about you as truth and this shaped your self-image and values in the early part of your life.

#### Why You Adopt Others’ Values—Even If They Make You Unhappy

Multiple authors, including Wiest, Maltz, and Shetty suggest that **the compulsion to adopt others’ values as your own comes from the need for external validation**. This need was conditioned in you early on in life when you likely found that conforming to the expectations of other people was the only way you could experience comfort and happiness:

  * If you acted according to their desires and expectations, you were rewarded—for example, with extra attention and affection. This made you feel comfortable and happy. 
  * If you acted against their desires and expectations, you were punished—for example, with rejection or social humiliation. This made you feel uncomfortable and unhappy.



According to Maltz, your self-image and values have likely evolved since your childhood. However, until you consciously address the thoughts and beliefs that influenced you, they will continue to subconsciously inform your motivations and behaviors.

**Letting the pursuit of external validation rule your life inevitably leads to unhappiness and dissatisfaction.** This is due to three reasons:

##### Reason 1: You Pursue Unfulfilling Goals

According to Neil Pasricha (_The Happiness Equation_), **chasing external validation pushes you to act in ways that don’t support what you really want. **Instead, you make decisions and set goals about how to look and behave, your career, and your possessions based on how you want others to react to you. This creates internal conflict for three reasons:

  * Different people have different perspectives and expectations. Your behaviors and goals can’t please or impress everyone, so you won’t always receive positive feedback.
  * Basing your happiness on external validation forces you to conform to what other people want instead of what _you_ want—because pleasing yourself won’t always elicit the feedback you crave. 
  * Your motivation to please or impress others forces you into constant comparison and competition. You strive to be more like people who receive the validation you want and set yourself ambitious goals to outdo them.



Wiest expands on this: Because your need for external validation is so deeply ingrained in you, you fail to question why your achievements aren’t making you happy. Instead, you assume that you just haven’t done enough to deserve happiness and that you need to be, do, or acquire something _more_ —for example, by making yourself more attractive, acquiring more possessions, or achieving a higher status.

##### Reason 2: You Feel Powerless to Change

In _How to Do the Work_ , holistic psychologist Nicole LePera argues that conforming to others’ expectations in the hope of receiving validation caused you to lose touch with who you really are and your true needs. She explains that, like most people, you’re likely not conscious of your impulse to seek external validation or the fact that your beliefs and behaviors are a reflection of your conditioning. **Instead, you assume that your beliefs and behaviors are inherent and unchangeable parts of your identity.** As a result, you live your life catering to the needs of this conditioned identity because you think that it _is_ you.

Meanwhile, your _true needs_ remain neglected, unexpressed, and unfulfilled. When your true needs go unmet, you get the sense that something important is missing from your life—which triggers negative feelings ranging from dissatisfaction to resentment.

Wiest explains why you might feel powerless to overcome these negative feelings: Because you’ve given external factors so much power over your happiness, you mistakenly assume that they are responsible _for_ your happiness. In other words, you believe that your happiness is outside of your control, and therefore feel powerless to take responsibility for how you think and feel.

##### Reason 3: You Suppress Your Emotions

According to Wiest, your conditioning inadvertently taught you to believe that some feelings are unacceptable or bad.

  * For example, if you were punished for expressing disagreement as a child, you unconsciously associated the feeling of disagreement with punishment and labeled it as “bad” or “wrong” in your mind. 



As a result, you feel ashamed each time these feelings come up, pretend that you don’t feel them, and try to avoid people and situations that might trigger them. You also judge other people who express these feelings as “bad” or “wrong.” However, these suppressed feelings continue to live on inside you, get stronger the more you try to deny them, and morph into irrational thought patterns and emotional reactions that stifle your capacity to feel satisfied with your life.

  * For example, your discomfort around feeling disagreement leads to unhealthy behaviors that fuel insecurities and resentment—such as pretending to agree with others, agreeing to do things you don’t want to do, or judging others who do express their disagreement. 



Tony Robbins (_Awaken the Giant Within_) adds another negative effect of suppressing your emotions and avoiding situations that risk triggering them: You miss out on experiencing the _positive_ emotions these situations might elicit. For example, if you’ve suppressed your need for affection, you might avoid relationships or pretend not to need affection in a relationship. As a result, you miss out on positive experiences that spring from meaningful relationships, such as love and intimacy. This makes you feel lonely and increases your unfulfilled desire for affection—and your shame for wanting it.

### Part 2: Clarify What You Want Out of Life

Now that you understand how living out of alignment with your values holds you back from living your best life, let's explore the first step toward feeling happier: Determining what your values are. To achieve this, accept yourself as you are, assess how your current beliefs and values make you feel, and explore various approaches to identify what types of experiences make you feel happy and satisfied.

#### 1) Accept Yourself

The first step toward clarifying what you want out of life is to let go of your need to seek external validation. Pasricha suggests that **you can free yourself from the need for validation by accepting who you are and what _you_ need to feel happy.** This shift in thinking encourages a cycle of happiness and satisfaction: Self-acceptance inspires you to align your behaviors and decisions with what makes you happy. This alignment encourages positive self-judgment and influences you to make decisions that further increase your happiness.

Furthermore, the more you encourage positive self-judgment, the less time you waste thinking about how others perceive you. This helps you accept yourself exactly as you are and frees you from the pressure of adapting to please or impress others.

#### 2) Assess Your Current Opinions and Beliefs

An important part of accepting yourself and clarifying what you want out of life is assessing whether your current opinions and beliefs align with who you really are or if they only exist to please or impress others. Wiest suggests that you can dissect each of your opinions and beliefs by asking yourself the following four questions:

  1. **When was the first time you came across this idea?** For example, you believe that people should not make mistakes. You remember overhearing your parents punishing one of your siblings for making errors on a spelling test. 
  2. **How does this idea influence your judgment of yourself, other people, and your experiences?** Your belief that people should not make mistakes compels you to be overly critical of yourself and others. It also makes you feel resentful of the experiences that don’t live up to your perfect standards.
  3. **How might adopting opposing ideas impact you?** If instead, you choose to believe that it’s okay to make mistakes, you might find it easier to accept and forgive yourself and others for making mistakes. You might also be less inclined to notice mistakes in the first place.
  4. **How would you choose to think about this if your thoughts were already aligned with who you really are?** Your aligned self sees mistakes as a valuable part of learning. Therefore, there’s no need to feel critical of yourself or others for making mistakes.



##### Distinguish Between Positive and Negative Values

Beyond assessing whether your values are truly yours or if they’re informed by others, think about whether your current values are “ _positive” or “negative_.”

According to Shetty, values that inspire positive thoughts, such as compassion or kindness, are **true values that elevate you to a state of happiness, fulfillment, and meaning**. On the other hand, values that inspire negative thoughts, such as fear, greed, or envy, are false values that demote you to a state of suffering, dissatisfaction, and anxiety.

Mark Manson (_The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_) considers the difference between positive and negative values a bit differently:

  * Positive values arise from an internal focus and have outcomes that you can control. For example, if you adopt kindness as a value, you can shape your thoughts and behaviors to align with this value. 
  * On the other hand, negative values arise from an external focus and have outcomes that you _can’t_ control. For example, if you adopt popularity as a value, the outcome hinges on what others think about you. While you can adapt your behavior to increase your popularity, you’ll never be able to control the outcome.



#### 3) Define Your Values

You've now determined which beliefs serve you and which don’t, and you’re closer to understanding who you really are. Now, let’s explore what's important to your _true self_ in order to define your values and clarify what you really want out of life.

##### Approach 1: Pay Attention to What Satisfies You

Burnett and Evans suggest that the key to defining your values lies in paying attention to what satisfies you. They recommend that you start a daily journal to track and reflect on how your activities make you feel. The point of this is to identify what types of experiences make you feel joyful, engaged, and energized—and those that make you feel bored and drained.

After the first week of tracking, include weekly reflections in your journal: Zoom in on the details of each activity to identify what you specifically like or dislike about them. Pay particular attention to who you were with, what you were doing, where you were, and what you were interacting with (for example, people, objects, or a machine) as your positive feelings rose and fell. Write down any themes, insights, or surprises you discover. If your current schedule doesn’t offer much in the way of variety, consider including reflections on past experiences that stand out as particularly positive or negative.

Jack Canfield (_The Success Principles_) adds to this by suggesting that you list the times in your life that you’ve felt most happy and determine whether these instances share any characteristics.

##### Approach 2: Brainstorm Your Ideal Life

Canfield suggests that brainstorming what areas of your life are important to you and what you want them to look like will help you define your values. For example, what kind of relationships do you want, and what characteristics should they include? You can consider other areas like finances, leisure, or community as well. Then, write down 30 things you want to be, 30 things you want to have, and 30 things you want to do before you die.

Meanwhile, Burnett and Evans offer a way to brainstorm values that help you achieve the perfect work-life balance. There are three parts:

  1. Write down your opinions on **work**. This includes everything you believe about work: what it’s for, why you do it, and what makes it good or bad. 
  2. Write down your opinions on **life**. This includes everything you believe about the world and how it works: what it means, what gives it value, how your life relates to others, the place of money in a meaningful life, and the value you place on fulfillment and experience. (You might draw inspiration from Canfield’s brainstorming exercise here.)
  3. Consider how to integrate your values in both areas so they’re in harmony with each other. 



##### Approach 3: Meditate With Your Ideal Self

In _The Mountain Is You_ , Wiest suggests that you can define your values by engaging in meditation with your ideal self. First, find a quiet place, sit down with a pen and paper, take deep breaths to center yourself, and release any fears or negative emotions. When you feel totally relaxed, visualize the highest version of yourself sitting across from you. Then, take note of how they look, behave, speak, and communicate through their body language; what are they wearing, how are they feeling, and what do they do every day?

Next, listen to the advice that this ideal self wants to give you, even if it’s something you might disagree with at first. This advice should be uplifting, caring, and helpful. Now, imagine the particular aspects of this person’s life that allow them to live their values—where they’re living, what job they’re doing, the relationships they have, their daily tasks, their habits, and so on. Finally, imagine them giving you the key to that life—their life, routines, behaviors, and skills are now yours. This final step will put you in an “action” mindset that encourages you to enact the tasks and behaviors necessary to become your ideal self.

In addition to considering your ideal self's qualities, Shetty recommends that you think about the qualities that you look for and admire in others to reveal the values that inspire you.

### Part 3: Commit to Living Your Values

Now that you’ve identified your values and what you want out of life, let’s explore different ways to start living in alignment with your values and make changes to your life.

#### 1) Set Life Rules

**Wiest says you mustcreate life rules that will help you live in alignment with your values**. These rules should represent personal commitments that you believe in and that will shape your life in the long term. For example, if you have a life rule to cut ties with people who regularly make you feel bad, you’ll live a life surrounded by positive people who encourage you to be your best self.

**Life rules will encourage you to continually live in alignment with your values, and help you overcome barriers** that may cause you to stray from your intended path. Living by your rules will ensure that you’re happy and always progressing toward the best version of yourself.

Making rules around _all_ your values might be overwhelming, and having too many values may restrict your ability to commit to the things that are _most_ important. Try choosing the two most important values on your list and prioritizing them, as Brené Brown recommends in _Dare to Lead_.

#### 2) Align Your Goals With Your True Self

One way to commit to living your values is to choose goals that are important to _you_ , and therefore feel more meaningful than the goals other people expect from you. Focus on the following three areas to set appropriate goals.

##### Focus Area 1: Enjoyable Activities

Pasricha suggests that one way to choose meaningful goals is to consider what activities you do purely for enjoyment. From there, increase your happiness by brainstorming additional ways to pursue these activities in different contexts or with different people. For example, if you enjoy writing, start a blog or join a writing group to create more opportunities to experience happiness.

Gretchen Rubin (_The Happiness Project_) builds on Pasricha’s advice: Once you’ve pinpointed your most enjoyable activities, set an ambitious goal that requires you to actively engage in these activities to succeed. Having goals that tie directly to what you feel passionate about will help you prioritize time spent on your interests and create more opportunities for similar uplifting experiences. For example, Rubin’s love of writing inspired her to set the ambitious goal of completing a 50,000-word novel in one month. Her work on this goal led to a number of opportunities that now allow her to pursue her love of writing as a full-time career.

##### Focus Area 2: Innate Gifts and Talents

Deepak Chopra (_The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success_) argues that you have innate gifts and talents that you’re meant to contribute to the world. You should choose goals that align with these natural tendencies because they’ll feel more meaningful and enjoyable to pursue. He claims that **aligning your strengths and interests in this way creates the perfect environment for success**.

> **Why Strengths and Interests Translate Into Success**
> 
> According to research in the area of positive psychology, Chopra’s advice to align your goals with your natural inclinations rather than what you _think_ you should do does indeed improve your chances of successfully achieving these goals: You’re more likely to feel motivated and experience an upward emotional spiral (increased feelings of happiness and satisfaction) when you pursue goals that genuinely interest you. This positive mental state allows you to access the best parts of yourself—your unique strengths and talents—and apply them to successfully achieve your goal.

##### Focus Area 3: Who You Want to _Be_

Shetty suggests another way to create value-based goals: **Set intentions for who you want to be** as you move through your day. He explains that focusing on who you want to be rather than on what you want to or have to achieve opens you up to experiencing life in a more satisfying way. For example, there are certain work projects that frustrate you. When you consider who you want to be as you complete them (calm, positive, productive), you switch from _being_ frustrated to _being_ calm and positive. This improves the way you experience your work and your ability to both enjoy and achieve what you set out to do.

> **The Link Between Intention-Setting and Self-Discipline**
> 
> Research on the topic of intention-setting confirms that when you focus on who you want to be more than on what you have to do, you increase your self-discipline when faced with conflicting choices about how to behave. For example, you usually use brute force to get through your workload. This method rarely works and only serves to increase your feelings of frustration. On the other hand, when you intend to be calm when approaching your work, you switch your focus from how you wish your work would be (satisfying, easy) to how you want to be (calm, capable). As a result, you immediately know how to act when you’re tempted to throw a tantrum at your desk.

#### 3) Establish a Schedule Around Your Values-Based Goals

Nir Eyal (_Indistractable_) suggests that one way to live better aligned with your values is to build a schedule that helps you prioritize them. This will ensure that you have time for the things that matter to you—which will make your life feel happier and more fulfilling. He recommends creating a schedule around your values in three areas of your life: you, your relationships, and your work.

**1) You:** Think about who you want to be and the qualities you want to have, and what value-aligned activities you can schedule. For example, if you value “mindfulness,” schedule 15 minutes of gratitude reflection in the morning. If you value “staying healthy,” schedule an hour-long walk every morning.

**2) Your relationships:** Make time for _non-negotiable_ _commitments_ to your relationships with your family and friends every week. For example, schedule device-free hours with your children every Saturday, a weekly date night with your spouse, and bi-weekly drinks with your group of friends.

**3) Your work:** Consider areas where you might reprioritize or cut out work tasks that don’t align with what you want to do and who you want to be. For example, if you value "creativity," allocate time each week for brainstorming and pursuing innovative ideas. If you value "continuous learning," schedule regular blocks of time for professional development or attending relevant workshops and conferences.
