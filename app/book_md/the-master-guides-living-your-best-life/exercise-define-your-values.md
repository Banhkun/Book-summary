## Exercise: Define Your Values

Defining the values you want to live by is a vital first step to experiencing satisfaction and living your best life.

* * *

Consider moments during which you feel joyful, engaged, and energized, and write down the values these experiences may point toward. For example, if completing a challenging workout feels good to you, you may value cultivating self-discipline and pushing your physical limits.

Reflect on times in your life when you’ve felt happiest. Write down at least two experiences, noting if they share any characteristics. For example, if going on a family vacation and achieving a work goal stand out as your happiest moments, you might observe that both involved developing meaningful connections with others.

Write down at least one thing you want to _be_ , one thing you want to _have_ , and one thing you want to _do_ before you die. For example, you might want to be a compassionate and inspiring leader, have a loving family, and do volunteer work in underserved communities.

Visualize your ideal self, paying attention to how this self feels, looks, and behaves. Write down at least one piece of advice your ideal self wants to give you. For example, your ideal self may feel confident, look fit and healthy, and behave compassionately toward others. They advise you to prioritize self-care and maintain a healthy work-life balance.

Think of someone who inspires you. Name the specific qualities about them that you admire, noting down the values that may guide them. For example, if you admire their warmth or generosity, you might write down that they’re guided by compassion or kindness.
