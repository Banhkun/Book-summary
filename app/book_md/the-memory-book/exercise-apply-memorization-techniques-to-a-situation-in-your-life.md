## Exercise: Apply Memorization Techniques to a Situation In Your Life

You can apply Lorayne and Lucas’s techniques to help you remember many different kinds of information. Consider how to use them to memorize something in your life.

* * *

Describe something you need to memorize soon. When is your deadline for memorizing this information? (For example, maybe you need to remember a list of names by your meeting next week, or you have to memorize a script for a conference presentation next month.)

Which of Lorayne and Lucas’s techniques would work best for the information you need to memorize? (For example, for the list of names, you might use image-based associations and stand-in words. For the presentation, you might use image-based associations, stand-in words, _and_ core words and phrases for the ideas in the script.)

Write a plan for completing and practicing each step of your chosen memorization techniques before the deadline. (For example, for the list of names, maybe you plan to spend one day coming up with stand-in words for all the names, two days making up the images for your associations between them, and the last few days practicing your associations.)
