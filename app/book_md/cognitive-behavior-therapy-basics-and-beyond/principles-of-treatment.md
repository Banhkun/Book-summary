## Principles of Treatment

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is directed toward solving current problems and modifying dysfunctional thinking and behavior. Changing the underlying belief system leads to enduring behavior change.

CBT encourages the patient to:

  * Recognize the negative thoughts that are happening automatically.
  * Recognize the biased interpretations of their experiences.
  * Examine the evidence of a situation. View their experiences from a more realistic and objective perspective.
    * Example: Instead of thinking “I can’t do anything right,” patients are led to think, “I’m not good at this specific task. But I’m good at others.”
  * Experiment with exposure to situations they fear to test their negative predictions.
  * Reflect on their experiments to adjust their beliefs. 



The cardinal question of CBT: “**What was just going through my mind?** ”

CBT treatment has 6 characteristics.

**1) CBT is Collaborative**

  * The therapist and patient work together on the session agenda and after-session homework. As the patient improves, the patient takes more initiative.
  * The therapist shares the conceptualization to ensure it “rings true,” rather than forcing her understanding on the patient.
  * The therapist provides rationales for intervention and elicits approval.
  * The therapist constantly ends suggestions with “is that OK? Does that sound right?”
  * The therapist asks for feedback at the end of each session.
  * The pair uses guided discovery, Socratic questioning, and empiricism to explore the validity of automatic thought and test new situations.



**2) CBT is Time-bound**. Straightforward patients are empowered to be self-sufficient after 6-14 sessions, followed by periodic booster sessions.

  * After each session, the patient takes home therapy notes to review.
  * The patient carries coping cards with written statements that are important to remember.
  * As the therapist demonstrates techniques like problem-solving, she teaches the patient how to apply those techniques alone.
  * The patient learns to conduct her own CBT sessions.



**3) CBT is Customized** to the disorder and to the patient.

  * Different disorders require different approaches. 
    * Panic disorder involves testing catastrophic misinterpretations of bodily/mental sensations. 
    * Anorexia requires modifying beliefs about personal worth and control. 
    * Substance abuse focuses on beliefs about the self and permission-granting beliefs about substance abuse.
  * Each patient has different thinking patterns, beliefs, and developmental events.



**4) CBT is Present-focused**. CBT is goal-oriented, current problem-focused.

  * Contrast this to Freudian psychoanalysis, which tends to focus on unconscious conflicts and past events.
  * Strategies are devised to overcome current problems. This often consists of evaluating the evidence of the situation, creating incremental solutions to experiment with the situation, changing beliefs.
  * Attention _can_ shift to the past when patients get stuck in their thinking, or when examining childhood roots modifies their rigid ideas. (“With that experience, it’s no wonder you feel that way. Can you see how almost any child who had the same experiences would grow up feeling the same way you do?”)



**5) CBT is Built on Trust** , which arises with the therapist’s warmth, empathy, genuine regard, and competence.

  * Treat patients the way you would like to be treated.
  * Accurately summarize the patient’s thoughts and feelings. The patient will feel understood.
  * Your previous successes will make the patient feel optimistic about chances of recovery. “I’ve helped other patients much like you.”



**6) CBT is Structured**. This Makes the session more understandable and empowers the patient to do self-therapy. Each CBT session consists of three parts:

  * Introduction: Mood check, reviewing the week, setting an agenda.
  * Middle: Reviewing homework, discussing problems on the agenda, strategy setting, setting new homework, summarizing.
  * Final: Eliciting feedback.



To build collaboration, trust, and structure, use a standard communication approach during a session:

  * Tell the patient what you are about to do, why, and say you will invite feedback.
  * Do what you said.
  * Ask, “Does this ring true? How does that sound?”



### Developing the Therapeutic Relationship

A therapeutic relationship that is trusting, empathetic, and collaborative is critical to patient improvement. Here are pointers on how to build a strong therapeutic relationship:

  * Share your conceptualization with the patient constantly, asking whether it “rings true.”
    * “OK, I want to make sure I understand. The situation was [this], and your automatic thought was [this]. This thought made you feel [this emotion], so you acted by doing [this]. Did I get that right?”
  * When noticing dysphoria during the session (the patient could be remembering something or reacting to the session itself), address it: “You look upset. What was going through your mind?”
  * **Positively reinforce patients** for providing feedback. “It’s great that you recognized your thinking.”
  * Positively reinforce patients for making strides in their therapy. For example, when the patient notices automatic thoughts, suggests new solutions, or does homework.
  * **Highlight evidence of improvement** makes the patient more optimistic that the method is working. Improve the patient’s mood during the session and create a plan to feel better during the week.
  * **Emphasize the positive**. 
    * Elicit patient strengths.
    * Elicit positive data from the preceding week. “What positive things happened since I saw you last?”
    * Elicit data contrary to their negative thoughts.
    * Ask what positive data means about the patient.
    * Give positive feedback on adaptive coping mechanisms: “What a good idea.”
  * Don’t attack the core beliefs too early—this can endanger the alliance. Instead, identify the cognitions that are closest to conscious awareness, then work your way down into core beliefs over time.



### Planning Treatment and Structuring Sessions

Most patients feel more comfortable when they know what to expect from therapy and what they are expected to do. CBT sessions are designed to be structured and follow a predictable format each time.

Session agenda at a high level:

  1. Reestablish the therapeutic alliance and collect data. Set and prioritize the agenda together.
  2. Discuss the problems on the agenda. Engage in problem-solving and thereby teach cognitive skills.
  3. Review the session and provide homework.



During the session, maintain the structure of the session:

  * Elicit the most important points of the session and make sure those are written down.
  * If the patient gets off track, interrupt gently to guide the patient on the most helpful agenda items.
