## Principles of Mental Disorders

The **cognitive model** proposes that **dysfunctional thinking is common to all psychological disturbances**. In this way, mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety may be considered **thinking disorders**. The patient has automatic dysfunctional self-talk that influences behavior negatively; the behavior is then interpreted in a negatively biased way, leading to worse thinking. This reinforces itself into a vicious cycle.

  * Example: A patient wants to try something new. She thinks, “you’re definitely going to fail, you’re not good at anything.” → Anxious about failing, the patient declines to try the new activity. → She then thinks, “I told you, you can’t get anything right—you’re worthless.”



The negative thinking extends to the **_core_ of a patient’s beliefs** about herself, the world, and other people, as well as **intermediate levels of _attitudes, rules, and assumptions_** the patient holds.

It’s not just the situation itself that makes a person feel a certain way, but also how they construe it, what lens they use to view it.

  * Cyclical downfalls can be triggered by **precipitating factors** , such as a sudden provocation in stress.
  * The patient may have had key **developmental events** earlier in life that predispose her to the condition.
  * The patient may have developed **coping mechanisms**(adaptive and maladaptive) for the dysfunctional beliefs. 



The key point of cognitive behavior therapy is that **these dysfunctional beliefs can be unlearned**.

### Cognitive Conceptualization

The patient’s cognitive conceptualization exists on 3 levels: 1) core beliefs, 2) intermediate attitudes, rules and assumptions, and 3) automatic thoughts.

#### Core Beliefs

These are fundamental understandings regarded as absolute truths—just the way things are. Example: “I’m incompetent.”

They are often not explicitly articulated by the patient consciously.

Early experiences may have developed these—by parents, early authority figures; by a traumatic event; by apparent negative treatment by others (accurate or not).

These generally fall into three categories: “I’m helpless.” “I’m unlovable.” “I’m worthless”

#### Intermediate Attitudes, Rules, and Assumptions

Attitudes are judgments about a particular outcome or situation. Example: “It’s terrible to fail.”

Rules are prescriptions for behavior for the patient to follow in certain situations. Example: “If a challenge seems too great, don’t even try it.”

Assumptions are predictions about how things will go based on the patient’s behavior. Example: “If I try to do something difficult, I’ll fail. If I avoid doing it, I’ll be OK.”

Generally, the patient’s logic works like this: “If I engage in my [maladaptive coping strategy], then [my core belief] won’t come true and I’ll be OK.” And the inverse of this: “If I don’t engage in my [maladaptive coping strategy], then [my core belief] will come true and I’ll be hurt.”

(Note the patient may also have positive inversions, which arise when the patient’s mood is better. For example, a positive assumption may arise: “If I work hard, I can overcome my shortcomings.”)

#### Automatic Thoughts

Automatic thoughts arise unconsciously, often in response to a situation and sometimes unprompted. For example, someone who has a core belief that she’s incompetent may be told that her manager wants to meet with her. Her automatic thought may be, “My boss probably thinks I’m doing a terrible job. I’m finally going to be found out and fired.”

Patients are often more aware of the **emotion they feel than the thought itself**. Automatic thoughts may come in the form of verbal thoughts or images.

A wide variety of situations can evoke automatic thoughts:

  * External events
    * “A friend didn’t pick up my call.”
  * Stream of thoughts
    * A patient thinks about an exam and how much is being tested, then continues thinking about how important her grades are and a cavalcade of other thoughts.
  * Cognition: a thought, image, memory, or daydream
    * A patient thinks of a violent image.
    * A patient has a flashback of a traumatic event.
  * Emotion
    * A patient feels anger, then reflects on that anger. “I shouldn’t be angry at him. I’m such a bad person.”
  * Behavior
    * A patient binge eats despite promising herself she wouldn’t. “I’m so weak. I can’t even get my eating under control.”
  * Physiological
    * A patient feels her rapid heartbeat. “Why is my heart racing so fast? There’s something seriously wrong with me.”
  * Mental experience
    * A patient feels a sense of unreality. “I’m going crazy.”



These automatic thoughts then lead to **emotions**. The two are distinct.

  * Emotions are one word: sad, anxious, angry, jealous, ashamed, hurt, suspicious, disappointed.
  * Automatic thoughts are expressed as more than one word.



### The Patient’s Reaction

A patient’s cognitive conceptualization shapes the patient’s **reaction** , which is composed of **emotional** , **physiological** , and **behavioral** components.

To cope with negative beliefs and a cognitive conceptualization, patients often use a variety of coping mechanisms. Generally, a coping mechanism is often an extreme implementation of a behavior, or an extreme absence of the behavior. Examples:

  * A patient tries to be perfect, or, on the other end of the spectrum, tries to appear purposely incompetent
  * A patient seeks intimacy aggressively, or she avoids intimacy absolutely.
  * A patient tries to control situations, or she abdicates control.



If the response is maladaptive, the patient progressively worsens her situation, because the behavior causes further problems, which further worsens the patient’s cognitive conceptualization.

Over time, the patient can be locked into a negative vicious cycle, where the patient’s biased information-processing model **reinforces negative beliefs**. Reinforcement can happen when:

  * The patient selectively pays attention to negative data.
  * The patient discounts positive data, even turning positive into negative data
    * A patient may get an A on a test, then discount the grade with, “That test was too easy to mean anything.”
    * A patient may get praise, then discount the praise with, “I don’t deserve it, my boss is wrong.”
  * The patient may ignore positive or neutral data altogether.
    * A patient who struggles at a task may not consider that other capable people have failed at the task, or that the task has poor instructions.



The **negative vicious cycle** works like this:

  * A stressful situation arises.
  * Automatic thoughts arise that cause a maladaptive, self-defeating reaction.
  * A negative outcome results, further strengthening patient’s negative core beliefs and aggravating the automatic thoughts.
  * The patient also withdraws from situations that might lead to positive data.
  * All this is interpreted by the patient not as a mental disorder, but rather that something is wrong with the patient. This worsens dysphoria.



Importantly, **the maladaptive response may offer some short-term relief to the patient but be destructive over the long-term**.

  * For example, a patient feels anxious about taking a test. She stays in bed to calm her heart rate, but this causes her to arrive late to the test and get a poor grade. This aggravates her future anxieties.



As a clinician, your understanding of the patient’s cognitive conceptualization begins with first contact, and is refined over more sessions and gathering more data with the patient.

Example patient:

  * Sally was criticized as a child by her mother. She was often compared unfavorably to her more successful brother. This led to core beliefs about her inadequacy.
  * She developed attitudes and rules about always doing the best, being great at everything she tried. In depressed states, she focused on her deficiencies and became afraid of never amounting to anything.
  * Her coping strategies include having high standards, overpreparing for tests, looking for weaknesses and addressing them, and not asking for help.
  * Sally received new experiences leading to negative thoughts: her classmates had far more AP credits than she did; she didn’t make the school athletic team.
  * Sally developed automatic thoughts: “I’m no good. I won’t be able to do this. I’ll probably fail and drop out of college.” She did not question her automatic thoughts. 
  * These automatic thoughts aggravated into meta-thoughts about her emotions and thought patterns: “What’s wrong with me? Why am I so down? I’m just hopeless.”
  * These thoughts led to self-defeating behaviors, like withdrawing from her friends, discontinuing activities that used to give her positive accomplishment, and not concentrating during studying.



Here’s an example of a cognitive model sequence, where a situation prompts automatic thoughts:

  * Situation: Sally feels exhausted (physiological trigger) when she wakes.
    * Automatic thought: I’m too tired to get up. There’s no use getting out of bed.
    * Reaction: Emotionally, she feels sad. Physiologically, she feels heavy. Behaviorally she stays in bed.
  * Automatic thoughts: “What if my professor gives a pop quiz? What if this counts against my grade? What if I fail the class?”
    * Reaction: Emotionally, she feels anxious. Physiologically, she feels her heart rate rise.
  * Situation: Sally notices her rapid heartbeat.
    * Automatic thought: “What’s wrong with me? Why am I getting worked up over nothing?
    * Reaction: Emotionally, she feels more anxious.
  * Automatic thought: “I’d better just stay in bed, I can’t do anything right now.”
    * Reaction: Emotionally, she feels relief. Physiologically, she feels her heart rate slow. Behaviorally, she stays in bed longer.



### Correcting Automatic Thoughts

Patients misconstrue neutral or even positive situations as negative through their automatic thoughts. Further, they tend to not examine their automatic thoughts critically and take them for granted. However, through the process of CBT, by examining their automatic thoughts and correcting errors, they often feel better.

Automatic thoughts can be examined on the basis of their validity and utility.

**Validity** : the thought is not supported by the evidence. Or, the conclusion drawn may be distorted.

  * Example: The patient looks at evidence of failure and thinks, “I didn’t do what I promised,” which leads her to conclude, “I’m a bad person.” The patient can learn to recognize that the conclusion is incomplete and not supported by all available evidence.



**Utility** : the thought may be valid, but dysfunctional.

  * Example: “It’ll take an all-nighter to finish this assignment.” While true, this increases the patient’s anxiety, which decreases concentration and causes worse performance. Therefore, this thought is dysfunctional.
  * A better thought is, “I’ve finished assignments in this situation before. Dwelling on how long it’ll take makes me feel bad, and I won’t concentrate. It’ll take me longer to finish. Better to concentrate on one part at a time, and give myself credit for finishing.”
