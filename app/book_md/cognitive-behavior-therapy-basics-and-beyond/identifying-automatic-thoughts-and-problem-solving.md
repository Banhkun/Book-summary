## Identifying Automatic Thoughts and Problem Solving

A key part of treating mood disorders is identifying the patient’s automatic thoughts and guiding the patient to evaluate them and overcome them. This is done by:

  * Articulating the automatic thought explicitly.
  * Evaluating the automatic thought for validity and utility.
  * Constructing behavioral experiments to highlight the discrepancy between the patient’s automatic thoughts and reality.



We’ll cover each component in a dedicated section.

### Identifying Automatic Thoughts

The key question of identifying automatic thoughts is: **“What is going through your mind right now?”**

**To elicit the automatic thought, try a range of techniques:**

  * Paint a vivid picture. Ask the patient to imagine the situation, picture the time, and revisit exactly what the patient was doing.
  * Ask for a description of the physical sensation of the emotion.
    * “Where did you feel the anxiety?”
  * Turn the reflection into **present tense** —past tense obscures the emotional response.
  * Ask the opposite of what you think the thought was. “Did you think you were going to ace the test?”
  * Role play the situation with the patient.
  * If the patient is unresponsive, ask what the patient thought would have been the worst that could have happened.
  * “Were you imagining something that might happen or remembering something that did?”



The patient should be led to describe the specific thought as it occurred, **NOT speculating on its intent**.

  * Not “I must be sabotaging myself.” Rather “I was thinking, “I’m going to fail the test.”
  * Not “I couldn’t get myself to start reading.” Rather “I can’t do this.”
  * Not “how will I get through it?” Rather “I can’t get through this.”



**Probe if secondary automatic thoughts may have surfaced.**

  * Automatic thoughts about their reactions (emotion, behavior, or physiology) can cause a vicious cycle.
    * For example, the first thought may be “I’m going to fail the test.” This may provoke anxiety, leading to a physiological response and rapid heart rate. This may then provoke another automatic thought: “Why is my heart beating so fast? What’s wrong with me?”
  * Ask, “what else went through your mind?” Then ask, “which of these thoughts was most upsetting?”



**Frame the thought as an idea, not as a truth or fact. It will be evaluated later.**

**Make clear the impact the thought has on emotion and behavior.**

  * “How did that thought make you feel?”
  * “What does that emotion make you want to do?”
  * “What would happen if you had the opposite thought? How would you feel?”
  * The patient should understand the difference between thought and emotion. Emotions are one word.



**If the emotion doesn’t match the thought, then probe further—you may not be at the root of the situation.** Here’s an example:

  * “My mom didn’t pick up the phone and I thought ‘what if something happened to her?’ I felt sad.” This doesn’t quite match—wondering if something happened to your mother would typically provoke worry or anxiety.
  * Probe further—“so the ring tone stops. What happens next?” Patient: “I get teary.” Therapist: “What is going through your head?” Patient: “What if something happens to her? **Then there’s no one left to care about me**.” That’s the real underlying thought that matches the emotion of sadness.



**Rate the intensity of the emotion to triage problems and gauge improvement in mood.**

  * “Let’s try to rate the emotion on a scale of 0 to 100%. 0 is no sadness at all, and 100% is the saddest you have ever felt.”
  * Make a ruler of emotions with the patient. “Let’s make a scale of when you felt sad in the past. When did you feel just a little bit sad? The saddest you’ve ever felt? And in between? Now, how did you feel in this situation?”
  * If the patient is reviewing a past event: “How much did you feel [the negative emotion] then? How much do you feel it now?”
  * Situations that are minor in emotional intensity might not be worth exploring further. 



### Evaluating Automatic Thoughts

Automatic thoughts can be examined on the basis of their validity and utility. Invalid thoughts are not supported by the evidence. Or, the thought may be valid, but dysfunctional.

**Never challenge a patient’s thought or belief.** This violates the collaborative empiricism of CBT. You are to guide the patient to examining her own thought.

**Ask Socratic questions to help them gain distance**.

  * “What is the evidence that your thought is true? What is the evidence on the other side?”
  * “What is an alternative way of viewing this situation? What else could explain the person’s behavior/the outcome?”
  * “What’s the worst that could happen? How would you cope with this situation?” (You can give solutions to help the thinking.)
  * “What’s the best that could happen? What’s the _most realistic_ outcome of this situation?” (This is especially useful if the patient has a catastrophic view.)
  * “What is the effect of believing your automatic thought? What could be the effect of changing your thinking?”
  * **“** If your friend were in this situation and had the same automatic thought, what advice would you give him or her?”
  * “What should you do going forward? How likely are you to do this?”



**For more advanced patients, you can vary the questions.**

  * “Is it true that [your extreme assumption] always has to be true?”
    * For example, “does it always have to be true that you need to make your mom happy at all times?”
  * “Is it reasonable to expect that sometimes [the situation] will happen?”
  * “Is it desirable to have [this extreme goal]?”



**Cognitive distortions tend to fit one or more of these patterns:**

  * Catastrophizing—imagining the worst possible thing that could happen
  * Selective bias/tunnel vision/discounting the positive —focusing and emphasizing negative evidence for the thought. Alternatively, ignoring or de-emphasizing positive evidence against the thought.
  * All-or-nothing—”either I get an A or you’re a total failure.”
  * Mind reading—assuming negative intent or negative beliefs about other people, without considering other possibilities.
  * Emotional reasoning—because you feel it so strongly, it must be true
    * “I feel like a failure all the time, so it must be true.”
  * Exaggeration, or overgeneralization.
  * Should and must statements—a precise fixed idea of how people should behave. The patient overestimates how bad it is if these expectations are failed.



**When automatic thoughts are true:**

  * Focus on problem solving.
  * Investigate whether the patient has drawn an invalid conclusion.
  * Work on acceptance.



**Comforting lines to say:**

  * “We’ll keep practicing this until it becomes easy.”
  * (If the patient finds it difficult to get thoughts) “Sometimes these thoughts are hard to catch. No big deal.”



**Ask about the patient’s current mood and how much they believe the automatic thought.**

**If after examination, there is no mood improvement, a deeper root issue may be at hand.**

  * The automatic thought may be too superficial. Other thoughts, images, or assumptions remain.
    * “I was thinking that I would fail the test” may be incomplete. On further examination, the patient says, “I was thinking I can’t do anything right. I saw my parents laughing at me.”
  * Evaluation of the automatic thought is implausible, superficial, or inadequate.
    * “Yes, my automatic thought was silly. I’ll get my work done for sure.”
  * The patient has not sufficiently expressed the evidence in support of the automatic thought.
    * Don’t skip ahead after one response. Ask if there’s any other evidence in support of the thought, or against the thought.
  * The person believes the new thought rationally, but doesn’t feel it emotionally.This is often because of an underlying belief, which needs more intervention to change.



**Teach the patient to examine thoughts herself.** Often 1-2 particular questions will work better for a patient than other questions.

  * Patients can keep a Thought Record or “Testing your Thoughts” worksheet, which goes through the whole Socratic questioning above. Components include:
    * Date/Time
    * Situation—”What event or stream of thoughts led to the unpleasant emotion? What distressing physical sensations did you have?”
    * Automatic thoughts—”What thoughts or images went through your mind? How much did you believe each at the time?”
    * Emotions—”What emotion(s) did you feel at the time? How intense was the emotion?”
    * Adaptive response—”What cognitive distortion did you make? Use (Socratic) questions at bottom to compose a response to the automatic thought. How much do you believe each response?”
    * Outcome—”How much do you now believe each automatic thought? What emotion do you feel now? How intense is the emotion? What will you do/what did you do?”
    * Note to the patient that this is a general tool, that it may not work all the time, and that relieving the emotion by 10% is worth it.
  * For some people, consider audio recordings of the main points, rather than written notes.



Not every thought needs to be examined. It might be more helpful to focus on a more distressing thought, teach other parts of the cognitive model, or avoid distress in the moment.

With experience, the patient can skip some of the examining questions, going directly to examining alternatives and forming an adaptive response.

### Behavioral Experiments and Behavioral Activation

#### Main Ideas

Negative cognitions are linked to patients’ negative predictions of what will happen.**The goal of behavioral experiments is to show that the patient’s negative prediction doesn’t often match the reality of the outcome**.

For example, if a patient is anxious about being socially rejected, a behavioral experiment might consist of calling one of her close friends and reflecting on how the outcome matched her prediction.

Depressed people often have inactivity as a core problem. They deprive themselves of opportunities for pleasure or mastery, and they engage in dysphoric activities (such as sleeping or lying in bed) that may offer short-term relief from their negative automatic thoughts. Even when they do pleasurable activities, their automatic thoughts may make it displeasurable. (“I’m doing a terrible job. I can’t do this as well as I used to.”) Behavioral experiments try to reverse the vicious cycle and create situations for positive thoughts.

#### Tactics

Use the patient’s daily schedule as an opportunity to spot positive things that the patient isn’t doing, or negative things the patient does too much of. Strive for a good balance between pleasure and mastery.

  * Ask how the activities make them feel (probably bad). Then normalize the activity for the patient: “Most depressed people think they’ll feel better in bed. But usually they find that doing anything else is better.”



Suggest experiments that are within the capability of the patient. **Find the version of the behavior that is easiest** —finding the right friend to ask out, the easiest physical activity to resume.

If applicable, try to achieve results within the session—collaboratively design experiments that patients can conduct right in the session itself.

  * A depressed patient might have the automatic thought, “I won’t be able to concentrate on reading anything.” The experiment could be to read a passage from a book and summarize it for you, to see what degree the thought is valid.



Teach the patient to give herself credit when she does a good behavior or detects an automatic thought.

  * The patient can tell herself, “Good. I did it.”
  * If the patient is skeptical about this, say, “Even if these behaviors used to be easy in the past, being depressed makes it harder. So you deserve credit. When you’re over the depression, you don’t have to give yourself credit.”



Anticipate barriers to executing the experiment.

  * If you sense hesitation from the patient, ask what automatic thought crossed her mind.
    * If she doesn’t offer one, say the opposite: “were you thinking about what a good time you’d have?”
    * Confront the automatic thought by asking what evidence she has to support it, and what evidence she has to disagree with it.
  * Reduce the time delay to conducting the experiment—schedule an action today.
  * If the behavior is too imposing, find an easier behavior to start with. Ask what activity takes less energy.
  * Preempt negative feelings if the experiment fails: “what would you feel if your friends said no to hanging out?”
  * If the patient has no ideas on what’s enjoyable, give a list of 5-10 activities and ask which sound the most enjoyable.



Use an hourly activity chart to plan out the day. Plan in rest sessions.

  * The patient should write the activities into the chart herself.



Rate the sense of mastery and pleasure the person gets.

  * Create a scale of 0, 5, and 10 for pleasure and mastery.
  * Ask the patient to rate activities the patient has previously done, and to predict her ratings of future activities to come.
  * Ideally, the real ratings contradict their predictions. For example, the patient may predict an activity is a 2 in pleasure, then find out later it’s a 6.



### Example Discussion

This example dialogue pieces together the three steps of identifying automatic thoughts, evaluating them, and creating a behavioral experiment.

  * Therapist: OK, Sally, you wanted to talk about getting a part-time job?
  * Patient: Yeah, I need to work for the money, but...I don’t know.
  * Therapist: [noticing Sally’s dysphoria] What’s going through your mind right now?
  * Patient: [automatic thought] I can’t handle a job.
  * Therapist: [labeling the idea as a thought and linking to her mood] And how does that thought make you feel?
  * Patient: [emotion] Really sad. Hopeless.
  * Therapist: [beginning to evaluate the thought] What’s the evidence that you can’t handle a job?
  * Patient: Well, I’m already having trouble getting through my classes, so how can I handle a job?
  * Therapist: Is there anything else?
  * Patient: I feel so tired everyday. It’s already hard to just _look_ for a job—how can I actually go to work everyday?
  * Therapist: In a minute we’ll look at that. [suggesting an alternative view] It’s possible that looking for a new job is the harder part, and that once you have a job, keeping it is easier. Is there any other evidence that you couldn’t handle a job, assuming you can get one? 
  * Patient: No, nothing comes to mind.
  * Therapist: [evidence on other side] Is there any evidence on the other side, that you _might_ be able to handle a job?
  * Patient: I _did_ keep my part-time job last year, and I was able to do OK in school too. But this year...I don’t know.
  * Therapist: Is there any other evidence you could handle it?
  * Patient: It’s possible if the job didn’t take that much time and wasn’t so hard, I could keep it up.
  * Therapist: What kind of job might that be?
  * Patient: Maybe working in a store, like what I did last year.
  * Therapist: [helping build concrete solutions] Are there any places like that where you could find a job?
  * Patient: Maybe the college bookstore. I saw they were hiring in an email.
  * Therapist: OK. And what would be the _worst_ that could happen if you got a job there?
  * Patient: I’d get overwhelmed and fail.
  * Therapist: If that happened, how would you cope? 
  * Patient: I guess I’d quit.
  * Therapist: What would be the _best_ that could happen if you got a job there?
  * Patient: I guess it’d be easy like last year and I could do it.
  * Therapist: What’s the most _realistic_ outcome?
  * Patient: It probably won’t be easy at first, but I might be able to handle that and school at the same time.
  * Therapist: Sally, what’s the effect of believing your automatic thought, “I can’t handle a job?”
  * Patient: It makes me feel sad. It makes me stop wanting to try.
  * Therapist: And what’s the effect of changing your thinking, of realizing that you realistically _could_ work in the bookstore?
  * Patient: I’d feel better. I’d apply for the job.
  * Therapist: So what do you want to do about this?
  * Patient: I want to go to the bookstore and apply for the job.
  * Therapist: When will you go?
  * Patient: I guess this afternoon.
  * Therapist: How likely are you to go? 
  * Patient: Pretty likely. I’ll go.
  * Therapist: How do you feel now?
  * Patient: Better. A little nervous. But I’m hopeful.



Here, Sally can write a coping card that prepares a response to the situation: “If I’m afraid to go to the bookstore, remind myself that I probably could handle a job there and, in the worst case, I could quit. Even then, it’s not a big deal.”
