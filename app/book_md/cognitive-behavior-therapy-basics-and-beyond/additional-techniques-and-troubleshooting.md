## Additional Techniques and Troubleshooting

CBT is customized to the patient, and different techniques may have different efficacy between patients. Here are more techniques mentioned in the book to draw upon:

  * When making decisions and choosing between options, ask the patient to make a list of advantages and disadvantages of each option. Score each entry to help make the ultimate decision.
  * **Refocusing** : when the patient’s attention veers to distracting automatic thoughts, rather than evaluating their automatic thoughts, instead refocus attention on the task at hand.
  * **Distraction** : get the patient’s mind off of automatic thoughts.
    * Ask what has worked in the past.
    * Suggestions: watch TV, go for a walk, email a friend, clean her desk, or browse the web.
  * **Exposure** : keep engaging the object of concern until the negative affect dissipates.
    * Patients often have safety behaviors, such as avoiding thinking about the subject to ward off anxiety, but which perpetuate the fundamental problem.
  * **Graded task assignments** : reaching the ultimate task (such as landing a new job) may be intimidating. Break the task into its constituent stepwise tasks to make each step seem less problematic (for example, prepare the resume, look at job postings, and so on).
    * Represent the steps visually with a staircase.
  * **Role playing**
    * Assume a positive outcome: “If you knew for sure the teaching assistant would be willing to talk to you, what would you say?”
  * **Pie technique** : visually represent something that causes distress. This can help the patient recognize the reality of a situation.
    * Time spent on different activities, with one pie chart showing actual time and another showing ideal time.
    * Attribution of causes for a situation. When shown on a pie chart, the most feared cause may be unlikely.
    * The likelihood of outcomes. When shown on a pie chart, the catastrophic one may be seen as unlikely.
  * **Self-comparison** : discuss the headwinds the patient has faced by applying them to a different person.
    * “We know that depression is a physiological issue. Would you expect someone who was infected with pneumonia to do everything flawlessly?”
  * **Credit lists**
    * Keep track of things that were positive or difficult to do.
    * This is a good stepping stone to the Core Belief Worksheet.



### Imagery

Often specific vivid images are a primary source of patient distress. Elucidating the image is important for recovery.

Synonyms of imagery include mental picture, daydream, fantasy, or memory.

Techniques to improve imagery:

  * **Continue imagining beyond the image.**
    * Often the patient stops at the most distressing part. Continuing past the image often shows how the patient will resolve the situation capably.
    * Picture what happens in the far future—weeks, months, years after the anxious image. Shows that things will likely be resolved satisfactorily.
  * **Rework the image to include coping behaviors.**
    * Ask leading questions to guide the adaptive behaviors that the patient could do in the situation.
    * This can include coping behaviors like reading coping cards during the stressful situation.
    * Assign homework to remember the positive image.
  * **Rework the image to imagine a different outcome.**
    * The outcome could be realistic and imagine likely outcomes. Then talk about behaviors that could push toward this outcome.
    * The outcome could also be magical. For example, a scary person could morph into a crying baby with a puff of smoke.
  * **Imagine the image multiple times in succession.** The severity of the image should decrease.



Use imagery as a therapeutic tool.

  * Induce an image of a situation. The patient then rehearses coping techniques.



### Troubleshooting Sessions

#### Common Pitfalls to Sessions

As a therapist, you may run into the following shortcomings:

  * Failing to set patient expectations for therapy, and of her responsibilities.
  * Failing to emphasize key automatic thoughts
  * Failing to summarize frequently
  * Failing to summarize using patient’s own words
  * Failing to ask the patient for depth of understanding
  * Failing to provide rationale for agenda items or your direction
  * Failing to make a therapeutic intervention—just talking about problems without solving them or assigning homework
  * Failing to record therapy notes for patient to review



Getting feedback on your performance is helpful. Ask the patient if you can record their session, so you can review the session with a colleague.

Beware of your own negative automatic thoughts about the patient, therapy, or yourself. Not all sessions will go well. Instead of catastrophizing the problem and questioning your ability as a therapist, see it as an opportunity to refine your skills.

#### Problems in Patient Engagement

In general, problems in CBT sessions can be a result of one of two issues: 1) insufficient socialization (the patient lacks training on what to do) or 2) reluctance to comply (the patient knows what to do but doesn't want to do it).

Distinguish between the two by socializing the patient to the CBT model.

  * If the patient gives a neutral reaction, then it's a socialization problem.
  * If the patient is frustrated, then follow this standard procedure, 1) thank the patient for expressing her thoughts, 2) investigate automatic thoughts, 3) provide rationale for what you're doing. Directly tackling automatic thoughts can work, but sometimes it causes too much friction



Causes of reluctance to comply include a weak therapeutic alliance; ineffective structure or pace of session; unrealistic patient expectations; lack of patient understanding of cognitive model; or the patient’s biology or external environment.

#### Interrupting During Sessions

To get the session on track to cover the most helpful items, you will have to interrupt.

An effective way to do this is to:

  1. Ask if you can interrupt
  2. Ask for what you want, or summarize what you're hearing
  3. Ask if that sounds right.



If the patient is upset at the interruption, follow the standard procedure from above. Also apologize for interrupting, and ask if they would like to continue and leave some topics behind, or to talk uninterrupted.

#### The Patient Feels Over-structured

If the patient’s automatic thoughts reveal feeling boxed in by the session, ask if the patient would like to begin the session without agenda setting but just talking at length.
