## Exercise: Revise Your Morning Routine

Meurisse recommends starting your day with low-stimulation activities that don't cause sensory overload. He explains that avoiding dopamine-inducing activities first thing in the morning will help you stay focused for the rest of the day.

* * *

Describe your typical morning routine. What’s the first thing you do when you wake up? How do you spend the first hour of the day?

What's one behavior change you could make to your morning routine that would decrease stimulation? For example, spend the first five minutes after waking up meditating, or avoid checking your email until it’s time to start work.

What's one thing you can do to make this new behavior easier? For example, put a note next to your bed or plug in your phone in a different room.
