## Exercise: How Do You Support Your Gut Health?

According to Enders, maintaining a healthy gut helps strengthen your immune system, provide you with nutrients, and prevent diseases such as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease.

What, if anything, do you currently do to support your gut health, and why? (For example, you might take probiotics or prebiotics, eat foods high in fiber, or take antibiotics only when required.) If you don’t currently do anything to support your gut health: Why not?
