## Convince Consumers That You’re the Only Viable Option

The first four laws of marketing focus on how to be the top choice within your market. In every major product category, there’s one brand that immediately comes to consumers’ minds. For chocolate, it’s Hershey’s. For cellophane tape, it’s Scotch tape. The most successful brands are those that are considered the defaults in their categories. Use the following laws to make sure your product is consumers’ first choice.

### Law #1: Be the First in Your Field

Do you know who piloted the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean? Charles Lindbergh. Do you know who flew the _second_ flight across the Atlantic? If not, you’re not alone. People remember firsts—whether it’s the first person to walk on the moon or the first company to offer a new product. For this reason,**companies that are first to enter their markets are typically more successful than those that follow, even if the latecomers have better products.** Furthermore, the first entrants in a particular market tend to remain the market leaders over time. In fact, the rankings of the top-selling companies in an industry tend to match the order in which they launched their products—the innovator has the highest sales, the second entrant is behind them, and so on.

Humans are wired to prefer things that are familiar. When a new product hits the shelves and consumers eagerly adopt it, they become familiar with and attached to that particular product. In other words,**the first brand available typically becomes the default for that product.** The most successful brands actually become synonymous with the product itself—for example, people often refer to tissues as Kleenex, even though Kleenex is the name of a specific brand of tissues (case in point, Kleenex was the _first_ brand of facial tissues). The same goes for Xerox, Jell-O, Q-tips, Velcro, and Band-Aid.

Despite this law and case after case of proof, companies are often tempted to wait to enter a market until another firm has tested the market and proven that it’s viable. However, this approach puts later entrants in a difficult position: By the time latecomers enter the market, they face the formidable task of trying to wrest consumers away from the brand they’ve become comfortable with. Even if these companies used the extra time to develop higher-quality products, consumers typically prefer the devil they know over the one they don’t. At the end of the day, **successful marketing doesn’t depend on the _actual quality_ of a product, but rather consumers’ _perception_ of the product **(more on this in Law #4).****(Shortform note: Read our summary of The Innovator’s Dilemma for more about how innovative companies balance the risks and rewards of establishing emerging markets.)

### Law #2: If You Can’t Be First, Create a New Category

If you have a great product but another company was already first in that market, **create a new category in which you are first.** You don’t have to entirely change your product—just find something that sets it apart. For example, if someone else is already selling the first electric razor, make your product the first electric razor _for curly hair_. When Charles Schwab opened a brokerage firm, instead of competing with existing firms, he made his the first _discount_ brokerage firm.

Once you’ve established a new category, **promote the product instead of your brand.** Convince people with curly hair that they need a razor made specifically for them—one that can solve their specific problems. Then, when you’ve convinced consumers that they need this product, they’ll naturally buy it from you because you’re the first (or possibly the only) one selling it.

### Law #3: Be the First Brand in Consumers’ Minds

Although Law #1 states that you need to the first _in the marketplace_ , Law #3 amends that principle: **Above all, you need to be first _in consumers’ minds_ —when consumers think of the product you sell, they should immediately think of your brand. **Being first in the market merely gives you a head start to get into the public’s mind.

Although being the first entrant in a market gives you the opportunity to be first in people’s minds, it also carries responsibility to convince people that they need this product to begin with. You can have a revolutionary product, but it’s not worth much if you can’t convince anyone to buy it. There are examples throughout history of companies that were first to market with a product but failed to establish a need for it:

  * Duryea Motor Wagon Company manufactured the first gas-powered car, but the credit typically goes to Ford, who followed closely after. 
  * Hurley Electric Laundry Equipment Company produced the first automatic washing machines, followed by Barlow & Seeling Manufacturing, which later became Speed Queen. While Hurley no longer exists, Speed Queen is now the world leader for industrial washing machines. 



### Law #4: Perception Trumps Fact

In the battle for prospective customers’ minds, you must fight not only to be _first_ in mind but also _best_ in mind. Contrary to popular belief, **your most potent weapon in marketing is not the quality of your product, but rather the public’s perception of your product.** Simply put, perception is reality: No matter what research and performance tests reveal, your marketing will only be successful if consumers believe that your product is the best. Have you ever tried to get someone to change her mind about something she was absolutely convinced was true? You can throw every fact at the person and, still, if someone is convinced that something is true, then it is—at least, it’s true in her mind, and that’s all that matters.

These are just two examples that illustrate how perception trumps product quality:

  1. Japanese carmakers sell Honda, Toyota, and Nissan in both Japan and the United States. Given that the quality, design, and power of the cars are identical in both countries, and the prices are nearly the same, the best-selling car should be the same in both places. However, while Honda trails behind Toyota and Nissan in Japan, it sells far more cars in the U.S. Honda is considered a quality car company in the U.S., but Japanese customers perceive Honda primarily as a motorcycle manufacturer, and they don’t perceive a motorcycle company to be a source for high-quality cars.
  2. When the Coca-Cola Company introduced New Coke, it conducted a taste test among 200,000 people that revealed that New Coke had the best taste, followed by Pepsi, followed by Coca-Cola Classic. However, the sales were reversed: Coca-Cola Classic had the highest sales, followed by Pepsi, with New Coke last. **If product quality truly determined marketing success, the sales should correlate with the taste test data.**



This isn’t just true in marketing—in all areas of life, people assume that their perception of reality is the truth. In fact, there is no objective truth; the only truths are those that people perceive. People think that reality exists _outside_ their minds, but the only reality is the one they create _within_ their minds. Your prospective customers have their own truths, and you’ll be hard pressed to sway them with facts about how your product is better than your competitor’s. Instead, build your marketing plan around the way people form perceptions. **Marketing manipulates people’s perceptions and, thus, their realities.**

People’s _individual_ perceptions are also influenced by _other people’s_ perceptions. This is the “everybody knows” principle—as in, everybody knows that Japanese cars are higher quality than American-made cars. **Consumers often base their buying decisions on common knowledge and hearsay, even if they haven’t had any personal experience with the product.** Furthermore, the “everybody knows” principle is even stronger than firsthand experience. In other words, shoppers who have used a product interpret their experiences to align with what “everybody knows.” For example, since Japanese cars are better quality, if you had a reliable American car, it must have been purely good luck.
