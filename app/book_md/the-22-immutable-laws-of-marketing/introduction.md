## Introduction

The most successful companies are the ones with the highest-quality products and biggest marketing budgets, right? Wrong. While quality products and large cash reserves certainly help, they don’t determine a company’s success. In reality, **there are laws that govern what works and what doesn’t in marketing.** A beautifully constructed airplane that doesn’t adhere to the laws of physics won’t get off the ground, and neither will a cleverly designed product that breaks the laws of marketing.

Authors Al Ries and Jack Trout are marketing experts who spent more than 25 years studying marketing successes and failures. Through their research, they discovered common principles that they’ve distilled into 22 laws that lead to success. Each of the following chapters is devoted to explaining one of these laws and illustrating the principle with anecdotes about well-known brands such as IBM and Honda. This is one of several books that Ries and Trout have authored on marketing, including _Marketing Warfare_ , _Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind_ , _Horse Sense_ , and _Bottom-Up Marketing_. (Shortform note: This book was published in 1993, before the Internet and social media altered the way companies market and consumers shop.)

Although these laws have been proven time and again, many reputable companies and advertising firms continue to violate them, albeit to their detriment. If you try to apply these laws at your company, be warned that you will likely face pushback from colleagues and higher-ups who wrongly believe that:

  * Product quality determines success (see Law #4)
  * Selling more products leads to larger profits (see Law #13)
  * It’s better to market to everyone instead of risking excluding some potential customers (see Law #14)



(Shortform note: For added context, we’ve renumbered the laws and grouped them into six themes:

  1. **Convince consumers that you’re the only viable option** : Position your product as the top choice within your market.
  2. **Focus your message** : Create a unique, targeted marketing message.
  3. **Leverage your market position** : Learn how markets generally behave and how to use that insight to inform your marketing strategy.
  4. **Be consistent** : Position your product as the best in its category and build your marketing around that product so customers know what to expect from your brand. 
  5. **Be strategic about your overall marketing plan** : Aside from the specifics of your marketing message, be strategic with your overarching tone and approach.
  6. **Get on top and stay there** : Beyond the marketing arm of your business, ensure that your organization remains healthy for lasting success.)
