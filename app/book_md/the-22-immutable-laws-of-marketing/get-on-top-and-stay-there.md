## Get on Top and Stay There

While the laws we’ve discussed so far will help you craft your overall marketing plan and message, these final laws address more general advice about how to approach your business.

### Law #18: Don’t Underestimate the Need for Funding

If you have a great idea and you’re ready to apply these laws and watch your business take off, take a step back. No matter how brilliant your idea is, you need money in order to successfully market it. **Marketing is about getting your product or service into the minds of consumers, and you need money not only to _reach_ them in the first place but also to _stay_ in their minds. **Marketing is a constant—and expensive—battle. Even household names like Procter & Gamble and General Motors spend billions each year to stay in consumers’ minds.

Leverage your idea to find funding. You could:

  * Pitch venture capitalists, but be warned that few entrepreneurs secure sufficient funding this way.
  * Pitch your idea to an existing company, in which case your best bet is to pursue smaller companies. Large companies seldom accept ideas from outside the organization. 
  * Franchise your idea. Tom Monaghan took this route to get Domino’s Pizza off the ground. 
  * Marry into money, or divorce for a large settlement. _Lear’s Magazine_ was launched with Frances Lear’s divorce money. 
  * Get help from your parents or relatives, if you come from a wealthy family. Donald Trump’s father had already built wealth that was critical to Donald’s early success. (Shortform note: Read our summary of The Art of The Deal to learn more about Donald Trump’s early business ventures.)



If your customers are other businesses, you’ll still need a sizable budget but it will be considerably less than you’d need for a product or service aimed at the general public. And if you’re a large company that already has a big budget, use it. **Being frugal won’t earn you sales, so invest in marketing** and follow the laws we’ve discussed.

### Law #19: Embrace Failure

Failure is inevitable. Sometimes it’s small and manageable, sometimes it’s massive and devastating. **To be successful in business means to expect and embrace failure.** Not every problem needs to be resolved—sometimes you just need to recognize a failure and cut your losses. Xerox could have saved itself $2 billion and decades of struggles if it had accepted its failure in the computer market and stuck with copiers. If you embrace failure:

  * You’ll be willing to**make the bold risks that are necessary for big rewards.**
  * You’ll be able to**learn from your mistakes and constantly improve.**



Foster a company culture that accepts the possibility of failure:

  * Encourage employees to experiment and learn from their misses. Don’t punish failure—unless they make the same mistake repeatedly. 
  * Promote group decision-making so that no individual bears the weight of the risk of failure. If just one person carries this weight, they’ll be less inclined to take necessary risks. 
  * Don’t allow managers and executives to dismiss an idea simply because they don’t benefit directly from it. 



### Law #20: Don’t Believe Hype

When the media creates a lot of hype about a company or a new product, it’s usually a poor predictor of success. **When companies are doing well, they don’t need to manufacture excitement because it exists organically.** By contrast, when companies are struggling—or when they’re taking a chance on an iffy new product—that’s typically when they start holding press conferences and reaching out to media outlets.

There are countless examples of innovations that the press predicted would be instant successes, but that ultimately flopped or took years to catch on. One example is the picturephone, which debuted at the 1964 New York World’s Fair. The picturephone—later called the videophone—was essentially a telephone attached to a television. AT&T tried promoting the technology in the 1970s, ‘80s, and ‘90s with little success. (Shortform note: The technology supporting videotelephony improved over the course of the 1990s and 2000s, ultimately resulting in the ubiquitous video chatting platforms available today.)

### Law #21: Follow Trends, Not Fads

It’s critical to know the difference between fads and trends, because fads can hurt your business while trends can create long-term success:

  * **Fads are short-term.** They hit like a wave, generate a lot of hype, saturate the market, and fade as quickly as they rose. 
  * **Trends are long-term.** They are subtle—almost unnoticed—and they can endure for years or decades. 



Beware of investing in fads. **Although fads can be profitable, their short lifespan can cause more harm than good for the company.** By the time an organization has set up the staff, manufacturing, and distribution necessary, the fad is over. If you’re already selling a product that becomes a fad, the best thing to do is to dampen the fad by limiting the supply. If you flood the market, soon everyone will own the product and the excitement will be gone. On the other hand, if you restrict supply, the product will remain in demand. Ideally, you want to dampen the fad so much that it converts into a trend.

For example, Cabbage Patch Kids dolls became a fad after they were introduced in 1983. The manufacturer, Coleco Industries, capitalized on the hype and produced Cabbage Patch games, clothes, pens, and pencils. By 1988, the fad had passed and Coleco filed for bankruptcy. However, Hasbro acquired Cabbage Patch Kids and sustained sales—albeit at lower levels than during their heyday—with a more measured approach.

### Law #22: Don’t Let Your Success Sink You

You’ve worked hard, stayed focused, grown in the market, dodged your competitors’ negative attacks, and gained huge success. Now you have to **be wary that that success doesn’t cause your downfall.** Consider the cautionary tale of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) founder Kenneth Olsen, who built the $14 billion company from the ground up by becoming the leader in minicomputers. Olsen’s success caused him to overestimate his industry wisdom and dismiss some of the most impactful computer innovations of the time—the personal computer, open systems, and reduced instruction set computing (RISC). (Shortform note: In the late 1970s, Olsen said, “There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home." He was forced to retire as president of DEC in 1992.)

Success can alter the dynamics that brought the company success in the first place:

  1. **Success tends to inflate executives’ egos, causing them to make decisions that hurt the company.** This often comes in the form of line extensions. For example, when the CEO of a market-leading steak sauce brand sees how successful the product has become, she may think that the brand name is the source of that success. With that logic, the natural next step is to put that brand name on a host of new products, assuming that the name will bring success with it. In reality, the brand name’s success is a byproduct of effective marketing, and sticking it on other products only weakens its power across the board (Law #13). 
  2. **Success causes companies to grow, which creates more demands on executives’ time, and they lose touch with marketing.** As CEOs spend more time sitting in corporate meetings, meeting ancillary obligations, and doing everything else required to run a large company, they spend less time on the front lines and often delegate marketing to a manager. However, executives must stay involved in the nitty-gritty in order to catch opportunities when they arise (Law #16). Although a large company has more resources to invest into robust marketing, that advantage is offset by the sacrifices the executives must make. 
  3. **As CEOs become more distant from the front lines, their subordinates are less likely to tell them hard truths.** As a result, CEOs are often out-of-touch with issues and challenges that should influence their decision-making—but as far as the executives know, everything is going great. One way executives can get around this is by dropping in unexpectedly (or in disguise) at lower-level meetings and retail stores. Successful marketing requires you to put yourself in the customers’ shoes, so a wise CEO must bridge the gap between her corner office and her customers’ lifestyles.
