## Exercise: Boost Your Consciousness Level

You've read Hawkins's theories about what consciousness is, how to measure it, and how to increase it. Now, think about what your consciousness level is and how you might improve it.

* * *

Describe one area of your life where you tend to rely on aggressive coercion, rather than cooperative energy. (For example, maybe you tend to see your job as a competition instead of a collaborative effort with your colleagues.)

How might you change from using coercion to using energy in that area of your life? (For example, instead of trying to have the best sales or production numbers at your job, perhaps think about how you could improve your entire department's performance.)

To boost your consciousness even further, whatâ€™s one new way you could help your family, friends, or community? (Remember that one of the hallmarks of energy is that you give more than you take from the world.)
