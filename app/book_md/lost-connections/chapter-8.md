## Chapter 8: Reconnecting to Your Past, Your Future, and a Meaningful Life

In addition to connecting with others, recovering from depression requires acknowledging past trauma, reclaiming a hopeful future. Likewise, it requires reconnecting to a sense of meaning and purpose in everyday life. Collectively changing the way we think about work is a major part of this: For most people, work takes up more waking hours than any other activity, so if work feels meaningless, it’s easy for _everything_ to feel meaningless. On top of that, we need to reconnect to deeper, meaningful values, rather than being sucked into the materialistic worldview we discussed in Chapter 5.

Note that these are all examples of the type of collective action to fight depression that we mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 7. They aren’t just individual solutions—they involve steps we can all take to help _everyone_ reconnect to their full self.

### Work Through Childhood Trauma

To heal depression, we need to reconnect to our childhood trauma by talking about it. Talking openly about childhood trauma is painful, and it’s understandable to want to avoid that pain. However, research shows that it’s not just trauma itself that causes depression—it’s the experience of keeping that trauma buried inside for years, too. In a way, opening up about past trauma is like disinfecting a wound: It’s painful in the short-term, but it saves you from an infection that would continue to cause problems down the road.

Acknowledging and working through childhood trauma can also benefit your physical health. In one study, doctors expressed empathy for patients’ childhood trauma and asked if they’d like to talk about it. As a result, patients were 35% less likely to need follow-up care for any condition. Another study offered patients the option to discuss their trauma with a therapist—those patients were 50% less likely to need follow-up medical care from a doctor.

This research is only a first step, but it builds on a history of medical research showing that bottling things up because of internalized shame can make people physically ill. For example, at the height of the AIDS crisis, openly gay men lived an average of two to three years longer than closeted gay men, even when they got the same quality of medical care.

Another important takeaway from this research is that there are ways to change the healthcare system to help _everyone_ overcome their trauma. If all doctors asked their patients about their trauma history and gave them the chance to talk about it (as they did in the study above), it could drastically improve the mental _and_ physical health of their entire communities.

### Create a Hopeful Future

To heal depression, we can’t just deal with the past—we also have to restore hope for a meaningful future. When your personal trauma history is making you depressed, that’s an individual problem with a mostly individual solution. On the other hand, the loss of a hopeful future is a collective problem caused by systemic economic inequality, so solving it requires a structural societal overhaul. Specifically, **restoring a hopeful future for everyone requires creating a social and economic safety net.** That way, even if you work an unstable job without guaranteed hours, you’ll still have at least some control over your future because there’s a base level of support that you can always count on.

#### Universal Basic Income

In the 1970s, a small town in Canada experimented with a way to break the cycle of depression caused by financial instability and give people the breathing room to think about the future. **They implemented a groundbreaking economic policy called _universal basic income_ , in which the government directly paid every citizen the bare minimum they needed to survive** (in today’s money, roughly $19,000 U.S. each). The money was guaranteed, with no hoops to jump through and no strings attached. The government hoped that removing the burden of constantly worrying about having enough money to survive would translate to improved community health.

After three years, a new conservative government took office and immediately shut down the experiment, and the results weren’t calculated for another 35 years. As it turned out, the experiment had been a huge success even in its short run. School retention and performance improved, parents took longer parental leaves to care for their newborns, and those babies had significantly healthier birth weights.

The effects were especially powerful for women. Before universal income, women faced enormous barriers to higher education—they were expected to be full-time family caregivers, which left little time to pursue schooling. However, with guaranteed income, not only could they pay tuition, but they could afford the cost of childcare for their children while they were in school. Armed with a degree, those women were then able to secure higher-paying jobs and ultimately create generational wealth for their families.

The experiment also had a powerful impact on community mental health, **including a 9% drop in hospitalizations for depression and anxiety during that time**. That result makes sense given that universal basic income attacks multiple causes of depression simultaneously. When you’re not constantly worried about money, you not only regain a sense of the future—the financial security of a basic income also gives you the freedom to turn down jobs that make you miserable and seek out meaningful work.

Other communities around the world have replicated this experiment with similar positive results. For example, **a Native American tribe saw a 40% decrease in childhood behavioral and mental health problems after implementing a universal basic income** because parents had more time to focus on their children. A guaranteed income removed the need to be constantly working. The results of that study are especially impressive because the universal income was only $6000 to $9000 per year—not enough to live on, but enough to take some pressure off of working families.

These early results are promising in terms of improving public mental health. They also suggest something about the nature of mental illness: If depression and anxiety were truly biological brain disorders that strike randomly and indiscriminately, they wouldn’t be so closely correlated with poverty levels, and financial security wouldn’t do anything to alleviate them. Clearly, social and environmental factors hold a huge influence over the development of these diseases.

##### Objections to Universal Basic Income

Despite this promising research, many people see universal basic income as a radical, amoral, and completely unfeasible idea. Here’s how experts in the field respond to the three most common objections to universal basic income:

  1. **“It will make people lazy—they’ll just watch Netflix all day.”** If you ask people what _they_ would do with a guaranteed income, almost everyone says they would pursue a dream, like finishing a degree or starting a business. In other words, most people have ambitions beyond Netflix. 
  2. **“No one _wants_ to scrub floors, but it has to be done. If people don’t need the money, nobody will take those types of jobs.”** That’s true, but it’s a good thing. It means employers in service industries will have to provide higher pay and better benefits to attract workers—in other words, they’d have to start valuing their employees as human beings.
  3. **“It’s expensive.”** This is the most common criticism of universal basic income, and it’s a valid concern. However, the evidence from early studies suggests that a basic income could actually _save_ government money in the long run. Economists and public health experts agree: Universal basic income is ultimately less expensive than providing healthcare for all the physical and mental illnesses caused by constant financial stress, lack of access to resources, and poor work environments. 



### Create Democratic Workplaces

As well as reconnecting with your past and future, healing from depression requires you to reconnect with meaning and purpose in your present: in particular, to reconnect to meaningful work. Being forced to work at a job you hate just to pay the bills is a surefire recipe for depression—but when job prospects are limited and rent is due, quitting a soul-sucking job isn’t an option for most people. For that reason, this reconnection isn’t an individual suggestion, since individual action isn’t always possible: Instead, it’s a call to reexamine the way we think about work as a society so that everyone can make a living without becoming depressed.

One way to do this is through democratic cooperatives like Baltimore Bicycle Works. This bike shop is collectively owned by a group of friends whose mission was to break out of the typical boss-as-dictator business model and find a way to reclaim control of their livelihoods.

The actual, day-to-day work of the business isn’t too different from that of a “traditional” bike shop—mechanics still fix bikes, office workers still handle paperwork. The key difference is that the shop’s co-op model works like any democracy: Employees elect leaders, make decisions, and share profits as a group. **The lack of hierarchy means that anyone can propose an idea without worrying about stepping on anyone’s toes, and everyone’s opinion counts.** This kind of work model provides reconnections to meaningful work (because everyone has control over their jobs) _and_ to positive social status (because everyone’s opinion matters).

Starting an innovative new business is risky, but the Baltimore Bicycle Works is a success, both financially and as proof that the co-op model creates a more meaningful work experience. **Having a sense of control over the shop makes all the difference to the employees’ mental health.** Everyone working in the shop is happier and less anxious overall than in their previous, traditional jobs: They no longer feel like work is something “done to” them, and they don’t have to worry about their livelihood depending on the whims of whoever’s in charge. The sense of control also restores a balance between effort and reward: Everyone shares in the shop’s profits equally, so everyone is motivated to work hard and make the business succeed.

The Baltimore Bicycle Works model doesn’t just improve employees’ mental health: **The business is more successful overall than similar shops with traditional top-down models of leadership.** Nothing is siloed—if one person encounters a problem, the entire team can help solve it instead of letting that person flounder alone. Like any workplace, they have occasional arguments or off days, but overall, the co-op model could be the solution to work-induced misery.

### Curb Materialism

Reconnecting to meaningful work is important, but when we’re inundated with harmful, materialist messages the moment we step outside of the office, it’s hard for those positive effects to carry over. For this reason, the second thing we must do to reconnect to a meaningful life is to curb materialism and reduce its impact on our lives.

While we all know that materialist culture is contributing to the rise in depression rates, most of us don’t have the individual freedom to completely shut out commercial culture by moving to the countryside and ignoring all advertising. Instead, to tackle materialism, we need to take collective action to reframe how, on a societal level, we think about “stuff.”

#### Advertising Makes Us Miserable

As we discussed in Chapter 5, the biggest culprit in the rise of materialism is advertising, which tells us that we “need” certain products in order to be successful, fit in, and be happy. **One approach to stop this cycle of depression is to ban advertising altogether.** It may seem like a radical step, but several countries have banned different types of advertising with encouraging results. In Brazil, the city of São Paulo banned all forms of outdoor advertising in 2007 with the widely popular “Clean City Law”—now, 70% of residents believe it’s made the city a better place to live.

#### Refocus on Intrinsic Motivations

Advertising bans can create a healthier environment for future generations, but they can take years to implement. In the meantime, **a focused, collective effort to spend time and money on the things that _actually_ make us happy can boost self-esteem and fight off materialism-induced depression.**

One experiment in Minneapolis paved the way for this type of intervention. A group of sixty parents and their teenage children met regularly with a financial advisor to discuss their family’s relationship to money and materialism (a separate group of parents and their children served as a control group and didn’t participate in discussions). Over the course of three months, the advisor guided them through a series of exercises designed to help them reconnect to their values:

  * First, the advisor asked everyone in the group to write down **what money means to them.** For most people, money was a source of constant stress because there never seemed to be enough. 
  * Second, the participants broke up into smaller groups to talk about **why they spent money in the ways they did.** Aside from necessities like food and rent, many people in the group said that they bought things as a status symbol or to distract themselves when they felt miserable. 
  * Third, the advisor asked the group to**list their most important values** —things like being honest or taking care of others. For many people, reflecting on the gap between how they spend money and what they really value was the first step to reframing their relationship with materialism. 
  * Fourth, everyone in the group **described their experience with finally buying something after wanting it for a long time**. Almost everyone described the excitement leading up to the purchase, followed by the faint disappointment of getting the item home and realizing that the feelings of loneliness or insecurity that prompted the purchase were still there. 
  * Fifth, the advisor asked the group to **list their intrinsic motivations—things they would happily do for free if money were no issue** , like spending more time with their children or playing a musical instrument just for the joy of it.
  * Finally—and most importantly—**the advisor challenged the group to act on those intrinsic motivations** , in whatever small ways they could. Group members helped keep each other accountable and encouraged each other to make choices that aligned with their values instead of their desire for “stuff.”



Social scientists tested the participants’ materialism and self-esteem at the start of the study and then again after the three-month intervention. The results were groundbreaking: The group who dug into their money habits and refocused on their values (rather on spending for status or emotional reasons) had **significantly lower levels of materialism and significantly higher self-esteem than the control group**. This suggests that, with group support, it’s possible to resist the barrage of depressing messages from a materialistic culture.
