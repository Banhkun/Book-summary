## Part 3 | Chapter 7: Reconnecting to Others

As we’ve seen, there is strong scientific evidence for social and environmental causes of depression, like Adverse Childhood Events, separation from nature, and a lack of control over your working life. All of this evidence points to one thing: **If biology isn’t the only problem causing depression, then medication shouldn’t be the only solution to it**.

Part 3 of this summary uses examples from all over the world to illustrate non-pharmaceutical forms of antidepressants. Hari calls these ideas “reconnections” because they can help us bridge the disconnections that contribute to depression. Many of these ideas seem radically new, but for the most part, they are actually a return to the way people lived their lives for most of human history.

As you read these sections, keep in mind that many of these strategies aren’t designed to be implemented individually. There _are_ some remedies you can try on your own (like getting to know your neighbors or practicing loving-kindness meditation), but many more involve widespread social changes that require banding together with others and demanding policy changes that will improve _everyone’s_ mental health on a societal level.

Furthermore, these reconnections are only the beginning of a new wave of innovative treatments for depression. Research on most of these ideas is still in the early stages, and there are probably many more ways to improve our collective mental health than are mentioned here. But these strategies offer a hopeful bridge across the disconnections that are making us so miserable—so they’re a pretty good place to start.

In this section, we’ll explore ways to reconnect with others, with your own past and future, and to a meaningful life. We’ll begin with three concrete strategies for reconnecting to others—building genuine relationships, letting go of the ego, and social prescribing.

### Build Genuine Relationships

In an increasingly digital world, many of our connections are superficial and don’t allow for meaningful connection, leading to loneliness and, ultimately, depression. To heal that depression, we need to build genuine relationships based on vulnerability and mutual support that restore us to our natural, healthy state as social animals living in close-knit communities.

#### Self-Care vs. Communal Care

One way to build such relationships and benefit from the healing power of connection is to engage in communal care: helping others around us, and receiving help ourselves in turn. Right now, the fatal flaw in depression treatment is that, as a society, we think of it as an individual endeavor. If you’re sick, you go to a doctor who gives you pills that make you better—nobody else needs to be involved. But as we’ve seen, **depression is _not_ just an individual issue. **The societal structures that got us into this mess weren’t created by one person, and it will take a communal effort to reshape them into something new and soothe our collective depression.

The idea that depression is a personal issue that should be dealt with alone is a symptom of Western individualist values. Western culture values individual liberty over collective health—if you’re struggling, it’s your own fault; if you want to get better, it’s your own responsibility. We see happiness as an individual thing, so we address it on an individual level. We engage in “self-care” and read books from the “self-help” section—and we’re still miserable.

That’s a direct contrast to Asian collectivist cultures that value the wellbeing of the community over the wellbeing of particular individuals. Success and failure are shared with the group—when one person struggles, everyone struggles, and when the group succeeds, everyone succeeds. **That’s why, in Asian countries, if you set out to make yourself happy, you'll most likely engage in _communal_ care because you see your happiness as intrinsically tied to the happiness of your community. **You’ll focus on making life better for other people, knowing that increasing their happiness will ultimately increase your own.

Collectivist approaches to depression actually _work_. Focusing on others forces your attention out of your own head and creates the mental breathing room you need to genuinely connect with a community. Depression creates an ego-centric worldview— _you’re_ unhappy, _you_ don’t feel good enough, _you’re_ not getting what you need—so countering that narrative by focusing on the _group_ is more powerful than looking for a quick fix on your own.

#### Case Study: Amish Communities

When it comes to resisting the pull of individualism and embracing collective living, we can learn a lot from the Amish. In Amish communities, everything is shared. Unrelated neighbors consider each other “family,” and every adult takes responsibility for helping to raise children in the community. **People don’t see their family’s house as “home” because the entire community is “home.”** That’s the main reason the Amish eschew modern transportation—not using cars means they are always “at home,” or close to it, because home is an entire community contained within the circle of how far you can travel by horse and buggy.

What makes Amish people especially unique is that they have freely and consciously chosen to give up modern convenience in order to focus on their community. All Amish young people leave the community for two years to go on Rumspringa, where they live in modern cities and are free to use technology, drink alcohol, and fully experience the wider world. At the end of this period, they can choose whether to rejoin their home community. Those who decide to maintain the Amish lifestyle do so because to them, the novelty of the modern world is a distraction from what really matters—a fully connected community.

Obviously, the Amish way of life is an extreme approach, and not one that can or should be used on a grand scale. It also has serious downsides, like the entrenched sexism and homophobia in Amish communities. However, studying Amish collectivism still offers valuable lessons—lessons that can be applied in communities that look nothing like Amish farmland, like the Kotti neighborhood in Germany.

#### Case Study: The Kotti Neighborhood Protest

The Kotti neighborhood was once a West Berlin peninsula bordered on three sides by the Berlin Wall. Being nearly surrounded by Soviet-controlled East Berlin terrified local residents and led to a mass exodus from the area. By 2011, Kotti was almost solely populated by people who faced ostracism in other parts of Berlin—Turkish immigrants, left-wing activists, and gay people. These radically different groups made uneasy neighbors and were deeply distrustful of one another.

Hari jokingly refers to Kotti as “Berlin’s Bronx” because of the proliferation of housing projects. But after the Berlin Wall came down and the threat of Soviet invasion passed, the rock bottom property values in Kotti began to skyrocket as developers snatched up the now-safe available real estate. The cost of rent rose dramatically until **most residents were spending more than half their monthly income on rent alone.**

In the midst of this chaos, an elderly Turkish-German woman (Nuriye Cengiz) living in Kotti was facing eviction because she couldn’t afford the most recent rent increase. As an elderly, disabled immigrant with no close family nearby, Nuriye had nowhere else to go and felt that suicide was her only option. She hung a note in her window explaining to her neighbors that she intended to kill herself before the police arrived to forcibly remove her.

For the first time, her neighbors began to reach out. They empathized with Nuriye’s despair—the endless rent increases were slowly pushing them to their limits, too. No one recommended that Nuriye see a psychiatrist because they understood that despair was a reasonable reaction to the circumstances they were all facing. That part is crucial: **Kotti residents recognized that their shared depression was a _collective_ issue, not an individual one. **

In response to Nuriye’s announcement, her neighbors reached across the ideological divide between them and decided to fight back against the rent hikes and evictions. They formed a makeshift protest camp and blocked a major street. The residents each took shifts guarding the camp to prevent the police from tearing it down overnight, working in randomly-assigned pairs. Elderly Muslims teamed up with single mothers in mini skirts while teenage punks paired with retired Communists—all under an umbrella donated by a local gay bar. Nuriye became the center of a strong community of people who genuinely cared for one another. She no longer felt that she had to face her problems alone, and her depression and suicidality began to heal.

##### A Model for Communal Care

After decades of living just steps away from each other but never interacting, the residents of Kotti reconnected under a common purpose. When they welcomed a homeless protester named Tuncai into the community, residents brought him food and clothing—in return, Tuncai kept the camp spotless and gave out encouraging hugs.

Eventually, the owner of the gay bar hired Tuncai in a paid position. Unfortunately, this stability didn’t last. Tuncai’s go-to solution for anyone who seemed unhappy was to hug them—so when police officers showed up to the camp and appeared to get angry, Tuncai tried to hug an officer and was immediately arrested.

The Kotti protesters immediately rallied to find Tuncai and bring him back. When the police refused to give them any information, the residents tracked Tuncai down on their own. They discovered that he’d been locked up in a psychiatric institution, and that he’d spent much of his life in similar institutions before escaping and becoming part of the Kotti community.

For eight solid weeks, huge groups of residents consistently stormed the offices of the facility holding Tuncai to demand his release while others put together official petitions and gathered signatures. The Berlin authorities had never seen that kind of dedication—most people in the facility didn’t have a strong social network to fight for them.

Eventually, the authorities agreed to release Tuncai on the condition that he had a job and a place to live. The community signed off on these demands easily, but they saw them as only the first, tiny step: What Tuncai needed most was the type of community the Kotti residents had found through their protests. He needed a group of people who genuinely cared about him to act as a safety net.

The Kotti protesters’ efforts to free Tuncai are a model for the type of social connections we all need in order to thrive. Before the protests, Tuncai was homeless both physically and emotionally: He had no safe place to live, and no one to make meaningful connections with. Like Nuriye, **his situation was a pressure cooker for depression, but what he needed wasn’t a prescription: Instead, he needed basic shelter, a secure source of food, and a place to belong.** If every depressed person had those basic necessities, our cultural approach to chemical antidepressants would change drastically.

### Let Go of Your Ego

The second strategy for reconnection to others is letting go of your ego and focusing on others rather than your own struggles. This is especially hard because individualist Western culture operates on the assumption of scarcity: There is not enough to go around, so the only way to succeed is to focus on your own needs and compete with other people—even for clearly unlimited resources like intelligence. This constant egocentric competition and self-interest fuels depression, but there is an antidote to it: a technique called “sympathetic joy.”

#### Sympathetic Joy

As the name implies, sympathetic joy is the practice of feeling genuine, untainted happiness for other people. You won’t master the skill overnight, but if you’re willing to practice it, it can significantly improve your life. To try it for yourself, follow the steps below, spending at least 15 minutes following them each day:

  1. First, imagine something wonderful happening to you, like falling in love or winning an award. In your mind, picture all the details of that moment. Let yourself feel the joy you’d feel in that moment until it almost feels like that picture is really happening right now.
  2. Now, think about someone you love, and imagine something happening to them that makes them feel that same profound happiness. Focus on their joy—and then let it fill you up with that same powerful feeling. The goal is to feel as genuinely happy _for them_ as you would feel if _you_ were the one experiencing a joyful moment. 
  3. Next, repeat this process while picturing someone you see often but don’t know very well, like a neighbor you’ve never officially met. Picture them feeling powerfully happy, and try to feel happy that they’re experiencing that joy. 
  4. This next step is tough, but don’t give up! Picture someone you don’t like, or who you have a conflict with. Imagine them feeling truly, profoundly happy, and try to feel equally joyful that _they’re_ joyful. This takes a lot of practice, so don’t worry if you can’t muster that feeling right away—just focus on the image of them feeling happy and try to wish them well.
  5. The final step is the real gauntlet: Picture someone you actively despise, and push yourself to feel really, genuinely happy for them. It may feel impossible, even after weeks of daily practice, but that’s normal. Keep practicing—over time, that active hatred will start to lose steam, and you may even be able to feel truly happy for that person’s happiness. That doesn’t mean you agree with them or even like them—but you’re no longer consumed with negative feelings. 



Studies show that this kind of meditation has all kinds of mental health benefits, including reducing jealousy and increasing compassion in practical ways (which makes it easier to make the social connections everyone needs). Even better, training your body to produce a rush of joy whenever you see someone else succeed **connects you to an unlimited source of happiness.** At any given moment, someone, somewhere, is feeling profoundly happy. If you seek out those people and allow yourself to share their joy, you can conjure a genuine sense of happiness even when your own life feels especially dark.

#### Parallels to Psychedelic Research

As we’ve just noted, deep, sustained meditation practice similar to that outlined above can be a powerful treatment for depression. The downside to meditation, however, is that it can take months or even years of practice to become skilled enough to reap those benefits. So, in the 1950s, scientists started the search for a faster way than meditation to dissolve the ego and reconnect to other people. They started the first official research into the clinical effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD (which was legal at that time) with extremely promising results. Those early studies showed that psychedelics could have all kinds of benefits for mental health, from helping people break lifelong addictions to healing chronic depression.

Unfortunately, a wave of anti-drug hysteria in the United States led to a total ban on LSD in the late 1960s, shutting down psychedelic research programs before they could follow up on those promising early results. Research on the mental health benefits of psychedelics didn’t pick up again until a single study in the 1990s, this time using psilocybin (the psychedelic chemical found in “magic” mushrooms). Modern medical research involves much stricter controls than in the 60s, so researchers spent months preparing participants before administering the drug in a series of guided, graded exposures. After taking the drug, many participants had deep revelations about long-suppressed trauma and described it as a “spiritual experience.”

Once again, the results were almost universally positive—**nearly 80% of participants said the experiment was one of the five most important events in their lives.** That study opened the door for a modern wave of psychedelics research. It’s still in the early stages, but preliminary studies show that psilocybin is remarkably effective at treating depression and anxiety. It’s also more consistently effective for helping people quit smoking than any other treatment on the market. These results are correlated with the intensity of the spiritual experience a person has: Somehow, a powerful, mystical experience dissolves the ego as effectively as deep meditation.

### Use Social Prescribing

In addition to building genuine relationships and practicing sympathetic joy, social prescribing can be a powerful way to reconnect with other people. **Social prescribing is a practice in the medical field in which doctors can prescribe a range of structured social connections as a treatment for depression** in addition to psychiatric drugs. To make this possible, doctors and medical facilities join forces with social workers, volunteer programs, and behavioral health programs that provide opportunities for people to form social connections in a supported, low-pressure environment.

Social prescribing has the potential to revolutionize mental healthcare by integrating social treatments for depression directly into patients’ medical treatment plans. To illustrate this, imagine you visit your doctor because you’ve been struggling with depression. Traditionally, she would only be able to prescribe medication and possibly recommend seeing a therapist. In terms of the biopsychosocial model, she’d only have the power to directly address part of the problem—the biological aspect. The rest, you’re left to tackle on your own.

In contrast, **social prescribing would give doctors back the power to fully care for their patients’ health** by prescribing treatments that work on the biological, psychological, _and_ social levels. If your doctor practices social prescribing, you’d leave the appointment with prescriptions for two antidepressants: one in the form of a pill, and one in the form of, for example, an invitation to join a volunteer project focused on turning an empty lot into a community garden.

Anecdotal data suggests that social prescribing can be a powerful remedy for depression, but there is little formal research that specifically analyzes these programs—most likely because research requires funding, and pharmaceutical companies are the largest source of funding for research on mental illness. These companies have no interest in funding research on social prescribing because it is a major threat to the medical model that they rely on to make a profit.

**Social prescribing threatens drug company profits because it addresses _all_ the causes of depression.** If you treat the underlying causes of mental illness, the need for drugs to act as a bandaid eventually goes away, and the number of people taking psychiatric medication as a long-term solution would drop dramatically. But if you only treat the biological component of depression, most people won’t get better, so they’ll keep buying newer and more powerful versions of the drugs.

#### Case Study: The Bromley-by-Bow Center

To see what social prescribing looks like in action, Hari visited the Bromley-by-Bow Center in East London. The doctors at Bromley-by-Bow fully embrace social prescribing. They don’t claim to be “experts” in treating depression because they understand that the causes of depression are deeply personal, and that the biological aspect that they were trained to treat is only one piece of the puzzle. These doctors take the time to really get to know their patients—to ask “What matters _to_ you?” instead of “What’s the matter _with_ you?” That relationship informs every aspect of their treatment plan.

The doctors at Bromley-by-Bow can and do prescribe pharmaceutical antidepressants, but they think of them as only a first step—**if depression is a bullet wound, then antidepressants are just the bandage that stops the bleeding.** Once the patient’s immediate pain is addressed, doctors can treat the underlying issues contributing to their depression by prescribing one of over one hundred different structured social programs. These programs are deliberately designed to help depressed people connect to others, primarily through group volunteering.

You may wonder: Why volunteering, rather than, say, a support group, or maybe a sports team? There are two reasons for this. **First, while support groups have their place, they require people to talk about the traumatic experiences that are making them miserable,** which can feel impossible for people in the middle of a deep depression. The volunteer programs at Bromley-by-Bow avoid that hurdle while still providing the type of structured support that a support group would provide.

**Second, volunteering with a group provides more than just social reconnection**. Doing something to help others also provides a reconnection with meaningful work. Furthermore, caring for others can increase a person’s sense of status and respect, and some forms of volunteering (like urban gardening) can provide reconnection with the natural world.
