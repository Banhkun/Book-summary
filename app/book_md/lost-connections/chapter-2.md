## Chapter 2: The Arguments Against Antidepressants

Now that we’ve explored the history of the medical and biopsychosocial models, let’s examine the arguments against antidepressants: the golden standard of treatment in the medical model.

Before you dive into this chapter, remember that Hari’s goal is not to talk anyone into or out of taking antidepressants—it’s to make us question the way we think about depression and the societal conditions that contribute to it. Chemical antidepressants _do_ work for a small minority of people, and Hari stresses that the information in _Lost Connections_ is not medical advice. Going off these medications can cause severe physical withdrawal symptoms, so if you do decide to stop taking antidepressants, talk to your doctor first. They can help you create a plan to reduce your dosage gradually and minimize withdrawal symptoms.

In this section, we’ll discuss the lack of evidence for the “chemical imbalance” that forms the foundation of the medical model of depression and see how psychiatry itself undermined that idea with the former “grief exception” in the DSM. Then, we’ll discuss why pharmaceutical antidepressants continue to be so popular (and can still be legally sold at all) despite the evidence that most people feel relief from a placebo effect, not the drug itself.

### Treating an “Imbalance” That May Not Exist

By the 1970s, new pharmaceutical technology allowed scientists to test the idea that serotonin was the specific cause of euphoria in patients given the failed tuberculosis drug. They tested this theory using a drug designed to lower serotonin levels in the brain. If healthy serotonin levels are the true key to happiness, then lowering the level of serotonin in someone’s brain should cause them to become depressed. However, in the study, this didn’t happen. **For the vast majority of people in the experiment, the serotonin-lowering drug didn’t alter their mood _at all_. **Further studies showed that **decreasing serotonin has the same, tiny effect on the brain as _increasing_ serotonin. **Scientists moved on to do similar tests on other neurotransmitters (like norepinephrine and dopamine), only to get the exact same results.

The chemical imbalance theory as a whole started to fall apart. If depression is truly caused by an imbalance in the brain, then either resolving or increasing that imbalance should have created different results; either decreasing or increasing depression levels. However, it didn’t, suggesting the whole hypothesis is false. In spite of this, most modern antidepressants are still designed to address imbalances by raising serotonin.

#### The Grief Exception

Another piece of evidence that calls the medical model into question is the former existence of the “grief exception,” which prohibited psychiatrists from giving someone an official diagnosis of depression if they were grieving the loss of a loved one. The exception (sometimes called the “bereavement exclusion”) was a caveat to the official diagnostic criteria for depression, which are laid out in the official manual for diagnosing mental health conditions known as the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual_ (DSM).

The grief exception existed because grief and depression have nearly identical symptoms,**** to the point that people who are grieving a recent loss usually meet the official diagnostic criteria for depression in the DSM. Without context about a person’s life or recent losses, even a skilled psychiatrist might not be able to tell grief and depression apart based on symptoms alone. The exception gave psychiatrists a way to officially recognize that grief is a normal response to loss, not a biological illness, and that the symptoms of grief are situational—even when they’re indistinguishable from the symptoms of depression. In other words, **the official medical rulebook of the psychiatric profession acknowledged that external life events— _not_ just biology—can cause _all_ the symptoms of clinical depression.**

There was a time limit on this “normal” grief—in the original version, you could grieve for one year without being considered depressed, but after that you were subject to a diagnosis that there was something medically “wrong” with you. Later editions slashed that time limit down gradually until 2013, when the newly-released DSM 5 eliminated the grief exception entirely.

Psychiatrists decided to remove the grief exception because its existence raised uncomfortable questions about the biological model of depression. By including the exception, psychiatrists were admitting that something that looks a lot like depression, having exactly the same symptoms as it, could be caused by a person's life circumstances—not just by their brain chemistry.

This opened up discussions about the causes of depression as a whole. If, in the case of grief, we can acknowledge that a person's situation, not their biology, triggers depression symptoms, **couldn’t this be the case for all depressed people who’ve experienced a terrible event?** Consider depressed people who've gone through traumatic breakups or financial struggles: Could _their_ depression symptoms have been triggered by their awful circumstances, too, rather than their brain chemistry?

Removing the grief exception allowed psychiatrists to simply ignore these questions and continue to promote the biological model of depression. The elimination of the exception means that if someone loses their spouse or sibling or child on Tuesday, they can be diagnosed with (and prescribed medication for) a mental health disorder on Wednesday. The only remaining evidence of the grief exception is a footnote encouraging providers to use “clinical judgment” based on an individual's circumstances.

### The Placebo Effect

The widespread belief that antidepressant drugs are a cure-all is partly due to the placebo effect. The idea behind the placebo effect is that every medical treatment actually has two parts: the treatment itself and the story that goes with it. For example, when you take medicine for a headache, you don’t just swallow a pill—you swallow a story about how that particular medicine can cure headaches. **Your _belief_ in the power of the treatment can sometimes create the same physical results as the treatment itself.** So even if that headache medicine is actually an inert sugar pill, your headache may very well disappear.

When someone’s symptoms improve as a result of a placebo, the improvement isn’t “all in their head”—**placebos can create real, measurable changes in the body, like reducing inflammation or curing stomach ulcers.** During World War II, an American doctor even used the placebo effect to operate on wounded soldiers without painkillers. The overwhelmed clinic had run out of morphine, so the doctor improvised and gave patients a saltwater drip that he told them was morphine. He then successfully performed surgery without the soldiers howling in pain or going into physical shock—which should be impossible without painkillers.

#### The Placebo Effect and Antidepressants

In the 1990s, Dr. Irving Kirsch and his research team set out to unravel just how big a role the placebo effect plays in antidepressant success rates. They conducted a meta-analysis of every published study of antidepressants, comparing the results of three groups across every study: a treatment group (that got the real medication), a placebo group (that got a sugar pill), and a control group (that got no pill at all). The control group was critical—it made it possible to calculate what percentage of people would get better on their own, with no drug and no story.

By accounting for natural healing and the placebo effect, Kirsch and his team were able to calculate exactly how much the actual chemicals in antidepressants were affecting people. The results were shocking: **only 25% of the positive effects of antidepressants were due to the chemicals themselves.** Natural recovery accounted for another 25%, and the additional 50% came down to the placebo effect. Researchers tested and retested this data and got the same answer every time: **most of the relief people feel when taking antidepressants doesn’t come from the actual drug.**

#### What’s the Harm as Long as It Works?

Some people argue that the fact the placebo effect is responsible for most of the positive effects of antidepressants doesn’t mean that antidepressants aren’t useful or that the relief they provide isn’t real. It just means that the brain is providing most of that relief all by itself simply thanks to a person’s belief in the drug’s impact, without requiring the chemical boost of the drug. Therefore, they argue, what’s the harm in continuing to prescribe anti-depressants if they do give people relief—even if that relief doesn’t occur for the reason we’d expect?

Arguably, the harm in continuing to prescribe these drugs comes from their side effects. **The side effects of antidepressant drugs are very real and come from the chemicals themselves, not a placebo effect**. In general, these effects include weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. Certain groups are even more at risk: For young people, antidepressants increase the risk of suicide; for older people, they increase the risk of stroke; for pregnant people, they increase the risk of miscarriage and birth defects. That’s a very serious set of risks for a drug that only really provides a placebo effect.

### Antidepressant Effects Don’t Last

Another argument against chemical antidepressants is that even when they create an initial boost in mood, those effects don’t last more than a few months (and may be due to the placebo effects of trying a promising new medicine). Researchers have studied this in many ways, always with similar results.

For example, the Star-D Trial in the 1990s tracked people who visited their doctor and were prescribed an antidepressant. Within the first few months, a promising 67% of patients felt relief from their depression symptoms. But after a year on the drugs, half the people who felt initial relief were depressed again, while only 33% of patients made a full recovery while taking antidepressants. However, without a control group, it’s impossible to say how many of those patients would have recovered on their own—so the real number who found lasting relief from antidepressants is likely even lower.

### Pharmaceutical Companies Control the Research

One final argument against chemical antidepressants is that they may not be as effective as pharmaceutical companies claim they are. The reason for this is that in the United States, **pharmaceutical companies control every step of the drug research and development process.**

In order to get a drug on the market in the United States, pharmaceutical companies have to produce two separate trials that show _some_ positive effects—no matter how small. These trials are run by the companies themselves (or by scientists whose research they fund), not by independent researchers, which means the people conducting the research have a vested interest in the drugs appearing to work (even when that’s not exactly true).

Furthermore, companies can run as many trials as they like in order to get those two positive results. So**if a company runs 500 trials of a drug and finds no positive effects in 498 of those tests, that drug can still go into production** based on the two trials where it showed even a tiny positive result.

On top of this, drug companies aren’t required to publish the results from those failed trials. This creates a serious publication bias. When independent researchers want to look at the data about a drug for themselves, they only see a fraction of the real picture—just the times the drug was successful, not the times that it wasn’t. Even the most objective evaluator is going to come to the conclusion that these drugs work if that’s the only data available to her.

Eventually, the results of drug trials are evaluated by a group of regulators, who decide whether the drug is safe enough to be released. This should mean that independent eyes—who have no vested interest in the outcome—objectively evaluate the data and decide whether the drug is safe and effective enough to release. The catch? In the United States, drug companies pay 40% of the regulators’ salaries; in the United Kingdom, they pay 100%. **In other words, every single link in the drug production chain is controlled by someone who stands to make a profit if the drug is released.** Even if a drug only works for a small percentage of people, there is always incentive to push that drug through anyway because it will bring in more profit.

### The Argument _For_ Antidepressants

Most pharmacology researchers accept the conclusion that antidepressants don’t work for most people in the long term and that short term results are often due to placebo effects. However, some scientists still strongly believe that antidepressants work the way they’re supposed to (providing long term relief for the majority of people who take them).

One of the most notable proponents of antidepressants is Dr. Peter Kramer, whose book _Listening to Prozac_ is one of the best-selling books on antidepressants ever written. Kramer disagrees with Dr. Irving Kirsch’s idea that antidepressants aren’t helpful for most people. Kramer has three main arguments against the evidence, all of which were refuted by Dr. Kirsch after further research.

**1) The clinical trials that the research is based on weren’t long enough**. This is a valid critique—most clinical trials lasted four to eight weeks, but antidepressants don’t work that quickly. It takes time for the chemicals to build up in the body and start taking effect, which is why most people taking antidepressants don’t feel the full effects of the medication for at least eight weeks. To see the true effectiveness of the drug, we need long term data.

Kirsch’s team agreed with this point and went back to the data to isolate only those trials that lasted more than eight weeks. There were only two, which isn’t enough to make a definitive conclusion, but the antidepressants were no more effective than the placebos in those trials (in one, the placebo did even _better_ than the drug). More long term studies need to be done to confirm this, but so far, the conclusion still holds.

**2) Kirsch’s data analysis combined studies on both moderately and severely depressed people.** As a practicing psychiatrist, Kramer has personally witnessed severely depressed people make incredible recoveries on antidepressants. He concedes that the effects might not be as strong for moderately depressed people—so when the two groups are lumped together, the moderately depressed people’s results are obscuring the true effects of the drug.

When Kirsch reanalyzed his data, he found that only one of the studies he originally included looked at people with moderate depression. Every single other study looked exclusively at severely depressed people. Removing the one study on moderate depression didn’t change the results.

**3) Clinical trials are invalid by default because people self-select into them.** This is Kramer’s biggest argument and is based on his personal experience of supervising drug trials. To be part of a drug trial, participants need to have a diagnosis of _only_ depression (with no comorbid conditions) and be willing to take experimental medication for very little pay—usually between $40 and $75. People who agree to that arrangement are essentially volunteering to sacrifice their time and potentially their safety for free medical care and a small monetary reward. These are people who probably have few other options to get the care they need, and who are willing to say whatever they think researchers want to hear in order to keep getting care.

This is a crucial point, and one that Kirsch fully agrees with, although he comes to a different conclusion. Kramer argues that the reliance on self-selection makes all clinical trials fundamentally invalid and claims this means Kirsch’s arguments are based on data from bad science. But this point is self-defeating: **If _all_ the studies Kirsch analyzed were fundamentally flawed, that must include the studies that drug companies used to satisfy safety regulations.** If we have no valid scientific evidence that these drugs are safe, they aren’t actually legal to sell and therefore shouldn’t be used.
