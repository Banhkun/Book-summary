## Chapter 4: Disconnections From Your Past and Future

In addition to disconnections from other people, being disconnected from your own trauma history and from a sense of a hopeful future can both cause depression, too.

### Disconnection From Past Trauma

It may seem counterintuitive that being _dis_ connected from past trauma could cause depression: If you’re _not_ thinking about the terrible things that happened to you, shouldn’t you be happy? However, trauma affects us in powerful ways, many of which operate subconsciously—in other words, just because you’re not thinking or talking about the trauma doesn’t mean it’s not still impacting your life and contributing to depression, even decades later. Childhood trauma is one of the most reliable predictors of adult depression, and fully processing that trauma by facing it head-on is a powerful way to begin healing depression.

Scientists still don’t know exactly how childhood trauma causes adult depression, but Hari has his own theory based on the fact that people who experienced trauma as a child often irrationally blame themselves for what happened. He argues that this impulse starts out as a coping mechanism—**when kids experience trauma, blaming themselves is a way of taking back control.** In the short term, that sense of control is a relief—especially when the alternative is feeling totally powerless in a big, scary world—but in the long run, the false idea that the trauma was their fault and that they deserved what happened creates a deep emotional wound.

#### The Trauma-Obesity Link

Researchers didn’t discover the link between childhood trauma and adult outcomes until the 1980s. The discovery itself was the accidental product of a completely unrelated study on obesity. In that study, Dr. Vincent Felitti put people who were dangerously overweight on a medically supervised extreme diet. Most people did lose weight, but there was a catch: Those who lost the _most_ weight also started experiencing intense anxiety and depression. Many of them dropped out of the program and quickly put all the weight back on.

Instead of simply moving on without these participants, Felitti reached out to them to ask what happened—why would they suddenly run away when they’d already achieved so much? In a series of interviews, he discovered that **almost all of these participants first began to put on weight after experiencing abuse as a child.** They’d gained weight as a subconscious attempt to protect themselves from feeling that vulnerable again. The extra weight provided a sense of security in three ways:

  1. For women in particular, **gaining weight reduced the perceived threat of sexual assault.** Traditional Western beauty standards value thin bodies over fat ones, so women who’d been assaulted in the past felt that being heavier would make them less attractive to men and therefore safe from sexual violence. 
  2. In a similar way, **carrying extra weight provided a sense of physical protection.** For example, two male prison guards in the program felt that extra weight made them look more intimidating to inmates who might get violent. Losing that weight made them feel far more vulnerable and less confident that they could defend themselves if they had to.
  3. Lastly, **being overweight lowered other people’s expectations.** After surviving abuse, many people in the program wanted to attract as little attention as possible—the fewer people who noticed them, the fewer potential threats they had to worry about. Modern culture associates large bodies with laziness and ignorance, so being overweight ensured no one would ask them to do something that might attract a spotlight.



Almost everyone who had abandoned the program and regained the weight fell into one of these categories. They’d successfully lost the weight—but when the weight was suddenly gone, so was the sense of safety that came with it.

Ultimately, Felitti realized that obesity—much like depression—doesn’t pop up randomly; it’s a symptom of a much deeper, hidden issue. In other words, treating obesity by focusing on weight loss—or treating depression without addressing childhood trauma—is like trying to put out a house fire by focusing on blowing away the smoke.

#### The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study

Another study that demonstrates the link between trauma and depression is the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study, a landmark piece of research in the connection between childhood trauma and adult outcomes (like depression, obesity, cancer, and missed work days). The original study surveyed seventeen thousand people on their experience with 10 categories of childhood trauma:

  * Emotional abuse
  * Sexual abuse
  * Physical abuse
  * Emotional neglect
  * Physical neglect
  * Mental illness
  * Substance abuse
  * Divorce 
  * Domestic violence
  * Having an incarcerated family member 



The ACE Study has been replicated all over the world, and the results are always the same: **There is a strong positive correlation between adverse childhood experiences and adult health issues.** In other words, people who had experienced ACEs were more likely to suffer from all kinds of physical, mental, and behavioral problems than people who had no ACEs. For depression and suicidality outcomes specifically, the data from the ACE study is shocking: people with seven ACEs are 3,100% more likely to attempt suicide than people with no ACEs.

Moreover, the relationship between ACEs and health problems shows a dose-response effect—**the more ACEs someone had, the more likely they were to experience negative health outcomes as an adult.** For example, a person with five categories of ACEs is more likely to experience depression as an adult than someone with two categories of ACEs, just like someone who smokes two packs of cigarettes a day is more likely to develop lung cancer than someone who only smokes occasionally.

The dose-response relationship implies that ACEs are at least partly _causing_ these outcomes. **In other words, experiencing ACEs _causes_ depression; and the more ACEs you experience, the higher your risk of being depressed as an adult. **Think of it this way: If one sleeping pill makes you feel drowsy, but two sleeping pills knock you out for hours, that’s a good sign that the pills actually work the way they’re supposed to. If they were a placebo, there might be a small difference in the effects of taking one pill versus two, but not nearly to the same degree.

#### Rewriting the Trauma Story

This disconnection is an especially difficult one for people who have believed the serotonin story their whole lives. It’s much easier to say, “I have a chemical imbalance in my brain that I treat with medication” than it is to say, “Terrible things happened to me as a child, and I’m really struggling because of them.” Moreover, in the serotonin story, there is always the gleaming hope that the right combination of medications will take the pain away entirely—and abandoning that story means abandoning the hope that there is a simple, painless solution.

Facing childhood trauma takes immense courage. It requires not only acknowledging what happened, but rewriting the story to reflect the truth: If adults in your life failed to keep you safe, that is _not_ your fault, and you did not deserve what happened. Childhood trauma leaves powerful wounds that you may have spent a lifetime covering up, and facing that trauma can be terrifying—but finding the courage to address those old wounds is the only way to truly heal this disconnection and the depression it causes.

### Disconnection From Hope for the Future

While disconnection from childhood trauma is a form of disconnection from the past, this section focuses on disconnection from the future: specifically, being unable to picture a hopeful future for yourself—or even any future at all.

You might assume that a lost sense of the future is just another _symptom_ of depression—people get depressed, so they stop planning ahead because there doesn’t seem to be a point—but **a lost sense of the future can also _cause_ depression**. Researchers confirmed this by studying indigenous First Nations groups in Canada. For generations, indigenous Canadians have suffered the same state-sanctioned abuses as Native Americans in the United States, including being forced off their ancestral land and into reservations. As a result, suicide rates were higher among First Nations people than any other group in Canada—but those suicides were clustered in only half of the 196 indigenous nations. The other half had _zero_ suicides.

The reason for that stark difference had to do with control. Until recently, the Canadian government took over control of nearly every aspect of life in indigenous communities, including schools, elected officials, and even the local language. In the last few decades, some indigenous nations have successfully reclaimed control of some of their rights; others are still completely at the mercy of the federal government. That split in nations’ degree of control maps perfectly onto the suicide data: **Nations with the most control of their own lives had the lowest suicide rates, while nations with the least control had the highest suicide rates.**

Feeling in control of your life is so important to avoiding depression because when you don’t control your life, you can’t control your future; and when you have no way to influence the future, it’s hard to picture a happy one that feels remotely attainable. If your present reality is brutal and you can’t picture a hopeful future, depression is a pretty logical response.

For people outside First Nations communities, the loss of control that leads to no hope for the future and ultimately depression takes the form of unstable work, which is far less traumatic but can still have a powerful impact on mental health. **The rise of the “gig economy” means that stable, guaranteed employment is no longer the norm.** More people than ever are working for hourly wages with no contract and no guarantee that they’ll still have a job next week, let alone next year. Without that security, it becomes impossible to picture the future, and depression sets in.
