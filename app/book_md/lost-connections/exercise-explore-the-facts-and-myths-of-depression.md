## Exercise: Explore the Facts and Myths of Depression

There’s a lot of misinformation about depression out there. Use this exercise as a chance to reflect on your exposure to those myths.

* * *

Think back: When was the first time you remember hearing about depression explicitly? What was the context? (For example, in a school health class, on television, or talking to a parent about their own experience with depression.)

Which “story” about depression did you hear? (For example, you may have been told that depression comes from a chemical imbalance, that it happens when someone goes through trauma, or even that it’s just an excuse for laziness.)

How did that story shape the way you view people with depression? If you’ve dealt with depression yourself, how did that story influence the way you thought of your own struggles?

Does the biopsychosocial model (the idea that depression comes from a combination of biology, personal psychology, and environment) change those views at all? Why or why not?
