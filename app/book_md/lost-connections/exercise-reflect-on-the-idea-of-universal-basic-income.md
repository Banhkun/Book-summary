## Exercise: Reflect on the Idea of Universal Basic Income

Universal basic income is an extremely divisive idea—some people think it could cure a whole host of societal ills, while others think it would be a moral and economic failure. Take a moment to reflect on where you stand.

* * *

Had you heard of Universal Basic Income before reading this chapter? When you first encountered the idea (here or elsewhere), what were your first reactions?

If the government implemented Universal Basic Income tomorrow, how would your life change? (For example, you might choose to go back to school or start a new business.)

How would your neighborhood or city change? (For example, would there be more businesses? Less? Would people be happier? Would it affect other social inequalities?)

Overall, what do you think of the idea of Universal Basic Income? Is there anything you’d change about it if you could?
