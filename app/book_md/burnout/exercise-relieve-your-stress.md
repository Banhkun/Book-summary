## Exercise: Relieve Your Stress

The authors explain that relieving stress is a process: You need to relieve your stress hormones, identify and manage your stressors, and take preventative measures that will make you more resilient against burnout.

* * *

Consider the techniques the authors recommend to dissipate stress hormones and write down the top three strategies that you think will work best for you. (For example, you might try exercising, screaming into a pillow, connecting with loved ones and friends, or practicing wellness exercises like measured breathing.)

Now, describe one of the stressors in your life that weighs heavily on you. Elaborate on whether this stressor is external (like a frustrating person or situation) or internal (like self-doubt or unrealistic self-expectations), and whether it’s controllable (like self-doubt) or uncontrollable (like a misogynistic coworker).

Now that you’ve identified your stressor and whether or not it’s controllable, which technique do you think will help you manage it best—making a plan, valuing the obstacle you’re facing, reevaluating your goal and measures of success, or moving on entirely? In your response, include _why_ you think this is the best option.

Finally, which of the burnout recovery tools do you think will help you become more resilient to stressors in the future? (For example, you could try getting more rest, practicing more self-compassion, relying more on your support system, or connecting to a larger purpose in life.) List two tools that you’d like to use and explain how you could incorporate them into your daily or weekly routine.
