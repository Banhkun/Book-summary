## Exercise: Generate New Perspectives

Thinking like a superforecaster requires coming up with new perspectives. Let’s practice creating multiple perspectives on a single issue.

* * *

Think of a hot-button issue that you personally don’t have strong feelings about (for example, if you’re not a sports fan, you could think about steroid use in professional athletes; if you don’t follow any particular diet, you could think about the ethics of eating meat). What would you think about this issue if you were passionately opposed to it? What would be your reasoning?

What would you think about this issue if you were a passionate supporter? What would be your reasoning?

Is there a middle ground between those opinions? What would that argument look like?

If you wanted to learn more about each of these opinions, where would you look for information? What resources could you use?
