## Chapters 9-10: Forecasting Teams and Forecaster Leaders

Tetlock and Gardner note that in forecasting tournaments, superforecasters work in teams to create forecasts. The way these teams operate can make or break their predictions. The authors argue that these outcomes are more than the sum of each team member—**efficient forecasting teams can reach a level of accuracy that no individual forecaster can reach on their own**. (Shortform note: Superforecasters are such natural team players that grouping them into teams reduces the impact of bias on their forecasts even more than specific anti-bias training does.)

In this chapter, we’ll discuss the factors that make a good forecasting team, as well as the attributes that superforecasters have that make them team players.

### The Dangers of Groupthink

Tetlock and Gardner argue that one of the biggest challenges for a successful team is to avoid _groupthink_ , or the phenomenon in which well-bonded teams gradually lose sight of critical thinking. **When groupthink takes hold, group members no longer challenge each other’s assumptions.** Instead, they unconsciously develop a shared worldview, and group members take this unanimity as a sign that the group’s conclusions must be correct.

The authors argue that groupthink usually creeps in unintentionally and can derail even the most well-intentioned teams. Teams with a strong belief in a shared mission might reinforce each other’s beliefs that support the mission and collectively ignore contradictory evidence or opinions, which can skew their forecasts.

(Shortform note: Superforecasting teams might be able to avoid groupthink in part because their collaboration happens online rather than in person. In _Quiet_ , author Susan Cain argues that teams that collaborate digitally are less likely to develop groupthink and more likely to produce quality ideas. This may be because it’s harder for one dynamic personality to steamroll the whole group while interacting online than it would be during an in-person meeting.)

### What Makes a Good Team?

Avoiding groupthink is an important part of building a successful team. According to the authors, this sets the group up for success by ensuring that each member of the group forms their own judgments independently and has an opportunity to present their thoughts to the team. This culture of openly sharing ideas is crucial for a successful superforecasting team.

To promote the free exchange of ideas, the authors believe that groups need to foster an environment that is _“psychologically safe,”_ where all team members feel comfortable voicing opinions, challenging each other respectfully, and admitting when they don’t know the answer. **For teams with leadership hierarchies, a psychologically safe environment is one in which everyone, regardless of status, feels comfortable offering constructive criticism to higher-ups without fear of repercussions.** For example, in a psychologically safe business environment, a rookie employee could comfortably challenge the boss’s idea without worrying about being fired, and a boss can comfortably say “I was wrong” without worrying about losing the respect of her employees.

(Shortform note: Most of the research on psychological safety focuses on hierarchical environments with traditional boss/employee or leader/follower structures. However, superforecasting teams are non-hierarchical because there is no designated leader—every team member is on equal footing. It’s not clear how that lack of hierarchy might change how superforecasting teams create or experience psychological safety.)

#### Active Open-Mindedness

Tetlock and Gardner argue that creating a psychologically safe environment requires **active open-mindedness**(AOM), or the deliberate pursuit of new perspectives that challenge your worldview.

Individual superforecasters tend to have above-average AOM scores. However, research shows that throwing a few high-AOM superforecasters onto a team together doesn’t necessarily create a high-AOM team. The authors argue that a team’s AOM score reflects how team members engage with one another when they disagree. **A random group of open-minded thinkers won’t be a successful team unless the group as a whole can work well together.**

(Shortform note: In _Principles: Life and Work_ , author and successful investor Ray Dalio advises cultivating open-mindedness by assuming you have certain blind spots that others don’t have. In that view, one way for a team to raise its collective AOM score is to have each member share their ideas aloud so that the group can help identify any blind spots and suggest ways to strengthen each other’s ideas.)

#### How to Create Psychological Safety

So how can group leaders create a sense of psychological safety? The authors advise starting by getting comfortable with frank, respectful discussion rather than dancing around an issue. It’s not enough to say you welcome critical feedback: Every member of the group needs to proactively ask for it from their teammates and genuinely thank those who point out flaws in their ideas. Additionally, group leaders should wait to share their opinions until the rest of the team has chimed in. That way, group members who might be hesitant to contradict the higher-ups will feel free to speak openly.

> **Other Ways to Create Psychological Safety**
> 
> As mentioned above, most of the research on increasing psychological safety assumes the group has a traditional hierarchy. In addition to soliciting critical feedback, groups without designated leaders (like superforecasting teams) may need to rely on some non-traditional strategies to promote psychological safety.
> 
> In _Trillion Dollar Coach_ , authors Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg, and Alan Eagle argue that one way to promote psychological safety is to increase the diversity of the team. This sends a clear signal to every team member that their differences are valued, which ultimately increases their confidence to voice their disagreement with other team members’ ideas.
> 
> Another way for non-hierarchical teams to create psychological safety is to prioritize group bonding. In _The Culture Code_ , author Daniel Coyle argues that laughter is a major indicator of psychological safety. Coyle believes that creating a culture of fun within the group (through structured events, casual conversations, or both) promotes bonding and increases psychological safety.

#### Givers and Takers

According to the authors, another feature of successful teams is the way they freely share resources with each other. Psychologist Adam Grant calls people who give more than they receive “givers.” He compares them to “matchers” (who give and take in equal measure) and “takers” (who take more than they give). Tetlock and Gardner argue that successful superforecasting teams tend to be stacked with givers. This creates a culture of generosity, which contributes to the feeling of psychological safety that is critical for success.

The authors believe that this culture of generosity is especially critical for superforecasting teams because they have no designated leader. Everyone has an equal share of responsibility for the team’s performance. In dysfunctional teams, the lack of structure might result in one person dominating the discussion or being saddled with most of the work. But superforecasting teams avoid these traps surprisingly well because they’re composed of equally dedicated volunteers. Everyone on the team eagerly does their part because they’re natural givers who are passionate about forecasting.

> **Superforecasting Teams Are Optimally Distinct**
> 
> In his book _Give and Take_ , Adam Grant offers another clue as to what makes superforecasting teams so prone to generosity. Grant argues that we’re more motivated to help people who are part of our own social and identity groups (which can be anything from immediate family to school classmates to fellow football fans). Additionally, the more unique the group is compared to the dominant culture, the more inclined members are to help one another (this is called “optimal distinctiveness”). Participating in forecasting tournaments is a rare hobby, and superforecasters are a unique subgroup of forecasters; that uniqueness might strengthen their group identity and make them even more likely to share resources with one another.

### Can Good Forecasters Be Good Leaders?

We’ve learned that forecasters are often good team players—but are they good leaders? According to the authors, leaders need to be confident, but superforecasting requires the humility to admit when you don’t know the answer and to acknowledge that bias might cloud your judgment. How can one person balance both these attributes, and be both a good forecaster and a good leader? The key is having _intellectual humility_ : **acknowledging the power of randomness** and that some things are impossible to predict or control, regardless of your skill.

Professional poker player Annie Duke describes this as the difference between “humility in the face of the game” and “humility in the face of your opponents.” Duke’s long record of success indicates that she is an exceptionally talented poker player and is probably more skilled than most of her opponents. But all of Duke’s skill and experience doesn’t mean she will automatically win every game or that she is even capable of fully understanding every possible intricacy. **Her skills allow her to beat her opponents but not the game itself.**

> **To Foster Humility, Understand the Role of Luck in Success**
> 
> Annie Duke’s distinction between “humility in the face of the game” and “humility in the face of your opponents” reflects author Nassim Taleb’s views on luck and success. In _Fooled by Randomness_ , Taleb argues that, while skill is a good predictor of moderate success, luck is a better predictor of wild success (this is especially true in industries that are intrinsically tied to luck, such as investing). Based on Taleb’s ideas, we should remain humble even when we succeed because wild success (the kind that breeds fame and fortune) isn’t evidence of extraordinary skill—it’s evidence that we got really lucky.
> 
> Similarly, Duke understands that winning at poker requires a certain degree of luck; if she were extremely skilled but terribly unlucky, she’d be able to carve out a decent record, but she certainly wouldn’t be the champion player she is now. Therefore, Duke is able to remain humble because she understands that no matter how well she plays, she’s always one streak of bad luck away from a loss.
