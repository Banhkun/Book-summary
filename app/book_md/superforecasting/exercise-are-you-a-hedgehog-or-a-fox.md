## Exercise: Are You a Hedgehog or a Fox?

By nature, we all lean more toward either fox or hedgehog thinking. This exercise will help you reflect on the way you think and identify biases that might be holding you back.

* * *

You may have recognized parts of yourself in the descriptions of hedgehogs and foxes. Overall, would you describe yourself as a hedgehog, a fox, or a hybrid? Why?

The old saying tells us that hedgehogs know “one big thing,” but no matter our natural thinking style, most of us have a strong belief or guiding principle in at least one area of our lives (like “the government should provide healthcare to all its citizens,” “people are fundamentally good,” or “depleting natural resources is morally wrong”). What “one big thing” do you know?

Strong beliefs are not a bad thing, but they do have the power to cloud our judgment. Can you think of a situation when your “one big thing” might have stopped you from seeing the full picture? If not, can you think of a situation where your “one big thing” might skew your perspective?

Critically analyzing our own tightly-held beliefs isn’t easy. How did it feel to acknowledge the ways your “one big thing” might create mental blindspots? Would this kind of thinking be helpful in any specific area of your life? Which ones?
