## Chapter 8: The Power of a Growth Mindset

By now, we’ve learned that superforecasters are smart, numerate, well-informed, and actively open-minded. All of these traits make them fantastic forecasters, but according to the authors, what sets superforecasters apart from other forecasters more than anything else is their persistent commitment to self-improvement, which we’ll discuss in this chapter.

### Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset

Forecasting involves quite a bit of failure because forecasters are asked to predict the unpredictable. While no one enjoys being wrong, the authors argue that superforecasters are more likely than regular forecasters to see their failures as an opportunity to learn and improve. Educational psychologists call this a “growth mindset.”**People with a growth mindset believe that talent and intelligence can be developed through learning and practice.**

The idea behind the growth mindset seems intuitive, but in practice, the authors report that most of us gravitate towards a “fixed mindset” instead. **The fixed mindset tells us that talent and intelligence are traits we’re born with** , so practice can only strengthen the natural abilities that are already there.

  * To illustrate this difference, imagine a child learning to ride a bike and falling repeatedly. If the child has a fixed mindset, they might say, “I’m just bad at this,” and accept their fate. They see bike riding ability as a fixed trait, which means trying to improve seems as futile as trying to get taller. 
  * On the other hand, a child with a growth mindset might be discouraged if they fall repeatedly, but they would see it as an opportunity to improve. Instead of thinking, “I’m just bad at this,” they’re more likely to think, “I still don’t understand this, so I should keep working on it.” They believe their effort is meaningful, so they keep trying (and therefore keep improving).



Superforecasters embrace the growth mindset and aren’t discouraged by failure. **Tetlock’s research found that this commitment to constant personal growth was three times more important than any other factor in superforecasters’ success**.

> **Grow Your Own Growth Mindset**
> 
> Like many other superforecaster skills, a growth mindset isn’t an inborn trait—it can be grown and developed with practice. In _Mindset, _psychologist Carol Dweck lays out a few concrete tips to help you transition from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset.
> 
>   * First, acknowledge and accept your fixed mindset. Most people call on both mindsets in different scenarios, so having a predominantly fixed mindset doesn’t make you a bad or inferior person. It’s just another way of thinking, and if you want to develop a growth mindset, you absolutely can. In other words, avoid having a fixed mindset about having a fixed mindset.
> 
>   * Next, take note of the situations that trigger your fixed mindset. For example, you might notice yourself slipping into a fixed mindset when you’re overwhelmed by a demanding task or when a colleague gets promoted over you.
> 
>   * Think of your fixed mindset as a separate persona and give it a name. That way, when you catch yourself thinking, “I should give up; I’m just not talented at this,” you can say, “Oh, that’s just Rigid Rita acting up.” Assigning those thoughts to a separate persona will help you remember that you don’t have to believe those fixed-mindset thoughts; you can choose to respond with a growth mindset instead.
> 
>   * Finally, when you notice your fixed mindset persona taking over, confront it directly. Remind that persona that you _are_ capable of growth and that risk and effort are necessary parts of that.

#### Grit

According to the authors, one thing people with a growth mindset tend to have in common is **grit** ,**a psychological term for the steadfast perseverance of a goal even in the face of failure**. People with grit are persistent. They keep trying, failing, and trying again long after most people would have given up.

Grit is a helpful quality in any field, but the authors believe it is absolutely essential for superforecasters because, as we’ve already noted, forecasting inevitably involves failure—even failing at predictions that took months to prepare and refine. Superforecasters keep trying anyway.

Beyond just continuing to give their best effort, the authors believe that grit distinguishes the way superforecasters make their predictions in the first place. When faced with difficult questions and obsolete data, talented forecasters have been known to reach out to international agencies directly for updated numbers. Superforecasters aren’t afraid to put in the work when it comes to getting the information they need.

> **How to Develop Grit**
> 
> Psychologist Angela Duckworth is the leading name in grit research. In her book,_Grit_, Duckworth breaks down the concept of grit into four necessary components: interest, practice, purpose, and hope. Here’s how to strengthen each of these areas.
> 
>   * **Interest.** Grit requires sticking with a project even when it’s tough, which is much easier to do when you’re intrinsically interested in the topic. If you’re not sure what your interests are, start by exploring the things you’re naturally curious about. Try new activities or read about new subjects and notice when you feel most engaged. You can also try digging deeper into an existing interest (for example, if you enjoy computer games, you might explore coding to learn how your favorite games are made).
> 
>   * **Practice.** To be effective, practice needs to be deliberate and focused. For example, if you’re learning to play the piano, don’t just sit down and hit a few keys now and then. Set yourself a stretch goal and create a routine with regular, structured practice sessions.
> 
>   * **Purpose.** Dweck defines purpose as “the intention to contribute to the well-being of others.” To develop your purpose, think about how the work you’re already doing could benefit society. Are there any ways you could make your daily tasks align more with your core values?
> 
>   * **Hope.** This is the belief in your own ability to improve. It is a growth mindset in action. Practicing a growth mindset will ultimately help you become a grittier person.
