## Exercise: Weigh the Impact of Black Swan Events

Letâ€™s test the theory that unpredictable events make a bigger impact than gradual change.

* * *

Think of a black swan event in your own life (remember, black swans are events that seem out-of-the-blue and have lasting consequences). This could be an event that strongly impacted your life in positive, negative, or neutral ways. Briefly describe the event and its most important consequences.

To compare, think of a gradual but important change in your life (things like advancing in a career field, working on your mental or physical health, building up a collection, and so on). Describe the change and its most important consequences.

Looking back, did one of those changes make a bigger difference in your life than the other? What made it more impactful?

In general, would you say black swans or gradual changes have shaped your life more? Why?
