## Exercise: Develop a Growth Mindset

A growth mindset doesn’t always come naturally, but the more you practice, the easier it gets. This exercise will get you started with pushing past frustration.

* * *

Think of a project in your work or personal life where you feel “stuck” (if this doesn’t apply to a current project, try to think of a time you felt this way in the past). What about this particular project makes it difficult?

What strategies have you tried to overcome that difficulty?

What other strategies could you possibly use? List three ideas below, even if they seem impractical or silly.

If you decide to try one of these new strategies and it still doesn’t work, what will you do next? Why?
