## Shortform Introduction

**_Homo Deus_ by Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history and looks centuries into the future, covering everything from theistic religion to artificial intelligence. **This book explores the way that technological advancement may lead to the decline of modern political, social, and economic systems, with advanced algorithms, “superhumans,” and data surveillance becoming the new normal.

To understand this perspective, we must first look to human history to see how modern society has developed. From there, we’ll look at technology and how it has already impacted modern systems of religion, economics, and politics. Finally, we’ll look at the future of humanity and the systems that may develop within the next century:

  * **Chapters 1-4 focus on the _rise of human dominance_** , highlighting the advent of religion and the search for power.
  * **Chapters 5-7 focus on the _rise of humanism_** , highlighting the branches of humanism and the impact of liberal ideology.
  * **Chapters 8-10 focus on the _rise of techno-religions_** , highlighting the potential future of socio-political structures and the influence of technological advancements. 



In addition to _Homo Deus_ , check out Shortform’s summaries of Harari’s other works for a fuller view of his perspective: _Sapiens _(an in-depth look at the history of humanity) and _21 Lessons for the 21st Century_ (an in-depth look at the biggest challenges facing humanity today).
