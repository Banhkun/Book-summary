## Chapter 8: Threats to Liberalism in the 21st Century

As discussed earlier, religion relies on ethical judgments supported by “factual” statements. Liberalism contends that freedom is more important than equality (ethical judgment) because human beings possess free will and a unique, singular voice. **However, recent scientific studies expose flaws in liberalism’s “factual” statement through research into the liberal concepts of free will and individualism.**

### Free Will

**For centuries, humans have been told that they possess free will, or the power to make their own decisions.** Before the advent of brain scans and modern psychology, the simplest way to explain why someone would do something was to say, “They chose to.” It gave people authority over their destiny as they maintained total control over the choices they made.

However, researchers have challenged the theory of free will through the use of neuroscience and brain mapping. The electro-chemical processes in the brain are subconscious, meaning humans have no control over the neural system that creates thought or action. When external stimuli cause a reaction in the brain, the human body will naturally respond to the electrical and chemical interactions. For example, you don’t _choose_ to get angry. Anger emerges naturally due to the body’s response to external stimulation.

**These reactions can be either deterministic or random, but they’re never “free”:**

  * A deterministic reaction is the direct response of the brain to an external stimulus. For example, if you accidentally put your hand on a hot pan, the electrical signals in your brain will tell you to retract your hand.
  * A random reaction is the result of an unpredictable event in the brain such as the decomposition of an atom or the misfiring of an electrical impulse. For example, your brain may accidentally cause you to shiver after randomly firing off an impulse. 



While scientists are able to explain the electro-chemical responses in the brain, there have been no major discoveries that support the concept of free will. In fact, evolutionary theory directly contradicts the concept of free will.

According to the theory of evolution, all animals have developed according to their genetic code and natural selection. Animals with stronger genes will make better “choices” because their genetic makeup instructs them to behave in a certain way, allowing them to pass their genes on to future generations.

Conversely, animals with weaker genes will make poorer “choices,” restricting them from passing along their genes. **If animals, including humans, had the ability to freely choose their behaviors, then natural selection couldn’t exist because choice would be separate from genetic code, meaning that the actions of the animals would have nothing to do with passing along the strongest genes.**

#### Human Desire

**People often confuse desire with free will.** They conclude that they have free will because they have the ability to act on their desires. However, while animals, including humans, _do_ possess the ability to make choices based on their desires, they _don’t_ possess the ability to choose their wants or desires. These are determined by involuntary electro-chemical reactions in the brain. For example, while you may be able to choose _not_ to attack your annoying colleague when the feeling arises, you have no control over your annoyance.

On a larger scale, **uncontrollable human desire leads to the creation of human perspective** , meaning that humans have no control over the very thing liberalism uses to champion freedom. For example, your political affiliation is the result of following or fighting against your desires. While you may have logical reasoning behind your decision, you can’t control the way that you feel about a candidate, policy, or behavior.

In one particular study, researchers asked participants to flip one of two switches while connected to a brain scanner. Based on which area of the brain activated, the scientists could predict which switch the person was going to flip before they took the action. Specific areas of the brain would light up hundreds of milliseconds before the participants were conscious of their decision, leading researchers to conclude that the participants were responding to activity in the brain instead of making a “free” choice.

#### Manipulation of Desire

**In the 21st century, researchers have been able to use the principles of neuroscience to manipulate the desires and behaviors of animals.** In one study, scientists placed electrodes into certain areas of a rat’s brain. Using these electrodes, scientists were able to manipulate the rat’s behavior, making it move in certain directions, climb ladders, and jump from extreme heights. The rat acted based upon its “wants” and “desires,” unaware that it was being manipulated.

Recently, researchers have used this manipulation of desire on people. For instance, a hospital in Jerusalem has developed a method to combat depression using a small computer and electrodes. The computer, which is implanted into a person’s chest, sends signals to electrodes that paralyze the area of the brain responsible for depression. While the treatment isn’t always successful, some patients have reported that their depression melted away “as if by magic.” **While ethical objections limit the use of electrode implants, many studies have been done using helmet-like devices that place electrodes on the outside of the brain called transcranial stimulators.**

For example, the U.S. military has developed helmets that are meant to enhance a soldier’s focus and performance. A journalist tested the technology at an Ohio Air Base by participating in a sniping simulation. Without the helmet, she felt overwhelmed as simulated suicide bombers rushed her position, only eliminating a small number before the simulation ended. When she put the helmet on, she calmly and efficiently eliminated every single target.

**While the long-term effects are still unclear, transcranial stimulators may have a serious impact in the development of humanity.** Some claim that they’ll actually strengthen the liberal perspective by giving people the power to silence unwanted desires and focus on their authentic wants. However, this is unlikely because, as you’ll learn in the next section, people probably don’t possess an “inner self” that’s able to define an “authentic” want.

### Individualism

**Liberals believe in individualism, or the belief that human beings have a singular, unique voice that leads them towards their true goals.** However, recent studies have debunked this myth, placing the “inner self” in the same category as the “human soul”—an unfounded theory that drives religious belief.

**Researchers have discovered that human behavior has nothing to do with a “singular, unique voice.”** Rather, human thought is dictated by the interactions between the two hemispheres of the brain. Each hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body, meaning actions of the left side of the body are controlled by the right hemisphere and vice versa.

While both hemispheres play a role in most behaviors, the right hemisphere plays a more important role in spatial and creative processes, while the left focuses on logical reasoning and speech. The neural responses of the hemispheres are often at odds with one another and cause conflicting feelings or “voices.”

While the hemispheres are usually connected by a neural cable, severing the neural connection causes them to work independently of one another. For example, researchers flashed a picture of a chicken claw to a split-brain patient’s right eye and a picture of a snow shovel to their left eye. When they asked the patient to state what they saw, they said “chicken claw,” because that object was flashed to the left hemisphere, the center of speech.

However, when they asked the patient to point to the picture they’d seen, their left hand pointed to the snow shovel while their right hand pointed to the chicken claw. The areas of the body responded differently based around the different experiences of their appropriate hemispheres. When asked why they pointed to two images, the patient said that the shovel had to be used to clean the chicken coop.

**The patient’s justification is the result of the brain’s need to rationalize behavior.** The left hemisphere is the center of logical reasoning, so it developed a logical reason for the patient to point to two objects instead of one. This process occurs in the brains of all people, not just split-brain patients. It justifies the subconscious behavior of the brain by creating conscious narratives such as the belief in an “inner voice.”

For example, if a person wakes up one morning and suddenly decides to quit their job, their brain may justify this behavior by creating a narrative that says their “inner voice” is guiding them in a new direction. However, the reality is that this desire is the result of the neurons firing in particular sections of the brain, not an individual goal. The brain simply created the narrative to rationalize the seemingly random behavior.

#### The Experiencing Self and the Narrating Self

**The hemispheres of the brain create two versions of the human experience—the experiencing self and the narrating self:**

  * **The experiencing self:** Usually controlled by the right hemisphere, the experiencing self processes moment-to-moment information. Most people associate this “self” with instinct. For example, if you hit your head on a door frame, the experiencing self would cause you to grab your head, check for blood, and feel the pain of the impact.
  * **The narrating self:** Usually controlled by the left hemisphere, the narrating self tries to rationalize past behaviors and justify future decisions. Most people associate this “self” with identity. For example, if you hit your head on a door frame, your narrating self may rationalize your clumsiness by attributing it to exhaustion while making you more conscious of the door frame for the next few days.



While the experiencing self produces a more immediate feeling in response to an experience, it can’t remember feelings, leaving the narrating self to create memories. These memories usually consist of highlights and end results, cutting out much of the detail felt by the experiencing self. The memory created by the narrating self evaluates the memory based on the “average” of the experience as a whole.

**Both “selves” interact to create perspective and inform decision-making.** The experiencing self can support or derail plans made by the narrating self. For example, if you decide to go on a diet, your experiencing self may not feel like cooking one night, leading you to order a pizza instead.

The narrating self, on the other hand, can frame in-the-moment experiences. For example, someone fasting before surgery is going to feel differently than someone fasting for religious reasons. While both parties are experiencing hunger, their narrating selves create perspectives that shape the way they respond to their hunger.

> **The Cold Water Experiment**
> 
> **In one study, researchers conducted a two-part experiment.** In the “short” test, participants were asked to submerge their hand into a tub of cold water for 60 seconds. In the “long” test, participants were asked to submerge their hand into a tub of cold water for 90 seconds. Unbeknownst to the participants, the researchers added a little warm water to the tub during the “long” experiment after the subject had their hand in the tub for 60 seconds.
> 
> The parts of the experiment were administered in random order, with some participants performing the “short” part first, while others started with the “long” part. Even though both parts of the experiment required subjects to leave their hand in the cold water for 60 seconds, 80% of participants found the “long” test more bearable than the “short” test. **By adding the warmer water for the last 30 seconds, researchers lowered the “average” level of discomfort, leading the narrative self to remember the “long” test as less painful.**

> **Reproduction and Childbirth**
> 
> Childbirth isn’t a pleasant experience, with women often experiencing excruciating pain.**** However, in the days following labor, women experience higher levels of cortisol and endorphins, creating a brief positive experience. **The narrating self clings to this positive experience to frame childbirth in a positive light.** If humans hadn’t evolved to remember reproduction positively, few would want to go through the pain associated with labor, and the survival of humanity would be put at risk.

#### Hardship and the Narrating Self

**The narrating self tries to attach meaning to hardship, making it more endurable.** It creates purpose within chaos and allows people to move forward after a difficult or traumatic time. However, when humans rely solely on this perspective, they run the risk of disconnecting from logical reasoning and often make choices that exacerbate an issue even further.

For example, the Scottish government once decided to construct a new parliament building with a budget of £40 million and a one-year timeline. However, the construction process was tumultuous, with unexpected issues arising every day. Afraid to abandon the project and lose the millions they’d already invested, the government continued to extend the timeline of the project and invest more money. When the building was finally completed, five years had passed and the government had spent £400 million, 10x the original budget.
