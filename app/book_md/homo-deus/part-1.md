## Part 1: Past—The Rise of Homo Sapiens | Chapter 2: Human Dominance

To understand where we’re headed, we must first understand how we became the most dominant species on the planet. **Humans have been the single greatest agent of change in the history of the Earth.** In just a few thousand years of existence, mankind has completely changed the ecosystem of the entire planet. Where natural selection and environmental phenomena were once the primary catalysts of evolution and development, humans have shaped the world through their actions.

**As the dominant species on the planet, we determine what species they want to survive, and how to use them to serve our needs.** This isn’t a new development. Even in the earliest years of human history, Neanderthals pushed certain animals to extinction by hunting them for food and clothing. However, they didn’t understand the consequences of their actions. Conversely, in the 21st century, we have a better understanding of how our behaviors can impact the world around us.

For example, where changes in animal population were once the result of natural occurrences, the number of wild and domesticated animals now depends on human behavior. In 1980, 2 billion wild birds lived in Europe. By 2009, that number had decreased to 1.6 billion. In that same year, 1.9 billion chickens were raised for meat and eggs.

**In this chapter, we will look at the ways humanity has dominated over other species, the ways in which humans are similar to the animals they domesticate, and the severe impact of industrialized agriculture**.

### From Animism to Domestication

**Animists believe people and animals are closely related.** They believe that animals, like people, experience intelligence and emotions. Therefore, animists are less likely to harm or domesticate animals unless absolutely necessary. The earliest human beings were likely animists as they relied mostly on foraging for their food, only killing animals when essential.

While animist cultures have mostly gone extinct, a few still exist today. For example, in India, the Nayaka people believe in sharing their land with the wildlife around them. They believe that the animals have as much of a right to the land as they do. They even refused to help the Indian forestry department track down an elephant who trampled a Nayaka tribesman because they believed the elephant was only acting out because the foresters killed its partner.

**In the modern world, most people believe humans are superior to animals.** This perspective has dominated human culture for millennia, thanks to religious support. For example, Adam and Eve are depicted as unique creations with no relationship to the animals they dominated. The one time that they interacted with an animal as an “equal,” it was the devil in the form of a snake, who brought about man’s fall from grace.

Humans’ dominance over animals rose to new heights during the First Agricultural Revolution around 10,000 BC. Instead of capturing or killing animals in the wild, people began domesticating them on a large scale. While they met the animal’s survival and reproductive needs, they didn’t care about the emotional, social, and psychological needs of the livestock.

#### Similarities to Animals

**Just as we inherit non-survival needs from our ancestors, domesticated animals also inherit non-survival needs from _their_ ancestors. **This means that, while animals may not _need_ mental, social, and emotional stimulation to survive or reproduce, they still crave these things instinctually. However, we’ve determined that our desire for animal byproducts outweighs the needs of animals, and we often follow effective but unethical practices to assert our dominance.

For example, researchers have discovered that pigs have a high level of intelligence. They communicate with one another, form relationships, and can even operate simple computer games. They need social, emotional, and intellectual stimulation to be happy. However, we’ve deprived domesticated pigs of these interactions by placing them into tiny cages and restricting their interaction.

#### Mother-Infant Bond and Animal Emotion

While there are emotional differences between species, there are also many similarities. **One of the universal emotions among mammals is the bond between a mother and its offspring.** For most mammals, offspring can’t survive without the attention of their mother, and mothers will ferociously fight for their children’s survival. While people have discovered how to survive without maternal protection, parental bonds are still essential to emotional development.

This is a relatively recent discovery. In the early-20th century, behaviorists told parents to keep their distance from their children. They believed that giving children too much attention would lead to them becoming too dependent.

**However, by the mid-20th century, researchers concluded that parental relationships are more important for mammals than previously thought.** In a series of studies, researchers stripped young monkeys from their mothers and left them in isolation. When later given the choice between milk and a motherly doll, they always chose the doll, proving that emotional instincts in mammals will often trump survival instincts.

**Despite this knowledge, people still separate domesticated animals from their offspring today.** What researchers did to several hundred monkeys in the aforementioned study, the agricultural industry does to billions of animals per year. They strip young animals from their parents and raise them in tiny cages. They don’t care about the emotional needs of the animals as long as they survive long enough to provide food and reproduce.

### Organic Algorithms

**Refuting past claims that humans and animals are vastly different, scientists have theorized that all mammals are organic algorithms.** Algorithms are steps followed to solve problems, perform calculations, and make choices. They can be as simple as basic arithmetic and as complicated as artificial intelligence. For example, a vending machine uses the following algorithm:

  1. Wait for payment from a user.
  2. Once payment is made, wait for button inputs.
  3. Once the button inputs are made, release the item at the corresponding location.
  4. Once the item is delivered, provide any leftover change from the purchase.
  5. Once change is delivered, show a “thank you” message, then wait for the next payment.



**According to researchers, organic algorithms are run by emotions, thoughts, and sensations.** Determined by genetics, these experiences control behavior by creating instinct. Instinct exists for two reasons: risk/reward calculation and reproduction.

#### Risk/Reward Calculation

**Every day, mammals must balance risk with reward.** Often, they have to take risks in order to gain necessary components for survival and happiness. However, if their algorithm is out-of-balance, their instincts may lead them down one of two dangerous paths:

  * If someone’s algorithm leads them to take too many risks, they’re more likely to die as a result of recklessness. For example, if a person decides to scale the exterior of a skyscraper without safety gear just to “get a thrill,” the risk may lead to their death without the promise of much reward.
  * If someone’s algorithm leads them to take too few risks, they’re more likely to die because they’ll be unable to fulfill their basic needs. For example, if a giraffe is too afraid of the lions surrounding a watering hole, it may not take the necessary actions to stay hydrated.



#### Reproduction

**Instincts are directly related to attraction**. A mammal’s internal algorithm kicks in and converts dozens of small factors such as body shape, facial structure, and pheromones into an assessment of “beauty.” For example, many people view a strong jawline, a good physique, and healthy skin as signs of male beauty. Likewise, peacocks view a large tail, colorful plumage, and a strong beak as signs of male beauty. In both cases, beautiful males are more likely to find mates and continue their genetic lineage.

**Mammals instinctively search for beautiful mates because the brain associates beauty with good genes.** This ensures that only the best genetics are being passed down through offspring. If a mammal has “bad genes,” they likely won’t be able to find a mate, and their genetic lineage will die off with them.

### Agriculture and Religion

**Following the Agricultural Revolution, early farmers looked to theistic religions to justify their treatment of animals.** According to most theist texts, humans are the “chosen” beings while animals are seen as “lower” beings. These texts catered to farmers and peasants by giving them divine authority over the other creatures of the world.

Even religious stories that depict mankind “saving” animals end with a reminder that humans are superior. For example, many theist texts have a version of the “great flood” story. In the tale, a divine being destroys the earth because of the sins of mankind. Animals have to suffer for mankind’s failings because they’re “lesser than.”

In the Biblical version, Noah is tasked with bringing the animals of the Earth into an ark, acting as their savior. When the global flood ends, Noah uses his dominance to sacrifice some animals to the Lord, even though there are only two of each kind of animal on the ark. This implies that Noah wiped out an entire species by sacrificing it after saving it because God gave him the authority to do so.

Some religions have a more loving perspective on animals. For example, Jainists, Buddhists, and Hindus apply the “thou shall not kill” rule to all living beings, with some even going so far as to cover their mouths to prevent accidentally swallowing a bug. However, even in these religions, people still use animals for byproducts such as milk or for their work power.

**These feelings of human superiority have continued into the modern era.** Even in cultures that show more respect to living beings than others, people are constantly adapting the narrative of human superiority to match their needs.

For example, the Nayaka believe that some living things are _mansan_ , or beings that have a unique personality. However, they don’t give this title to the beings that they use for food. For instance, an elephant is _mansan_ , but a chicken isn’t. This makes the process of slaughtering the chickens easier because they carry no intrinsic value.

### Removing God From the Equation

Following the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, people removed theist religion from the agricultural equation. Where people once had to rely on a deity to bless them with harvests, scientists began discovering ways people could ensure a consistent and healthy crop, even in the face of unfavorable conditions. **This human-centered thinking led to the creation of a new religion: humanism.**

**According to humanism, humans are their own gods and hold the power to unlock the secrets of the universe.** Like religions before it, humanism created tales and mythology to encapsulate its beliefs, using these stories to uphold the dominance of mankind while encouraging people to continue to search for greater meaning.

For example, where the Bible had the Garden of Eden, humanists have the Garden of Woolsthorpe. In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve were punished for their curiosity about the forbidden apple. In the Garden of Woolsthorpe, on the other hand, Issac Newton was rewarded for his curiosity about an apple falling on his head. Humanism turned the Biblical narrative on its head, championing human curiosity and discovery instead of villainizing it.
