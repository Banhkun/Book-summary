## Chapter 5: The Search for Power

**Historically, humans believed they played a role in a cosmic plan created by a divine being.** This plan gave people purpose, but it also restricted their power. For example, if a famine destroyed the crops of hundreds of farmers, it was accepted as “God’s plan.” Rather than working to solve the problems that created the famine, people would rely on prayer and sacrifice to “atone” to their deity.

As theistic religions have lost influence over the last century,**people now believe they’re in charge of their own destiny and aren’t beholden to a god.** This takes the meaning out of suffering and creates motivation to solve problems. Because plagues, droughts, and wars have no cosmic purpose, humans now have the drive to eradicate them.

For example, if people believed that an omnipotent god created plagues, they’d believe there was no way to stop it, aside from offering that god whatever they wanted. However, if a plague is simply an obstacle that can be overcome by human innovation, then humans may feel inclined to find a solution.

The dismissal of theism also leads to the removal of a traditional afterlife. Because there is no longer a promise of eternal bliss, humanity is driven to create Heaven on Earth. **To do so, humans must amass immense amounts of power through technological advancement and scientific discovery.**

### Power and the Economy

Scientific advancement requires funding. Researchers must be able to test theories for significant periods of time to achieve results.**Historically, few were willing to provide this money because the results of scientific research weren’t guaranteed.** In fact, for thousands of years, humans were too focused on survival to invest much in the future. When faced with a disaster, they’d turn to the one “sure” thing in the universe: their religion.

For example, an ancient town is suffering from an annual locust infestation. The farmer decides he’s going to try to find a solution to this problem, but he needs money to do so. He asks others within the town to donate, promising that he’ll pay them back at a later date. However, the other townsfolk reject his request. They’d rather pray to God for salvation than give away the money they need to survive to a project that may not produce any results.

**The modern solution to this problem is credit.** Credit and investment economics allow for the funding of projects with the promise of future gains. For example, if an investor puts $500,000 into pharmaceutical research, she could make millions if the research leads to the creation of a cure for cancer or other serious disease. Where something like an epidemic was once an unavoidable act of god, it’s now a business opportunity.

As science advances at an unprecedented rate, investors have the opportunity to make significant amounts of money they can then reinvest into other projects. Therefore, as more scientific ventures succeed, more credit becomes available. This creates a system that leads to economic growth and technological expansion.

#### Economic Growth

**From an evolutionary standpoint, humans have been conditioned to view the economy as finite.** Historically, wealth was determined by tangible resources such as gold and land. Therefore, if one family hoarded wealth, other families wouldn’t have the ability to gain power or status.

**However, in the modern era, nations focus on constant economic growth, using the concepts of credit and currency.** Because economic resources are no longer finite, countries now look to solve problems by creating products, investing in research, and invigorating the economy. This is essential for three reasons:

  1. **Quality of living:** More production leads to more consumption, which can raise the standard of living for average citizens.
  2. **Population growth:** If your country is growing at a rate of 1.4%, then your economy must grow at a rate of 1.4% or higher. If it doesn’t, your nation won’t have the resources to ensure standard of living.
  3. **Bolstering of the lower class:** As the economy expands, it creates more opportunities and resources for the lower class. If it doesn’t expand, the only way to support the lower class is to take resources away from the wealthy, which could lead to class warfare.



**Economic growth is heralded as the solution to most problems, from national crises to personal issues.** Consider the following examples:

  * National: If countries such as Congo and Myanmar could maintain a healthy economic growth rate, they could raise the standard of living and create an educated, well-versed, and prosperous middle class.
  * Personal: If a struggling married couple made more money, they could resolve their fights over their limited space by buying a bigger house, then attend expensive marriage counseling to get their marriage back on track.



Today, economic growth is central to every modern religion, political party, and social movement because money equates to power. Regardless of economic philosophy or political affiliation, leaders around the world champion economic growth as a barometer of their success.

**The demand for economic growth on both a personal and national level often creates ethical and moral dilemmas.** For example, a young lawyer’s father has a stroke and requires constant care. She has a choice: Give up a six-figure salary to provide care for her father, or hire a caregiver. If she gives up the salary, she can ensure that her father gets loving care, but she loses her career. If she hires the caregiver, she keeps her career but can’t ensure that her father is given the best care.

##### The Religion of Free-Market Capitalism

**Free-market capitalism puts growth above all, even at the expense of relationships.** This demand for constant investment is the result of an ethical judgment: “Economic growth solves all problems.” This makes capitalism less of a science and more of a religion. Instead of promising riches in the afterlife, capitalism promises wealth on Earth at the expense of your personal life.

For example, if you had to choose between spending more time at your job or with your family, you’d have to make an ethical judgment about the importance of money. If you were a true capitalist, you’d likely choose to spend more time at work because you’d believe that money could solve any problems facing your family.

Historically, kings and queens would either spend their money on extravagances, or store it away in chests, never to be touched.**In the modern era, capitalism demands that you reinvest your wealth into economic growth through methods such as expanding a business, hiring employees, or investing in the stock market.**

For example, if a capitalist made $500,000 today, they probably wouldn’t put it in the bank and leave it. They’d talk to their friends and family about what to “do” with their money, looking for investments that have potential. They likely wouldn’t be satisfied until their $500,000 turned into $5 million, constantly reinvesting in promising ventures.

> **The Fear of Resource Depletion**
> 
> As the economy continues to grow, many fear that humanity will exhaust Earth’s resources. **However, while raw materials will eventually be exhausted, humanity now relies on knowledge and energy to power the economy and find new ways to survive.** For example, while humans once relied on oil and coal for power, new developments in wind and solar energy remove humanity's strict reliance on raw materials and give corporations a sellable resource that will never deplete.

### The Danger of Ecological Collapse

**While humanity will likely solve the problem of resource depletion, constant economic growth _does_ threaten to destroy the planet’s environment.** As the CO2 emissions rise and forests continue to disappear, we risk a complete ecological meltdown that could destroy economic, political, and social structures.

To slow down the rate of destruction, we would need to slow down the rate of technological advancement and economic growth. However, because the world now runs on constant growth, humanity presses onward faster than ever before. In fact, many justify the rate of advancement by explaining that it will allow us to find more solutions to problems as they arise. **However, with the rate of growth where it is today, humanity needs to make significant discoveries every few years to prevent ecological disaster.**

For example, greenhouse gas emissions have risen exponentially over the last century because of technological advancements in manufacturing, transportations, and agriculture, causing the Earth’s temperature to rise at an alarming rate. Politicians refuse to impose drastic regulation out of fear that it would limit economic growth. This leaves humanity to rely on frequent scientific breakthroughs to combat continually rising CO2 levels.

**Even if we can produce scientific solutions, these solutions will likely be reserved for the richest in society, leaving the poorest countries and citizens to suffer.** Wealthy nations and families can rely on technology to save them from impending disaster, freeing them from the concerns associated with constant growth.

For example, the pollution levels in Beijing have made the city dangerous to live in. This led to the creation of the air purification market, a lucrative business that caters to the wealthiest citizens of the city. While rich families and well-funded institutions can afford the expensive equipment necessary for the systems, poorer citizens have to directly combat the health issues associated with the poor climate.
