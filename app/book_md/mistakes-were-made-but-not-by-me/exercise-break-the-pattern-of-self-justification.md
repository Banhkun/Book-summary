## Exercise: Break the Pattern of Self-Justification

Tavris and Aronson assert that we can halt patterns of self-justification by understanding how they work and what role they play in our lives. Reflect on a time when you used self-justification and consider how you could avoid it in the future.

* * *

Describe a choice you made or a thought you had recently that provoked cognitive dissonance: specifically, something that went against your usual beliefs, behaviors, and values and made you uncomfortable as a result. (For example, maybe you hurt a friendâ€™s feelings, despite usually priding yourself on treating others kindly.)

How did you resolve the dissonance and make yourself feel more comfortable with your actions? Write down any self-justifying thoughts you experienced or actions you took. (For example, maybe you convinced yourself that your friend is just too sensitive and that you did nothing wrong, or that they deserved the insult due to them treating _you_ badly.)

How might you handle a similar situation differently in the future? How could you hold yourself accountable instead of self-justifying? Write down at least one productive strategy you could use. (For example, you could apologize to your friend or journal about how the event made you feel.)
