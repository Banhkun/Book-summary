## Exercise: Lay the Foundations of Your Rental Empire

Now that you’ve explored Brandon Turner’s rental property investment advice, reflect on your own real estate investment ambitions and start planning to execute them.

* * *

In your opinion, what’s the greatest benefit of hiring a property manager? What’s the greatest drawback? Would you hire one? Explain your answer.

Think back to when you moved into your most recent home or apartment. What did the landlord do to make that property appealing to you? What did they neglect to do, and how would you rectify this mistake if _you_ were a landlord?

What appeals to you more as an investment opportunity: a property that a renter can just move into and that thus produces immediate cash flow, or one you’d repair and build appreciation into? Why?

Finally, consider whom you’d add to your prospective real estate team. How many members can you identify right away? (For instance, you might already know a lawyer.) Which one do you think it would be the greatest challenge to find, trust, or build a rapport with?
