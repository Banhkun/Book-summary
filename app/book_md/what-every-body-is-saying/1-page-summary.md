## 1-Page Summary

Have you ever wished you could tell what someone was _really_ thinking? In _What Every Body Is Saying_ , former FBI agent Joe Navarro provides expert insights into how to decipher body language. He argues that by practicing good observation skills and learning to decode universal patterns of behavior, you can master the language of nonverbal communication, gain access to people’s true thoughts and feelings, and detect signs of deception.

Joe Navarro is a leading authority on behavioral assessment, the bestselling author of 13 books, and one of the founders of the FBI’s Behavioral Analysis Program. He served as a consultant for the U.S. Department of State and has lectured on body language to diverse audiences ranging from university students to poker players.

In this guide, we’ll first explore how your brain’s limbic system controls your behavior and discuss why body language is an honest form of communication. Next, we’ll delve into Navarro’s process for reading body cues and identifying behavioral patterns that will help you determine whether someone is feeling secure or insecure. Finally, we’ll look into tips for detecting deception and discuss why it’s hard to tell when someone’s lying. Along the way, we’ll dig deeper into the psychology behind human behavior and provide alternative perspectives on reading body language cues.

### Why Your Body Doesn’t Lie

According to Navarro, **body language cues are more accurate indicators of a person’s emotions than their words.** This is because we’ve developed immediate and automatic physical responses to stimuli in our environments throughout our evolutionary history. In response to many things, whether it be a cute puppy or a rude coworker, our bodies react more quickly than our conscious thoughts do, making those reactions honest reflections of how we feel.

(Shortform note: In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Daniel Goleman refers to these automatic responses as “emotional hijackings.” He provides additional insight as to why body language cues are so honest, explaining that we automatically judge whether anything we see is good or bad within milliseconds. He adds that even when you briefly glimpse a photo of something you’re scared of, your body starts to activate its threat response and immediately initiates physical reactions like sweating.)

#### The Limbic System Controls Your Body’s Reactions

The part of your brain that controls these automatic emotional responses is called the limbic system. Over thousands of years of evolution, the limbic system’s main function has been to keep us alive, governing our instinctive behaviors to avoid harm (like stressful situations) and seek out things that are beneficial to our survival, like shelter. To do this, the limbic system has three consistent and automatic responses to danger: freeze, flight, and fight.

(Shortform note: What exactly happens in your brain when you perceive a threat? According to Bessel van der Kolk in _The Body Keeps the Score_ , your brain transmits all of the sensory information you perceive to two parts of your brain: the amygdala and the frontal lobes. First, your amygdala receives this information and quickly assesses whether it’s a threat. If it identifies a threat, it automatically signals your body to release stress hormones to prepare your body to react. Then, only after the sensory information reaches your frontal lobes does your conscious thinking kick in, allowing you to rationally assess the situation.)

According to Navarro, **the secret to decoding body language is learning what physical behaviors are associated with these three limbic responses**. After years of evolution, these reactions are strong and hard to suppress, making them noticeable and reliable cues that can indicate a person’s true feelings. Let’s look at each response and why we have it.

  1. **Freeze** —Your body’s first automatic response to something threatening is to freeze. This is because movement attracts attention and holding still helps you avoid being noticed. Restricted movement, then, indicates someone is feeling threatened or uncomfortable.
  2. **Flight** —Your next limbic response is to run or physically distance yourself from the threat. Subconscious distancing, then, also indicates discomfort.
  3. **Fight** —The last limbic response to a threat is to confront it directly. The body will prepare itself for conflict through aggressive behaviors such as puffing out your chest.



> **The General Adaptation Syndrome: How Stress Affects Your Body**
> 
> As Navarro explains, we have specific behaviors linked to our threat responses that can be reliable clues to what we’re thinking. To better understand how we react in such uniform ways, let’s look at a three-stage model of stress called the General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) that elaborates on Navarro’s insights about freeze, flight, and fight. It also explains how stress _continues_ to affect our bodies beyond the immediate trigger.
> 
> **1\. Alarm Reaction Stage** : When you first encounter something stressful, your brain activates one of the threat responses that Navarro discusses (fight, flight, or freeze). When this happens, your body prepares you to run or fight by increasing your heart rate and releasing hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline that increase your energy. While Navarro mainly discusses the alarm reaction stage (immediate limbic responses to stress), the next two stages of GAS reveal how longer periods of stress can cause your body to display more subtle cues you can learn to detect.
> 
> **2\. Resistance Stage** : In this next stage, you begin to recover from the effects of the initial threat response while your body remains alert. When a stressor is gone, your hormone levels, heart rate, and blood pressure return to normal. However, during prolonged stress, your body continues producing stress hormones and elevating your heart rate and blood pressure, which can lead to irritability, frustration, and trouble concentrating.
> 
> **3\. Exhaustion Stage** : In this final stage, your body loses the physical, mental, and emotional capacity to deal with the stressor, and you experience the harmful effects of chronic stress. These might include health conditions such as depression and anxiety, overall fatigue and burnout, as well as physical illnesses like heart disease or stroke.

Navarro explains that each time you encounter a new threat, your limbic system records your experience to inform how your body responds to future encounters with that same threat. For example, if you were badly scratched by a cat as a kid, your limbic system identifies cats as a threat. Later on, when you encounter cats, your body knows to immediately react with a threat response. Conversely, if you have new, positive experiences with cats, your limbic response to them will change.

Because your limbic response is largely influenced by your experiences, something that might not activate a large majority of people’s threat responses (like cats) may trigger someone else’s. Keeping this in mind allows you to better interpret not only what behaviors someone displays but why they might be displaying them.

(Shortform note: This dynamic nature of the limbic system is important in understanding trauma and how traumatic events can alter your threat responses. In _The Body Keeps the Score_ , Bessel van der Kolk writes that trauma is caused by either a single event or an ongoing experience. Although Navarro explains that your limbic system records and remembers threats so that your body can respond appropriately, trauma can cause your brain to misjudge non-threatening things as threats and inappropriately launch into a threat response.)

### How to Read Body Language

Now that you’ve learned that our basic emotional reactions (freeze, flight, or fight) are pre-programmed into our bodies, let’s look at how you can observe and interpret these reactions to make sense of body language. In this section, we’ll explore Navarro’s strategy in five steps.

#### Step 1: Strengthen Your Observation Skills

Navarro writes that**the first step of reading body language is to become a good observer.** Research has proven that people aren’t typically aware of their surroundings and that most of us fail to notice obvious things in our visual environment, such as other people’s clothing or the color of the building we’re in.

(Shortform note: Being a good observer isn’t easy. According to psychologists, most of us suffer from inattentional blindness, or the failure to notice things in the world around us. This phenomenon has been famously illustrated by the Invisible Gorilla experiment conducted at Harvard University, which had participants pass a basketball and keep track of the number of passes. However, during the experiment, a person in a gorilla suit passed through the scene and was noticed by only half of the participants.)

To be a good observer, then, practice becoming situationally aware. This means keeping constant tabs on where you are and what’s going on around you. When you practice situational awareness, you’ll naturally notice more in your surroundings, which will aid you in picking up body language cues. However, Navarro cautions you to observe discreetly so that your behavior won’t affect how others act.

(Shortform note: The term situational awareness was originally used in a military context, defined during World War I as a necessary skill for pilots to safely and effectively handle their aircrafts. Since then, it’s taken on multiple definitions but centers on the idea of being aware of the past and the present of a situation so that you can predict potential outcomes. One model identifies three levels of situational awareness: perceiving your environment, understanding the current situation, and anticipating the future situation.)

#### Step 2: Identify a Person’s Baseline Behaviors

When you observe a person’s body language,**** Navarro says you must first **make a mental record of a person’s behaviors at the _start_ of your interaction**. This allows you to get a baseline to measure your future observations against. Take into account their overall physical appearance, hygiene, and behavior—such as whether they’re loose, relaxed, and well-groomed or stiff, fidgety, and unkempt.

(Shortform note: Navarro’s suggestion of identifying a baseline is an important step for measuring change and interpreting information for other purposes, such as in cancer treatments. When treating cancer, doctors measure the tumor before treatment which is then used as the baseline to gauge the treatment’s effects.)

You should establish a baseline before trying to interpret body language because people have different personalities or cultural backgrounds that can affect their behavior. For example, someone with a shy personality might naturally have more nervous or withdrawn body language compared to someone more outgoing. Alternatively, some cultures might display more intimacy than others, such as through hugs and physical touch.

(Shortform note: Beyond acknowledging cultural differences when reading body language, psychologists point out two other factors you should consider: developmental and psychological differences. People with developmental disorders, such as individuals on the autism spectrum, display and perceive nonverbal cues in different ways. Similarly, mental health conditions, such as anxiety, can also influence a person’s body language.)

When analyzing someone’s starting behavior, assess it in the context of the situation they’re in. Consider things such as their surroundings and what they’re doing there so that you can know what behaviors to expect and what behaviors are abnormal. For example, you should expect someone at a job interview to showcase more nervous behavior than someone shopping at a grocery store.

(Shortform note: While Navarro doesn’t go into depth about how to better assess what behaviors are normal and abnormal in different contexts, in _The Nonverbal Advantage_ , Carol Kinsey Goman offers an exercise that lets you practice assessing when behaviors are expected and when they’re abnormal. She suggests identifying one body language cue (like fidgeting) and listing the situations you can think of where this behavior would be acceptable or normal (like before a flight). Then, consider what changes would make the behavior abnormal, such as how a different location might affect the meaning of this behavior.)

#### Step 3: Observe From the Feet Up

While it may seem intuitive to read a person’s body language from head to toe, Navarro suggests you do the opposite: start observing from the feet up. He explains that **your lower body is the most honest half.** This is because the feet and legs of our ancestors played a more significant role in their survival. Back then, the lower body came into contact with dangers such as predators or sharp objects more frequently, which makes it especially sensitive and reactive to stimuli.

(Shortform note: According to Navarro, your lower body reacts more sensitively to stimuli because it was more at risk to dangers during our early human history. However, a look through our evolutionary history reveals that our ancestors didn’t always walk upright. Additionally, around three and a half million years ago, our ancestors could walk on two legs but spent the majority of their time in trees. Ultimately, there is no scientific consensus on exactly why humans became bipedal. However, over three million years of bipedalism has heightened the sensitivity of our lower bodies, enabling Navarro to identify them as the most honest half of the human body.)

Our upper body and, more specifically, our facial expressions, are less honest. Navarro explains that we learn to mask or fake our facial expressions at a young age to avoid disagreements and maintain peaceful relationships. Therefore, he advises you to start at the most honest bottom half of the body to get a more accurate impression of a person’s true emotions.

(Shortform note: Lying and masking our facial expressions requires a _theory of mind_ , or the ability to understand that other people have different beliefs than your own. According to psychologists, children develop this ability around the age of four or five, backing Navarro’s claim that we learn to fake facial expressions at an early age. In this way, learning to deceive others is a developmental benchmark.)

#### Step 4: Look for Changes in Behavior

As you make your observations, **be alert to any rapid or gradual changes in behavior**. Navarro explains that since the limbic system automatically responds to stimuli, these behavioral changes signal shifts in emotion—for instance, from confidence to insecurity. If you notice what stimulus precedes these behavioral changes, such as a new person entering the room, you can identify not only _how_ someone feels about the situation, but _why_ they’re feeling that way.

(Shortform note: When noticing changes in behavior, Robert Greene warns you to avoid Othello’s error in _The Laws of Human Nature_. This error occurs when you incorrectly assume you know the reason behind a person’s display of emotion because of your own expectations and predispositions. This bias is named after the Shakespeare play _Othello_ , in which Othello believes his wife cheated on him and assumes that her nervousness confirmed his belief, when in reality, she only felt intimidated.)

#### Step 5: Look For Multiple Behavioral Cues

Before making any assumptions about a person’s true sentiments, Navarro suggests you **look for _multiple_ behavioral cues rather than rely on a single observation **(we’ll discuss what specific cues you can look for shortly). Since each person has a unique personality and their own behavioral quirks, you can get a more reliable reading by observing multiple indicators.

(Shortform note: Navarro advises you to look for multiple clues, which Carol Kinsey Goman refers to as _gesture clusters_ —multiple behaviors that reinforce a common message. In _The Nonverbal Advantage_ , she elaborates that single cues could mean many different things or nothing at all, which is why you can get a clearer picture by observing clusters of behaviors. Goman suggests you count to three after making an observation to stop yourself from making instinctive judgments based on a single cue. Then, look for two more cues that support your first observation.)

### How to Differentiate Between Secure and Insecure Behaviors

Now that you know the five steps to reading body language, let’s look at how you can apply them to identify whether someone is feeling _secure_ or _insecure_. Since our limbic systems induce strong responses (freeze, flight, or fight) to things that make us uncomfortable, most unconscious behaviors reflect either feelings of security or insecurity.

When we see something we _dislike_ —whether it be a person, a word, or a situation, our bodies display signs of the freeze, flight, or fight responses. When we see something we _like_ , we won’t experience a threat response—we’ll be open, expressive, and eager to interact. With that in mind, you can gauge how secure someone feels by observing the direction in which their body moves, their posture and range of movement, and the presence of self-comforting behaviors following a threat response.

> **How Our Likes and Dislikes Form**
> 
> According to Navarro, some things we dislike are strong enough to trigger our threat responses, but what determines what we like or dislike? Researchers explain that we develop our unique likes and dislikes based on the experiences we have through a process called respondent conditioning. Essentially, everything we encounter makes us feel positive, negative, or neutral. Positive experiences lead us to like the stimuli associated with them, while negative experiences cause us to dislike the stimuli associated with them. If something that originally makes us feel neutral occurs alongside a positive stimulus, we may find ourselves liking the neutral thing more.
> 
> For example, a student might find a new school subject like chemistry to be neutral. However, based on their experiences in that class, they might associate with chemistry either more positively or more negatively. If the experience was very negative, the student might find themselves experiencing some threat responses when starting a new chemistry class, such as sweating or having a closed-off posture.

#### 1) Observe the Direction a Body Points or Leans

Navarro argues that one major way to read a person’s level of security is to **pay attention to the _direction_ their body points or leans. **Since the limbic system controls our emotional responses, most people subconsciously turn away or distance themselves from things they find threatening.

(Shortform note: In addition to the direction someone orients their body, another factor you can note is distance. Researcher Edward T. Hall argues that how close someone stands to you can indicate how familiar or intimate you are with them. He identifies four distance categories based on relationship intimacy in North Americans: intimate, personal, social, and public. An intimate distance is less than 18 inches away from your body. A personal distance is anywhere from 18 inches to four feet away. A social distance is anywhere from four to 12 feet. Lastly, a public distance is anywhere from 12 feet and beyond.)

**Direction the Body Points** : Since the feet and the legs are the most honest body parts, note whether a person’s feet point toward or away from you. Navarro explains that our bodies naturally orient toward things we like and away from things we dislike. For example, if you watch a horror movie at a theater, you might notice people cringing away from an unpleasant scene with their knees and legs pointed sideways. In your daily interactions, if someone is speaking to you but they’re standing with one foot directed toward the exit, their body might be subconsciously signaling their desire to leave.

(Shortform note: While Navarro says people direct their bodies toward and away from things they like and dislike, you also orient your body toward novel stimuli. This is called the orienting reflex, which happens when something new or unexpected occurs in your environment. When this happens, your pupils and blood vessels dilate so that you can pay full attention to the new stimulus.)

**Direction the Body Leans** : Next, assess security by noticing what direction a person’s body is leaning, if at all. Navarro explains that it takes more energy to lean your body than it does to hold yourself straight, which is why leaning is often an indicator of a person’s true sentiments. Like with pointing, a person leaning toward you is comfortable while a person leaning away is uncomfortable.

(Shortform note: Leaning away might not always indicate dislike. In fact, some experts suggest you lean back when you first interact with a stranger, especially when flirting, to present non-threatening body language that respects their personal space and helps them feel secure. As they become more comfortable with you, you then lean forward to communicate interest.)

#### 2) Observe a Body’s Range of Movement and Openness of Posture

In addition to observing the direction someone moves, you can **assess security by evaluating how much someone moves and how open their posture is.** A comfortable person will move more expressively and present their body in a vulnerable and open way. On the other hand, an uncomfortable person will have restricted movements and closed body language—such as hiding, shielding themself, or preparing to escape from whatever’s causing discomfort.

(Shortform note: While posture can indicate comfort or discomfort, researchers argue that changing your posture can also change your mood. Good posture—sitting or standing with your head up and your back straight—increases testosterone and decreases stress hormones, making you feel more confident and positive. On the other hand, bad posture—sitting or standing with your head down and your back slouched—can lead to depression and lower energy, as well as increased negativity.)

**Range of Movement** : When we’re insecure, we naturally restrict our movements**** because our limbic system has activated our automatic freeze response. Navarro explains that insecure people tend to hold their arms and legs close to their bodies to avoid attracting attention. You might notice examples of this in public speaking—someone who’s uncomfortable in front of an audience will struggle to gesture emphatically and move around. They’re more likely to remain glued to the spot and struggle with voice inflection.

(Shortform note: More movement doesn’t always equal confidence. When insecure, people might display nervous jitters like shifting weight or pacing around. Some psychologists believe these repetitive movements help calm people and relieve muscle tension.)

When we feel secure, our threat responses aren’t being triggered. According to Navarro, a comfortable and confident body takes up space and often makes what he calls “gravity-defying behaviors,” such as rising onto the toes when greeting someone or raising the arms above your head to emphasize a point. For example, consider a class of students. When asked a question, students with their hands raised above their heads exude more confidence than those with bent arms at shoulder height.

(Shortform note: Researchers Jessica Tracy and David Matsumoto studied gravity-defying behaviors in Olympic medal winners, finding that both blind and sighted victors all displayed the same behaviors, such as raising their arms, expanding their chests, and tilting their heads back. Based on this, the researchers argue that behavioral displays of success and failure are biological and universal. They suggest that these behaviors stem from the biological instinct to appear bigger, convey dominance, and attract attention when confident. On the other hand, we share cringing behaviors with other animals including chimpanzees, wolves, and even crayfish to dispel conflict and signal our acceptance of someone else’s dominance.)

**Posture** : Navarro explains that a comfortable body has an open and vulnerable posture, whereas an uncomfortable body is more closed off. When we feel secure, nothing activates our body’s limbic instinct to protect itself. For example, if someone’s leaning back in a chair with their hands folded behind their head, they’re not conscious of themselves or the environment they’re in. Crossed legs while standing, Navarro points out, is also a sign of security because it is more vulnerable—this position leaves you more off balance. People in a heated debate, for instance, won’t stand with their feet crossed.

(Shortform note: Navarro suggests that an open posture can signal comfort, but one study also found that an open and expansive body posture also makes you more attractive to others. The study suggests that openness is nearly as important as dominance in initial attraction, as it can signal your willingness to share resources. In fact, our tendency to like people who are more willing to share goes beyond romance and holds true for all social relationships.)

Navarro adds that people often enlist their arms to protect their bodies. They might shade their eyes with a hand or cross their arms tightly across their chests. Some examples of this shielding behavior might be rearranging nearby objects to act as a barrier, clutching a protective object like a pillow, or buttoning up a shirt.

(Shortform note: In _The Definitive Book of Body Language_ , Barbara and Allan Pease offer deeper insights into how arm blocking behaviors affect our interactions. They found that crossed arms decrease your ability to pay attention and remember the information you hear by 38%. Further, crossed arms tend to make you more critical of what someone’s saying and can often be a sign of disagreement. To break arm barriers, they advise the listener hold something, such as a book or a pencil.)

#### 3) Observe the Presence of Self-Comforting Actions

If you notice someone displaying the insecure behaviors we’ve explored above, observe if any self-comforting acts follow. According to Navarro, **people perform self-comforting acts as a natural coping mechanism for stress.** These are subconscious and take on many forms such as touching the body and engaging in distractions.

(Shortform note: Research has shown that self-comforting acts, such as touch, have immediate stress-reducing benefits, decreasing heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones while increasing oxytocin, a hormone associated with affection and love. Massage, in particular, can even improve your focus and immune system functioning.)

**Self-comforting Touch** : According to Navarro, people often comfort themselves when under stress by rubbing or massaging their necks, faces, or limbs. He explains that the neck and the face have many nerve endings that, when rubbed, release calming chemicals inside the brain and lower heart rate and blood pressure. These self-comforting behaviors can manifest in different ways for men and women—women tend to cover the dimples between their collarbones, while men prefer touching their faces.

There are numerous other ways a person might use touch to soothe themself, such as sliding their hands down their thighs while seated (which serves to both calm them and dry any sweat from their palms), hugging themselves, or rubbing their inner cheek with their tongue.

(Shortform note: Some researchers suggest that people touch their faces more than other parts of their bodies—up to 800 times a day. Like Navarro, they argue that these behaviors tend to increase in frequency when you’re experiencing negative emotions, adding that they also increase when you’re trying to focus on a demanding cognitive task. They found that suppressing self-touch can lead to poorer memory. This highlights the important role of self-touch in regulating not just your emotions but your cognitive performance.)

**Self-comforting Distractions** : When people experience discomfort, they seek distractions as a way to relieve stress, such as tidying their clothes, playing with their hair, or adjusting jewelry. Navarro explains that, in moments of stress, the limbic system instructs the body to distract itself from the stressor. People might drum their fingers on a table, speak to themselves, or whistle a tune.

(Shortform note: While fidgeting may be a way to relieve discomfort, psychologists suggest that people also fidget when they need to concentrate on something. One study involving children with ADHD found that fidgeting can improve the ability to retain new information. However, excessive fidgeting can also be a sign of underlying conditions such as restless leg syndrome.)

### How to Read Facial Cues

Now that we've explored how different behaviors of the human body reflect security or insecurity, let’s discuss how and why you should approach facial cues differently. As Navarro explains, unlike other parts of our bodies, **we’ve trained our faces to mask how we truly feel**. This means that when reading facial expressions, you must use careful judgment and look for subtle cues.**** He contends that lying is an adaptation that many of us have formed since childhood—we’ve learned to hide displeasure and feign agreement to maintain relationships and avoid conflict.

(Shortform note: In _The Laws of Human Nature_ , Robert Greene agrees with Navarro’s claim that masking our emotions is a social adaptation and says that you should wear a pleasant mask to form good impressions. He argues that complete honesty would cause us to offend others and make us vulnerable to being judged or taken advantage of. To preserve our mental and social health, we commonly mask negative emotions like aggression or vindictiveness that would provoke negative responses from others.)

With this in mind, Navarro suggests you pay more attention to the first emotion that you notice when reading someone’s facial cues. For example, if you make a suggestion to someone and notice they furrow their brow before nodding in agreement, give more weight to the first behavior you observe (the furrowing of the brow).

(Shortform note: According to Robert Greene, this first display of emotion is likely to be a microexpression, or one that appears for under a second. These may occur when someone is trying to suppress their emotions, as expressions are hard to control. Greene suggests you use your peripheral vision to observe these microexpressions.)

Also, focus more on displays of negative emotions over positive ones. If someone says they’re excited but their facial expression indicates displeasure, consider the negative emotion as more truthful. This is because it's often harder for someone to conceal their body’s limbic response to discomfort than it is to feign pleasure.

(Shortform note: While Navarro recommends you focus on displays of negative emotions, Robert Greene points out in _The Laws of Human Nature_ that it can be harder to notice negative cues for two reasons. First, we naturally want to be liked and might subconsciously ignore hints of dislike. Second, people mask their dislike to be socially appropriate. When you’re trying to detect negative cues, Greene suggests you look for microexpressions and mixed signals.)

While facial expressions can be misleading, certain cues can still offer helpful insights. Navarro points out several parts of the face you should observe: the eyes, changes in face color, and the mouth.

#### 1) Observe the Eyes

Although we have more control over facial expressions than other parts of our bodies, our eyes still have numerous automatic limbic responses that have developed over the course of human evolution: **They instinctively block out things we dislike and widen to things we like**.

Your blink response, for instance, happens instantaneously to protect your eyes from physical harm such as dust blowing in your face. When reading body language, you can pick up more subtle eye blocking behaviors that a person might display for less obvious threats, such as seeing a person they dislike. Take note of more subtle cues like squinting, rapid blinking, and pupil constriction, which are common indicators of discomfort. On the other hand, widened eyes and dilated pupils reveal positive interest since they’re not being triggered to block out any threats.

(Shortform note: Researchers support Navarro’s claim that the eye’s instinctual behaviors can help you read body language. However, they add that the expressiveness of your eyes serves not only as an indicator of your emotions but as a way to alter your vision depending on the situation. Navarro suggests that widened eyes might signal positive interest, but they can also indicate fear. In both cases, your eyes widen to increase your field of vision. Narrowing your eyes, on the other hand, sharpens your vision onto whatever prompts your dislike.)

#### 2) Observe Changes in Face Color

Navarro explains that **changes in face color, such as blushing or growing pale, can be truthful indicators of emotions** since we have little control over the blood flow in our faces. When you experience strong feelings like embarrassment, your limbic system gets triggered, causing blood to rush to your face and creating a flushed look. When you sense something alarming, your face pales as your blood flows to other parts of your body in preparation for fight or flight.

(Shortform note: Navarro primarily discusses blushing and paling, but researchers have found that many emotions have a unique pattern of facial coloring. Disgust, for instance, results in a bluish-yellow tint around the lips and a reddish-green around the nose and forehead area, while happiness is associated with reddened cheeks and temples along with blue around the chin.)

#### 3) Observe the Mouth

Navarro explains that **the fullness of your lips indicates your level of security**. When we feel secure, our lips are relaxed and full. The more uncomfortable we are, the more we purse our lips. This is a protective limbic response that activates so that you don’t ingest anything dangerous during a threatening situation.

(Shortform note: In _The Like Switch_ , Jack Schafer and Marvin Karlins agree with Navarro that lips can be revealing and provide insights beyond broad indications of comfort and discomfort. They argue that pursed lips can more specifically indicate disagreement with what you’re saying. Furthermore, lip biting or lip compression might mean that the person is hesitant to speak their mind.)

### How to Detect Deception

According to Navarro, body language can reveal signs of possible deception. He explains that **people who are lying tend to exhibit more insecure behaviors** because deception takes mental effort and often causes stress, which can trigger some limbic responses that we can identify.

(Shortform note: Neuroscientists explain why lying is more stressful and mentally taxing: it requires you to use your brain’s executive function and, more specifically, your working memory. This is because you need to predict the directions the conversation might go and determine what you need to say to maintain your lie. One study showed that lying increased both mental workload and reaction time.)

However,**** no behavioral cue can directly indicate whether or not a person is lying. Research has shown that even the most experienced behavioral analysis experts have, at best, a 60% chance of correctly guessing whether someone’s lying. For this reason, he cautions you to be careful when using body language alone to accuse someone of deception.

(Shortform note: Other researchers echo Navarro’s warning, adding that it’s a common misconception that you can tell if someone is lying based on the way they’re acting. A 2003 study by psychologist Bella DePaulo found that out of 102 nonverbal cues gathered from 116 experiments, none could reliably indicate deception. Because lie detection mistakes can have costly consequences in the criminal justice system, psychologists are looking into alternative strategies to detect lies, such as allowing interviewees to talk more freely so that they might contradict themselves.)

#### Behaviors That May Indicate Deception

While the signs of insecurity we’ve discussed earlier indicate discomfort and can reflect possible deception, Navarro offers two more specific deception-related signs:

**1) Delayed or Inconsistent Behavior** : Navarro explains that people who are lying often have delayed responses, since they’re consciously trying to behave in a way that matches their words. For instance, if someone says that they agree with you, observe whether their nod occurs at the _same time_ as their words. If they start nodding after they speak or even start shaking their head side-to-side, this delay or inconsistency in behavior may indicate inauthenticity.

(Shortform note: These delayed or inconsistent body signals are what psychologists refer as nonverbal leakage. This term was popularized by psychologist Paul Ekman in the 1970s, who argued that the face has the highest _sending capacity_ of signals—it’s the most easily visible body part with nuanced expressions. The feet, hands, and legs, then, have lower _sending capacity_ in that they’re more easily concealed and less expressive. However, like Navarro, Ekman acknowledges that the face can also produce confusing signals and suggests looking for contradictory expressions.)

Similarly, people who are lying might not be displaying the appropriate emotions for the situation. For example, if someone asks to borrow money for an emergency, they should be acting anxious and urgent rather than relaxed and collected.

(Shortform note: While, as Navarro suggests, inappropriate emotions can indicate deception, research shows that people also display unexpected emotions during intensely emotional situations. You might be familiar with some common examples: crying when happy or laughing when sad. Psychologists theorize that this behavior isn’t deceptive, but used as a form of emotional regulation. Essentially, when you’re overwhelmed with positive or negative emotions, you express an opposite reaction to lower the intensity of your feelings.)

**2) Uncommitting Behavior** : Navarro explains that people who are lying tend to be less committed to their statements and use fewer grand gestures to convince you of what they’re saying. A person might give a half-hearted shrug instead of a full one, or they might cover their mouth while speaking.

(Shortform note: Although Navarro writes that people who are lying use less emphasis to support their words, Robert Greene argues the opposite: that deceptive people may intentionally use exaggerated gestures to distract you from their true thoughts. Greene explains that the mouth and face are likely to be the most animated body parts and advises you look for other parts of the body that might be tense.)

One specific behavior that reflects commitment is whether someone gestures with their palms up versus palms down. Navarro explains that raising your palms up when you speak suggests you’re _asking_ to be believed, whereas facing your palms down while speaking demonstrates emphasis.

(Shortform note: Researchers explain why palm gestures have these meanings: Evolutionarily, our distant ancestors used palm-up gestures in a submissive crouch position and palm-down gestures as part of a push up into a higher, more aggressive stance. More specifically, palms-down signals denial or interruption while palms-up signals an offering or request. In fact, palm-up gestures are so deeply rooted in our evolutionary history that they’re still common in apes. For apes, researchers believed these gestures occurred originally as a means to catch fallen food while another ape was eating, which later evolved into a communication signal.)

#### Tips for Detecting Deception

Now that you understand the difficulty of detecting deception and two specific cues you can look for, let’s look at Navarro’s tips on how to assess whether someone might be lying:

**Tip #1: Get a complete view of the person.** Navarro suggests you clear any obstacles between you and the person you’re interacting with so that you can observe their full body. He states that oftentimes the most honest half is concealed under a table, making it harder to make good judgments.

(Shortform note: When you think of a police interrogation room, you might imagine a room with two chairs and a table in between them. In recent years, experts are becoming more aware of the importance of nonverbal cues and argue for the removal of physical barriers between interviewer and interviewee. They elaborate that this type of barrier not only physically hinders your ability to read their body language cues but serves as a psychological obstacle to building rapport. Instead, they suggest the interviewer and interviewee sit less than four feet apart.)

**Tip #2: Make the person feel comfortable.** Since discomfort can indicate deception, try to help the person feel comfortable at the start of your interaction. This gives you a baseline to judge their future behaviors when you transition into more difficult topics.

(Shortform note: While Navarro doesn’t provide any advice on how to make your interviewee more comfortable, experts provide some actionable suggestions: maintain eye contact and match their body language. Therapists, for instance, often mirror the body language of their patients to subtly convey understanding and cultivate a feeling of comfort.)

**Tip #3: Ask focused questions.** Navarro explains that just because someone’s talking a lot doesn’t mean that they’re telling the truth. By controlling the conversation with specific questions, you can trigger behavioral cues in someone instead of letting them ramble and lead the interaction.

(Shortform note: To lead an interaction with focused questions, consider asking a series of “funnel questions,” which start off broad and grow more specific or vice-versa. Useful in a variety of situations, such as job interviews, funnel questions allow you to get detailed answers and easily change the focus of the conversation according to your needs.)

**Tip #4: Look for self-comforting behavior.** After asking a focused question, assess the person’s stress levels by looking for any attempts they make to comfort themselves. When you observe self-comforting behaviors, try to make note of what stimuli preceded it to get an understanding of what made them uncomfortable.

(Shortform note: According to psychologist Paul Gilbert, these self-comforting behaviors often follow a distressing question because our bodies have a natural soothing system, much like our threat response system that Navarro focuses on. Like the limbic system, this soothing system is hardwired into our bodies, and it relieves the intense effects of the stress response.)

**Tip #5: Leave room for silence.** Navarro advises you to insert deliberate pauses between your questions so that your interviewee has time to react and you have time to observe. Instead of drilling them with a series of questions, ask a single question and wait for a response.

(Shortform note: Leaving space for silence in your interactions is useful beyond trying to detect deception. In _The Coaching Habit_ , Michael Bungay Stanier writes that being comfortable with silence is also a good practice for coaching and understanding others. He writes that asking too many questions back-to-back can be overwhelming, and giving people space allows for thoughtful responses.)
