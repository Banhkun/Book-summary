## Exercise: Exploring Trauma

Think about the power of storytelling and remembrance.

* * *

Is there someone who was important in your life that you lost? Describe this person and what they meant to you.

Do you share stories about this person? If so, why do you do this?

Would you want your memory to live on through stories after you die, even if the stories arenâ€™t 100 percent accurate? Explain why or why not.
