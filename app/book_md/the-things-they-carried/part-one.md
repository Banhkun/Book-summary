## Part One: Burdens

First Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, commanding officer in charge of Alpha Company, a unit of the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War, is reminiscing about a girl named Martha whom he knew back home. He is in love with her, but fears that his love is unrequited—although she signs off her letters to him with the customary “Love,” Cross knows that it is perfunctory and without meaning.

**Cross is a reluctant commander** , who never wanted the responsibility of leading men in combat. He had joined the officer training program in his sophomore year of college because it seemed preferable to the draft. He has no deep commitment to the war, and, at 24 years of age, feels himself to be entirely unsuited to be making life-or-death decisions for others. The responsibility is too much for him to bear.

To cope with his war burden, he clings to the memory and to the idea of Martha in any way he can, including tasting the envelope flaps of her letters (knowing that her tongue has been there) and keeping a small pebble in his mouth that she sent to him from a beach back home. He also endlessly ponders whether or not she is a virgin. His feelings about Martha are his tether, **his connection to a world apart from the horror and mayhem of Vietnam.**

Cross recalls going to see _Bonnie and Clyde_ with her and touching Martha’s knee during the final scene of the film. He regrets not going further—carrying her up to her dormitory, tying her to the bed, and touching her knee all night. For him, this act is a symbol of a lost time, of a path in his life not taken.

### Humping

In military parlance, to “hump” means to walk or march. In the psychologically harrowing context of Vietnam, however, to hump something carried far deeper meaning. All the men must carry the necessary weaponry, rations, and survival gear for operating in the dense jungle warfare of Vietnam. All of them are grimly aware of the terrifying destructive power of the weapons they wield. **The brutality of war has transformed all of them** , hardened them into new and unrecognizable versions of their former selves.

What each man chooses to carry is a window into who they are and what is most important to them. Some carry extra rations, condoms, comic books, marijuana, or copies of the New Testament. Beyond the physical, **the men of Alpha company also carry a great many burdens** —including diseases both biological and psychological.

Cross carries two photographs of Martha. Another man, Dave Jensen, carries a rabbit’s foot as a good-luck charm. Henry Dobbins carries his girlfriend’s pantyhose, tied around his neck. Disturbingly, Norman Bowker carries a rotting thumb taken from the corpse of a slain Vietcong (VC) soldier, a boy of perhaps 15 or 16.

### War and Death

Much of the war is spent in passive waiting and long spells of boredom. It often seems to be a continual march, without end and without purpose, humping their burdens from one poor village to the next. Of course, it is war—and war still brings the fearsome anticipation and knowledge that, **at any moment, death and destruction may descend upon the company**.

In moments of combat when the unit is under fire, the boredom drains away and the tough exterior the men put on drops immediately. They fall to the ground in terror and pray to be spared from death. But when the firing stops, the men cover up their fear, almost as if it’s a stain. **The shame of being seen to be afraid is a powerful force, more powerful than death itself.** Many of them are only in Vietnam because they want to avoid the shame of not going off to fight. They are there out of fear of embarrassment, not out of any patriotic zeal. They castigate soldiers they know who have shot themselves on purpose to get put on medical leave as “pussies” and “candy-asses,” but always with a measure of envy for those who have found a way out of the jungle.

There are jobs that every man dreads. One of the most fearsome tasks is to search out enemy tunnels. The men reveal their cold fatalism when the unlucky soldier is selected to perform this dangerous and possibly deadly service—you win some, you lose some. Lee Strunk draws the short straw and is forced to descend into the subterranean world of rats, spiders, and possible hidden VC. When Strunk emerges back out of the tunnel, Rat Kiley, the company’s medic, remarks that Strunk looks like he is “right out of the grave, fuckin’ zombie.”

### Dehumanization

One of the men under Cross’s command, Ted Lavender, is shot in the head and killed while the company is stationed outside a small village. His death comes entirely out of the blue, without warning. By this point, the burden of war has hardened the men—**death is no longer (at least outwardly) a cause for shock or displays of grief**. They coldly and unemotionally observe how Lavender’s body hit the ground. They note that his death was un-dramatic and oddly mundane—in their words, “the poor bastard just flat-fuck fell. Boom. Down. Nothing else.” Of the 17 men—now 16—only Rat Kiley shows any shock as he repeatedly remarks, as if in shock, “The guy’s dead.”

In lieu of expressing their grief, **the men find their emotional outlet by subjecting a local Vietnamese village to an orgy of mayhem and destruction**. They burn homes, destroy food stocks, slaughter domestic animals, and then call in artillery to raze the place to the ground while they watch. Azar, a soldier particularly given to performative displays of cruelty and callousness, sees a boy with one leg. His sympathies, however, are not with the boy, but with the soldier who failed to _kill_ him and instead only succeeded in maiming him. He remarks, “War’s a bitch. Some poor fucker ran out of ammo.”

The company desecrates the corpses of soldiers and civilians,**** kicking them and cutting off their limbs to take as trophies. **They also brutalize and dehumanize with language**. The men joke and put on a mask of weary indifference to cope with the threat of death that hangs over their existence. When someone dies, they are, “offed,” “lit up,” or “zapped.” Even the death of one of their own, Lavender, brings the same chorus of jokes. They sneer about how Lavender (who constantly took tranquilizers to cope with the fear of war) is serene and tranquil _now_.

**Cross is consumed with guilt over Lavender’s death,** as he has been—and will be—about all the men who die under his command. He believes that he was daydreaming and distracted while thinking about Martha, and that this led to Lavender’s demise. Wracked with guilt and shame, **he is afraid to cry in front of the men**. He retreats to his foxhole to weep, for Lavender, for his unrequited love for Martha, and for the world he has lost to war. The morning after Lavender’s death, Cross burns Martha’s letters and photos. He would sever the connection to his old life, commit now to his duties as a soldier—and nothing more. **“Love” would no longer be a factor.**

Among the men of Alpha Company, only one soldier, Kiowa, a Native American who carries his New Testament on his person at all times, shows any introspection. When death strikes the company, he is always the one who encourages his comrades to talk about their experiences rather than submerge them in acts of violence or displays of emotional cruelty. Seeing Cross’s despair, Kiowa wishes to himself that he could feel for Lavender as Cross does. But instead, all he can think about is the sound of Lavender’s body hitting the ground.

(Shortform note: Some of the men’s stories are told from the third-person, while others are told from the first-person perspective of the narrator and main character of the book, Tim O’Brien. Often, O’Brien is sharing stories that he heard from others, but claims not to have experienced or witnessed himself. The character O’Brien shares many autobiographical similarities with the _actual_ author of _The Things They Carried_ , including sharing the same name. Because the book blends autobiograpy and fiction, we as readers are never certain whether the “Tim O’Brien” in the story is the same person as the author.)

Years later, after the war, Cross reunites with the narrator, O’Brien, at the latter’s home in Massachusetts. O’Brien asks Cross what became of Martha. He tells O’Brien that he ran into her again at a college reunion in 1979 and told her that he still loved her. He’d even confessed to her his fantasy about tying her to her bed and touching her knee (which Martha had said she was glad he never acted upon).

O’Brien, now an author, says that he’d like to develop Cross and Martha’s story into a written piece. Cross only asks that O’Brien make him out to be **“brave and handsome, all that stuff. Best platoon leader ever.”**

### Happy and Bloody Stories

Even years after they’ve returned home, the men can’t stop telling themselves war stories. The stories, whether they are literally true or not, provide a powerful catharsis. **Through the power of narrative, they can make sense of their experiences and convey to others what it felt like to be in Vietnam.** It is the stories that connect the past to the present, that tie together the loose narrative threads of their lives. Whether they literally happened or not is irrelevant. They provide meaning and coherence to memory, they fill in the gaps between who the men were in Vietnam and who they are now.

There were some happy stories. Indeed, for all the horrors of war, there were still moments where people could display decency, even compassion for others. Like the time a local village elder guided Alpha Company safely through a minefield and Cross tearfully hugged the man while others provided him with rations as an expression of gratitude.

**Many of the stories are barely stories at all** , lacking a narratively clear beginning, middle, and end. Rather, they are memory fragments. Like the time Kiowa (a Native American) taught a rain dance to Rat Kiley and Dave Jensen. Or when Ted Lavender adopted a stray puppy.

But of course, **there are also stories of bloodshed and near-sadistic cruelty.** Like when Azar strapped Lavender’s puppy to a landmine and then detonated it. Or when the same Azar mocked the frenzied dancing of a girl whose family had just been killed in a napalm attack on her village (the girl was clearly suffering from some sort of psychotic break). Or when Rat Kiley tortured a baby water buffalo with a submachine gun, methodically blowing away its limbs and body with surgical precision (he was a medic, after all) while the company watched the animal bleed to death, fascinated by how long it took to die. Or when the company shook hands with and ironically “introduced” themselves to the corpse of an old man who’d been killed in an air strike on a local village.

For some of the men, these were rituals that objectified the horror of war and made it seem less personal—it was easier to cope if it was all just a joke. Others, like Azar, seemed to genuinely relish the most ghoulish aspects of Vietnam and took pleasure in watching the pain and suffering of others.
