## Part Three: The Field

**Madness was baked into the Vietnam experience**. Rat Kiley, a keeper of these tales (and also a known braggart and exaggerator), shares another one with O’Brien about an American _girl_ who became consumed by the war.

### Going Native

Kiley tells O’Brien that before he joined Alpha Company, he had been assigned to a separate medical unit embedded with a detachment of Green Berets. Kiley says that the Green Berets, or “Greenies,” were a secretive unit that operated largely outside of the normal command-and-control structure of other military personnel in Vietnam, often going out on clandestine, weeks-long excursions into the jungle.

(Shortform note: The Green Berets are the colloquial name for the U.S. Army Special Forces, a special operations force that focuses on specific missions and tactical responses outside the scope of what the broader Army does. They are subjected to more rigorous training and are considered an elite fighting force even within the Army.)

One of the men in Rat’s unit, Mark Fossie, decided to bring his American girlfriend out to Vietnam. He reasoned that the presence of the Greenies made the outpost safe, a sort of oasis within the war. To the astonishment of the men, he actually managed to pull the logistics of this off, bringing in his girlfriend Mary Anne on one of the daily resupply choppers from Hanoi.

After some time with the unit, Mary Anne became accustomed to life in Vietnam, learning about weaponry and military hardware, coming to understand the intricacies of Army tactics and maneuvers, learning some Vietnamese, and growing more and more curious about what was in the mountains beyond the unit’s base camp.

**Mary Anne developed a fascination with the war, especially its most grisly realities**. She got an adrenaline rush from treating injured soldiers and seemed to be at her most comfortable and serene when she was surrounded by the chaos and violence of warfare. She had become more of a natural soldier than any of the men in Kiley’s unit, remarking, **“Everything I want is right here,” and telling Fossie that she’d never been happier in her whole life.**

One night, Mary Anne didn’t come back to the base. At first thinking she was sleeping with one of the other soldiers, Fossie and Kiley searched the entire camp, but found no trace of her. It dawned on them that Mary Anne wasn’t missing or captured—she had gone out on _ambush_ with the Green Berets. **Vietnam had consumed her. She had gone native.**

She would go off on ambush often after this, sometimes for as long as three weeks, with fewer and fewer return trips to the camp. One night, Kiley claimed to have seen her returning from a mission with the Greenies, like a silhouette, ethereal and mysterious. **She had become one with the strangely compelling chaos of Vietnam.**

One night, Kiley and Fossie went out to the Special Forces area. From inside the Greenies’ compound, they could hear ghostly, otherworldly, chanting, not unlike what the men on the listening patrol had heard up in the mountains. Inside, they found Mary Anne singing, chanting, and swaying to some sort of tribal music, wearing a necklace made of human tongues. She was flat and indifferent, betraying no emotion and displaying no sign of the person she had once been. She told Fossie that **she wanted to consume Vietnam (and, by implication, the war), to imbibe and swallow the filth and death and have it live inside her forever**. For her, Vietnam was a powerful drug, a potent mix of terror and pleasure. From there, Kiley says, she slipped forever into the shadows of Vietnam, still out there like a predator, waiting for the kill.

### Soldier Jesus

O’Brien recalls another man in Alpha Company, Henry Dobbins, as being highly drawn to sentimentality. Dobbins carried his girlfriend’s pantyhose around his neck, but not out of a sexual predilection. For Dobbins, the pantyhose were a talisman, a good-luck charm, something that made him feel protected. Like Cross’s pebble from Martha, they were a link to a world away from the war.

O’Brien observes how powerful a hold superstition exerted on all the men **in circumstances where life and death seemed to hang so precariously and randomly in the balance**. Thus, even the other men came to accept the pantyhose’s mysterious protective power, seeing how Dobbins seemed to glide through the mayhem of war without so much as a scratch. Once, he stepped on a landmine that, miraculously, failed to explode. Another time, he was trapped in a gunfire battle with no cover, but simply slipped the pantyhose over his nose and somehow came out unscathed. Even after his girlfriend broke up with him, Dobbins believed that the pantyhose retained their power. “No sweat,” O’Brien recalls him saying, “The magic doesn’t go away.”

One day, the company discovered a pagoda where they met two monks. The deeply religious and (atypically for Alpha Company) scrupulous Kiowa was uneasy about going in, believing that it was sacrilegious for the men to enter such a holy place. Still, the men camped out there for a week, as the monks waited on the soldiers. They took a special liking to Dobbins, dubbing him “Soldier Jesus.” The serenity of the place and the kindness of the monks even inspired Dobbins to consider leading a spiritual life after the war.

O’Brien recalls Dobbins as being more drawn to the idea of being nice to people as a minister rather than grappling with any weighty theological considerations, remembering Dobbins saying, **“All you can do is be nice. Treat them decent, you know?”**

### Taking a Life

**O’Brien vividly recalls the VC soldier he killed**. He describes him as a “dainty young man” who was left with a star-shaped hole in his eye after O’Brien’s grenade tore through him. O’Brien stresses that he did not kill him out of any personal malice, nor out of any moral or political conviction, or even out of a sense of military duty. Seeing the young enemy soldier pass by a few meters away, O’Brien simply pulled the pin on his grenade and lobbed it at him as a purely automatic function. It was not even an act of self-defense—O’Brien knows that this soldier would have almost certainly passed him by harmlessly had he simply done nothing. **He remains deeply traumatized by the experience, haunted by it even decades later.**

Azar, in his typically callous manner, described the body as being like “Shredded fuckin’ Wheat.” Kiowa, however, tried to comfort O’Brien about what he’d done, telling O’Brien that he had had no choice in the matter. It was war and it could have just as easily been O’Brien lying dead. Kiowa reminded O’Brien of the fatalistic circumstances of war—the man would likely have been killed anyway, if not by O’Brien, then by someone else. Critically, O’Brien remembers Kiowa urging him to _talk_ about his feelings instead of suppressing them. **Kiowa was encouraging O’Brien to fulfill his role as a storyteller.**

O’Brien then takes us through an imagined biography of the young man he killed.

(Shortform note: It is another example of the blurred line between fact and fiction and the subjective nature of even “true” war storytelling. O’Brien, of course, couldn’t have _known_ in any absolute sense the details of this soldier’s life, but he shares it with us anyway. The story is true, because it represents the _kind_ of thing that _did_ happen in Vietnam, and serves as a stand-in for the untold stories of the hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese who died in the war. Perhaps most importantly, it evokes the proper sense of shame and sadness in the reader.)

The young man was born in the village of My Khe around 1946, into a family that had resisted French colonialism (though the young man himself was not a Communist). **Like O’Brien, the young soldier was subjected to peer pressure from his community** about the necessity of military service. He was bombarded with stories about the famed military exploits of his family and how it was his duty to follow in their footsteps. **He, too, was afraid of disgracing himself.**

But he’d had no stomach for soldiering. He had a passion for mathematics and had wanted to pursue a scholarly life. He’d fallen in love with a classmate at the university in Saigon (whose photo O’Brien and Kiowa found on the young man’s corpse) whom he married, later returning with her to his village. **Giving in to the same fear of shame as O’Brien** , the young man enlisted with a VC battalion, where he was killed on his first day in combat.

### Imagined Conversations

After the war, a soldier from Alpha Company named Norman Bowker returns to his hometown in Iowa. **He is unable to find a meaningful use for his life after the war,** and spends his days and nights wistfully driving his car along the lake in his town, remembering friends lost and a life gone by. He thinks about his best friend from high school who drowned in the same lake and about his teenage sweetheart, Sally Kramer, who is now married.

**He imagines conversations that he’d _like_ to have with all the people in his life, but never actually does**. He fantasizes about visiting Sally and impressing her with his war-taught skill of being able to tell time without looking at a clock. He is haunted by the Silver Star medal for uncommon valor that he _almost_ won in Vietnam, but never did. **His life has become a series of regrets, unfulfilled promises, and dreams unrealized.**

He yearns to talk with people about his experiences, to tell his stories. He longs to have a conversation with his father, in which he shares the fact that he almost won the Silver Star. In Norman’s imagination, his father comforts him and tells him that he is proud of him anyway and that many soldiers who are brave nevertheless return home without medals. In Norman’s mind, he failed to win the Silver Star because he didn’t display bravery in the right moment. But Norman never actually shares any of this with his father.

Later, he imagines telling Sally about that terrible night where he didn’t win the Silver Star. The unit had been camped out, he tells her, in a field on a stormy night, which turned the dirt to mud. They had been warned away from camping in this particular field by the locals, but their warnings went unheeded, with First Lieutenant Cross even chasing the villagers away with rifle fire. Norman remembers the awful, all-consuming smell of this field, and how the rain covered the men in the filth. They realized that **they had settled down into a sewage field and were mired in human waste**. He even imagines Sally being offended when he describes the place as a “shit field.”

He pictures telling her about coming under heavy mortar fire in this awful place, how the mud and human waste oozed and boiled up into his face and even into his mouth. **And he remembers seeing Kiowa sinking into the vile ooze, and being unable to save him**. He remembers watching Kiowa drowning (it’s unclear if he was also hit by gunfire) and trying desperately to save him by grabbing his boot and attempting to pull him out. But he was unable to rescue his comrade.

_This_ is why he failed to win the Silver Star. _This_ is what he is haunted by. Throughout the war, he had been braver than he ever thought he could be, but **not as brave as he wanted to be—and _needed_ to be in that moment.**

### The Writer

O’Brien tells us that Norman Bowker shared this story with him in 1975, three years before Bowker hanged himself in the locker room of a YMCA. He had sent O’Brien a long, rambling, and disjointed letter in which he shared his thoughts on life after Vietnam; his resentment toward “patriotic idiots” who knew nothing about what the war was actually like; and his feeling that he had actually died back in the shit field all those years ago, rendering his life after that moment a mere addendum or epilogue to his story.

O’Brien thinks about how _he_ has made the transition from Vietnam to the world after. He has done this by telling stories, which he likens to clearing the throat. **Storytelling enables him to clarify and make sense of his experiences** , objectifying them and separating them from himself. He has told his stories, engaged in catharsis, in a way that Bowker never could.

O’Brien then reveals that he adapted the emotional crux of Bowker’s tale into a published short story, with some adaptations. For example, he condensed most of the action to a single time and place, of Bowker circling his car around a lake as he imagines unspoken conversations (apparently, the car circling is a literary device and Bowker didn’t _literally_ do this). He also changed Bowker’s name and used his _own_ hometown to color the scenery of the journey around the lake. Most notably, however, he omitted the part about Kiowa and the field, which he now feels substantially weakened the piece and robbed it of much of its emotional impact. O’Brien tells us that Bowker was disappointed to see these details missing. **His story had not been told after all.** He killed himself a mere eight months later.

### Blame

O’Brien reveals why he was unable to write about Kiowa’s death. It is because he feels that _he_ was responsible, not Bowker. Right before the attack, O’Brien and Kiowa had been talking together in the field, sharing stories from back home. O’Brien had shown Kiowa a picture of his girlfriend Billie and used a flashlight to illuminate the photograph. The light from the flashlight gave away the company’s position to the enemy, causing the firefight which led to Kiowa’s death. Naturally, **O’Brien is haunted because he believes he is responsible for the gruesome death of his friend.**

The next day, the men begin the mournful search for Kiowa’s body in the sewage field. Their boots sink into the filth as they wade through, trying to cover as much ground as they can. Eventually, they find Kiowa’s pack, containing a pair of moccasins and an illustrated New Testament.

Later, they find Kiowa’s submerged body, which requires several men to dig out from the muck. Finding the body causes the men to reflect on**the random nature of life and death in Vietnam**. What happened to Kiowa could just as easily have happened to any of them. Even Azar is driven to a moment of introspection after the incident. While earlier in the day he had been cracking jokes about Kiowa being “buried in shit,” he later tells his comrades, **“Those dumb jokes—I didn’t mean anything.”** After finding the pack, Mitchell Sanders becomes enraged at what he perceives as Lieutenant Cross’ incompetent decision to encamp the company in a sewage field, arguing that he ought to have exercised better field discretion and found a safer place for his men to spend the night.

**Cross, meanwhile, is stricken with guilt at losing _another_ man under his command**. He knows that he ignored the warnings from the villagers (and from Sanders) to avoid that field. It is _his_ mistake, he believes, that killed Kiowa. He silently laments the loss of Kiowa, remembering him as an upstanding young man who deserved far better than the fate he met. In writing to Kiowa’s father, Cross is unable to tell him the true awful and disgusting circumstances of his son’s death.

Cross observes to himself that a death always leads to an assessment of responsibility, a search for who or what is to blame. It could get very abstract and disconnected from the proximate events in the field—you could blame the politicians and generals who started the war, the American voting public, God, the military-industrial complex, or any number of other “responsible” parties. But in the field, the larger sociopolitical or theological context doesn’t matter: a single stupid decision (like Cross camping in the sewage field or O’Brien switching on his flashlight) could lead to a man getting killed. **Kiowa’s death is simultaneously _no one’s fault_ and _everyone’s_.**
