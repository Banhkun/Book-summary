## Chapter 4: Making the Pitch

Now that you understand frames and status, and how they affect your standing in your target’s eyes, it’s time to talk about the specifics of making your pitch. This chapter first delves into the mechanics of attention—what grabs it and what holds it—and then walks you through the first three (of four) phases of a successful pitch.

### Understanding Attention

In order to effectively command your target’s attention—not just spark her interest, but hold it—you must understand the factors that control attention. **A person is paying full and close attention only when she feels both desire and tension.**

These feelings are controlled by two specific neurotransmitters in the brain. Dopamine is the chemical of desire, curiosity, and interest. It can create interest, but by itself it’s not enough to hold it. Norepinephrine is the chemical of tension and enhances the effects of dopamine by threatening to take it away.

#### Desire

**Desire is your croc brain telling you that this thing in front of you will improve your life or your chances for survival.** It is one of your brain’s most primitive responses, and in order for your pitch to be successful, you must create a feeling of desire in your target. Without that urge, your pitch fails.

Dopamine is released **when you come across something new.** New things are pleasurable: the anticipation of something new causes us to anticipate a reward, which releases dopamine.

Dopamine is also released **when you’re presented with a puzzle.** We enjoy figuring things out. As discussed earlier, the croc brain likes simplicity. But at the same time, if something seems _overly_ simple, it’s boring. Our brains like a bit of a challenge.

Dopamine does have a dark side: **Too much of it triggers feelings of fear and anxiety.** Consequently, you need to get the balance right.**** You want your pitch to be novel enough to spark curiosity, and complex enough to spark interest, but not _so_ novel or complex to trigger anxiety.

  * Not novel enough, and it’s unimportant. Your target will ignore it.
  * Too novel, and it’s strange, or unrealistic. She’ll reject it.
  * Too simple, and it’s boring. She’ll, again, ignore it.
  * Too complex, and it feels unsolvable. She’ll resist it. We only enjoy puzzles if we feel we can ultimately figure them out. 



Desire, though, is just one half of the recipe. The other half is tension.

#### Tension

**Tension is the introduction of consequences. Consequences imply importance.** Even with desire built into your pitch, your target won’t pay full attention if there are no stakes. She may think you’re great, and really nice, but without more to compel her, she won’t have a reason to pursue you further.

**To create tension, you need to create conflict.** Many salespeople try to avoid conflict, just as we avoid conflict in our daily lives. However, with no conflict, your pitch is bland and easily forgotten. Conflict is the basis of interesting relationships and connections.

You can inject tension and conflict into your pitch with a series of “tension loops”—“pushes” and “pulls” designed to make your target feel you are rejecting her and then accepting her again. This activates her croc brain’s need for acceptance, making her instinctively want you to pull her in.

To do this, say something that indicates you might reject the target’s business (push), and then immediately follow it up by qualifying it with a more favorable statement (pull). There are three levels of push-pull tension loops that you can use to hook your target. You can incorporate these loops at any time during your pitch.

  * **Low-Intensity Tension Loop**
    * The push: “We might not actually be right for one another.”
    * The pull: “But then again, if we could find a way to work together, we’d accomplish a lot as partners.”
  * **Medium-Intensity Tension Loop**
    * The push: “There’s more to any deal than the idea alone. Ideas are everywhere, there are millions of them. What truly matters is having the right people behind the wheel. If you and I can’t see eye-to-eye on that, it’s not going to work between us.”
    * The pull: “But of course, that’s crazy talk. I can see you value people over ideas. I’ve known plenty of corporate types who can’t see beyond the numbers, and you are definitely not one of them.”
  * **High-Intensity Tension Loop**
    * The push: “Based on the vibe I’m getting here, it seems like this isn’t a good fit. I truly believe in only doing deals that both parties feel strongly about. So let’s wrap this one up, and maybe reconnect on another one.”
    * The pull here is a bit different. You’ve laid out an ultimatum. Allow her to respond. The pull is an unspoken expectation for her to stop you. Start packing your things. If your target doesn’t stop you, leave. 



#### Brevity

No matter how terrific your pitch, you need to wrap it up after 20 minutes. A person's attention does not last long. That’s not necessarily a reflection on your pitch. It’s just the way we’re wired. **After 20 minutes, you will start to lose your target’s attention.** Not only will her mind start to drift, but she will begin to forget what you’ve already told her.

Furthermore, if you continue to generate dopamine and norepinephrine for too long, you’ll eventually reach a point where they start to turn on you. Too much dopamine turns desire into fear. Too much norepinephrine turns tension into anxiety. So, keep it brief.

### The Pitch Itself

Now that you understand the basics of frame control, status, and attention, you can focus on the specifics of your pitch. Your pitch will have four phases. The first three of these will be covered in this chapter.

  * Phase 1: Introducing your pitch, yourself, and your idea (5 min)
  * Phase 2: Discussing the numbers, the competition, and the secret sauce (10 min)
  * Phase 3: Offering the deal (2 min)
  * Phase 4: Creating hot cognitions by stacking frames (3 min).



We will go into Phase 4 in further detail in Chapter 5.

#### Phase 1: Introducing Your Pitch, Yourself, and Your Idea

**Your goal in Phase 1 of your pitch is to grab your target’s attention.**

To do this, you’ll:

  * Introduce your pitch by letting your target know it will be brief. 
  * Introduce yourself with a summary of your past accomplishments. 
  * Position your idea or product against the current market climate with a “why now” frame. 
  * Outline the idea itself by highlighting its key elements.



This phase will take 5 minutes.

##### Introduce Your Pitch: Assure Your Target It Will Be Brief

Put your target at ease as soon as you open your pitch by letting her know that you will only be pitching for 20 minutes. “Let’s get started. I’ve only got about 20 minutes to run this down, which will leave us some time to discuss it before I have to head out.”

This lets her know she doesn't have to commit to an hour-long presentation, which is what she’s probably used to. It also lets her know that you have other places to be—telling her croc brain that you are popular, and by implication, valuable.

Keep to this time constraint. Twenty minutes is plenty of time to explain your idea. Remember that after 20 minutes, you will start to lose her attention anyway.

##### Introduce Yourself: Summarize Your Background

Give a brief overview of your relevant history. **Only include your run-away successes.** This is not an exhaustive review of your resume. A person’s impression of you is based on the average of the information she knows about you, not the sum. Tell her one really great thing, and she’ll think you’re really great. Tell her one really great thing and one so-so thing, and she’ll think you’re kind-of great, but also a bit so-so.

Spend no more than 2 minutes on this. For example:

  * “I earned my degree from Columbia and got my MBA from NYU.
  * I spent 5 years at KPMG, where my biggest home run was this sales program I did for General Electric. Added about $50 million to their bottom line.
  * I left about a year ago to pursue this idea.” 



##### Introduce Your Idea: Use a “Why Now?” Frame

**You must impress upon your target that your idea is new and emerging from current market trends that you recognized and are now taking advantage of.** Your target comes into your meeting with an unspoken question about _why_ your idea is relevant and why she should consider it _now_. By answering these questions before she’s asked, you assure her croc brain that you have a deep understanding not only of your idea, but of her concerns. Everything you say after this will have more meaning and will come across with greater urgency.

**To give your idea or product a strong “why now” context, frame it against these three market forces.** Ideally, include all three (though leave out any that aren’t obviously applicable to your idea).****

  1. **Economic forces** : Has anything changed financially in your market or the larger world that positively affects your idea? 
     * Changes in interest rates, inflation, and the value of the dollar are strong examples of forces that can open up business opportunities. 
  2. **Social forces** : Have peoples’ behavioral habits changed in ways that will support your idea? 
     * Newsworthy topics like concern for environmental issues are often a strong influence.
  3. **Technological forces** : What changes in technology are driving your industry or making your idea possible? 
     * Such changes can flatten existing business models and create new ones. Showing that you are ahead of the curve here can create excitement.



Be aware of the trap of “change blindness.” Our brains are trained to spot movement. We often cannot see changes if they happen without movement. For example, if you are inspecting two pictures for differences, you might not notice, say, a basketball net being swapped out for a ladder, because no movement was involved in the change.

Consequently, if you simply frame your idea as “Here’s how things used to be done, and here’s how we do things now,” you can’t guarantee that your target will make the full connections without you drawing the lines of movement.

Instead, show your target how your idea is _moving away from_ current models and _moving toward_ a new way of operating. Focus on _change_ : the most relevant _changes_ in your market and beyond; how these _changes_ impact costs and consumer demand; and how these _changes_ have opened a market window.**** Framing your idea against the three market forces shows your target how the market is _moving_ to support your idea.

As an example of how this might work:

  * “Costs for production on this product have just dipped below $5. This means we can retail it for $49. We’ve been waiting for two years to get to that price point. **(Economic forces; changes in industry)**
  * One of the changes in our society is a growing understanding of the importance of vitamin D on our health. People know they need more of it; there are headlines every day about it. **(Social forces; consumer demand)**
  * This product requires a microchip that can finally be manufactured small enough to ensure the product fits in a person’s pocket, allowing mass-market production.” **(Technological forces; market window)**



##### Outline Your Idea: Highlight Key Elements

When introducing your concept, your goal is to **position your idea as something novel but not _so_ novel that it poses a threat.** You want to grab your target’s attention but not trigger her croc brain to feel anxiety.

You can reduce anxiety by introducing your concept using the following basic introductory structure, laying out the what, the who, the why, and the competition. It hits on these key elements without delving into complicating details, giving your target a clear mental road map for where your pitch is headed. All further details you give after this will now have context, and she can listen to your message in a more relaxed state, since you’re not asking her to do the mental work of piecing the details together in a narrative.

The structure is:

  * “For [target customers]
  * Who are unsatisfied with [current market options].
  * My idea/product is a [new idea/product category]
  * That provides [key benefit].
  * Unlike [competing idea/product]
  * My idea/product [has these key features].”



For example:

  * For companies maintaining server rooms on the west coast
  * Who are dissatisfied with their inefficient air-conditioning systems
  * My product is a wall-mounted panel
  * That provides equal cooling power with 25 percent more efficiency.
  * Unlike portable air conditioning units,
  * My product uses minimal electricity and has no moving parts, ensuring easy maintenance.



#### Phase 2: Discussing the Numbers, the Competition, and the Secret Sauce

While your goal in Phase 1 was to grab your target’s attention, **your goal in Phase 2 is to _keep_ your target’s attention. **

In this phase, you’ll give a brief overview of the details of your pitch:

  * the numbers (budget and projections)
  * the competition (other current or potential players)
  * the secret sauce (your competitive advantage). 



You are entering the part of your pitch most susceptible to the trap of analysis, cold cognitions, and boredom. As you introduce more details, you introduce more opportunities for the croc brain to object and cool its enthusiasm. Of course, this part of the pitch cannot be glossed over or skipped if your message is to be credible. **The key is to be brief, competent, and efficient.**

You must also **find a balance between simplicity and complexity.** Remember that the croc brain gets bored with too much simplicity, but turned off by too much complexity.

In general, though, you don’t need a revolutionary way to present this information. This is the brass-tacks section of your pitch and **you’ll come across best if you simply present this information competently and professionally**.

This phase should take no more than 10 minutes.

##### The Numbers

Start with the budget. Budgeting is difficult and is a respected executive ability. Getting it right will set you apart.

Spend relatively little time on your projections. Projecting revenue is a simpler task that anyone can do. Your target will view your projections with a grain of salt anyway.

Keep in mind that any potential investor will expect you to paint your budgets and projections in an overly optimistic light. Distinguish yourself by not living up to these expectations, but instead delivering realistic numbers.

##### The Competition

After hearing your budgets, your target will naturally next wonder who you compete with. Most people don’t adequately describe the competition they face. When discussing potential competition, focus on answering these two questions:

  * How easy would it be for potential competitors to enter the market?
  * How easy is it for customers to switch from your product to your competitors’?



##### The Secret Sauce

The secret sauce is whatever prevents you from being a flash-in-the-pan company, shining brightly one day and passed over the next. It’s the one thing that will give you staying power against your competition: the “unfair advantage” you have over others, and what your competitive edge is based on.

Don’t take too long outlining this. As much as you may love this piece of it, and as special as your idea may be, remember the limits of your audience’s attention span.

#### Phase 3: Offering the Deal

**Your goal in Phase 3 is to offer the deal** : describe to your target what benefits she can expect when she does business with you.

Be clear and concise. Tell her what you will deliver, when, and how. Explain any roles and responsibilities she will take on. Don’t drill down into a lot of lower-level detail—tangential benefits and side points—but do include high-level details regarding what your target will get out of the deal.

Be brief, so that you can quickly move onto the next phase.

Phase 3 should take only 2 minutes.
