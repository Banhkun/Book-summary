## Chapter 6-8: Putting It All Together

You’ve now got a good handle on:

  * Recognizing and disrupting frames
  * Capturing situational status
  * Commanding and keeping your target’s attention
  * Packing your pitch full of hot cognitions to appeal to your target’s croc brain



In these last few chapters, we’ll discuss “neediness” and how it affects your pitch; we’ll look at a deal the author was involved in that demonstrates many of these ideas in action; and we’ll talk about your next steps as you start to master these techniques.

### Neediness Kills Pitches

There is nothing that can kill your pitch swifter than signs of your neediness.

**When your target sees you as needy, she sees weakness, and her croc brain tells her to run.** Thousands of years of evolution have taught us that weak people die and strong people survive. Your target does not want to die, metaphorically or otherwise, and does not want to partner with a weak person. Even if you’ve held your target’s interest all the way through and have made a fantastic pitch right up until the end, you can kill it by suddenly projecting even a momentary neediness.

**Neediness is a response to anxiety or disappointment,** and a pitch is chock-full of potential for both. The very premise of a pitch is that you need or want something from another person. It is naturally anxiety-provoking.

It can also be full of disappointments both small and large. Your target may stop cooperating by responding to a text or a phone call, or allowing someone to come into the room and interrupt (small disappointments). Or, she may cut you short before you’ve finished your key points, start to withdraw, or show signs of losing interest in your pitch (large disappointments). When we feel disappointment, we reflexively seek validation to “fix” it; this broadcasts neediness.

Although your neediness can be triggered at any time during the pitch, **the most dangerous time is the two minutes after you’ve laid everything out and are waiting to hear your target’s response.** Any mistakes you make here are amplified, because the focus is now on your target and her decision. A wrong move now can destroy all your hard work of the past 20 minutes.

This is a moment ripe with anxiety, and it can be tempting to try to close the deal here by saying things like, “So, what do you think?” or “We can sign right now if you’d like.” Unfortunately, this is straightforward validation-seeking and a clear sign, in your target’s eyes, of neediness. Resist the urge.

#### Don’t Be Needy

Approach every business encounter with a strong frame that says **you are valuable, competent, and needed elsewhere.**

  1. **Want nothing.** Tell yourself you don’t _need_ this deal: and believe it—it’s true. There will be other deals. Internalize the prize frame: _they_ need _you_.
  2. **Focus on things you do well; ignore everything else.** Be an expert in your area, and keep the conversation there.
  3. **Announce your intention to leave the encounter.** As mentioned earlier, put your target at ease up front by letting her know you’ll be done in 20 minutes. Mention you have somewhere else to be afterwards. Repeat this towards the end, so your target knows you mean it and is reminded of your time constraint. Don’t be afraid to pack up and leave if you are losing the pitch. If you pull away at a moment when your target expects you to pursue her, her croc brain will notice, and will see you as confident and valuable. 
  4. **At all times, consciously work to stop yourself from instinctively responding with neediness if your target pauses, thinks things over, or starts to look disinterested.** It is far better to sit there stony-faced and wait for her to break the silence, than to break the silence yourself with an approval-seeking question like, “Does it sound good so far?” The last thing you want is to get stuck in a downward spiral where her disinterest brings out your neediness, which pushes her away further, bringing out more neediness from you, and on and on until you’ve truly lost her. 



### The Airport Deal

One deal the author made exemplifies many of the techniques outlined in the book.

The author was recruited by a former colleague to pitch a deal for a renovation project of an aging airfield in southern California. If they won the bid, they’d be in charge of raising $1 billion of investment in the project. Their own company would rake in $25 million in fees, and Klaff personally would earn 30% of that. So the stakes were high.

He was up against two other companies vying for the role. Both other companies were larger, were better funded, and had more experience than his firm.

**He could not compete with these other companies on global status: both of them had more wealth, power, and popularity. He would have to create local star power for himself and establish situational status.**

He anticipated (correctly) that both of the other companies’ pitches would likely be filled with neocortex-suited messages. He knew that he could differentiate himself by aiming his pitch at his targets’ croc brains.

Instead of focusing on numbers, projections, and hard facts, as the other firms did, he pitched his idea as a way to build a legacy airport that would provide a link between the rich history of the airfield and the present-day community that had sprung up around it. He tempted his targets with the status and social rewards that would come with building such an airstrip. He knew that these desires are stronger than the more simple desire for profit.

Throughout his pitch, he used many of the techniques discussed previously:

  * **His pitch was only 20 minutes** , even though he’d been allotted an hour.
  * **He didn’t waste time on details unessential to the pitch:** his resume, or promises that his company would do everything they could to cater to their clients—everyone assumes this basic level of professionalism, so harping on these points wastes the target’s valuable attention span.
  * He used a **push/pull tension loop:** assuring the target that yes, this plan was bold, and if they weren’t comfortable working with such a grand vision, they wouldn’t be the right fit (push), but of course, if they did work together, their combined passion and financial know-how would win over any potential investor (pull). 
  * He used a **time frame,** letting them know he’d be wrapping up the pitch in five minutes.
  * He used the **moral authority frame** by talking about the community around the airport, and how his concept, unlike his competitors’, would include a community-strengthening program, further increasing the project’s legacy value. 
  * He made his pitch **personal, not analytical,** by talking about the townspeople he had met who would support his idea. 
  * He used a **prize frame** by ending his pitch with an invitation for the target to come to his office if they wished to further discuss the project. 
  * **He ended strong, not needy.** He didn’t ask for their business, he just left the invitation to his office stand. 
  * His firm got the deal. 



### In Sum: Three Insights

There are three principle insights into how you can win over your target’s croc brain.

The first is procedural: **You must be alert for oppositional power frames and you must win the resulting frame collisions** , thereby establishing your own, stronger frames as dominant. You must reinforce your higher status by perpetrating small denial and defiances.

The second is structural: **You need to package your ideas correctly.** Speak about them in ways that generate hot cognitions and avoid cold analysis. Create desire, with a sprinkle of tension.

The third is transcendent: **Use humor, and have fun.** Do this throughout your interactions. Even while under the surface you are fiercely fighting for dominance, you must do it all lightheartedly. Humor is a signal that you are confident enough to play around with a little conflict. It also signals that framing is a game, and invites others to join in.

### Becoming a Frame Master

Becoming a frame master takes time and practice, but it is fun from the start, and very rewarding once mastered. Learn the method by following these steps:

  1. **Start by recognizing beta traps.**
     * This is a low-risk way to get started on this method. In your daily life, start identifying anything designed to control your behavior.
  2. **Gradually, start stepping around beta traps.**
     * This may feel uncomfortable at first. You can work with a partner to practice. Eventually it will become second nature.
  3. **Identify and label frames you encounter.**
     * Start recognizing these and consciously naming them, to help your awareness. You’ll find they are everywhere. Power frames, time frames, and analyst frames are extremely common.
  4. **Begin to practice frame collision with safe targets.**
     * Safe targets are ones who won’t affect your career. Don’t barge into the CEO’s office tomorrow, take a swig of his soda, perch on the side of his desk, and start talking about a raise.
     * Use humor! Without humor, you’ll come across as rude and arrogant, and will trigger croc-brain defenses instead of engagement.
  5. **Practice push/pull tension loops.**
     * Get comfortable creating a bit of tension and conflict with those around you—again, in a lighthearted way.
     * Pause if you’re pushing too hard and are triggering defense responses. It may take time before you find the right balance. 
  6. **Have fun with it.**
     * If you’re not having fun, you’re not doing it right. Frame control is a game, and it needs to be enjoyable for both parties. 
  7. **Seek out other frame masters.**
     * Be alert for others who have mastered this game, then observe and learn from them. 
  8. **Keep it simple.**
     * Figure out a few frames that work well for you and stick to them. 



### Conclusion

Successfully pitching your idea often has less to do with the merits of your concept and more to do with the psychological maneuverings of the people in the room, as their primitive instincts collide.

Mastering the techniques laid out in this book is the first step toward understanding those instincts and crafting successful pitches.
