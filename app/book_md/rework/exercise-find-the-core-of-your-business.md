## Exercise: Find the Core of Your Business

To make the best use of your time and energy at work, focus on the essential core of your business and don’t get sidetracked by less essential parts.

* * *

What's the most essential part of your business? (To find this out, ask yourself: If I took away XX from my business, would I still have a business? Fill in XX with whatever is appropriate. For example, if you run a hamburger stand, you can take away the ketchup and the diet soda and still run a hamburger stand, but you can't take away the hamburgers.)

What are some of the less essential parts of your business? (For instance, do you produce a smaller “side-product” or accessory to complement your main product?)

Do you think dropping these “inessential” strands of the business to focus on the “core” instead would help or hinder your business? Explain why.
