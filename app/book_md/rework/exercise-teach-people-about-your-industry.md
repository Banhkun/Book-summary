## Exercise: Teach People About Your Industry

If you run a business, you’re an expert in a lot of things—probably more than you realize—and other people would like to learn what you know. Even if you don’t see yourself as social-media-savvy, you can make your brand stand out by teaching people about your particular business or the industry you work in.

* * *

What interesting or useful information do you know about the industry your business operates in? (For example, if your company makes tennis balls, you definitely know a lot about tennis balls, but you probably also know how to hit a perfect serve, what the best tennis clubs in the country are, how to teach tennis to kids, and so on.)

If you were going to teach the world the things you know about your industry, what would be the easiest format for you to use, and why? (For example, could you best explain your knowledge through the written word or through pictures?)

Plan out one social media post (either text-based or photo-based) that you could make to teach people something about your industry. Write down the general theme of the post, what specific text or photo you’d use, and how you might be able to link the post back to your product or service.
