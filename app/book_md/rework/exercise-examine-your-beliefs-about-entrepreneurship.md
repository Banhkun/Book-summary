## Exercise: Examine Your Beliefs About Entrepreneurship

Take a few minutes to examine your beliefs about what it's like to start a business.

* * *

Briefly describe your mental image of what an entrepreneur looks like. (For example, do you picture an entrepreneur (or a “starter”) as an MBA in a button-down shirt who works 100 hours per week? Or do you picture someone who tinkers in their garage, rides their mountain bike every day, and frequently borrows money?)

Now that you have an image in mind, ask yourself where that image comes from. (For instance, does it come from traditional depictions of entrepreneurs in the media?)

Do you have any evidence that your beliefs about entrepreneurship are true or untrue? Based on this, how might you revise your original description of an entrepreneur?
