## Principle 5: The Tiddely Pom Principle

The Tiddely Pom Principle, named after one of Pooh’s songs, is similar to the idea of the “Snowball Effect.” It relates to taking the first step of believing in yourself to allow the natural momentum of life to build toward happiness and contentment.

We all have something special and useful that we can offer the world. Often, we require some outward result or someone else to show us what our specialness is. But **if you want to be the architect of your own life, you must find a way to believe in your power and learn how to wield it**. You can use your gifts to make life work for you, rather than striving to be like others or waiting for fate to deliver what you want.

You are less likely to take risks when you don’t understand your power. You will come to unfamiliar circumstances with fear, and nothing new will be accomplished. This disbelief in your power makes you unable to believe in the power of the natural order of life, as well, and you miss out on opportunities to evolve.

> An example from the world of Pooh expresses this concept.
> 
> Pooh and the gang went on an expedition to find the North Pole. Along the way, Roo fell into a rushing stream and was swept away. Everyone was too busy worrying about Roo or shouting out advice to do anything, except for Pooh. Pooh wondered if there was something he might be able to do that hadn’t been done before. As he wandered along the stream, he found a pole and picked it up. He decided to stretch the pole across the stream, and when Roo came up to it, he was able to climb out. Christopher Robin asked Pooh where he found the pole, to which Pooh responded he just saw it and thought it might be of some use. It was then that Christopher Robin realized that Pooh had found the North Pole.
> 
> Pooh, in his simple way of following the path before him, recognized that perhaps there was something in the environment around him that could help in this new situation. **He believed he was capable of seeing what was around him and using it to serve his purpose.** That first step started the snowball effect of positive action, which led to a positive result.

### Tz’u, or Caring and Compassion

Taoists refer to this belief in oneself as _Tz’u_. This belief comes from the heart, and as Lao-tse wrote in the _Tao Te Ching_ , the “heart” is the first gift from which courage and wisdom grow. We all have the ability to be happy and use our gifts effectively. Some of us just choose not to. This decision is likely influenced by knowledge and cleverness, which come from the brain, not the heart, so they do not involve compassion. A lack of compassion equals a lack of wisdom, and a lack of wisdom equals a lack of courage.

**When you are courageous enough to believe you are special and capable of living harmoniously with the world, you’ll stop seeking outside validation.** You’ll believe in the goodness of your power and no longer feel the need to compete. This is the first step in the Tiddely Pom Principle, for as Lao-tse wrote, “A thousand-mile journey starts with one step.”

Wisdom, joy, and bravery are not distant concepts standing at the end of a long tunnel. They are immediately available as soon as you choose to start living with them. If you want to be happy, you must be grateful for what you have and who you are. If you want respect, you must take the first step of giving respect. Conversely, if you want to be unhappy, you should be dissatisfied with yourself and life.

Whether you live with hope or disillusionment depends on how you use the Tiddely Pom Principle to benefit yourself and the world. **The parts of you and the world that will help you be successful are likely already around. You just have to be willing to see them and use them.**
