## Exercise: How Satisfied Are You?

It’s easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of life. With so much going on, we often forget to stop and smell the roses. How has your busy schedule affected your life?

* * *

What are one or two ways you attempt to save time each day?

What do you do with that extra time?

Do you find the pace of your life satisfying? Is yes, how does it fulfill you? If not, why are you unfulfilled?

How might you change your life to find more peace or time to experience the energy of the world?

What is one goal you’re working to attain? How can you find joy in the process of attaining it?
