## Chapter 6: House of Sand

By early 2007, Greg Lippmann’s big gamble should have been paying off. Housing prices were falling, defaults were creeping up, but subprime bonds were somehow still standing strong. To him, it was almost **as if the market had believed its own lies about the value of these assets.**

And Wall Street’s continued delusions about subprime were costing him. With the swaps he’d purchased, he was paying $100 million in premiums, waiting for the bonds to go rotten. He was sure it was a profitable bet in the long-run, but it was costly in the short-run. He _needed_ co-investors like Eisman and the team at Cornwall in order to maintain his position. And even a dyed-in-the-wool market cynic like Steve Eisman was beginning to have his doubts. Lippmann had to act. **He had to _show_ Eisman just how arrogant and dumb the people on the _other_ side of their bet truly were.**

### Sin City

In January 2007, Lippmann flew Eisman and his team out to a giant annual convention of subprime lenders, speculators, and investors, dwarfing the similar convention Eisman had already attended in Miami. Given the excesses and financial hedonism of the subprime industry, the irony of the convention being held in Las Vegas certainly wasn’t lost on Eisman (nor would be the fact that Las Vegas would become ground zero for the housing market meltdown that was shortly to ensue).

Lippmann had Eisman meet a CDO manager named Wing Chau. Eisman hadn’t even known that there _was_ such a thing as a CDO manager (because what was there to manage?), but here was one in the flesh. Chau was a middleman whose job was essentially just to take triple-B tranches of original CDOs (again, themselves composed of subprime mortgage bonds) and repackage them into new towers of bonds. **He would then pass them off to unwitting investors like pension funds and insurance companies**. And by buying more and more mortgages to immediately repackage and resell, CDO managers like Wang directly contributed to the _demand_ for these bonds and the subprime mortgages of which they were composed. It was like a machine that nobody knew how to turn off.

And, to Eisman’s disgust, Chau was paid obscenely for doing nothing more than shuffling around stacks of useless debt. He received a 0.01 percent fee off the top of the total CDO portfolio he managed, _before_ any of the investors he theoretically served got paid anything (the opposite, if you’ll recall, of Michael Burry’s client-first business model at Scion Capital). This, of course, **gave the CDO manager every incentive to grow the pile of CDOs as large as he or she could** , no questions asked about the quality of the underlying loans. And 0.01 percent was a lot when you were talking about billions of dollars. In just one year, **a CDO manager like Chau could take home $26 million.**

Lippmann knew that a figure like Chau embodied everything that Eisman hated about Wall Street. He was**arrogant, mediocre, wildly overcompensated, and had his clients’ _worst_ interests at heart.** He was a living representation of the dumb wealth that Eisman found so appalling. Meeting Chau was just the sort of boost that Steve Eisman needed to continue shorting the subprime market. Not only did Eisman stand to make lots of money, but he would do so at the expense of the Wing Chaus of the world. That was a powerful enough motivation all by itself. After he left the dinner, Eisman pulled Lippmann aside and told him, **“Whatever that guy is buying, I want to short it...I want to short his paper. Sight unseen.”**

### Troublemakers

Unbeknownst to Eisman, Ledley and Hockett were _also_ in Las Vegas that same weekend. Like Eisman, they were aghast at the lurid spectacle of the subprime convention, and how eagerly investors seemed to be buying these toxic assets.

Everyone they spoke to had the same rationale: these loans had never defaulted in the recent past, so why should they now? They were **using the statistically irrelevant past to predict the unknowable future**. In fact, they underrated the chance of a catastrophe in the housing market precisely _because_ it would be such a catastrophe. They had deluded themselves into believing that nothing so cataclysmic could actually happen. In thinking this way, they were no different than gamblers riding a “hot streak” at the roulette table, fooling themselves into thinking that the good luck on the last roll of the dice had anything whatsoever to do with what happened on the next roll.

It was a marvelous look inside the sordid world of the subprime mortgage-backed securities business. Eisman, Lippmann, Ledley, and Hockett met all of the key players who did their part to keep this engine of financial doom going—the investment bankers at the big banks selling these poison bonds to unknowing investors, the people at the smaller banks who packaged the loans into those bonds, the intermediaries who reshuffled _those_ bonds into new CDOs, the loan originators, the CDO managers, and the people at the ratings agencies who gave the whole process their stamp of approval.

Eisman earned a reputation as a troublemaker at the convention. He couldn’t help himself when he was surrounded by thousands of (as he saw it) dumb, ethically compromised financial operators who were knowingly scamming the public. At one Q&A session, he harangued the CEO of Option One, a subprime lender known for making loans to particularly un-creditworthy borrowers. Eisman publicly called this man out as a liar, claiming that **the default rate in their portfolio of loans wouldn’t be five percent (as the CEO claimed)—it would be _far_ higher**, especially once the teaser rates on the loans expired and homeowners got hit with the higher payments on their adjustable-rate mortgages.

### Whistling Past the Graveyard

In February 2007, just after the convention in Las Vegas, a publicly traded, triple-B subprime bond index known as the ABX fell by more than a point on the bond markets. It was the first sign to the outside world that all was _not_ well in the housing markets. Yet to the dismay of the short investors, the subprime market kept humming along, as though there was no impending crisis. The big banks seemed to be blithely ignoring the crisis and **the ratings agencies refused to revise their positive ratings**. The big Wall Street firms were insisting that generic “market sentiment” was driving the value of the bonds down, _not_ the poor quality of the underlying loans themselves. The value of the bonds was completely divorced from the subprime loans underpinning them.

For the short-selling investors, it was as though they’d bought cheap fire insurance on a house that was already on fire. It _shouldn’t_ have been this easy—**their swaps were worth _far_ more than they’d been purchased for**. This incongruity became even crazier as the subprime bond indexes tumbled even further: by June 2007, **CDOs had lost 30 percent of their original value**. Ledley and Mai began to suspect that the markets were bluffing their way through the crisis, continuing to sell synthetic CDOs created from the original junk bonds. They had no choice: the banks were all so deep into subprime that they couldn’t _afford_ to change their position.

The complexity of the financial instruments helped the banks continue to fool the markets. No one on Wall Street really understood these products, how they worked, or what was in them. There was total asymmetry of information, with the information mismatch heavily favoring the likes of Goldman Sachs. Thus, the banks were able to dictate the terms of an inefficient market. **The prices of CDOs were whatever the banks _said_ they were**. Almost nobody had the knowledge (or was willing to do the work) to question this. Even the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), ostensibly Wall Street’s beat cop, had no clue what was going on with these derivatives.

### The Contagion Spreads

But the fiction couldn’t be maintained forever. Eventually, the big players on Wall Street began to feel the pain. In June 2007, **Bear Stearns announced that it had lost $3.8 billion on subprime mortgage securities.** Cornwall should have been delighted, as they had bought most of the credit default swaps from Bear. What was bad news for the investment bank was surely good news for Cornwall. But there was a hitch: Bear had taken such a beating that they might not have the liquidity to actually pay Cornwall the face value of the bonds that the latter had insured.

The exposure to the fallout from subprime wasn’t just limited to Bear Stearns. British bank HSBC also announced in 2007 that they had taken major losses in their subprime lending business. **These bonds were like a virus that had infected _all_ of the major financial firms**. And given the complexity of the CDOs, very few people inside or outside these firms could tell exactly _how much_ exposure they had to subprime. No one knew for sure just how much of these toxic assets were **littered across the balance sheets of the world’s leading financial institutions.**

Eisman and his team, in fact, set out to investigate which firms had long positions on subprime (whether these firms knew that they had these positions or not). They called it “the great treasure hunt.” They were looking to **take short positions against anyone who had made a bet that the subprime bonds would succeed** : in the end, Eisman’s team bought swaps against the banks themselves, the loan originators, and the ratings agencies, fully confident that the whole fraudulent business (as Eisman saw it) would blow up in their faces. In conducting his treasure hunt, Eisman was continually struck by just how foolish and inept so many CEOs at financial institutions really were. The Masters of the Universe were clueless: the emperor had no clothes.
