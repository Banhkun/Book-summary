## Chapter 5: Event-Driven Investing

By fall 2006, Gregg Lippman’s proposal (again, largely copied from Michael Burry’s strategy at Scion Capital) to short the housing market through credit default swaps had made the rounds in the financial world. But he still had few takers. Too many investors, it seemed, were leery about the idea of taking a short position against an asset that major players like Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Merrill Lynch seemed so sure about.

Two young, obscure start-up investors, however, heeded the call and saw the opportunity of a lifetime staring them in the face. Charlie Ledley and Jamie Mai had established their (admittedly short)financial careers by **betting big on events that Wall Street seemed certain wouldn‘t happen**. Profiting off the impending collapse of the subprime market fit perfectly into their theory of how the financial world worked.

### Charlie Ledley and Jamie Mai: Garage Band Hedge Fund

Ledley and Mai weren’t career Wall Street guys. They barely had _careers_ at all. Starting their fledgling money management fund, Cornwall Capital Management, with just $110,000 in a Schwab account, they were the sort of bit players that couldn’t even get a phone call returned at Goldman or Merrill. They were scrappers, a “garage band hedge fund.” In fact, they _literally_ started out of a backyard shed in Berkeley, California.

But they had a theory about financial markets that proved to be all too prescient—and that would give them a powerful advantage as the subprime market spun itself into a more and more complex web. Their insight was that **investors only understood _their own_ particular slice of the market**, whether it was Japanese government bonds or European mid-cap healthcare debt. Everyone was looking at the small picture, the micro. Cornwall’s strategy was to go _macro_ and look at the big picture. With information so unevenly distributed, **there _had_ to be pricing mistakes—assets that were priced for far more or far less than they were actually worth**, simply because investors didn’t understand what they were actually buying and selling. And that inefficient pricing mechanism could mean big money for the investors who _did_ understand and bought at the right time.

Cornwall’s first test of this theory was with Capital One, a credit card company specializing in issuing credit cards to Americans with poor credit scores. In the early 2000s, their stock had tanked amid fears that they had insufficient capital reserved as collateral to cover the risky credit cards they’d issued. The company soon got into a regulatory dispute with the federal government. The market smelled fraud and investors fled in droves. Despite this, Capital One wasn’t posting unusual losses. Upon speaking with a mid-level corporate manager at Capital One (the only person who would return their phone call), Ledley and Mai discovered that he was buying stock in his own company—not the behavior they’d expect to see from officers at a company engaged in fraud. They determined that Capital One was more or less a sound company, the regulatory dispute was trivial, and that **the market was irrationally penalizing them.**

For Cornwall, the stock was clearly underpriced at $30-per-share. The best way to profit off this was not to buy the stock itself, but to **buy the _right_ to buy the stock at a fixed price for a defined period of time**. And the _options_ to buy Capital One stock at $40 for the next 2.5 years cost just over $3 each. It was another asymmetrical bet. If the company really _was_ fraudulent, the stock would be worth nothing and your losses would be capped at $3-per-share of options that you’d bought. But if the company resolved its regulatory issues, the stock would likely jump to $60—double its current price and over 33% more than what you would pay per share once you exercised your options. It was a no-brainer. Cornwall bought $26,000 in Capital One options. When the stock rose, that position was worth $526,000. It was **a strategy based upon exploiting the false confidence of other players in the market**. They even came up with a name for it: “event-driven investing.”

### Getting in the Door

This strategy paid off handsomely for Cornwall. The market for stock options was wildly inefficient. If some external event would cause a stock to be worth either $100 or $0 within a year, it was irrational for an option to buy the stock at $50 to be priced as low as $3. But the market was littered with opportunities like this. Wall Street’s model followed a bell-shaped probability curve for stock prices:**** it mistakenly believed that a $30-per-share stock was more likely to increase to $35 per share than to $45 per share. **It assumed orderliness where there was, in fact, chaos.** This was totally at odds with reality. Wall Street seriously underrated tail risk: the ability of extreme events to change asset prices in either direction.****

By early 2006, Cornwall had $30 million in the bank. But Ledley and Mai were still small potatoes by Wall Street standards. They might have been high-net worth individuals, but they weren’t institutional investors—they weren’t managing _other_ people’s money, just their own. On Wall Street, they were still second-class citizens. This wasn’t just about recognition or social prestige. Their lowly status denied them the right to trade in the highly complex options—like credit default swaps—being sold through the quantitative trading desks at the big investment banks. **There was major money to be made, but Cornwall was locked out of the opportunity**. But when they hired Ben Hockett, doors began to open.

Hockett was a former Deutsche Bank trader who’d left Wall Street behind to trade derivatives from the comfort of his home in Berkeley Hills. He wanted to be closer to his family and away from the wild culture of the financial world. He had an apocalyptic streak and was hyper-attuned to the possibility of extreme events. After learning that his house was wildly overpriced and lay on a geological fault line, he immediately sold it and moved into a rental—fearing that he would be hit with the unlikely combination of a housing bubble bursting _and_ an earthquake. _This_ was how Ben Hockett thought about the world.

But for all his eccentricity as both a trader and an individual, Hockett was a respected figure at the major banks. And _he_ knew the right people to get Cornwall’s foot in the door. With a few well-placed phone calls and some meetings, Hockett got Cornwall its ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) Master Agreement, **giving them the right to buy credit default swaps from the likes of Greg Lippmann**. They now had a seat at the adult’s table.

### Shorting with a Twist

When Ledley, Mai, and Hockett heard Lippmann’s pitch, they recognized credit default swaps as just another type of option, the kind they’d been trading in for years. **The market had fantastically underpriced the probability of an extreme event** —in this case, the subprime world going up in flames. By October 2006, the doomsday scenario already seemed to be happening. Home prices were falling and borrowers were defaulting. The bonds were already turning sour.

But the team at Cornwall took a slightly different shorting position than did Eisman, Burry, Lippmann, and others. Instead of betting against the _lowest_ tranches of the CDOs, **they purchased credit default swaps that enabled them to bet against the _highest_ tranches**. Why would they do this? Because they saw that the triple-A bonds were just as vulnerable to collapse as the triple-B bonds, but the swaps against them weren’t priced that way.

As you may recall, the CDOs rated triple-B and those rated triple-A were **composed almost entirely of the _same_ types of subprime mortgage bonds**, which were in turn made up of the _same_ types of worthless mortgages to low-income Americans. There was no reason to treat them any differently, but the corruption and incompetence of the ratings agencies caused insurance (credit default swaps) on them to be priced as though they were completely different things. **A credit default swap on a triple-A CDO cost far less than on a triple-B because the market (irrationally) saw the triple-A as a safer class of asset.**

Obviously, these bad loans were _all_ subject to the same economic forces. **If _one_ subprime mortgage went bad, they were _all_ likely to go bad**. And all that was needed for the entire CDO to collapse was a 7 percent loss in the pools of home loans. Cornwall couldn’t believe the opportunity they were confronted with. On October 16, 2006, they bought $7.5 million worth of credit default swaps from Lippmann’s trading desk, betting against the double-A tranche (one rating below triple-A) of a CDO. Four days later, they bought another $50 million worth from Bear Stearns. Cornwall only needed to spend a fraction of the face value of the referenced CDOs. A small investment in credit default swaps translated to a potential enormous gain once the CDOs collapsed. **By February 2007, they owned $205 million worth of credit default swaps against double-A CDO tranches**. They had put their chips down.
