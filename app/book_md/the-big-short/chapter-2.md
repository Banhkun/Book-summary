## Chapter 2: Placing the Bet

We’ve seen how the big banks had foolishly hitched their wagons to the subprime mortgage-backed securities market, which suffered from fatal structural weaknesses. But for some savvy investors who saw the mortgage bonds for what they _really_ were, **the banks’ short-sightedness represented an unparalleled opportunity**. They could bet _against_ Wall Street’s position and reap enormous profits. This was the world of short-selling.

### Dr. Michael Burry: An Eye for Value

Dr. Michael Burry was, along with Steve Eisman, skeptical (to say the least) about the confidence with which Wall Street sold mortgage-backed securities. Burry was another outsider to finance, who’d come to Wall Street with an unconventional background and unique life story.

He had lost his eye at the age of two, when it was removed during surgery for a rare form of cancer. He wore a glass eye to replace the one he’d lost. Burry later would observe that this caused him to see the world differently, both literally and figuratively. Perhaps out of self-consciousness, **he had trouble with interpersonal relations and thought of himself as something of a loner.** To compensate for his social struggles (he would learn much later in life that he suffered from Asberger’s syndrome, a disorder on the autism spectrum), he learned to **analyze data with a rigorous eye to detail, seeing patterns that no one else could see.**

He was a medical doctor by training, who discovered a knack for investing and stock-picking when he was in medical school in the 1990s after studying the teachings of the legendary investor Warren Buffett. In his spare time (which, as a medical student, was rare) he started a blog on value investing that quickly became a favorite among traders and investment bankers—all of whom were amazed by his aptitude as a newcomer to investing and by the fact that he was doing this _while_ attending medical school. As a value investor, Burry specialized in identifying companies that could be acquired for less than their liquidation value—that is, **finding companies that the market was undervaluing**. This form of investing was a natural fit for the analytical and unconventional Burry, who saw things that others could not.

The success of his blog established Burry as an acknowledged authority on value investing. Eventually, he quit medical school to pursue a career in finance. Joel Greenblatt of Gotham Capital offered Burry a million dollars to start his _own_ fund, Scion Capital.

Scion was quickly delivering for its clients, no doubt due to **Burry’s keen insights about true value and risk**. He knew how to beat the market. In 2001, the S&P index fell by nearly 12 percent, but Scion was _up_ 55 percent. In 2002, the S&P fell by over 22 percent, but Scion was _up_ 16 percent. Burry believed that **incentives were the driving force behind much of human behavior** —and that his rival fund managers had poor ones. Most other managers simply took a 2 percent cut of the total assets under their portfolio, which they earned regardless of how their actually performed. Thus, their incentive was simply to hoard clients’ money, not to take the time and energy to _grow_ that money.

Burry believed this to be inherently unfair. Scion took a different tack, only charging customers for the actual expenses incurred running the fund. Burry insisted on profiting only when his clients profited first.

#### The Secret Sauce

But what made Burry so successful? How was he able to consistently beat the market by such wide margins? It turns out, he wasn’t really doing anything special. There was no insider trading. He didn’t have secret information or special technology that anyone else on Wall Street didn’t have access to.

**He was doing nothing more than buying stocks and analyzing companies’ financial statements**. But simply analyzing statements set him apart. No one else was bothering to do the hard, tedious work of actually studying up on the companies they were investing in.

A $100-per-year subscription to 10-K Wizard gave him access to all the corporate financial statements he could ever need. If that didn’t get him what he needed, he would sift through obscure (yet publicly available) court rulings and government regulatory documents to glean valuable nuggets of information that could change the value of companies and markets. **He was finding information in places no one else was bothering to look.**

#### Avant! Corporation

A great example of how this paid off for Burry was the story of Avant! Capital. He stumbled upon the company while sifting through court documents to identify firms that had settled lawsuits out of court. He reasoned that having been forced to pay a settlement would be **a good, low-key indicator of the kind of company that markets were likely to undervalue.**

Avant! had paid $100 million out of court to settle an intellectual property dispute claim. The firm was still bringing in $100 million in revenue and had a workforce composed of Chinese nationals on work visas, who wouldn’t be able to simply abandon ship if the company faced more trouble. Despite these positive trends, however, Burry discovered that the company was only valued at $250 million. Clearly, **the market was placing undue weight on the settlement and ignoring the fundamentals.**

But where the rest of the investment community saw garbage, Burry saw opportunity. He bought as many shares of Avant! Stock as he could at $12-per-share, and continued to do so as the share price dropped to $2. Of course, this was the exact _right_ time to be buying this stock. He became the company’s largest shareholder and was able to restructure Avant! to inspire new investor confidence. **Four months later, the company sold for $22-per-share.**

### Shorting

Given this background, Burry saw a rare opportunity in the subprime housing bond market, once again where no one else was looking. But this was a twist on his usual approach. Instead of looking for assets that were _undervalued_ , **he was going to target the subprime market because of his conviction that it was extraordinarily _overvalued_**. He was going to short the housing market.

(Shortform note: “Shorting” an asset is a way of placing a bet against it. If you believe, for example, that General Electric is about to sustain major losses, you can acquire borrowed shares of GE stock through your brokerage, with the promise to return those shares at a later, agreed-upon date. If the stock declines in value between when you borrow it and when you must return it, you earn a net profit on the transaction. If you borrow 10 shares of GE when it’s selling for $100 per share and then immediately sell those shares, you pocket $1,000. If they’re selling for $50 each when you need to purchase them in order to return them, your net profit is $500—$1,000 minus the $500 you now need to spend to purchase the stock.

But if the stock has _risen_ in value between when you borrowed the shares and when you must return them, you suffer a net _loss_ on the transaction. If GE is trading at $150 per share when you have to return the stock, your net loss is $500—$1,000 minus the $1,500 you now need to spend to purchase the stock at its higher price.)

Burry had, with characteristic fastidiousness, studied the underlying loans which made up the pool of mortgages being stuffed into the bonds. He saw that **borrowers with no income and no documentation were taking up a larger and larger share of the mortgages**. Lending standards had collapsed in the face of the market’s insatiable demand for subprime, as loan originators devised more and more elaborate means to justify loaning money to clearly un-creditworthy borrowers. As we’ve seen, **these loans were then being repackaged into bonds and sold off by the big banks.**

But how would Burry short these types of bonds? Their structure made them impossible to borrow, as the tranches were too small to individually identify. The market didn’t have a mechanism for an investor like Burry, who believed that the subprime mortgage bond market was essentially worthless. But Burry knew a workaround to this problem. He was about to dive into the world of credit default swaps.

### Credit Default Swaps

**A credit default swap is an insurance policy on a bond**. Like most insurance policies, the seller receives regular premium payments for a fixed term, roughly the same as an auto or home insurance policy might work.

For example, if you purchased credit default swaps on $100 million of GE bonds, you might pay $200,000 per year for 10 years. Thus, your losses would be capped at $2 million. But if GE defaulted on those bonds, **your payout could be up to $100 million: 50 times what you initially put down**. It was a classic asymmetric bet: fixed losses, but potential winnings many multiples over that amount.

![big-short-swaps.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/big-short-swaps.png)

**Burry saw that _now_ was the time to act.** Once the teaser rates on the subprime loans went away and borrowers started getting hit with higher interest rates (in roughly two years), **there would be a wave of defaults that would bring the mortgage bond market to its knees.** Once that started happening, lots of investors would be desperate to purchase insurance on the bonds they’d invested in—and the only way they would be able to do this would be through the credit default swaps that Burry would own.

But he couldn’t wait _too_ long to buy the swaps. Once the mortgage market started to crumble, the cost of purchasing insurance on subprime mortgage-backed securities would skyrocket, making his trade unfeasible.**Timing was key—he needed to corner the market on credit default swaps before the rest of Wall Street caught on** , while the swaps could still be had on the cheap.

But there was a hitch in his plan: there _were_ no credit default swaps for subprime mortgage bonds. The banks would have to create them. Furthermore, most of the big firms that _would_ be willing to create them might run into solvency issues and be unable to actually _pay_ Burry the returns on his swaps if his catastrophic predictions were accurate. They were too exposed to subprime. He ruled out Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers as potential credit default swap sellers, reasoning that**they were too deep in the subprime game to be able to pay him when the bonds failed.**

In 2005, only Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs expressed any interest. Burry hammered out a deal with them to establish a pay-as-you-go contract, ensuring payment as individual bonds failed. **In May 2005, he purchased $60 million in swaps from Deutsche Bank** , $10 million apiece on six separate bonds. Burry hand-picked these bonds after having read the prospectuses, seeing that **they were composed of the dodgiest, most questionable subprime loans.**

Eventually, he set up a separate fund, called Milton’s Opus, dedicated solely to purchasing credit default swaps on mortgage-backed securities. In October 2005, he told his investors that they now owned roughly $1 billion of such assets. **Some investors were outraged that Burry had tied up their money in (what seemed to them) such a risky bet**. The U.S. housing market had _never_ collapsed in the way that Burry had predicted. But Burry also knew that a full-on collapse wasn’t necessary for him to reap enormous profits. The way the swaps were structured,**he would make a fortune if even a _fraction_ of the mortgage pools went belly-up**. The banks barely seemed to understand what they had sold him.

But within months, the market was starting to see the wisdom of Burry’s move. Before the end of 2005, representatives from the trading desks at Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, and Morgan Stanley were asking Burry to sell back the credit default swaps he’d purchased—at very generous prices. Their sudden interest in this financial instrument, which he’d helped them create mere months before, could only mean one thing—**the underlying mortgages were starting to fail.**
