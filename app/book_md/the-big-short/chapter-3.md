## Chapter 3: Doubling Down

By February 2006, many of the savviest players on Wall Street had their eyes on Dr. Burry’s big bet. Other traders were curious why Scion Capital, Burry’s fund, had taken such a dramatic short position against mortgage securities and why Goldman Sachs, in particular, had been so eager to _sell_ him the credit default swaps. **What did he know that everyone else didn’t?** Greg Lippmann, the head subprime mortgage bond trader at Deutsche Bank, wanted in on the action.

### Greg Lippmann: Financial Mercenary

Greg Lippmann was a bond trader with a reputation for being bombastic, crass, and nakedly self-interested. He was known for humble-bragging about how much money he made from his annual bonuses and loudly complaining that he wasn’t being paid _enough_. Even within the money-obsessed culture of Wall Street, this was beyond-the-pale behavior. **Everybody was greedy, but you weren’t supposed to be so _transparently_ greedy.**

Although his nominal employer was Deutsche Bank, everyone who met him saw that he had zero loyalty to the bank or its leadership—he was in it purely for himself. This was also something he refused to disguise about himself, openly remarking, **“I don’t have any particular allegiance to Deutsche Bank, I just work here.”** But his own comically obvious self-interest also made him a keen observer of everyone _else’s_ selfishness and greed. He saw through the phoniness of Wall Street decorum and noticed that everyone was exactly like him.

In early 2006, Lippmann went to Steve Eisman’s office with a proposal to bet against the subprime mortgage market. (As we’ll see in the next chapter, Lippmann couldn’t execute the scheme on his own.) Of course, he had simply copied Burry’s idea, but he presented it to Eisman as his own original strategy. He told Eisman that **the underlying loans in the bonds would start to go bad even if housing prices _didn’t_ fall—all they needed to do was _stop rising_. **Borrowers would be unable to refinance using their homes as collateral, which would, in turn, trigger a wave of defaults. Lippmann noted that **first-year defaults were already up from one percent to four percent.** When the low teaser rates expired, that number would shoot up even more. Indeed, by the end of 2005,**Lippmann himself had taken a $1 billion short position _against_ the subprime mortgage bond market.**

He also showed Eisman the powerful compelling logic behind the credit default swap bet. You wouldn’t have to pay premium costs for long—most of these nominally 30-year mortgages were really designed to be refinanced and paid off within six years. 30 years became six when low-income Americans couldn’t afford their mortgages after the teaser rate ended and they were forced to refinance. Because the ability to refinance depends on the home’s value, ever-rising home prices meant homeowners would always be able to refinance and borrow more money. If you purchased swaps on $100 million in subprime bonds, your maximum losses would only be the fixed annual premium costs of $2 million per year—$12 million total for six years. But if the default rate rose from 4 to 8 percent,**you stood to reap the full face value of the original bond—$100 million.**

Finally, despite his skepticism, Eisman did the trade with Lippmann. The logic was sound. Premiums on even the worst subprime bonds were less than two percent of the face value of the referenced bond per year. This was a minor cost compared to what he would earn when the subprime market imploded, which was a certainty. It was spending $2 million to make $100 million.How could he _not_ seize this opportunity?

### AIG: Shadow Bank

For Eisman and others to whom Lippmann brought this proposal, it raised an important question: Why had Goldman Sachs been so willing to sell Michael Burry $100 million in credit default swaps? In doing so, they were making a bet that millions of poor and indebted Americans would be able to pay their mortgages on time. **No one believed that any major investment bank would be willing to make that stupid a bet** , no matter how outwardly confident they were in their subprime mortgage bonds. Goldman couldn’t have been the one left holding the bag. So who was?

The answer was American International Group, Inc. (AIG). The insurance giant was ideally placed to enter the credit default swap market. It was a sterling, blue-chip corporation that—crucially— _wasn’t a bank at all_. It was an insurance company. And weren’t credit default swaps just another form of insurance?

As a non-bank, AIG could dive into the world of swaps, long-term options, and other risky financial ventures without being subject to bank regulation. It could engage in speculation free from requirements to keep capital reserves against risky assets. It could be on the hook for $100 million in subprime mortgage loans without needing to disclose to regulatory authorities or its shareholders what it was doing. **AIG was operating in the shadows of the financial world,** where the regulatory spotlight didn’t shine.

AIG began insuring Goldman Sachs’ and Deutsche Bank’s subprime mortgage bonds as quickly as they could get their hands on them. From their point of view, the loan pools were sufficiently diversified that **there was little probability of them _all_ failing at the same time**. As far as AIG leadership was concerned, the premiums from the credit default swaps were free money. They could only lose if housing prices fell.

AIG, clearly, did not understand the nuances of the business in which it was no knee-deep. AIG was insuring piles of mortgages that it _thought_ were no more than 10 percent subprime—**in fact, that figure was over 95 percent.** By 2004, AIG was on the hook for $50 billion in triple-B-rated mortgage bonds. They had taken the long position, gambling on destitute American homeowners to pay their mortgages on time.

### The CDO: A Masterpiece of Complexity

Clearly, Goldman Sachs was fleecing AIG. The insurance giant seemed to have _no_ idea just how risky the securities that they’d insured actually were.

How did Goldman Sachs achieve this? By creating a masterfully complex and opaque financial instrument known as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO). Essentially, **the CDO was a product designed to conceal the true risks of mortgage-backed securities.** If you recall, the mortgage-backed security was a bond made up of thousands of loans. **The logic was that the bond _as a whole_ was secure**, as it was highly unlikely that the underlying mortgages would all tank at once—there was safety in numbers.

The CDO just applied this principle to the bonds _themselves.**A CDO bundled together the lowest-quality bonds into a whole new tower**_. It was a bundle of bundles. Bizarrely, the ratings agencies treated this repackaged product as an entirely _new_ financial instrument and slapped a triple-A rating on it (the highest rating that can be given to an asset). We’ll get into why the agencies assigned such high ratings to these dubious financial products later in the summary, but for now, it’s just important to know that these ratings defied market logic and common sense. The CDO wasn’t a new financial product at all—**it was just a Frankenstein monster made up of the dodgiest tranches of the original mortgage-backed securities**. Yet the ratings agencies treated it as a completely separate portfolio of assets. Apparently, to Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch (the Big Three ratings agencies), the CDO was greater than the sum of its parts.

If this sounds confusing or abstract, that’s because it was supposed to be. Complexity was baked into the design—**Goldman Sachs didn’t want customers like AIG to know what they were purchasing or understand the true value of the assets**. Opacity was the point.

#### Synthetic CDOs: Wall Street Alchemy

The issue was compounded even _further_ by the existence of synthetic CDOs. What are synthetic CDOs, and how did they amplify the problem?

An example comes in the shorts that the contrarian investors made. Essentially, Eisman, Burry, and Lippmann’s bets against the subprime mortgage market were more than just simple bets or insurance contracts. They were _themselves_ financial instruments that created their own set of cash flows—the gains they stood to make when the mortgage bonds went bad represented the losses of an actual investor who’d purchased the original bonds. **They were, in fact, a near replica of the original mortgage bonds** , just with the cash flows going in the opposite direction.

By the very act of purchasing credit default swaps, Eisman, Burry, and Lippmann had created a synthetic mortgage bond—one which could, in turn, be rated by the ratings agencies and packaged off to _another_ round of investors. _These_ investors (like AIG) didn’t know it, but they were essentially making a bet on the outcome of _another_ bet. And the process could replicate itself endlessly. New synthetics could be spawned from the first generation of synthetics. Wall Street didn’t even need to make new subprime loans anymore: **through synthetics, they could create new derivatives out of thin air.**

Thus, credit default swaps—an insurance product that, in theory, was meant to spread risk around and make the market as a whole more stable—ended up **greatly increasing the risk from and exposure to the original mortgage bonds**. The synthetics exponentially increased the size of the mortgage bond market. A $10 million CDO could be transformed into $1 billion of synthetics. It was pure speculation and abstraction—at this level, **investors weren’t even speculating on _actual_ assets like home loans and home buyers. They were betting on the performance of bets.**
