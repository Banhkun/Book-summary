## Exercise: Parsing Pessimism

Examine why skeptics and cynics turned out to be the big winners in the financial crisis.

* * *

Why were Eisman and the Cornwall Capital team so cynical about the financial system and CDOs specifically?

Explain, in a few sentences, why that cynicism proved to be so useful in predicting the housing crisis.

Is there something about which youâ€™re pessimistic or cynical, but that most people are positive and hopeful? Describe what this is and why you feel so differently.
