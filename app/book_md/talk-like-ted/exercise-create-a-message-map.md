## Exercise: Create a Message Map

Learn how to plan a presentation by creating a message map.

* * *

Imagine you’re creating a message map for a presentation on a topic you’re passionate about. Write the “headline” summarizing the main message you want to communicate in this talk. (Remember: Gallo advises keeping your headline below 140 characters.)

Now, outline three “sub-points” you’d make to support your main message. (For example, write three reasons why you believe your argument is correct, or three reasons why people should buy the product you’re promoting.)

Finally, outline the “supporting material” you’d include when discussing each sub-point. (For instance, would you tell a funny anecdote to entertain your audience? Would you tell a story that backs up your sub-point?)

Looking back at your completed plan, do you feel confident that you’d be able to give an effective speech on this topic? Why or why not?
