## Exercise: Devise a Shocking Moment

Shocking moments grab an audience’s attention and make talks memorable. Consider how you could incorporate a shocking moment into a speech or presentation.

* * *

Think of a presentation that you’ve given recently. Briefly outline the main point or idea of this talk.

During this presentation, did you incorporate any shocking moments? If so, what was this moment? How did your audience react?

If you had to give the same presentation again, how might you incorporate a shocking moment (or a second shocking moment, if you already featured one)? (Remember: You can use props, demonstrations, statistics, photos and videos, sound bites, and stories to create a shocking moment.)
