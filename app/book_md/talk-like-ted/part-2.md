## Part 2: Logistics | Chapter 7: Keep Your Talk Brief

The seventh principle of effective public speaking—and the first that relates to the logistics of your presentation—is **keeping things brief.** Whenever possible, you should limit your presentations to 18 minutes—the length of a TED talk.

### The Importance of Brevity

Keeping your talks and presentations brief is important for three reasons:

**1) It prevents your audience from becoming too tired to listen to you.** Research has demonstrated that the brain uses up a lot of glucose as it absorbs information, thus making listening to a speech or presentation incredibly tiring. If you talk for too long, you risk depleting your audience’s glucose levels to the extent that they simply don’t have the energy to keep listening. In contrast, if you only talk for a short time, your audience will hopefully not only have enough energy to take in your ideas, but extra energy left over that they can then use to share and act on your ideas.

**2) It takes the pressure off your listeners.** Studies have shown that the longer a speaker talks, the more anxious their audience becomes as they realize just how much information they’re being expected to absorb. In extreme cases, this anxiety becomes so overwhelming that the audience simply stops listening and disengages from the speaker’s ideas entirely. By keeping your talk short, you can avoid this situation.

**3) It promotes discipline as you craft your talk.** If you know that you only have a limited time to speak, you’ll put more effort into only expressing your key ideas and cutting out “fluff.”

#### What If You Have to Speak for a Long Time?

Sometimes, you can’t avoid speaking for a long time—for instance, if your manager orders you to give a one-hour presentation to your colleagues. In such situations, **every 10 minutes, take a “break” from the complex ideas of your talk.** For instance, you could play a light-hearted video that’s still relevant to your topic, but is less mentally taxing to comprehend than the facts and statistics that are the main “meat” of your talk.

Including breaks will give your audience’s brains a rest from listening to you, making it more likely that they’ll have the energy to take in the rest of your talk. Likewise, it’ll briefly remove the pressure on your audience to take in complex ideas, thus preventing them from becoming overwhelmed and mentally “checking out” from your presentation.

### Follow the Rule of Three

To make your talks brief, follow the Rule of Three, which**** states that **you should only communicate a maximum of three ideas in any one presentation.** For example, if you’re asked to give a presentation on your sales successes in the last quarter, pick just three transactions to discuss.

Following the Rule of Three will naturally reduce the time you spend speaking since you’re setting restrictions on the amount of information you’re going to communicate. **It’ll also increase the likelihood of your audience absorbing everything you say.** Research suggests that the maximum number of ideas that the brain can process at once is three: Add any more ideas than this, and your audience simply won’t remember them.

> **TED Talk Example: Neil Pasricha**
> 
> Neil Pasricha is a writer who came to prominence through his popular blog, _1000 Awesome Things_. Each blog entry discusses a different simple thing that can make you happy or enrich your life—for example, Christmas Day being snowy, or your birthday being on a Saturday.
> 
> When Pasricha was asked to give a TED talk on his blog, he knew he couldn’t mention all 1,000 “awesome things” in 18 minutes. So he limited himself to discussing just three things: having a positive attitude, indulging your inner child, and being authentic. Pasricha’s talk was a great success and has now been watched online by millions of people.

### Tell Three Stories

A version of the Rule of Three that’s used in many TED talks is the three-story framework. **This involves telling three distinct stories to explore and back up an overarching point.** The framework is beneficial to your public speaking efforts in two ways: Not only does it harness the rule of three, but it also incorporates the benefits of storytelling that we discussed in Chapter 2.

A notable proponent of the three-story framework is urban renewal expert Majora Carter. Carter’s 2010 TED talk was about the benefits of local eco-entrepreneurship: people developing business ideas that not only met the demands of their neighborhood but also addressed and prevented social or ecological problems. To demonstrate how powerful this form of entrepreneurship could be, she told stories about three inspirational people:

  1. **Brenda Palms-Faber,** a Chicago woman who started a business selling honey-based skincare products. Palms-Faber hired ex-convicts as beekeepers, thus helping them to get their lives back on track.
  2. **Andy Lipkis,** a man who persuaded the city of Los Angeles to plant grass and trees around inner-city schools instead of laying down asphalt.
  3. **Judy Bonds,** a coal miner’s daughter who introduced her hometown to green energy in the form of wind power.



Carter probably could have found and mentioned dozens of heartwarming stories of eco-entrepreneurship. However, she limited herself to three in order to keep her audience’s attention—and it worked. Her talk was a success.
