## Exercise: Use Humor

Consider how you might use humor in a presentation to increase your likability and get your audience on your side.

* * *

Think of a presentation you’ve seen that made you laugh. What did the speaker do that was so humorous? (For example, did they relate a funny anecdote, show a funny photo, or quote someone funny?)

Now, imagine you’re preparing a presentation on a topic you’re passionate about. What’s your chosen topic? How could you incorporate the types of humor you described above into your talk?

Which types of humor did the other speaker _not_ use that you feel you _could_ include in your presentation?

Do you feel confident that you could successfully incorporate humor into your next speaking event? Why or why not?
