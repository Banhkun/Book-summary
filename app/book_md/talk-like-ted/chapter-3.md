## Chapter 3: Present Something New

The next principle of becoming an effective public speaker is **using your talk to present something new.** This new content can take two possible forms:

**1) Information that was previously completely unknown to your audience—** for instance, a little-known fact about your area of specialty.

Make this information as niche and unexpected as possible to maximize the chances that your audience hasn’t heard it before. For example, if your area of expertise is space, present new information based on cutting-edge research that the general public probably isn’t aware of yet.

**2) An innovative new solution to an old and well-known problem** —possibly even a fix for an issue that previously seemed unsolvable. For example, when Albanian politician Edi Rama gave a TED talk in 2012, he presented a novel and unorthodox solution to the long-standing issue of crime in Albanian cities: painting previously dull and gray Soviet-era buildings in bright colors.

(Not only was Rama’s TED talk a success, but his approach to tackling crime was, too. As the buildings in the Albanian city of Tirana became brighter, crime rates began to fall.)

### The Importance of Presenting Something New

Presenting something new to your audience capitalizes on the human brain’s love of learning new things. According to neuroscientists, when we learn something new, the brain releases dopamine—a hormone that makes us feel good.**** Because this dopamine rush is so pleasurable, people constantly seek out ways to replicate it: In other words, they look for sources of new knowledge. **If you provide this knowledge during your talk, you’re more likely to keep people interested in what you’re saying.**

Likewise, because what you’ve said has made your audience feel good, they’re more likely to be receptive to you and your ideas. They’ll link what you’re saying with feeling positive, and they’ll respond with positivity in turn.

> **TED Talk Example: Robert Ballard**
> 
> Robert Ballard is a deep-sea explorer who’s best known for finding the wreckage of the _Titanic_. In 2008, Ballard gave a TED talk about the oceans, incorporating the things he’d learned from more than 100 deep-sea explorations.
> 
> During his talk, Ballard presented the audience with numerous little-known facts about the underwater world—for example, the fact that the Earth’s longest mountain range is under the sea. He also surprised the crowd with the knowledge that the deep seas are teeming with life, despite being cloaked in near-perpetual darkness.
> 
> Ballard challenged people’s perceptions of underwater biology and geography. His talk gripped the audience, who ultimately gave him a standing ovation.

### What If You Have to Repeat Old Ideas?

Sometimes, it’s necessary to include widely-known facts or opinions in your speech or presentation—for instance, to provide background information before you move on to your main idea. **To avoid boring your audience with this old information and consequently losing their attention, add novelty by packaging it in a fresh and innovative way.**

For example, an executive at SanDisk packaged old information (specifically, data about the popularity of high-capacity storage cards) in a new way by incorporating it into a story about his love of photography and need for such storage himself. This approach was so novel that his audience either failed to recognize they were being presented with old information, or didn’t mind. Most of the audience members graded the presentations they viewed that day as either “very good” or “excellent”—including the executive’s.

> **TED Talk Example: Hans Rosling**
> 
> In 2006, Hans Rosling gave a TED talk that used statistics to debunk various myths about the developing world. The talk ultimately went viral, with everyone from Ben Affleck to Bill Gates lauding Rosling’s ideas.
> 
> At the heart of Rosling’s TED success was the fact that he presented statistics in a novel way. For example, when discussing population trends in the developing world, he decided to present his statistics on an animated graph. On the graph, each country was represented by a “bubble” that grew and shrank according to changes in life expectancy and birth rates over time. This novel approach put a new spin on the old discipline of statistics, enthusing both its original audience and online viewers.

### Keep Learning New Things

To ensure that you have a constant flow of new information to include in your speeches and presentations, **consistently seek out new perspectives on and facts about the world.** For example, read books and articles on a variety of topics. Listen to talks by diverse speakers. Meet new people and listen to what they tell you. Visit new places and encounter different cultures. The more information you seek out, the more likely you are to discover something that will excite, surprise, and inspire not just yourself, but the audience of your next speaking event.
