## Exercise: Rate Your Speaking Skills

Being able to speak persuasively and confidently can increase your capacity for success in the working world. Before we learn about the principles of good public speaking, rate your current speaking skills, and reflect on what you hope to gain from this book.

* * *

Describe the last speech or presentation you gave. (For example, did you give the talk at work or in another situation? What specifically did you speak about?)

List three things that you think went well when you gave the talk outlined above, and three things that you think didn’t go so well. (For instance, did you speak confidently, or did your nerves take over? Did your audience seem interested in or bored by what you were saying?)

Out of the three things that didn’t go so well about your last talk, which one do you most want to improve next time around? Why is overcoming this stumbling block important to you?
