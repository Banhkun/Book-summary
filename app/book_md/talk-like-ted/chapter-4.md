## Chapter 4: Incorporate a Shocking Moment

The fourth principle of effective public speaking is **incorporating a shocking moment into your speech or presentation.** A “shocking moment” is an event that your audience doesn’t anticipate, but which deeply surprises, impresses, or moves them.

Including a shocking moment in your presentations will benefit you in three ways. First, **the unexpectedness of the moment will grab your audience’s attention.** They’ll become totally focused on what you’re saying and doing, and are therefore more likely to absorb your ideas.

Second, **shocking moments get people talking.** Your audience will rush to tell everyone they know about the surprising thing they just heard or witnessed. In the process, they’ll spread information about your talk and the ideas you communicated.

Finally, **shocking moments are memorable:** They frequently stick in an audience’s mind after your presentation. The more your audience thinks about the shocking moment, the more they contemplate the idea you were trying to get across—and the more likely they are to act on that idea.

### Why Are Shocking Moments Memorable?

According to neuroscientists, shocking moments are memorable because they’re **“emotionally charged”:** Our emotions are heightened.

Research has shown that when the brain recognizes we’re experiencing an emotionally charged event, it begins to perceive things more vividly. **We internalize even the tiniest details of what’s happening around us. Therefore, the memories we create of the event are much more comprehensive.**

For instance, if you think back to the morning of September 11, 2001, you probably remember everything from where you were, to who you were with, to how those people reacted. Because you were experiencing an emotionally charged event, your brain absorbed all of these details. In comparison, you may sometimes struggle to recall where your keys are. Since putting your keys down wasn’t an emotionally charged event, the details of what you did with them failed to stick in your mind.

Other studies have shown that **emotionally charged events are memorable because they cause the brain to release dopamine.** This is a hormone which, as well as being associated with pleasure, has the secondary effect of aiding information processing and helping to create memories.

### Create a Shocking Moment

To create an effective shocking moment, **first, identify the most important point you’re going to make during your talk.** Since this is the point that you most want your audience to remember, it makes sense to make it the subject of your shocking moment.

**Next, devise a surprising way to communicate this important idea.** Here are six methods you could implement:

  1. Bring an unusual prop
  2. Give a demonstration
  3. Include startling statistics
  4. Display a shocking photo or video
  5. Create a sound bite 
  6. Tell a surprising story



Let’s look at each method in more detail.

#### Method #1: Bring an Unusual Prop

Props are generally good at clarifying ideas that are too abstract to understand if only described verbally. For example, an audience is much more likely to comprehend what your product is if you show it to them rather than just telling them about it. **However, if your prop is unusual, it can also be used to create a shocking moment.**

Take the example of Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor. During her TED talk on her stroke, Taylor wanted to explore the idea that the brain is split into two hemispheres: left and right. To demonstrate this fact, she brought out a real human brain. Crowd footage shows that many people were disgusted by Taylor’s prop. However, the shock of seeing a real brain grabbed their attention.

#### Method #2: Give a Demonstration

This method is particularly useful if you’re presenting a product. **Give a demonstration that clearly showcases all of the item’s unique selling points and functions.** Your audience will be shocked by how impressive the product is, and will probably be encouraged to buy it.

Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was particularly adept at using this method. For example, in 1984, Jobs pleasantly surprised his audience by demonstrating the new Macintosh computer’s most unexpected features: its ability to play movies, and its ability to read out messages in a digitized voice. The crowd was enthusiastic, and the speech helped to generate buzz about the new product.

#### Method #3: Include Startling Statistics

Statistics usually serve the purpose of backing up your arguments. **However, if they’re particularly surprising, they can also be used to create a shocking moment.** For example, when giving a TED talk on psychopathy, author and journalist Jon Ronson revealed that one in every hundred people is a psychopath—a shockingly high figure that grabbed his audience’s attention.

To make a shocking statistic even more compelling, **explicitly state how it relates to your audience’s lives.** People are generally self-interested: They’re more likely to care about what you’re saying if you somehow make it about them. For instance, Ronson followed up his initial statistic on psychopathy with the revelation that based on that data, it was likely that 15 members of his current audience were psychopaths.

#### Method #4: Display a Shocking Photo or Video

This method is simple: **Find a way to include a shocking photo or video in your talk.** The more unusual and surprising the image or clip you use, the better. The visuals you pick could be shocking in a harrowing way. For instance, if you’re discussing the horrors of war, you could include images of war-torn communities to shock your audience into recognizing the pain that conflict causes.

Alternatively, the image or video you include could be shocking in a positive, awe-inspiring way. For example, in a 2013 TED talk, artist Raghava KK pleasantly surprised his audience by showing them a totally new art form: a digital portrait in which the subject’s facial expression changed to mirror Raghava’s mood. Raghava was wearing a headset that reported his brain activity back to his computer. The computer then interpreted this activity to figure out how Raghava was feeling and amended the mood of the portrait accordingly. The audience was amazed—they’d never seen anything like it before.

#### Method #5: Create a Sound Bite

Creating a sound bite means distilling your main argument into a short, snappy, and memorable sentence, and including that sentence somewhere in your speech or presentation. **You can transform your sound bite into a shocking moment by making it particularly emotionally charged.**

Here are a few examples of TED speakers who effectively crafted shocking sound bites:

  * **Adam Spencer:** “Numbers are the musical notes with which the symphony of the universe is written.”
  * **Amy Cuddy:** “Don’t fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it.” 
  * **Sir Ken Robinson:** “If you’re not prepared to be wrong, you’ll never come up with anything original.”



#### Method #6: Tell a Surprising Story

In Chapter 2, we discussed the importance of storytelling to public speaking. Stories play a crucial role in engaging your audience. **However, stories that are particularly dramatic are also effective at shocking listeners.** Nothing surprises people like a plot twist, and nothing shocks them like a harrowing tale of someone’s life struggles.

For example, during his 2013 TED talk, university president Freeman Hrabowski shocked his audience by telling the story of how, as a 12-year-old, he was inspired to take part in a peaceful civil rights demonstration in Birmingham, Alabama, after hearing Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. speak. Hrabowski ended up being arrested and sent to jail for his role in the demonstration, despite his young age. While he was incarcerated, he and the other young people in the jail received a surprise visit from Dr. King, who reassured them that their actions would benefit future generations.

> **TED Talk Example: Bill Gates**
> 
> Bill Gates’s 2009 TED talk arguably contained the most shocking moment in TED history. Gates’s speech discussed various global issues, including the threat that malaria-infected mosquitoes posed to some of the world’s poorest communities. Partway through his talk, Gates revealed a surprising prop he’d brought along: a jar of live mosquitoes. He then released the insects into the auditorium.
> 
> The mosquitoes weren’t infected with malaria, and therefore posed no risk to the audience. However, the act of exposing people to these potentially deadly insects was enough to shock both Gates’s audience and the world’s media, who reported on the incident extensively. Gates’s speech quickly went viral, and has now been viewed more than 5 million times on the TED website.
