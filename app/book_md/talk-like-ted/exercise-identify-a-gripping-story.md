## Exercise: Identify a Gripping Story

Telling a gripping story will engage your audience, help them understand your topic, and reinforce it.

* * *

Think of a topic you’re passionate about that you’d like to give a speech or presentation about. Describe this topic and what you’d say about it if given the chance.

Now, think of a story you could tell that relates to your chosen topic. Outline the main events of this story and its overall message. (Remember: You could tell a story about yourself, about someone else, or about a product or brand.)

How can you ensure that this story is gripping to your audience? (Remember: Gripping stories are detailed, unexpected, and mysterious. They also feature heroes and villains, and involve a character overcoming adversity.)
