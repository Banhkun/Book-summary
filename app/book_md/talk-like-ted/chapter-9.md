## Chapter 9: Be Yourself

The final element of successful public speaking is being yourself. **Let your true personality shine through as you speak.** For example, if you’re a naturally calm and measured speaker, don’t go on stage and fake being exuberant. Likewise, if you’re a naturally enthusiastic presenter, don’t tone down this element of your personality because you feel you need to be “serious” in professional situations.

Being yourself is important because, just as people can tell when you’re faking passion, **they can also tell when you’re faking your personality and pretending to be someone you’re not.** When they realize that you’re faking, they’ll start to distrust you—and they’ll be less willing to accept your ideas.

### Allow Yourself to Be Emotionally Vulnerable

Part of being yourself during a speech or presentation is**allowing yourself to be emotionally vulnerable:** giving yourself permission to express your true emotions as you speak. For example, if you’re giving a presentation a product that you’ve created, don’t be afraid to let your audience know that you’ve poured your heart and soul into the product and deeply care about its success. Likewise, if you tell a personal story during a speech, be honest about the emotional impact of the events you’re relating.

Many professionals resist showing their true emotions during a presentation. They worry that doing so will make them seem “weak” and result in judgment from their audience. However, allowing yourself to be emotionally vulnerable is important because**it shows your audience that you’re a human being who has feelings, just like them.** Your listeners will relate to the emotions that you express and will consequently feel connected to you. When you develop a connection with your audience, you increase the chances of them listening to and agreeing with what you say.

> **TED Talk Example: Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor**
> 
> In Chapter 1, we explored how Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor’s passion for her subject helped to make her 2008 TED talk about her stroke a great success. Gallo believes that another factor behind the success of Taylor’s talk was her vulnerability.
> 
> Throughout her talk, Taylor was honest about how her stroke made her feel. She related the anguish she experienced when she realized she was unwell. Likewise, she discussed the surprising peace that she felt when the left hemisphere of her brain shut down.
> 
> Taylor described this sensation of euphoria as “finding Nirvana”—an evocation of spirituality that Gallo argues most logic-loving scientists would be reluctant to bring up. He believes that Taylor’s willingness to be vulnerable and put this spiritual awakening into words is what made her presentation remarkable.

### What If You’re Not a Natural Public Speaker?

It’s easy to be yourself during a presentation when that “self” is a gifted public speaker. **But what if you feel that you’re not naturally talented in this area?** You might think that your only options are to be yourself and give mediocre speeches, or to pretend to be a strong speaker and come across as a “phony.” Neither choice will impress your audience.

In reality, most people who believe they’re intrinsically bad at public speaking simply lack confidence. **They have all the skills they need to be a strong speaker: They just need to overcome their nerves to let these talents shine through.**

If you struggle with anxiety around public speaking, Gallo advises**forcing yourself to do it anyway.** Practice speaking in public again and again until you prove to yourself that you _can_ do so successfully. Likewise, work hard to implement the nine principles discussed in this book. You’ll find that people will respond well to your presentations, which will give you the confidence boost you need to overcome your fears.

(Shortform note: For more tips on public speaking for introverts, read Chapter 5 of our summary of Susan Cain’s Quiet: The Power of Introverts.)
