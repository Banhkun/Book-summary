## Part 1: Content | Chapter 1: Pick a Topic You’re Passionate About

The first principle of becoming an excellent public speaker is **picking a topic that you’re passionate about.** For example, if you’re asked to give a presentation to your colleagues about one successful sale you’ve made this month, discuss the sale that excites you the most.

### Why Is Passion So Important?

Choosing a topic that you’re passionate about is important for a number of reasons. First, if you deeply care about the subject you’re about to talk about, **you’re less likely to feel nervous** **about your presentation.** You’ll be so excited about getting to share your passion with the world that the idea of your speech going wrong won’t even cross your mind.

Second, when you’re passionate about your topic, you’re likely to speak enthusiastically. **You’ll therefore be more interesting to watch** **than a bored and lackluster speaker.** People are more likely to actually pay attention to you and what you’re saying, and your message is more likely to sink in.

Finally, studies have shown that **feelings are contagious** —they spread from person to person. Therefore, if you speak with passion, your audience will feel your excitement, and they’ll listen intently to what you’re saying.

> **TED Talk Example: Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor**
> 
> In 2008, Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor gave a TED talk about a severe stroke she’d suffered 12 years earlier. She described in detail how she slowly felt her brain function deteriorating as the stroke progressed. Taylor also discussed the spiritual awakening that her stroke triggered.
> 
> The response to Taylor’s TED talk was overwhelmingly positive. It was the first TED talk to go “viral” online, quickly accumulating millions of views. In the aftermath of the talk, Taylor’s book detailing her stroke and recovery process became a bestseller and was translated into 30 languages. _TIME_ magazine named her as one of the top 100 most influential people of 2008.
> 
> Gallo argues that the key to Taylor’s talk’s success lay in her true passion for her subject. She was fascinated by and enthusiastic about the topic, not only because it related to a transformative experience in her life, but also because she was a trained neuroanatomist. Even before her stroke, Taylor’s life’s work and passion had been studying the brain and its workings.
> 
> This passion shone through as Taylor gave her TED talk. Her enthusiasm and energy were infectious, and the result was a speech that captivated millions of people worldwide.

### The Importance of Entrepreneurs Speaking Passionately

If you’re an entrepreneur, it’s important that you’re able to speak passionately about your product, service, or idea for two reasons. First, research has shown that **you’re more likely to secure funding from investors if you speak passionately about your business.** In one study, investors ranked passion as the third most important criteria when deciding whether or not to offer funds to a business leader.

Second, if you can’t muster passion when discussing your business idea with your employees, **they won’t feel passionate about the business either**. Consequently, they won’t care about the business enough to work hard on their daily tasks. It’s likely that your company’s performance will suffer as a result.

To ensure that you consistently speak passionately about your business, **make sure you** **genuinely care about the product or service you’re putting out into the world**. Lots of people pursue a business idea not because they’re really passionate about it, but because they think it’ll generate a quick profit. **Don’t fall into this trap.** If you do, you’ll struggle to recruit the people who really matter: committed investors and dedicated employees. Without them, it’s unlikely you’ll get your business off the ground, let alone make a huge profit.

### Can You Fake Passion?

What if you’re not passionate about the topic you have to speak on? For instance, what if your boss asks you to give a presentation on a prescribed subject? **Is it acceptable to _fake_ passion just to keep people interested in what you’re saying?**

In short: No. Research has demonstrated that people are astute at discerning when passion is genuine and when it’s false. When the people you’re talking to realize that your passion is fake, they’ll see you as a “phony,” thus making it unlikely that they’ll listen to you or take your ideas on board.

So what _should_ you do if you’re asked to speak on a topic that you don’t feel that passionate about? **The best option is to frame the topic in a way that _does_ excite you and appeal to your passions. **For instance, if your passion is bringing added efficiency to your workplace, and you’re asked to give a presentation on a piece of dull accounting software that you don’t really care about, focus your presentation on how efficient the software is.
