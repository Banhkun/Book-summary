## Exercise: Create Something of Value

Godin argues that to be an effective marketer, you must first **create something of value.** He cautions against creating a product and then trying to figure out how to sell it. Instead, he suggests identifying a group of people with a problem and then providing a solution to that problem.

* * *

Who's your core audience (the person or group of people you're marketing to)? What are some of the values that are important to them? (Your core audience might be your customer base, but could also be your partner, or friend group, whom you're trying to sell on an idea.)

What is a problem that your core audience struggles with?

Briefly explain how your offering (product, service, or idea) could help solve that problem.
