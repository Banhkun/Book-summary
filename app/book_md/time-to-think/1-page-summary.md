## 1-Page Summary

In _Time to Think_ , Nancy Kline explains that **what and how we think determines everything we do and say, and that the quality of our thinking is determined by how well we listen to each other.** By listening well to others, we can encourage them to engage in higher-quality thought and action—and when others listen well to us, they can encourage the same in us. Kline describes a step-by-step process for taking on the role of the listener to help someone else engage in higher-quality thinking, resulting in the generation and sharing of great ideas that lead to powerful action. By improving your thinking, you can improve every facet of your life, from work to family to relationships and even things like political engagement.

Nancy Kline is a teacher and researcher, as well as the co-founder of the Thornton Friends School in Maryland and director of the Time to Think leadership and coaching company. She’s also the author of nearly a dozen books, including _The Promise That Changes Everything_ , _More Time to Think_ , and _Living With Time to Think_.

In our guide, we’ll explain how high-quality thinking comes from high-quality listening, and we’ll explore Kline’s six-step process for a productive one-on-one thinking session from the perspective of the listener. We’ll discuss key components of the thinking process, including attention, assumptions, and important questions, and we’ll look at how the process can be adapted for a group setting. Finally, we’ll note some characteristics of a productive thinking environment. We’ll add research and ideas from other experts to expand on and supplement Kline’s advice.

### Good Thinking Comes From Good Listening

According to Kline,**all our actions are dependent on the thinking that precedes them. Further, our thinking is dependent on how well others listen to us**. Her research on students showed that while factors like age, IQ, and experience had little impact on the students’ thinking, the attention that others paid them had a significant impact. Therefore, she reasoned, we can teach people to think well, and in order to teach people to think well, people have to learn how to listen well to each other. She used this insight as a foundation for studying how to elicit good thinking from others by paying attention to them and treating them well.

(Shortform note: The type and subject of the thinking that Kline studied in these students is unclear, as are the methods she used in her research. In _Critical Thinking, Logic& Problem Solving_, the authors also argue that good thinking can be taught, but they suggest that practice (rather than listening) is the best way to cultivate thinking skills. They recommend a four-step process for practicing your thinking skills that involves gathering information, analyzing, evaluating, and then improving on your process.)

### The Thinking Session Process in Six Steps

**The key to evoking high-quality thinking in others is to listen to them well.** Kline provides a step-by-step process for conducting a productive conversation, or a thinking session, which maximizes the quality of both listening and thinking. You can employ such a session any time you want to help someone else think well, whether they’re attempting to solve a difficult problem at work, weighing their options regarding an important health decision, seeking to improve their relationships with others, brainstorming ideas for a creative project, or approaching any other situation that requires thinking. Similarly, if you need help thinking well, simply reverse the roles in the process listed below and have someone else listen to you.

(Shortform note: If you have a topic you need to think about and don’t have a listening partner available, other experts offer advice on how to think well on your own. In _The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking_ , Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbird explain that you can use techniques like trial and error, examining your perspective for bias, and gaining more knowledge about the topic at hand in order to think better.)

#### Step 1: Listen Attentively for as Long as the Thinker Needs

The first step in the thinking session process is to **give the thinker the opportunity to say everything that’s on their mind.** Kline explains that your job as the listener is to pay attention as the thinker spells out everything about the topic they’re pondering.

As a listener, begin by asking them what they think about the issue. Then, after they tell you what they think, ask them what _else_ they think about it. Continue asking this until the thinker is certain they’ve said everything they want to say, then double-check this by asking “Are you sure?” before moving on to the next step.

According to Kline, the reason listening works so well for producing high-quality thinking in others is because **when someone identifies a problem, the solution is usually buried somewhere in their mind**. The purpose of discussing an issue with someone to help them solve it isn’t to give them your ideas or decide what _you_ should do for _them_. It’s to provide an environment that prompts them to uncover the solution themselves.

Because of this, Step 1 may be all that’s necessary in a thinking session. Steps 2 through 6 are only needed if the thinker doesn’t come across the solution during Step 1.

> **The Connection Between Talking and Thinking**
> 
> Research shows that expressing our thoughts verbally helps us understand our thoughts. The thoughts in our minds tend to be condensed and unformed, but the cognitive process of putting them into words helps us access the full idea and triggers connections with new ideas. Additionally, it causes us to imagine the point of view of someone who’s listening to us, giving us a wider, more objective perspective. For these reasons, talking out loud to yourself can improve your thinking (another useful tactic if you have a topic you need to think about but don’t have a listening partner).
> 
> People also have differing communication styles, and Kline’s method of providing plenty of nonjudgmental space for sharing can help appeal to different styles. Some people suggest that some people have a talk-to-think style, meaning they process their ideas out loud as they’re expressing them. Others have a think-to-talk style, which means they reflect on and organize their thoughts before saying them out loud. A listening session with a talk-to-thinker might consist of a greater volume of talking, or it might begin with a lot of talking and then transition into longer periods of silence as the thinker considers what they’ve said. With a think-to-talker, there might be much longer pauses at the beginning of the session and more talking later.

##### The Importance of Attention

Throughout the thinking session—but particularly during Step 1—your attention to the thinker is paramount, explains Kline. **Your role is to give the thinker time and space in which to think, so you should listen quietly for the entirety of Step 1.**

Unfortunately, most of us were brought up to believe that good listening involves paraphrasing what the other person said and adding our own thoughts as often as possible. Kline argues that these behaviors limit the other person’s thinking. She adds that paraphrasing the other person’s words doesn’t actually indicate that you were listening well—in fact, it shows you _weren’t_ listening well enough to remember exactly what they said. According to Kline, the thinker’s wording and phrasing are the best: those exact words are the ones that are the most meaningful to the thinker and the most compatible with how their brain works, because they’re infused with the thinker’s background, knowledge, and experience.

(Shortform note: Many of us learn active listening, an approach that recommends paraphrasing another person’s words to show you’re paying attention. In addition to the issues Kline notes, paraphrasing another person’s words to show attention may cause other problems: It can make the speaker think you agree with them even if you don’t, and it can annoy the other person if you do it too much. However, summarizing what another person’s saying can help _you_ understand it better, so consider doing so silently so you don’t interfere with the other person’s thought process.)

**Interrupting the speaker to finish their sentence is also a bad idea** , according to Kline. This behavior shows the thinker that you think your words are just as good or better at conveying what they think, and it also shows impatience, which stifles good thinking. Because thinking requires time, there may be long stretches of time where the thinker is silent, but this still doesn’t mean you should interject your thoughts or try to prompt the thinker to continue. They’re using that time to process, and once they’re ready to continue, they’ll do so with greater understanding.

(Shortform note: Other experts note that interrupting people is also bad for you, as the listener, because you’re denying yourself the time to consider their words and hear additional information that could affect the idea you’re about to express. It also makes you look rude and impulsive. And keep in mind that different people process information at different speeds, so you may need to wait without interruption for longer periods with some thinkers than with others.)

##### Show Attention Through Eye Contact and Facial Expressions

Kline also asserts that **you should maintain eye contact with the thinker the entire time they’re talking**. The thinker’s eyes may wander, but yours must stay on theirs, and your expression should remain one of polite interest. Kline does note that there are some cultures where eye contact is seen as disrespectful, so **you should adapt her system to fit your culture and the culture of those participating in the conversation**.

(Shortform note: Culture isn’t the only thing that can affect a person’s ability or tendency to make eye contact and certain facial expressions. For example, blind people may not be able to perceive or engage in eye contact or normative facial expressions. Autistic people often find eye contact not only difficult, but genuinely distressing, and they’re often less facially expressive than allistic people. As Kline suggests in regard to different cultures, thinking sessions should be adapted to accommodate these differences.)

##### Let the Thinker Feel

Additionally, **don’t try to avoid or quash the thinker’s feelings as they talk**. While society has taught us that thinking and feeling are mutually incompatible, explains Kline, the reverse is actually true: Stifling emotions stifles thinking. In particular, crying is a natural physiological release that calms the mind and body and relieves pain. Allow the thinker to feel and express their emotions however they need so they can pursue their thoughts freely.

(Shortform note: Being able to express emotions verbally to another person can benefit not only thinking quality, but also emotional state. Intense feelings can cause the body to go into fight-or-flight mode, but _affect labeling_ (describing feelings in words) lessens this response and helps people feel better about the stressful situation. The clear structure of Kline’s recommended thinking session can also help the thinker avoid ruminating or fixating on negative feelings.)

If you reach the end of the first step, the thinker has said absolutely everything they want to say, and they haven’t uncovered the solution to their problem, you can move on to Step 2.

#### Step 2: Set a Goal for the Thinking Session

The second step in the thinking session process is to **have the thinker identify what they want to accomplish during the remainder of the session**. Encourage the thinker to state their goal clearly and succinctly, then memorize their goal in the same exact words. This will help you stay close to their original thinking as you proceed through the next steps.

This step is encouraging to the thinker: After exhausting their pool of ideas during Step 1, it can feel like there’s no chance of arriving at a solution and they should just give up. Setting a goal reminds them that there’s still plenty to be done before they throw in the towel.

Kline explains that they may need to think about their session goal for several minutes, during which you should wait patiently. They’re using this time to organize their thoughts and make a plan for the rest of the session.

(Shortform note: While setting goals will take some time, try not to get stuck on this step, as it can cause the thinker to fixate on their current state of not having achieved the goal. Feeling like there’s still a lot of work to do can actually be _dis_ couraging if they’ve already spent a lot of time thinking about this issue, so this may be a good time to remind them that you’re there to help them get to a solution. This makes it especially important to come up with a succinct goal so the speaker doesn’t feel like they have a huge, elaborate goal to reach.)

#### Step 3: Identify Assumptions That Limit Thinking

The third step in the thinking session process is to **identify the roadblocks that are currently preventing the thinker from achieving their goal**. Kline explains that these roadblocks take the form of _limiting assumptions_ , or beliefs that the thinker holds that curtail their ability to identify or implement the best course of action. There are three types of limiting assumptions:

  * **Facts**. These are statements of reality. For example, if the thinker is a college student who wishes their class had more hands-on activities, one of their assumptions about why they can’t change that might be, “I am not the professor.” That’s an objective, true statement. 
  * **Conjectures**. These are assumptions of things that _might_ happen. For example, if the thinker is a stay-at-home parent who wants to rejoin the workforce but is worried about missing out on time with their family, their conjecture-based limiting assumption could be, “My family will resent me for not being around as much.”
  * **Core assumptions**. These are fundamental beliefs that we’re often unaware of but that impact the way we think about the world. For example, if the thinker is having trouble talking to their partner about difficulties in their relationship, their bedrock assumption might be, “My needs are less important than keeping the peace in the relationship.” 



> **Limiting Assumptions, Cognitive Biases, and Untrue Facts**
> 
> Limiting assumptions can relate to or arise from cognitive biases. Like core assumptions, these are underlying beliefs we hold about the world that can distort our thinking. Biases provide shortcuts for our thinking so we don’t have to spend as much time or energy on making a decision, but because they’re often inaccurate, they can lead to highly flawed thinking in the form of assumptions and conjectures.
> 
> Using the examples above, the stay-at-home parent’s conjecture that their family will resent them for not being around as much might arise from the availability heuristic bias, which is the tendency to over-rely on specific examples that quickly come to mind rather than considering all pertinent information or possible alternatives. Thus someone might rely on the specific, easily accessible example of another parent who went back to work and whose family resented them.
> 
> Some people might have implicit bias that leads to stereotyping. An example of such a biased belief might be, “Women should stay at home to take care of the family.” The thinker who assumes that their needs are less important than keeping the peace in their relationship may be operating from the status quo bias, which leads them to think that any change in their current relationship dynamic will result in conflict.
> 
> Additionally, while facts are ostensibly universal and undeniable, we’re often taught “facts” that aren’t actually true, and certain types of facts (particularly scientific facts) can ultimately be proven untrue even if they’ve been held as fact for decades or centuries. Also, as Darrell Huff explains in _How to Lie With Statistics_ , facts can be manipulated or presented in a way that leads others to make inaccurate judgments. Thus, while you may be making an assumption that appears to be a fact, you should still examine it to make sure it’s truly reflective of reality.

To identify the thinker’s main limiting assumption, **take the goal they expressed in Step 2 and ask them what they’re assuming that prevents them from achieving this goal**. Once they pin down their assumption, memorize it word for word.

Again, your job as the listener is not to identify the assumption for the thinker, but to provide the setting for them to uncover it themselves, explains Kline. You may feel like you know what their limiting assumption is, and that therefore you know what the solution to their problem is. However, if you misidentify their assumption, there’s a high likelihood that you’ll offer them a solution that clashes with their actual limiting assumption, making your solution seem useless and discouraging.

(Shortform note: Some people note that when you try to identify the thinker’s assumptions and solutions for them, you’re making your own limiting assumption that you understand their perspective as well as or better than they do—which is impossible, because you’re not them. Such an assumption will hamper your communication with the thinker and make them feel misunderstood and alone. Remember that they’re a unique person with different thoughts, beliefs, and experiences than you, and don’t try to impose your own thinking on theirs.)

Once the thinker has identified their goal and their main limiting assumption, you can move on to Step 4.

#### Step 4: Ask a Liberating Question… and Then Keep Asking

The fourth step in the thinking session process is to **ask the thinker a _liberating question_ that challenges their limiting assumption**. According to Kline, this is a very specific question that’s based on the statements they’ve made about their goal and assumption (which is why it’s so important to memorize those). This question replaces the thinker’s limiting assumption with an assumption that frees their thinking, and as with the other aspects of the thinking process, it needs to be identified by the thinker.

**To help the thinker identify their liberating assumption, ask them what the converse of their limiting assumption is.** Do _not_ try to identify this for them. Again, the thinker chooses their specific words for a reason, because those words are more meaningful to them than any other phrasing would be. Always use the thinker’s words rather than your own.

For example, if the thinker wants to pursue a career change but they’re afraid to try, and their limiting assumption is “It’s not okay to fail,” your first thought might be that the liberating assumption would be “It’s okay to fail.” But if you ask the thinker what the converse of “It’s not okay to fail” is, they might instead say “Failing helps you grow.” So then, using their words, incorporate that converse assumption directly into your liberating question: “If you knew that _failing helps you grow_ , how would you go about _changing your career_?”

(Shortform note: Kline’s process of asking liberating questions is a type of coaching, or a way of guiding and supporting members of an organization to help them develop already-existing skills. This is distinct from a managerial approach, which is more appropriate when members of an organization are gaining brand new skills or tackling a role or task they’ve never encountered before. Employees in this position might not have the knowledge or skills needed to identify limiting assumptions and form liberating questions, so they would need more direct guidance. However, if your employees already have a strong foundation for what you’re asking them to do, a coaching approach could elevate their understanding and performance.)

**Note that simply saying “That’s not true” won’t dispel a limiting assumption.** To you as an outsider, the core assumption “My spouse might leave me if I am honest with them” may seem absurd, but to the thinker it’s a very real threat. It’s important that you take it seriously and not dismiss their feelings.

(Shortform note: Contradicting a person’s limiting assumption not only dismisses their feelings: It can also be redundant, as the thinker may already know that their assumption isn’t true but still believe it. Research shows that people often hold beliefs they know to be irrational, and that the cognitive process of identifying a thought as irrational is separate from the cognitive process of correcting that thought. Thus, pointing out that a thought is irrational is likely to be unproductive because it targets the wrong cognitive process.)

Once you’ve identified the assumption, work with the thinker to create a _liberating question_.**Use the following formula: “If you knew,” plus [the liberating assumption] (which we’ll discuss shortly), plus “how would you [go about reaching your goal]?”** Then ask the thinker the question and listen to their response, says Kline. As with Step 1, you should pay close attention and not interrupt, even when the thinker is quiet for a long time. After they answer the question, ask it again. Allow them to answer, and then ask yet again. While the question remains the same, the thinker will continue to generate new ideas on each occasion. Continue to ask the question until the thinker is certain they’ve answered it fully. When they’re out of ideas, you can move on to Step 5.

(Shortform note: While repeating a question can elicit new ideas, it may also make the responder feel like there’s a certain “right” answer you’re trying to get from them, a phenomenon known as “suggestive questioning.” This is another reason it’s vital to use the thinker’s own words in the question and to avoid adding your input as they talk.)

#### Step 5: Write Down the Liberating Question

The fifth step of the thinking session process is simple: **Have the thinker write down the liberating question they’ve identified, verbatim**. You might find that they struggle to remember it precisely, so make sure you help them get it exactly right. Even though you’ve asked them the question several times already, it’s easy to forget once they leave the session, so they need to write it down so they can refer back to it as they continue working on their issue.

(Shortform note: Writing down the question is useful to the thinker not only because they can refer back to it later, but also because the process of writing down your thoughts helps clarify and concretize them, helps you think about them on a higher level, and makes it easier to take action on them.)

#### Step 6: Appreciate Each Other

The sixth step in the thinking session process is to **express appreciation so that both the thinker and the listener leave the session feeling positive about themselves and what happened**. This appreciation shouldn’t focus on what you talked about in the session—meaning, the listener shouldn’t say “You did a great job generating ideas”—but should instead be a statement about what you respect about the other person, such as “I admire your teamwork skills” or “I appreciate your attention to detail.” Then when you receive appreciation from the thinker, don’t resist or argue with it. Simply say “Thank you.”

If you do this, at the end of the session, the thinker will leave feeling empowered about their problem and with many new ideas and possible solutions, and the listener will feel satisfied and encouraged about the work they did (and they’re also likely to have learned a lot along the way).

(Shortform note: Showing appreciation can be difficult, particularly in the workplace, because most of us do it so rarely that we haven’t built up the skills to do it well. However, research shows that it improves the mood of the person receiving the appreciation, as well as having physical and mental health benefits for the person giving the appreciation. Expressing appreciation for others also helps build trust, rapport, and a good reputation.)

### Thinking in Larger Groups

As individuals, our thinking determines the majority of our actions. However, many of the circumstances of our lives are determined by the decisions of _groups_ of people, like our corporate leaders determining our job responsibilities or our government representatives determining our rights with little to no input from us. To elicit the best problem-solving processes, it’s essential that these groups engage in the highest-quality thinking possible. The above process is designed for a one-on-one thinking session, but it **can also be adapted for group settings like work meetings, family conferences, or classroom discussions**.

> **Thinking Sessions in Remote Settings**
> 
> During the Covid-19 pandemic, many organizations began holding group meetings remotely via video conferencing applications like Zoom. Remote meetings have a different dynamic than in-person meetings because it takes more concentration to focus on video meetings and it’s more difficult to pay attention to body language and other nonverbal cues, among other things. This takes a toll on meeting participants and their engagement, a phenomenon that experts call _Zoom fatigue_. It can have a particularly limiting impact on problem-solving processes like Kline’s thinking session because of the high level of engagement and energy that these require.
> 
> If you participate in or run virtual meetings, be aware of how the remote setting impacts your meetings and consider scheduling shorter, more flexible meetings with plenty of breaks to prevent fatigue.

In group situations, **Kline emphasizes that you must highlight the positive before addressing the negative** , or the thing that needs to be improved (if improvement is the goal of the session). This means showing a lot of appreciation for each other and discussing what’s going well for everyone both at the beginning of the meeting and at the end. She says you should strive for a five-to-one appreciation-to-criticism ratio.

(Shortform note: Research shows the importance of appreciation in group settings: The greatest factor in employee engagement is feeling that employers care about their wellbeing and success. Beginning a meeting with appreciation and maintaining it consistently establishes these positive effects early and helps everyone feel more valued and comfortable.)

#### Taking Turns

The group setting means more turn-taking. Kline stresses that everyone must have a chance to share whatever they’re thinking, without interruption or contradiction. For this reason, group thinking sessions work best in smaller groups of around 12 or less.

(Shortform note: The average workplace meeting has about 18 participants, which can make turn-taking difficult. Others suggest that meetings even smaller than those Kline recommends are ideal, with some recommending meetings with nine or fewer participants and others noting that virtual meetings are most efficient with four or fewer participants.)

#### Allow Everyone to Reflect by Splitting Into Smaller Groups

As in the one-on-one sessions, the goal of group sessions is to identify limiting assumptions and replace them with liberating ones. The group can regularly reflect on these as a whole, but you can also divide the participants into smaller groups or pairs to ponder the assumptions that might be limiting the group’s thinking and the questions that would liberate their thinking. These small-group discussions should be timed at about five minutes per person in the small group to maintain the flow of the meeting. After the small group discussion, go around the room and let each person share what they thought about.

(Shortform note: The smaller group discussion format can also be adapted for virtual meetings using breakout rooms, or you can allow participants to brainstorm silently about the group’s limiting assumptions and add their ideas to a shared document. Additionally, in the classroom, research shows that the small group discussion is a more effective (and more popular) teaching method than the lecture, particularly when students come to the discussion well prepared. Using this knowledge, you might consider asking your meeting participants to work on identifying some limiting assumptions in advance so they can come ready to discuss them with their peers.)

### Characteristics of a Thinking Environment

Attention, limiting assumptions, and liberating questions are all aspects of the thinking environment that are directly incorporated into the thinking session process. However, other characteristics also impact how conducive a space is to good thinking.

#### Diversity and Equality

**Good thinking occurs best in a setting that’s reflective of reality, explains Kline, and diversity is reflective of reality**. The world doesn’t consist of just one type of person, so your thinking space should be filled with different kinds of people. Additionally, everyone should be on equal footing, with no one considered superior to anyone else—even if some people are higher up in the organization’s hierarchy. While people may have different responsibilities, everyone can be a brilliant thinker, and everyone should be given an equal opportunity to employ their brilliance.

> **How Diversity and Equality Impact Organizations**
> 
> Some people object to the idea of deliberately creating diverse groups and organizations, suggesting that such groups don’t perform as well as groups built solely with achievement in mind. However, research shows that teams perform better and engage in higher levels of thinking when they consist of participants with a variety of backgrounds and perspectives.
> 
> To foster a greater sense of equality in meetings, experts recommend engaging all members of the group as much as possible with hands-on, collaborative activities, changing the person who leads the meeting on a rotating basis so everyone gets a chance, and soliciting and implementing feedback from all members about how to improve future meetings.

#### Relaxed Atmosphere

According to Kline,**thinking spaces should have a relaxed, unhurried atmosphere that communicates to thinkers that they can take their time to do their best thinking**. Many business executives believe that conveying urgency gets better results from their employees or group members, and some groups even fabricate a sense of urgency deliberately to get these results. But this only leads to greater stress and less effective thinking.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest that a lack of urgency in the workplace results in complacency and reduced productivity, and that urgency helps with long-term planning and problem solving, as well as improving an organization’s reputation. However, others argue that a perpetual sense of urgency reduces innovation and makes employees fearful, while also undermining employee trust in managers. This suggests that in workplace-based thinking sessions, while everyone should be given plenty of time to think and share, it may be best to impose a time limit of some kind on the session.)

#### Cooperation, Not Competition

Finally, **your thinking environment needs to be one that encourages cooperation over competition**. Kline explains that our society tends to exalt competition as the key to progress. However, in reality, competition doesn’t guarantee that anything we do or create will actually be good: It only means our creation will be better than something else. **Competition obstructs thinking because it drives us not to do _well_ , but just to do _better_ than others. **And by limiting our thinking to what others are already thinking, Kline says, we close ourselves off to a wide range of possibilities.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that competition can sometimes be beneficial to creativity and innovation, and that whether it’s harmful or helpful depends on how it affects employees emotionally. As with urgency, fear-based competition is harmful and can increase the likelihood of unethical behavior, while competition that’s driven by a feeling of excitement enhances people’s work. For thinking sessions, encourage group members to think about the positive outcomes of what they’re working toward, and refrain from punishing thinking you don’t feel is “good enough.”)
