## Chapter 5: The New Sales Model—Optimism

Even if you’re able to create meaningful connections as a salesperson, you’ll still get more rejections than sales. The key to bouncing back from rejection, or being resilient, is optimism, the second component of Pink’s contemporary sales model. Pink recommends building optimism into the three stages of the sales process: your preparation, your handling of the sales conversation, and your evaluation afterward.

### Prepare: Question Yourself

Pink notes that the most difficult part of the sales process is usually hyping yourself up to get it started. The key is how you use self-talk. People talk to themselves all the time—sometimes it’s positive self-talk, mostly it’s negative self-talk, but all of it is generally “declarative.” Declarative self-talk states what something is, or what something will be. An example is “I am powerful,” or, “I suck and I’ll always suck.” Positive declarative self-talk is effective, but it’s also definitive, rather than open-ended. It doesn’t inspire growth or change.

Pink argues that the most effective style of self-talk is _interrogative_ ; people who use it outperform those using declarative self-talk. Interrogative self-talk asks questions instead of making statements. Asking questions prompts insight into how to do whatever you’re preparing for and how to get better results. It also gives your goals meaning, which helps you motivate yourself to achieve them.

> **The Five Categories of Optimistic Sales Preparation**
> 
> Sales experts note that when you use interrogative self-talk to prepare for a sales interaction, it’s important to focus your questions within categories that sharpen your understanding of your buyer’s specific needs. The goal is to know exactly who you are, who your buyer is, and what value you bring to the transaction. This builds both confidence and optimism. Consider the following categories and questions:
> 
>   * **Intention: “What are my intentions?”** Get specific. Ask yourself what the ideal outcome is for the transaction, both for you and for your buyer. Then identify topics important to your buyer and develop a set of questions tailored to those topics.
> 
>   * **Value: “Why is what I’m selling valuable?”** Get clear on your worth. Demonstrate respect for their time by preparing the talking points that will lead them to a quick and beneficial solution to their needs. Know the value of what you’re bringing to the table, and make it actionable.
> 
>   * **Structure: “What will the interaction look like?”** Create a blueprint for the transaction. Plan how you’ll open the transaction, identify key potential transition points, and try to time your questions or pitches to best match each transition point.
> 
>   * **Outcome: “What is my ideal outcome?”** Imagine how you want the interaction to go. Practice visualizing your idea of a successful transaction. Allow yourself to imagine it step by step, expecting a positive outcome. Pay attention to how you feel as you do this, and carry that feeling with you into the actual transaction.
> 
>   * **Research: “Is there anything else I need to know?”** Do thorough research. Be sure to know as much as possible about your buyer, their needs, and their goals. This allows you to understand the bigger picture while also attending to key details.

### Maintain: Communicate Positivity

After building optimism into your preparations, the next step is to maintain it during the sales process. It’s important to create a positive environment during a sale, both internally (for the seller), and externally (for the buyer).

Research indicates that there is a golden ratio of positive to negative experience. When you experience three positive sensations to one negative sensation, your well-being improves. When you experience 11 positive sensations to one negative sensation, your well-being _decreases_. A healthy ratio of positive to negative sensations makes the buyer more receptive, and more likely to take positive action (like make a purchase). Additionally, as a seller, when you feel positively about your product (as well as the sales process), you see a broader range of options and solutions, making it easier to connect with the buyer. This increases buyer trust.

Pink advises practicing positivity during a sale by expressing friendly emotions, using the 3 to 1 ratio when describing the positive or negative aspects of your product or service, and emphasizing your belief in it (“I’d personally pay more than I’m selling this for because I truly believe in the value of it”).

(Shortform note: While there is little doubt that positive experiences improve well-being, there is doubt about the legitimacy of the golden ratio rule. According to some studies, there is no scientific evidence that the mathematical formula the golden ratio theory is based on can be applied to feelings and well-being. The formula is reportedly based on fluid dynamics (a field of study within the physics family), and authors argue that the equations the original researchers came up with can’t measure changes in behavior or emotion.)

> **3 Ways to Maintain a Positive Sales Environment**
> 
> The environment you create can often make or break a sales transaction, and it’s not just about _thinking_ positively—your actions need to match your mindset. Consider the following tips for maintaining an optimistic sales environment:
> 
>   * **Use wording that inspires positive action.** For example, let’s say you’re trying to sell a gym membership to a buyer and they say something like, “I’ve never liked going to the gym,” you can shift the energy in a positive direction by asking “what would get you excited about going to the gym, and what can I do to help you have that experience?”
> 
>   * **Frame your buyer optimistically.** Identify opportunities to give your buyer genuine compliments or to acknowledge their strengths. For example, if you’re trying to sell sports equipment and your buyer is critiquing all the products, you might say something like, “I’m so impressed by your expertise. I can see how much you care about finding a high-quality product, and I’m excited to help you find one that meets your standards.”
> 
>   * **Demonstrate respect.** This is often easy to do when a transaction is going smoothly, but more difficult when there are bumps in the road. For example, if a buyer is distrustful, stubborn, or rude it can be tempting to get frustrated and match their energy. Instead, remain patient, positive, and calm. This will increase trust and help keep the buyer open to a purchase.

### Evaluate: Reflect With Optimism

In addition to integrating optimism into preparing for and conducting a sales transaction, Pink views it as equally important to reflect with optimism afterward because how we describe our experiences determines how we feel about them. If we have a bad day, and we think about how bad it was, we feel bad. If we are optimistic, we feel better.

Emphasis on the negative can lead to _learned helplessness_. Learned helplessness occurs when an experience of powerlessness persists to a point where an individual feels powerless even after there is no longer anything controlling their environment. It’s directly influenced by a person’s explanatory style. For example, let’s say you try to sell a product to your mailman and he impatiently or rudely rejects you. If you’re operating from a pessimistic explanatory style, you might say, “All mailmen are jerks,” or, “Now he’ll hate me forever,” or, “I’m a terrible salesperson.”

Those who are vulnerable to learned helplessness generally have these beliefs about negative experiences:

  * Negative experiences are universal
  * Negativity will last long-term
  * Negative experiences are your fault



The solution to learned helplessness is maintaining “flexible optimism,” or an “optimistic explanatory style” that sees negative experiences as:

  * Temporary
  * Due to circumstance
  * Impersonal



Consider again the example with the mailman. You can practice an optimistic explanatory style by saying, “He might have been behind on his route and in a rush” (circumstantial). Or, “He might have been having a hard day” (temporary). Or, “He might have just been irritable due to negative experiences with other salespeople” (impersonal).

> **Victim Mentality Versus Growth Mindset**
> 
> In a sales context, a victim mentality is detrimental and ultimately leads to chronic learned helplessness. When you see yourself as a victim, you prevent sales success because you begin to feel powerless and expect failure. A growth mindset leads to flexible optimism, supporting sales success by creating a sense of empowerment, confidence, and optimism.
> 
> A victim mentality looks like:
> 
>   * A perspective of powerlessness
> 
>   * Sensitivity to rejection.
> 
>   * Defeated self-talk
> 
>   * A sense of others being more capable.
> 
>   * A lack of willingness to take creative initiative.
>

> 
> A growth mindset looks like:
> 
>   * An emphasis on effort
> 
>   * A foundation of self-discipline
> 
>   * A resilient attitude
> 
>   * A sense of ownership.
> 
>   * A willingness to take creative initiative.
