## Chapter 6: The New Sales Model—Focus

The last component of Pink’s modern sales model is focus. According to Pink,_focus_ in a sales context is the ability to help people change their perspective, zero in on problems they didn’t know they had, and help to create solutions. There are two main obstacles buyers encounter in a transaction that focus can resolve: difficulty delaying gratification and difficulty imagining their future possibilities. Here’s how sellers can help buyers to resolve these obstacles:

**Problem 1:** Buyers often have a hard time weighing immediate rewards versus delayed rewards. We are more inclined toward instant gratification even if delayed gratification better serves our specific needs.

**Solution 1:** Give the buyer a way to do the “right thing” by default. Offer the buyer a solution to focus on that they can access immediately and requires no decision-making on their part.

  * Example: Let’s say you’re trying to convince someone to buy a gym membership. They can buy it for the full annual price, or on a month-to-month contract. You can help them focus and act by highlighting the benefit of paying annually over monthly. You can remind them that a one-time payment will inspire them to keep their commitment to their health by default, rather than giving them the opportunity to change their mind each month.



**Solution 2:** Remind the buyer of the long-term _consequences_ of accepting short-term solutions, and the long-term _benefits_ of delayed gratification. Get the buyer focused on how their purchase will improve their life in the long term, even though it will cost them resources in the short term.

  * Example: Let’s say you’re selling an iPhone, and you want the buyer to purchase insurance with the iPhone. You can remind them that although it will cost more upfront, it will save them money in the future if anything ever happens to their phone. On the flip side, you can make sure they understand that the short-term gratification of spending less money can cause them greater pain in the future by leaving their device unprotected.



> **Delayed Gratification Versus Instant Gratification**
> 
> _Delayed gratification_ in a sales context creates anxiety because there is a psychological awareness that a need is not being met. For example, if you’re hungry, and someone tells you that you can have a snack now or wait several more hours for dinner, you’ll probably choose the immediate option because it will meet the immediate need.
> 
> _Instant gratification_ is more appealing than delayed gratification, so sellers are best able to influence buyers if they can offer them something valuable that is immediately available. For example, in a sales transaction, if you’re selling gym memberships, and you have a client who is getting into exercise to boost their mental health, you’re more likely to be successful with your sale if you highlight that exercise will quickly boost their dopamine levels, creating immediate relief.

**Problem 2:** Research shows we’re not able to make an emotional connection between our present and future selves. Therefore, the idea of making choices based on what’s good for our future self rather than our present self is unappealing (it feels like making choices for a stranger), and our choices become less focused as a result.

**Solution:** Paint an image of the future self in a way that is familiar, yet improved. You can use a digital image, but in general, it can be done through description alone.

  * Example: Consider the gym membership example from above. To get the buyer connected to the long-term impact of their purchase, you can describe to them an image of who they might be, or how they may look and feel after a year of working out. 



(Shortform note: Persuading people to make decisions for their future benefit presents a challenge for public policymakers too. In _Nudge_ , authors Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein propose ways the government can encourage people to make beneficial long-term choices, including providing a default, or a choice that’s made automatically if the chooser does nothing. For instance, to get people to save for retirement, they propose that employers automatically enroll employees in a retirement plan while offering the option to opt out. Employers who do offer automatic enrollment have found that participation jumps, and few opt out.)

### Seven Ways to Develop Focus

According to Pink, there are seven approaches you can take to help a customer develop focus.

#### #1: Find the Problem

In Pink’s view, sales “movement” is less about _problem solving_ and more about _problem finding_. Buyers are more likely to allow you to provide them a service when they have problems they’re not aware of or need further understanding of. If they’re aware of their problem, they don’t need help from others, they can just solve it themselves. If they don’t have knowledge of their problem, that is when they need the support of others. That means the people who are most valuable in sales are not people who can quickly close a sale, but people who seek to discover problems with the buyer and determine pathways for a solution together.

For example, say you sell houses, and you’re working with a buyer who has a family of four. If you’re focused on problem solving, you might simply find the buyer a few houses in his price range with three or four bedrooms. If you’re focused on problem finding, you will take the time to ask the buyer questions about his family to identify their specific needs, provide him with a variety of options that meet those needs, make adjustments if necessary, and work with the buyer until a house is found that truly satisfies him.

> **Problem Finding Versus Problem Solving:**
> 
> Problem solving feels mechanical, whereas problem finding feels innovative. It allows you to make discoveries and connections you wouldn’t notice easily otherwise. Additionally, according to Einstein, identifying a problem is more important than solving a problem, because the solving of a problem requires little imagination—just the ability to engage in trial and error and the use of logic. Identifying a problem requires creativity, asking innovative questions, and unlocks new possibilities that didn’t seem to exist prior to the identification process.

#### #2: Create Contrast

Creating contrast by comparing items for your buyer also helps them develop focus. Research shows people are better able to understand or comprehend something when they see it alongside something else. “Compared to what?” is a critical question in the selling process. Contrast allows you to display the virtues of an option by, for example, displaying the flaws of another option. For example, if you’re selling a health supplement, you might compare it with other brands of the same supplement, and illustrate the differences between brands.

> **The Contrast Principle: Influencing Focus**
> 
> In _The Psychology of Persuasion_ , Robert Cialdini explores how comparison shapes the way we perceive things and how that can be harnessed for sales success. According to Cialdini, when we experience two things at the same time or one after another, we automatically compare the value of the second to the value of the first. Our opinion of the second item is heavily influenced by the way we perceive the first item. For example, if you’re buying a set of curtains, and the salesperson shows you a set that you consider to be extremely ugly, followed by a second set that you’d consider average on their own, the second set will seem better looking in comparison to the first. You’re automatically more likely to buy the average set than you would have been had they been your only option.

#### #3: Narrow the Options

Giving your buyer fewer options to choose from makes it easier for them to decide to buy. According to Pink, more options drive more initial interest, but fewer options increase the likelihood of a sale.

In a well-known Columbia University study, researchers set up booths at a grocery store for jam sampling. The first round provided 24 options, and the second round reduced that number to six. The study found that more people engaged with the booth in the first round, but the second round yielded more actual purchases. Cutting the options from 24 to six made a purchase 10 times more likely. The implication is that limiting options increases focus. Why? It prevents buyers from becoming overwhelmed by possibilities and allows them to fully evaluate available choices.

> **How Many Choices Should You Offer?**
> 
> When it comes to providing options, studies indicate that the sweet spot is to offer more than one but no more than three options to customers. When more than one option is offered, the customer feels as though their needs have been heard, and the seller is knowledgeable about what can meet those needs. More than three options overwhelms the customer, making them less likely to take any of the options. This is due at least in part to the “rule of three,” which stipulates that short-term memory capacity only comfortably allows for three significant pieces of information to be remembered at a time. More than three, and there is a risk of information not being retained and feelings of frustration. In short, the human brain is designed to thrive with simplicity, and sales representatives who cater to this have more success.

#### #4: Sell Experiences, Not Products

A fourth way to help create focus for buyers is to get them excited about the experience of using the product or service rather than its practical features. People identify more with experiences than material goods because, unlike practical or material products, experiences can be talked about and shared with others.

For example, let’s say you’re trying to sell a customer a basketball for their son’s graduation party, but the customer is not sure she needs one. You can help the customer develop focus by describing how the basketball might be used to enhance the party. You might describe how basketball can help to create an experience of community and entertainment for partygoers. The customer might realize that is exactly the experience she wants partygoers to have, and with that clarity, decide to purchase the basketball.

> **Why Is Selling Experiences More Effective Than Selling Products?**
> 
> Experiences often resonate more than products because:
> 
>   * **Customers are motivated to buy by their emotions.** Research shows that 90% of sales decisions are made subconsciously. We are, on the surface, seeking a product or service, but we are really paying more attention to how that product or service makes us feel. For example, you might go to a specific coffee shop regularly, not because the coffee tastes good, but because the employees treat you warmly.
> 
>   * **Experiences are easier to relate to.** You can discuss details of a product or service (for example, “with this cellular device you get 250 GB of storage space”), but you’ll connect more meaningfully with your buyer if you emphasize your experience with it (for example, “I have a passion for photography, so having the largest storage option on my phone allows me to hold onto all those memories”). According to research, only the language processing center of the brain is activated when people hear factual details, but more parts of the brain are activated when they also consider experiences.
> 
>   * **Modern buyers care more about what they do than about what they own.** Material possessions used to be a symbol of status, but have lost importance in recent years, partly due to the attitudes of millennials (72% prefer experiences to products), but the change applies to all age groups.
> 
> 


#### #5: Use Labels

The picture you paint matters. Labeling what you’re selling in a positive way makes it more attractive to the buyer, particularly if you use comparison (for example, you can describe the experience as one that most will never have and show the buyer why they are special if they have that experience).

There is value to including negative labels as well, to a point. People are more likely to buy after hearing mostly positive labels and a few negative labels than after hearing entirely positive labels. This is called _the blemishing effect_ , which means using a minor negative aspect of something to frame or enhance the positive. An example would be talking up a used car to a buyer, and then after highlighting all its best qualities, pointing out a minor negative detail. This minor negative detail highlights the positive details more dramatically.

The blemishing effect works best under two conditions.

Condition #1: Buyers need to be in a “low effort” state of mind—meaning they aren’t in a hurry to find a solution to their problem. An example is someone whose attention is on other things, like a busy producer always on their phone who just wants someone else to take care of the problem as soon as possible.

Condition #2: The negative information needs to be shared after the positive. The comparison of positive followed by negative moves the buyer to clarity.

> **How the Blemishing Effect Works**
> 
> Researchers have studied the impact of presenting negative information to people assessing the value of a product. The type of negative information varied, from legitimate drawbacks of the product to details that were inconsequential. The researchers found that people are more attracted to a product after receiving negative information as long as they have already received positive information that outweighs the negative information.
> 
> The positive information needs to come first because of _the_ _primacy effect_ , in which the first point a person hears in an argument is the point they are most attached to. Therefore, if they hear a piece of positive information about a product first, they will have a positive impression of the product. Hearing mildly negative information after the fact influences them to reassess for a moment, but as long as the positive outweighs the negative, they will double down on their positive impression. This is due to _attitude polarization_ , in which a person’s original opinion becomes more extreme after considering new (opposing) information.

#### #6: Emphasize Potential

Emphasizing the potential of a product or service also helps a customer decide to buy. For example, get a buyer excited about a new iPhone to replace their current one by emphasizing the fun new features they’ll be able to use or how it will improve their life. Studies show that the possibility of one day being skilled at something is more appealing than already having the skill. Why? Uncertainty. According to research, being uncertain makes you think more deeply about whatever is causing the uncertainty. This encourages you to imagine more possibilities and become excited by their potential. When selling yourself, frame your potential rather than your existing value. For example, if you’re seeking a promotion, share your goals for the position with your boss.

> **The Shadow Side of Uncertainty**
> 
> While uncertainty may encourage “potential-centric” thinking, too much uncertainty encourages buyers to stick with the products or services they’re used to—even if a new product or service would provide a better experience. For many buyers, uncertainty creates a fear of not getting what they want.
> 
> Jonah Berger, author of _Contagious _and _The Catalyst_ , believes uncertainty is one of five obstacles to influencing a person’s mindset (and therefore, their actions). People who are about to make a purchase want to feel certain of their decision. If they feel uncertain, they experience discomfort that they automatically want to avoid. As a result, buyers associate discomfort with the product, service, or seller, and may decline the transaction to avoid the feeling. Additionally, having a vague sense of a product or service leads to a devaluing of that product or service (known as _the uncertainty tax_).

#### #7: Provide a Path

A final way to bring focus is giving buyers an “off-ramp,” or a clear path to the resolution of a problem. Providing focus is not just about thinking, it’s about action. What moves people is not simply the identification of a solution or a goal, but a roadmap that shows them how to reach it.

> **The Power of the Call to Action**
> 
> One way to give a buyer an off-ramp is to provide a call to action.****A call to action is an easy way for the buyer to take an immediate, specific action. For example, when you buy a car, dealerships will often take care of registration, insurance, and financing so all you need to do is “sign on the dotted line and grab the keys.” When you don’t incorporate this strategy into your sales pitches, you are more likely to lose a sale or a customer. There are two lines of thinking that lead to this pitfall:
> 
>   * Assuming that the buyer has enough clarity and motivation to take action on their own.
> 
>   * Fear that a call to action is too aggressive and will push the buyer away.
> 
> 

> 
> Even if a buyer knows what they want, always give them clear information and directions. This will ensure a smooth closure of the sale. Rather than overwhelming buyers, having a clear, simple path to take relieves them of the pressure to act from uncertainty.

> **Focus in the Midst of Noise**
> 
> Your biggest challenge as a seller is to cut through the “noise” and get to the heart of your buyer’s needs. Noise can be anything that distracts from what you’re offering as a seller (examples include services that are more exciting or create a stronger sense of urgency, and truthfully, any other ways buyers can spend their resources elsewhere). You need to create a controlled environment for your buyer that helps them to focus on you and what you’re offering. One way to do this is by directly acknowledging and demystifying the noise upfront. For example, if you’re selling a cell phone service, you might identify each of your competitors by name and briefly note the ways they don’t serve your buyer’s needs.

### The Solution: Ask Clarifying Questions

According to Pink, asking the right questions improves focus by creating a better understanding of the buyer’s needs. It’s the key to getting results. If you’re preparing for a sales opportunity of any kind, three steps will help you to develop a great set of questions you should be able to use in most cases.

##### Step #1: Generate

Write down as many questions as you can think of that may be relevant to your interaction or transaction. Refrain from editing, and write them quickly, without curating.

##### Step #2: Enhance

Put each of your questions into one of two categories: Open-ended, or closed. Looking at your lists, consider the strengths and weaknesses of both styles of questions. Choose a couple of closed questions, and create some open-ended variations, then do the reverse.

##### Step #3: Prioritize

Narrow your questions to the three most powerful or significant. Edit them again to be sure they make sense. These are the questions you should lead with. Use these questions as a way to speculate on the general needs of buyers, but also ask them directly to build connection.

These steps are valuable for salespeople, but also for those doing other types of selling. For example, if you have a job interview, use the steps to develop questions to ask your potential employer.

> **How to Improve Your Questions**
> 
> Other sales experts note that sales success is not just about asking questions, but asking the right questions in the right way. Appropriate questions not only clarify what the buyer needs, but also allow buyer and seller to better build connection and trust. Here are five tips for asking better questions:
> 
>   * **Use the correct order of open versus closed questions.** Open-ended questions (that can’t be answered with yes or no) are most effective at the start and through the middle of a transaction because it helps to expand rapport and build trust. Closed questions (with yes or no answers) are best at the end when you’re ready to conclude the sale.
> 
>   * **Take each question one by one.** Allow the buyer to fully answer one question before you ask another. Otherwise you may overwhelm them and risk losing trust.
> 
>   * **Tailor your questions to the situation.** Rather than planning questions in advance, let them arise naturally so they are personalized to the interaction. This allows for a more genuine connection.
> 
>   * **Don’t be afraid to ask questions unrelated to the sale.** Asking less formal, more personal questions builds rapport.
> 
>   * **Refrain from answering your own questions.** You will always gain greater clarity if you wait for the buyer to answer your questions, rather than feeding them the answers you want them to have.
> 
> 


> **The Six Universal Principles of Persuasion**
> 
> Overall, the new sales model is a way to move others to act in a way that best serves their needs. How else can you move others to action? In _Influence_ , Robert Cialdini says that anytime people engage in a decision-making process, they follow a set of rules; he gives six principles (some with arguably questionable ethics) that help sellers to influence that decision. 
> 
>   * **Reciprocity:** If you want someone to agree to a request, do something nice for them just because—and then ask; they’ll likely feel compelled to do you the favor of complying. For instance, if you want to convince your friend to join the gym with you, treat your friend to a coffee, then broach the subject of joining the gym together.
> 
>   * **Commitment/Consistency:** People generally prefer to maintain a fixed sense of self. If you get someone to agree to something small, they will go out of their way to maintain that commitment if you make increasingly larger, related requests. Using the gym example, you might ask your friend if they’ll go on a weekly walk with you to help you stay motivated. Then work up to pitching them on the gym membership.
> 
>   * **Social proof:**This principle relies on the natural human instinct to belong in a social context, which influences conformity. If others are doing something, we are more likely to do it as well. So, in the context of a sales transaction, if you show a buyer a long list of positive reviews for your product or service, they are more likely to trust it. If the review comes from someone they know, they are even more likely to trust it.
> 
>   * **Liking:** This principle indicates that you are more likely to have a positive outcome with a buyer if they see you as someone they’d be friends with. Someone is more likely to comply with requests from people they know and like, people who are associated with those they know and like, and people who they believe like them. For example, your odds are better asking a friend than a neighbor.
> 
>   * **Authority:** This principle is about being seen as an expert in whatever you are selling. People are more inclined to do something if an expert or authority figure tells them to. Again using the gym example, you might show your friend research proving that people with workout buddies are more consistent than solo exercisers.
> 
>   * **Scarcity:** People find rare and exclusive things more appealing, so you can influence people to take your offer if you make it appear scarce or fleeting. For example, point out that you’re both so busy that partner workouts would be a rare opportunity to regularly spend time together.
