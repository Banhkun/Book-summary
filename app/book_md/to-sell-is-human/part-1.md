## Part 1: The Evolution of Sales | Introduction-Chapter 2: Everyone Sells

Pink argues that while we still think of sales in a traditional way, it’s changed. **Traditional sales values profits over people, and it serves the seller first.** But the sales industry has since evolved in significant ways, which we’ll discuss later in the chapter.**As a result, Pink defines sales more broadly as “moving” others to exchange one resource for another, whether it’s time, attention, money, or something else of value.** Selling can mean providing a tangible product or service in exchange for money (this is the type of traditional selling we’re familiar with), but much of what we “sell” or “buy” is intangible. In this guide, we’ll call the first type _traditional selling_ and the second type _contemporary selling_.

Compared to traditional selling (the type of sales job that one in nine Americans work in), contemporary selling is about persuading, influencing, or convincing others to give up an intangible resource. We sell ourselves on social media in exchange for likes, comments, and other attention. We sell our causes on GoFundMe pages. We sell our partners on cooking dinner or being the one to take the spiders outside. According to a study conducted by Pink, people spend 40% of their time at work in contemporary selling, and the skill is critical for professional success.

> **Can Everything Truly Fall Into the Category of Sales?**
> 
> While Pink views any job that moves others to part with a resource (whether it’s material, like money, or nonmaterial, like time and energy) as a sales job, many would consider his definition of sales to be a bit broad. After all, if sales is indeed primarily about moving others to give up any kind of resource, just about everything falls into that category, and in that case, what is the value of using the term “sales” to define it at all? For example, if we are engaging with romantic partners, and we inspire (move) them to share physical intimacy (a resource)—would we call that sales?
> 
> Many would argue that there are limits to the use of the term “sales.” In the Merriam-Webster dictionary, “sale” is defined in numerous ways, but each involves monetary gain. If monetary gain is not the focus of the transaction, is it truly sales? Or is a more appropriate term “service?” _Service_ is defined by Merriam-Webster in ways that include “contribution to the welfare of others,” and “useful labor that does not produce a tangible commodity.”
> 
> Why do semantics matter in this case?
> 
>   * The way we define words influences how we frame our experiences. When we define sales so broadly, we frame everything through a consumer lens. As a result, we may view our experiences as transactional, motivated only by “selling” our ideas, our causes, and even ourselves. In a consumer culture, this increases our vulnerability to manipulation.
> 
>   * The words we use both have and create connotations. Equating sales with service confuses the connotations of both words on their own. While sales techniques may be used in the context of service, that does not make sales service, especially given the way service is defined above (if you do something that contributes to the welfare of others, but you receive monetary or some other form of tangible gain, it ceases to be service by definition).

### How Did We All End Up in Sales?

Pink contends that in the modern era, sales has been redefined in two ways: profit through the sale of material goods is no longer the core focus. Instead, the focus is on _influencing buyers to act_ (and ultimately, buy). Additionally, the traditional sales philosophy has transformed to reflect the new power balance between buyer and seller in which both have access to product information. The old paradigm gave sellers a monopoly on information and therefore power, with profit being the priority. Now, that power is equal, and service to the buyer is the seller’s new priority. According to Pink, these shifts have three origins:

#### Origin #1: Economic Change and Need for Adaptability

Pink notes that in the past, a stable economy meant that business environments were predictable. Employers didn’t need workers to have adaptable skill sets. Employees knew what was expected of them week to week, and it wasn’t necessary to deviate. These factors allowed sales to become a concentrated skill set, and salespeople could become life-long sales specialists.

Since the heyday of traditional sales (encompassing much of the 1900s and shifting with the turn of the century), the economy has grown and is more diverse. The modern economy values movement, adaptability, and a broader range of skills. Everyone is now “selling” in some capacity. Having more people with sales skills has meant more profit for businesses. A flexible skillset cuts costs, because you have fewer employees applying a wider range of skills and essentially completing the same volume of tasks as were being completed within the traditional model. With a growing economy, a flexible skill set including sales is a major asset.

> **Sales Skills and Soft Skills Are Birds of a Feather**
> 
> As sales skills have become more critical for workers, so have interpersonal or “soft” skills, which are closely related: To sell, you need to be able to relate to people. So it's not surprising that both skill types are in increasing demand in the changing economy. Specifically, soft skills include social skills, emotional intelligence, time management, and handling conflict effectively. They're valuable because:
> 
>   * They allow you to connect effectively with others, and give you the ability to navigate obstacles such as conflict with others or personal limitations.
> 
>   * They keep you adaptable because they’re transferable to another job.
> 
> 

> 
> While it’s easy to see the value of soft skills, actually developing them is more complex. Given their personalized and often intuitive nature, it can be difficult to make them teachable or measurable. So how do you acquire them?
> 
>   * Try identifying soft skills you may already have and focus on strengthening them. For example, if you’ve ever played a team sport or worked in food service, retail, or hospitality, you’re likely skilled in adaptability, teamwork, and problem solving.
> 
>   * Also consider areas of work where you’ve experienced struggle, and determine which soft skills to fill in the gaps with. For example, if you struggle when customers or clients get upset, you may need to focus on improving or acquiring conflict resolution skills.
> 
> 


#### Origin #2: Rise of Technology and Entrepreneurship

It once seemed as though technology would eliminate the need for salespeople by automating the sales process online. But instead, Pink contends, the internet gave the masses access to information, which transformed the landscape of sales. First, the internet derailed traditional sales by shifting the information power balance (discussed further in Chapter 4) from seller to buyer. Second, it gave people who didn’t have the resources to run their own businesses access to free information, alternative business platforms, and new ways to build their own customer base. Anyone could become a self-starter, so entrepreneurs and startups became a bigger part of the economy.

Unlike larger companies, smaller businesses often don’t need, or can’t afford, specialized departments like sales. Entrepreneurs must wear many hats, nearly all of which involve moving others (for example, growing a social media following, motivating employees to work efficiently, securing outside funding for the business, and so on). In this way, the self-starter era has expanded contemporary selling.

> **Why Entrepreneurs Need Sales Skills**
> 
> While it might be tempting to argue that entrepreneurs are visionaries more than salespeople, the vast majority of entrepreneurial tasks involve sales for the following reasons:
> 
> **The best ideas are improvements:** Rather than being innovative, many of the most successful products are improvements on the original idea. For example, today’s big search engines like Google and Yahoo are based on the WebCrawler, which debuted in 1994. Entrepreneurs succeed by seeing the value of an idea and selling an improvement to a broader market.
> 
>   * **Brand is more important than raw value:** Many brands deliver nearly the same customer experience (for example, you likely won’t be able to tell the difference between Cheerios and an off-brand counterpart). This means the ability to differentiate and sell your brand or experience is critical to your success.
> 
>   * **Cash flow is critical to sustainability:** As exciting as it is to _generate_ ideas, you can’t _execute_ them without consistent cash flow. And developing a consistent revenue stream requires you to be a salesperson first.
> 
>   * **Products must continually meet customer needs:** You need sales skills to understand your customers’ evolving needs and adapt your product to meet them.
>

#### Origin #3: Growth of the Education and Medical Sectors

Pink believes that one of the most notable changes in the economy has been the creation of millions of new jobs in health care and education (which range from nurse practitioners to college test prep providers). He contends that the growth of these sectors is also driving demand for sales skills (in this case, the ability to persuade someone to part with their resources because it will benefit them). Teachers convince students that giving time, energy, and attention to class will benefit them. Doctors convince patients that doing unpleasant or uncomfortable things (like consenting to surgery) will support their long-term health.

> **Why Are Health and Education Growing So Much?**
> 
> Many factors are contributing to the growth of the health care and education sectors.
> 
> **Health care:**
> 
>   * **America’s population is aging.** By 2030, 72 million Americans will be 65 or older, increasing the need for health care services.
> 
>   * The increased demand is creating a variety of job opportunities. Additionally, many jobs in health care don’t require extensive education or credentials.
> 
>   * Pay is stable and often meets or exceeds the national wage average, which attracts potential employees.
> 
> 

> 
> **Education:**
> 
>   * Educational levels continue to increase globally. The UN had the goal of reaching universal primary education completion by 2015, and by that year, primary education enrollment in developing countries had increased by 83% from the year 2000 (91% enrollment overall).
> 
>   * People are recognizing the relationship between education and financial success. As a result of an early 2000s study, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development theorizes that if all children in developing countries were to meet national school system targets, overall income of these countries could increase 16% over 80 years.
> 
>   * **The evolution of technology requires continually updating skills.** Education was originally designed to serve the needs of the Industrial Revolution for workers who could perform repetitive mechanical tasks and follow directions. But now, education has to be updated to meet the needs of changing technology and the need for critical thinking skills.
> 
> 

> 
> It’s worth noting that the power imbalance in education and health care created by “buyers” lacking the information “sellers” have access to suggests that these sectors are actually more aligned with traditional sales than the modern sales environment Pink describes. For example, students (buyers) aren’t able to learn on their own the way they can learn with the support of an educator (seller), and patients (buyers) receive more accurate information from medical providers (sellers) than from a Google search. Further, these sectors are arguably more profit-focused than service-focused, considering the high costs of both education and medical treatment.
