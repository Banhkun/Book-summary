## Exercise: Practice an Optimistic Explanatory Style

Recall a recent experience of rejection (ideally in a sales context). Use the optimistic explanatory style to reframe the experience.

* * *

Think about how you felt after the rejection. Did the experience feel permanent? Why or why not?

Did the experience feel universal or due to circumstance? How so?

Did the experience feel personal to you? Why or why not?

How can you reframe this experience? (In other words, how can you optimistically describe it to others?)

How can you prepare for your next sale? What kinds of questions can you ask yourself to increase your optimism?
