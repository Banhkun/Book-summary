## Part 2: The New Sales Model | Chapter 4: Connecting With the Customer

The next three chapters focus on what Pink describes as an evolution from traditional selling to a methodology focused on meeting the buyer’s needs. He illustrates both methodologies with the acronym ABC. The first has been the mantra of profit-focused salespeople in the past, while the second is Pink’s reimagining of the model.

**Traditional ABCs**

  * “**A** lways **B** e **C** losing”
    * The dynamic between seller and buyer is akin to predator and prey
    * The singular goal is making the sale



**Pink’s Updated ABCs**

  * **A** ttunement, **B** uoyancy, **C** larity.
    * The dynamic between seller and buyer is akin to a service provider and someone seeking support
    * The goal is to persuade the buyer to “buy” by being of service



(Shortform note: In our guide, we’ll use more descriptive terms for the new sales model components. For attunement, we’ll use _connection_ ; for buoyancy, we’ll use _optimism_ ; and for clarity, we’ll use _focus_.)

> **Where the “Always Be Closing” Mantra Came From**
> 
> In 1992, Alec Baldwin played a salesman in the movie _Glengarry Glen Ross_ (originally an award-winning play written by David Mamet), and popularized the phrase: “A-B-C. A-Always, B-Be, C-Closing. Always be closing!” Baldwin’s character was the epitome of the “pushy salesman,” single-mindedly focused on making the sale, whether or not it benefited the buyer.

Chapter 4 explores the first component of Pink’s new sales model: connection. _Connection_ allows you to tune in to the context or perspective of others and adapt your own perspective or behavior accordingly. Like tuning in to a frequency, you adjust depending on the circumstances and the needs of the buyer or target. There is a difference between creating authentic connection and lying, however. Your motivation for connecting must be genuine (otherwise it can become mechanical or transactional); beyond that, your only other intention should be to use that connection to serve the needs of the buyer.

> **How Connection and Empathy Differ**
> 
> While empathy and connection are frequently used interchangeably, connection goes beyond empathy.
> 
> What is _empathy_?
> 
>   * Merriam-Webster defines empathy as understanding, being aware of, being sensitive to, and vicariously experiencing the feelings, thoughts, and experience of another.
> 
>   * In the context of therapy, empathy is “the ability to understand the feelings, attitudes, roles and perceptions and world of another.”
> 
>   * In the context of sales, empathy is the ability to understand what a buyer needs or what problem they need to solve, as well as building trust and creating connection.
> 
> 

> 
> What is _connection_?
> 
>   * Merriam-Webster defines _connect_ as "to become joined" or "to have or establish a rapport."
> 
>   * In a sales context, according to Pink, connection (which he calls attunement) allows you to look at the world through the eyes of the buyer, and try on their perspective in order to understand their needs.
> 
> 

> 
> While empathy, in general, appears to be about understanding the emotional experience of another person to create a foundation for connection, connection itself allows you to actually engage with the worldview of another person, which gives you a greater ability to respond to their needs.

### Four Qualities of Connection

Pink describes four qualities that allow you to sync up with others and adapt to their needs. When used correctly, each quality moves you closer to your sales goal.

#### #1: Humility

When you’re humble enough to allow the other person to be the focus and to have the power in a transaction, you’re more likely to move them.

> **Humility Is the New Road to Success**
> 
> When sellers had more information than buyers, the role of a salesperson was to flaunt their knowledge and play the expert. Now, with buyers having access to their own information, it’s no longer valuable for a seller to prove how much they know. More valuable than knowledge is a seller’s ability to ask the buyer what they need and how the seller can help. Humility in modern sales is about having confidence in what you have to offer, but also having the patience and maturity to offer yourself as a peer or partner rather than an authority.

#### #2: Emotional Intelligence

This quality allows you to connect to the emotional needs of the buyer, but also to objectively consider their thoughts and beliefs so you can act in their best interests. For example, let’s say you’re a wedding planner, and you have a devout Christian buyer who wants to find a catering company for her wedding. She says she wants the cheapest option, but it’s equally important that the company align with her faith. You have a cheap option you can offer her. You also have an option that costs a bit more, but the company offering it has a Christian background and prioritizes their beliefs. If you consider what you’ve learned about your client’s needs and beliefs, you might suggest the Christian catering company, highlighting that while the cheaper company would fulfill her immediate need, the Christian company might create a more meaningful overall experience for her.

> **How to Develop Empathy to Support Connection**
> 
> In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Daniel Goleman describes emotional intelligence as made up of five skills. Of the five, empathy (defined by Goleman as recognizing emotions in others) is the most relevant skill for sales positions or other environments where you need to connect with others. It can be strengthened through consistent practice. To improve empathy, therapists recommend strategies including: being curious about other people, stepping out of your comfort zone to interact with others, getting feedback from family and friends on improving your listening skills, examining your biases, and putting yourself in others’ shoes.

#### #3: Curiosity

Pink’s third quality for establishing connection is curiosity. Ask thoughtful questions to help you learn how your service or product can benefit the buyer. For example, if you’re trying to sell an iPhone, you can ask the buyer what some of their favorite daily activities are. Let’s say their answer is something relating to exercise—you might later show them the benefits of Apple’s “health” app.

> **Curiosity Drives Connection**
> 
> Sales managers seek curiosity in potential hires because they recognize that curiosity helps sellers connect with buyers and their needs, allowing them to create a more successful overall experience for both parties.

#### #4: Adaptability

This is the ability to recognize and respond quickly to change, whether it’s change in the selling environment or the needs of the buyer. For example, say you’re attempting to sell a health supplement and your buyer mentions suddenly an additional ailment they suffer from. Using adaptability, you might consider other health supplements you can pitch to the buyer that can be a solution to the newly uncovered ailment. Ambiverts often make great salespeople because they have both introvert and extrovert qualities, allowing them to adapt to their environment or to a specific customer.

> **Adapting to Market Changes**
> 
> Given that the marketplace is constantly changing (as a result of the technology boom and the elimination of the information gap), success and long-term security in sales require being able to pivot with change. For example, research reveals that 60% of the online buying process takes place before the customer connects with a salesperson. To adapt, successful salespeople customize their assistance instead of focusing on basic product information.

### Techniques for Practicing Connection

Pink recommends three techniques for practicing connection.

#### Technique #1: Perspective-taking

Perspective-taking is the ability to get outside yourself and objectively imagine the experience of others. It facilitates openness, clarity, and efficiency without sacrificing profit.

To sell effectively, you need to understand the preferences and biases of the buyer. Many assume empathy is the best way to achieve this. Pink sees empathy as an effective connection and persuasion skill but considers it limited because it’s subjective and emotion-based, which means you’re more likely to misunderstand the needs of your buyer (or sacrifice your own). An example of this is overly empathizing with a customer who doesn’t have great finances, making a sale that serves them but doesn’t allow you to profit at all (sacrificing self-interest). Another example is catering to a buyer's emotions so much that you lose objectivity and fail to suggest otherwise effective solutions.

Perspective-taking helps you think outside of yourself to get into the heads or hearts of others in a more calculated way. It keeps you objective and logical (rather than subjective and emotional), making you more likely to accurately address the needs and perspective of a buyer without sacrificing your own needs and perspective. That way, when a customer comes to you with a problem, not only do you find a solution, but you may even identify additional problems and provide solutions for those too. For example, if you have a client with poor finances, instead of offering them a discount that cuts into your profit, you might offer them an affordable payment plan. This allows you to receive fair pay while allowing the buyer to make the purchase (solution to initial problem) as well as build financial discipline (solution to additional problem).

> **Understanding Perspective**
> 
> As valuable as perspective-taking is for building your connection with a buyer, it’s not always easy to use. Applying perspective-taking effectively requires understanding five critical aspects.
> 
>   * **All perspectives are unique.**
> 
>   * **A person’s perspective dictates what they perceive and experience.**
> 
>   * **Perspectives can shift depending on a multitude of factors.**
> 
>   * **Perspective dictates how communication is received.** A message can mean different things through the lens of different perspectives.
> 
>   * **It’s common to assume that your perspective is the dominant perspective.** This is how misunderstandings occur because it is difficult to identify the difference between your own perspective and the perspectives of others. For example, if you’re a white male, you may assume that your experience and perspective are the same as those of a Black woman, causing you to misunderstand the nuances of her perspective and superimpose your own experiences over hers.
> 
> 

> 
> **Tips for Improving Perspective-Taking**
> 
>   * Practice setting aside your beliefs, opinions, and motivations to consider those of others.
> 
>   * Practice determining whether taking on the perspective of others warrants a change in behavior on your part, and in cases where it does, practice making the change.
> 
> 


#### Technique #2: Assuming you don’t have the power

Pink believes that when you assume you’re the one with the power, you impede your ability to perspective-take because you’re attached to your own perspective and dismissive of the perspectives of others. The perception of power causes you to tune in less to those around you, skewing your view of reality. Manipulation, coercion, and ignoring the needs of the buyer are all behaviors you’re more prone to when you assume power, and they prevent success in today’s sales environment. If you instead assume the power lies with the buyer, you’ll more naturally focus on their needs and be better able to serve them. Letting someone else have the power is often seen as a weakness, but in this case, doing so places you in a position of strength, because you serve your buyer rather than yourself, increasing your chances of a successful sale.

> **How Power Makes Empathy Harder**
> 
> Power helps you get things done, but on the flip side, it also makes you less empathetic for two reasons:
> 
>   * **You don’t care as much about getting along with others.** For those in higher status positions, it’s less necessary to connect with others, and over time this makes it both harder and less appealing to understand or engage with people.
> 
>   * **You’re more focused on your own needs than the needs of others.** You’re primarily concerned with accomplishing your goals, so you care less about what others need.
> 
> 


#### Technique #3: Mirroring

Mirroring or mimicking words and gestures can enhance buyer trust, and increase connection between buyer and seller because we trust people we perceive as being like us. Pink states that it’s innate for humans to mimic each other. Scientists see mimicry as demonstrating social trust. They call it “the chameleon effect.” Mimicry is effective because in primitive times we lived in smaller groups of people we trusted. Now, it’s not as easy to determine who can be trusted, so we look for environmental cues and signs of trustworthiness. We trust those who match our behavioral or vocal patterns.

A Dutch study demonstrated the usefulness of mimicry in sales by showing that waitresses who mimicked customer orders (repeating them back verbatim) were more likely to receive large tips than their peers who didn’t. Similarly, in a study at Duke University participants responded more positively to a new sports drink when they were subtly mimicked by the interviewer.

> **Downsides to Mimicry**
> 
> While mimicry can create rapport, it can just as easily undermine it:
> 
>   * **Mimicry can be negative when done in inappropriate contexts or inappropriate ways.** It can actually upset people, preventing positive rapport both consciously and subconsciously.
> 
>   * **It can bring up bad feelings related to race and culture**. Studies show that when a person mimics someone of the same race, rapport is more positive than if a person mimics someone of a different race (this undermines rapport).
> 
>   * **It can make people think of things that cause stress.** A 2011 study showed that when the person doing the mimicking causes the other person to think about money, they may feel threatened and think poorly of the one mimicking.
>

##### How to Mimic Strategically

Pink outlines three steps for mimicking in a sales conversation:

Step #1: Observe

Observe the other person, their patterns of speech, body language, facial expressions, and mannerisms.

Step #2: Be judicious

Don’t immediately mimic them. Take your time and test mimicry sparingly. Don’t bombard them with it.

Step #3: Relax

Once you’ve mimicked intentionally, relax and try not to think much about what you’re doing. Mimicry is natural to humans, and it will eventually become instinctive.

> **Mimicry Techniques: Matching, Pacing, and Leading**
> 
> _Win Bigly_ author Scott Adams, who writes about persuasion, suggests how to use mimicry techniques in several scenarios:
> 
>   * **Sales** : Set an equal _pace_ with a potential customer by verbally showing you have similar interests and values; also discuss how they’re like your other clients. This is a form of mimicry that builds trust. Then _lead_ them by explaining why your product or service makes logical sense for people sharing these interests.
> 
>   * **Hiring situations** : Build familiarity with a hiring manager by _matching_ their behavior (posture, speaking, and email style). Then verbally paint a picture (future pacing) that helps them visualize you working for them—for example, your contacts can get them better prices—prompting them to think beyond the hiring decision.
> 
>   * **Negotiation** : Besides matching the other party’s body language, lead them to your desired argument by initially matching their argument (setting the pace): “That’s a very reasonable approach...but I wonder if it covers all the bases—for instance…”
> 
> 


### The Ambivert Edge

Pink notes that we often assume extroverts are the best salespeople; however, ambiverts, who fall in the middle of the introvert-extrovert spectrum, actually have the edge in sales. While extroverts are naturally outgoing, more likely to converse and connect, and so on, that doesn’t necessarily translate to results (sales performance or volume).

In one study comparing personality traits of over 300 sales reps with their sales performance, extroverts only minimally outperformed introverts. Ambiverts outperformed both extroverts and introverts. The study suggested that being either too extroverted or too introverted impedes performance. Why? Extroverts can be overly assertive and persistent in a way that turns off buyers, while introverts can be too shy to open a deal or push a deal forward.

Extroverts and introverts also differ in how they handle two core sales skills: _responding and inspecting_. Responding is about asking questions, engaging, and advising, while inspecting is about listening and observing. Extroverts are generally _responders_ , while introverts tend to be _inspectors_. **Sales requires a balance of both responding and inspecting, which ambiverts tap into most easily.** Therefore, results imply that ambiverts are the best salespeople because they are naturally better at maximizing connection.

> **What Is An Ambivert and Why Are They Good Salespeople?**
> 
> According to research, ambiverts (who make up roughly 68% of the population) have many characteristics and benefits that make them good at sales.
> 
> Characteristics of ambiverts:
> 
>   * Can perform tasks alone or in a group
> 
>   * Are comfortable in social settings, but drained after too much exposure
> 
>   * Enjoy attention but within limits
> 
>   * Are seen by some as social, and as quiet by others
> 
>   * Can relax but get bored if there isn’t enough movement
> 
>   * Equally as prone to getting lost in thought as in a conversation
> 
>   * Are capable of small talk, but become bored eventually
> 
>   * Have equal potential for trust and distrust
> 
> 

> 
> Benefits of being an ambivert in sales include these abilities:
> 
>   * Finding a middle ground between being too aggressive and too passive
> 
>   * Being confident without being arrogant
> 
>   * Analyzing while still remaining connected
> 
>   * Being assertive and committed without being overbearing
> 
>   * Connecting with the needs of most customers
> 
>   * Maintaining a steady drive to achieve
