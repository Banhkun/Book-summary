## Defining Discipline 1: Focus

**The key of this discipline is to focus on—and _only_ on—the _wildly important._** Genetically, human beings work best when they do one thing at a time. Multitasking overloads our brains, and when our brains are overtaxed, they slow down. **As you practice multitasking, you actually get worse at thinking and problem-solving.** As a result, it’s physically impossible to be most effective when concentrating on too much at once.

You can see the harmful effects of multitasking in the workplace too. When you have too many goals, you get hit with the law of diminishing returns. If you have four to ten goals, you might achieve one or two. If you have more than ten, you won’t achieve any of them. **Too many or unfocused goals also make the whirlwind worse.** What might be five goals at the top of an organization cascades down to many smaller goals at the bottom of the hierarchy, creating too much to focus on. Also, conventional organizational goals often lack measurability, focus, and a deadline.

**Therefore, when you want to create change, choose one, at max three, very important goals to work toward.** Call them _Wildly Important Goals (WIGs)_ to make it easy for you and staff to remember that they’re top priority. These goals should not come from the whirlwind, and this discipline doesn’t apply to the whirlwind. (The whirlwind is made up of the essential day-to-day activities that keep your organization running. If you ignored parts of it, your organization wouldn’t survive.)

Additionally, this discipline **helps you more clearly communicate your strategy to your organization.** Choosing a WIG forces you to translate strategy from ideas to a specific outcome. When there are only a few specific outcomes, it’s easy for your staff to differentiate what’s goal and what’s whirlwind.

### Focus for Leaders

As a leader, however, you can’t simply focus on one sole thing. **You can use different parts of your brain at the same time, just don’t overload them.** Think of your brain like an air traffic controller. A controller must be aware of all the planes that are approaching, taxiing, or leaving, but only one of those planes is really important—the one that’s landing at this exact moment. Be aware of all your “planes” (tasks including the whirlwind), but only focus on the landing “plane” (your WIG).

Many leaders understand that focus is important, but still find this discipline hard to put into practice. There are both external and internal forces keeping you from focusing, and often the internal forces are more difficult to overcome. Here are the forces:

  * **Your own nature.** As a leader, you’re ambitious and creative, which drives you to do more. You see beyond what others see, and you’re always finding existing things to improve and new opportunities.
  * **Quest to appear successful.** If you try everything, something might work. And if it doesn’t, by taking on so much, you’ve demonstrated a ton of effort, so you _look_ good. Choosing a single goal raises the stakes—if you fail, you don’t have anything to fall back on.
  * **Difficulty of saying no.** Saying no is counterintuitive for leaders, who are by nature people who are looking for opportunities. A further challenge is that opportunities don’t show up all at once. You can’t compare their strengths and weaknesses and choose the best one. When they show up alone, they all look good.
    * For example, Apple’s Steve Jobs was very good at saying no. He made a single phone type, the iPhone, instead of the 40 different models his competitors were making.
  * **Other people’s goals and agendas** (particularly those of people above you). You must meet your responsibilities to others as well as yourself. You don’t have any control over how many goals your boss gives you, but you do have control over which goal you choose for a WIG
  * **Whirlwind.** Remember that WIGs are separate from the whirlwind. If you try to turn everything in the whirlwind into a WIG, you’ll be overwhelmed. WIGs require changes in behavior, and no one can change that much at once. Budget 80% of your time and energy to maintaining or slowly improving the whirlwind. Use 20% for your WIGs.



### Four Rules for Organizational Application

4DX can be used in any context, but the authors focus on team and organizational settings. Therefore, in much of the following, the authors refer to two types of WIGs: overall WIGs and team WIGs.

**The _overall WIG_ is the WIG for the _entire organization_ , chosen by the senior leaders.**

**_Team WIGs_ are the goals of specific teams.** They move the organization closer to the overall WIG, but the focus or language of the team WIGs may be different from those of the overall WIG.

Once an organization has an overall WIG, there are four rules for applying Discipline 1 across the organization:

##### Rule #1: No team focuses on more than two WIGs.

Across an organization, there may be many WIGs, but within a team, there cannot be more than two.

##### Rule #2: The WIGs at lower levels of the organization must directly help achieve those at higher levels.

Imagine the WIG at the top of the organization as a war. WIGs at lower levels are battles. The only reason to fight a battle is to help win a war. Once you have an overall WIG, consider how to achieve it with the fewest number of team WIGs (rather than making a to-do list of all the things that must be done to achieve it). This simplifies the strategy.

For example, an Internet provider had a WIG of “Increase sales from $6 to $9 million by February 28.” An outside sales team committed to raising $1 million and the major-account division committed the remaining $2 million. The technology team committed no money but improved the company’s record for uninterrupted service, which was very important to customers and helped the other teams achieve their WIGs.

##### Rule #3: Senior leaders can veto but not choose the lower level WIGs.

This rule combines the best of top-down (clarity from senior leaders) and bottom up (engagement). The senior leader knows what’s most important, but the team members are the people who will actually have to transform their behavior, so their input is important. If you just do top-down, you’ll have problems with engagement, and accountability might only come from authority. If you just do bottom up, the WIG might not be aligned with the overall WIG. That’s why seniors keep veto powers, in case the team-selected WIGs aren’t appropriate.

##### Rule #4: All WIGs must contain a measurable result and deadline, in the form of “from point A to point B by deadline.”

This format sounds simple, but many leaders struggle with it. Once they figure it out, they’ve achieved clarity and focus.

Consider a goal in the incorrect format like this one from a travel agent: “Increase customer satisfaction.” How do you measure satisfaction? What is the deadline? In short, how do you know if you’ve achieved it? Put into WIG format, the goal becomes: “Increase our customer satisfaction ratings from an average of 50% satisfaction to 70% satisfaction in six months.”

What should the deadline be? A year is a good starting point (since companies often measure things on a calendar or fiscal year). Some take six months to two years. Any project-based WIGs take around the same time as the project. The time frame must be long enough to achieve a compelling goal, but short enough to maintain enthusiasm for the vision.

### Example: NASA

Here’s an example of the effectiveness of adhering to Discipline 1:

In 1958, NASA had seven very important goals along the lines of increasing human knowledge about space, improving spaceships, long-range studies, positioning the US in the space race, military applications, and cooperation with other nations. Some of these goals were measurable, but none of them had a deadline.

In 1961, J.F. Kennedy gave NASA a WIG in the correct “from point A to point B by deadline” format: put a man on the moon and bring him back before 1970.

There were three lower-level “battle” WIGs to support Kennedy’s “war” WIG:

  * Get a spacecraft to the right position on the moon, keeping in mind that the moon is moving in orbit.
  * Find a way to power rockets carrying heavy lunar modules fast enough to break free of Earth’s gravity.
  * Develop a capsule and landing gear that would keep a person alive both in transit to and from, and while on, the moon.



**When Kennedy announced his WIG, accountability, morale, and engagement at NASA exponentially increased.** At the time, NASA didn’t have the technology to achieve any of the three “battle” WIGs, but they got it done—Neil Armstrong walked on the moon in 1969.

(Kennedy was also a good example of saying no to good ideas. He was asked why he chose to focus on man-on-the-moon instead of other worthy goals, and he said this goal was most important.)

### A Note on Project WIGs

Discipline 1 still applies to project WIGs, but you need to be careful about your point B value. The obvious choice is 100% completion, but that’s not as concrete as a numerical value such as profit or revenue. Once you factor in things like scope expansion, it might be hard to actually measure project completion. **Instead, relate the point B value to the business outcome**. Add to your from point A to point B by deadline.” For example, “Launch a new app by July 31, meeting 100% of the specified e-commerce functions.”
