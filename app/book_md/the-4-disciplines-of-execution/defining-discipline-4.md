## Defining Discipline 4: Accountability

Disciplines 1-3 set up execution, but Discipline 4 is where it actually happens. If you were to stop 4DX after Discipline 3, scoring would happen, but only for a short while. In time, the scoreboard would become a to-do list that no one’s doing. Or, everyone would come up with their own ideas about how to do things, scattering effort in all directions. **Without accountability, the game/goal will be overtaken by the whirlwind of day-to-day operations.**

In 4DX, “accountability” doesn’t mean an annual performance review or getting called out for failing—there’s no negative connotation. Here, accountability isn’t top-down or organizational; it’s personal. **You’re accountable to your team members (not just your boss), but most importantly, accountability becomes a matter of personal pride.** Since you helped choose the WIG and lead measures, you can make commitments you have the power to carry out. Discipline 4 reconnects everyone, in a personal way, to the WIG, in spite of the distractions of the whirlwind.

**The key to Discipline 4 is that the accountability is _precise and regularly scheduled_ —a cadence.**

### The WIG Session

The cadence of accountability is primarily maintained by a meeting called a WIG session. **This session takes place at least once a week and lasts less than 30 minutes.** In it, the leader holds people to commitments they make that will increase the lead measures.

(Initially, the meetings may take longer than half an hour, but they’ll go faster as you get used to the agenda. If non-WIG-related things come in the meeting, schedule a different meeting to sort them out.)

There are several benefits to a WIG session:

  * Refocus the team on the WIG in spite of the whirlwind.
  * Give team members a chance to learn from each other. When one team member comes up with something that works, the others can copy. Team members also learn what isn’t working, and know to avoid it.
  * Help team members. If someone hits a snag, the team helps clear it.
  * Adapt to things that were impossible to see back in annual planning.
  * Celebrate successes and maintain engagement.



#### Session Requirements

There are two requirements for WIG sessions:

##### Requirement #1: They must be consistently scheduled.

**The session must be at the same day and same time every week.** Never miss it—your team will follow your example and treat it with as much importance as you do. If you can’t personally attend (for example, you’re on vacation), you should:

  * **Choose someone else to lead the meeting** , such as a supervisor or an experienced member of the team. It’s also fine to rotate the meeting leader weekly.
  * **Train the substitute.** Make sure they know that the WIG session is very important, and that they know the agenda.
  * **Debrief.** When you return, meet with the substitute leader and recap the meeting. It’s also important to thank the substitute for taking on such an important responsibility.



**Demand attendance.** Even if the people in your organization work shifts, are geographically distributed, or have massive whirlwinds, everyone must attend a weekly WIG session to maintain accountability. To encourage attendance:

  * Remind people that a session isn’t a large time commitment (20-30 min for a session), or do a shorter 5-7 min version called a huddle. Huddles still take place weekly and cover the same things as the full meeting, but **the team as a whole makes one commitment for the next week** , instead of everyone making their own.
  * Hold the WIG session right before or after an existing meeting so most people are already assembled.
  * If there’s no time when everyone can attend a WIG session or huddle, leaders can hold more than one, or meet with people individually, in person or by phone.



##### Requirement #2: They must be whirlwind-free.

It doesn’t matter how important a whirlwind issue might be, **never discuss whirlwind problems in a WIG meeting. Have a separate meeting later.** Maintaining the whirlwind is never a good enough consolation prize for failing to meet a WIG’s weekly commitments.

#### Session Agenda

**A WIG session has a set agenda, and _only_ these three things are covered:**

##### Report on last week’s commitments.

Everyone outlines their WIG commitments from the previous week and the outcome:

  * Example #1: You might have committed to call three customers. You would tell your team that you did make those calls and what you learned.
  * Example #2: You might have gone to a meeting you committed to attending but not gotten the information you were looking for. You would explain the problem.



##### Review scoreboard. (Update the scoreboard before the session.)

Look at the scoreboard and assess the lag and lead measures. Are the lead measures moving the lag ones? Discuss what the team’s learned about what’s working and what’s not, and how to adjust. _Meaningfully_ celebrate both the team and specific individuals when there are successes. This increases engagement, as everyone likes being publicly praised.

  * Example #1: While looking at the scoreboard, you might discuss how a lead measure is improving but you’re not seeing the effect in the lag measure yet. 
  * Example #2: To celebrate an individual or team, you might create awards such as highest performer of the week or best WIG session, or get pizza. 



##### Plan for next week.

Everyone makes new commitments for the next week. Some of these commitments might be to help team members with problems that came up in the account part of the meeting (“clear the path”). For example, you might commit to doing research on an issue and coming back next week with at least three ideas.

Each commitment must:

  * Be specific. Avoid language like “focus on” or “work on.” If your commitment isn’t specific, the whirlwind will eat it.
  * Directly influence the lead measure, and so directly contribute to the WIG.



**Team members come up with the commitments, not the leaders.** The commitments must be _personal_. Guide your team members if you need to, but the goal is to get to a place where people understand the WIG so well they can tell you how to best execute it. Ownership creates engagement.

If a team member fails to fill their commitments, they must do so the next week, in addition to the next week’s commitments.

(Shortform note: When the agenda is first given, the order of actions is 1) report, 2) review scoreboard, 3) plan. Many of the examples, however, reverse steps 1 and 2. In the examples in this summary, the agenda order adheres to the original book’s.)

#### Timeline

If you are a leader, you’ll likely be attending two WIG sessions a week, one with your team and one with your boss.

It takes 3-4 weeks to get into the rhythm of weekly WIG sessions. A few more weeks later, the lag measures start to move.

**The WIG session is a large part of why 4DX is more effective than conventional annual planning.** No matter how detailed your annual plan, you can’t anticipate things months in advance as well as you can week-by-week. At the beginning of the year, you don’t know what commitments will be most effective based on last week’s events. (And annual plans usually have too many goals.)

### Scheduling WIG Commitments

**You need to schedule time to complete your WIG commitments or the whirlwind will eat up all of your time.** As Parkinson’s Law says, work expands to take up all the time, space and energy it can. If you don’t schedule your WIG commitments, not only will you not achieve your WIG commitments, you’ll feel like you worked really hard all week but didn’t actually get anything done. Spend 80% of your time on whirlwind matters, and reserve 20% for 4DX.

### Pitfalls

There are a few dangers to watch out for with Discipline 4. All of the following will derail your progress:

  * **Whirlwind.** This is the most common challenge with Discipline 4. WIG commitments should never have anything to do with whirlwind activities.
  * **Deviating from the WIG session agenda.** All three parts are critical
  * The same commitment more than two weeks in a row. 4DX is about changing behaviors, and repetition makes things routine
  * **Letting unfulfilled commitments slide.** If you don’t enforce accountability for both commitments and results, your team members won’t take accountability seriously.



### Example: Climbing Everest

This example contrasts two mountain-climbing teams, one that respected Discipline 4, and one that didn’t.

**Erik Weihenmayer’s Everest team had a “tent meeting” at the end of every day.** When they encountered a problem while climbing during the day, they debriefed and discussed possible solutions in the evening. For example, the first time the team practiced the dangerous Khumbu Icefall feature, Weihenmayer took 13 hours to cross it. On summit day, the team would have to cross the feature in less than two hours. After some time, Weihenmayer was able to improve the speed. He made it to the top, as did most of his team members, and **they set a record for the greatest number of people from a single team to summit in one day.** They all returned safely.

**Jon Krakauer’s Everest team didn’t have any method for regularly checking in with each other.** They had no discipline or accountability. When the team encountered difficulties, some climbers set out on their own for the summit. Even though they had harnessed some of the first three disciplines, they didn’t employ Discipline 4, and**the whole expedition was a failure.** Eight people died.

### A Note on Creativity

**WIG sessions have strict rules about the agenda and what’s allowed to be discussed, but they still inspire a lot of creativity.** Coming up with weekly commitments and identifying problems generates new ideas. Every team member has to problem solve and help their team.

For example, Towne Park, a valet service, had a WIG of increasing customer satisfaction. They wanted their lead measure to be vehicle retrieval time because it was highly predictive, but they weren’t convinced it was influenceable. **The valets—team members—were the ones who figured out how to influence the measure, not the leaders.** The valets asked guests to call ahead when checking out. They strategically parked cars closer or farther according to guests’ checkout date. One location in Miami faced a literally insurmountable obstacle, a concrete wall in the middle of the garage that everyone had to drive around. The solution was to tear down the wall—another idea that came from a team member, an assistant account manager. If a top leader had told people to start tearing down walls, they never would have done it, but since the idea came from the people, and would help them win, they not only did it, they were excited about it.
