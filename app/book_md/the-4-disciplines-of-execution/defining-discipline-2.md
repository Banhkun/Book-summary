## Defining Discipline 2: Leverage

Think of your WIG’s point A as a big heavy rock. No matter how hard your team pushes against it, it’s immovable. However, if your team applies a lever, the rock shifts. The team has to move the lever a lot to move the rock a little, but the rock does move. **Discipline 2 is about finding the right lever to move the WIG value from point A to point B.**

**Point A and point B values are also called _lag measures_. **Lag measures are results. They tell you if you’ve reached your WIG, so they’re very important. However, as the name implies, the actions that produced these results have already happened, so there’s nothing you can do to change them. Some examples of lag measures are revenue, profit, customer satisfaction, and body weight on a scale. (The whirlwind of daily tasks is full of lag measures.)

**The lever in the rock example above is a _lead measure_**. Lead measures quantify the actions that have the most impact on the WIG. Lead measures don’t tell you if you’ve achieved the WIG; instead they forecast if you _will_ achieve the WIG. They’re _predictive_ of the lag measure and, because the actions that drive them are ongoing, they’re _influenceable_. For example, if your lag measure is your body weight on a scale, as above, your lead measures are what and how much you eat, and how often you exercise.

Because lead measures directly affect lag measures, **the more you move your lead measure, the more your lag measures will move.**

Most people know that the lead measures are important. **The key to discipline 2 is _measuring_ lead measures.** For example, if you’re trying to lose weight, everyone knows diet and exercise are factors. However, not everyone actually measures and tracks calorie intake or time spent exercising.

There are two critical characteristics of lead measures:

  * **Predictive.** A change in the lead measure must create a change in the lag measure.
    * For example, consider a lag measure that’s how often your car breaks down. A predictive lead measure would be how often you have it serviced. A non-predictive lead measure would be what color you paint it.
  * **Influenceable**. Specifically, directly influenceable; your team must be able to influence this measure without dependence on another team or outside force.
    * For example, consider the lag measure that’s how many crops you grow. An influenceable lead measure would be how often the crops are fertilized. A non-influenceable measure would be the amount of rainfall—there’s nothing anyone can do about it.



### Why Leaders Fail to Focus on Lead Measures

Though fixating on lag measures doesn’t get results (because the lag measures _are_ the results), leaders focus on them for two reasons:

  * **It’s easier to get data on lag measures than lead ones.** There are almost always already systems in place to measure lag measures; sometimes you have to come up with a new system to get lead. It takes discipline to _keep_ getting data.
    * For example, it’s easy to step on a scale and weigh yourself (lag measure), but it’s a lot more work to keep track of how many calories you eat or how many minutes you spend exercising (both lead measures)
  * **Lag measures are the results you have to achieve and the results you’re held accountable for.** It’s not surprising that people focus on the numbers that measure success and failure.



Even when leaders shift their focus away from lag measures, they may still struggle with lead measures. Why? It’s rarely a matter of ignorance or effort—most leaders have some idea of what factors will influence their results. Leaders struggle with lead measures because:

  * **They aren’t employing Discipline 1**. Even if they know what the lead measures are, they’re not focusing on them because they’re dealing with too many goals, or they’re stuck in the whirlwind.
  * **They know what the lead measures are but they don’t know if anyone’s actually doing them because they’re not tracking.**
    * For example, suggestive selling is hardly a new idea in retail, but salespeople have to actually do it, regularly, for it to work.



Implementing lead measures is the hardest part of 4DX because:

  * They’re **counterintuitive**. Lag measures are the obvious place to focus, because the results are what matter. 
  * They’re **hard to measure**. Tracking behaviors (especially new ones that have never been done before) is harder than tracking results. On the bright side, it’s so much work to get data on lead measures that if you were tempted to disobey Discipline 1, you’ll self-enforce once you realize the time commitment required for measuring even a single WIG’s lead measures.
  * They come with a **false sense of simplicity**. They require focus on a single behavior that might not seem relevant, especially to those outside the team.



### Types of Lead Measures

There are two types of lead measures, both perfectly acceptable to use in Discipline 2.

  * **Small outcomes** are lead measures that create multiple new behaviors. The team must achieve a result, but everyone can use whatever method they want, and the team is accountable for the _result._
    * For example, achieve average customer satisfaction scores of 80% each week.
  * **Leveraged behaviors** are lead measures that force everyone on the team to do the same beneficial behavior. The team doesn’t have to achieve a result, but must do specific behaviors throughout the week, and the team is accountable for _doing the behavior._
    * For example, each team member must help at least 50 customers per week.



### Example: Water-Bottling Plant

Here’s an example of one company’s journey to find influenceable, predictive lead measures:

A water-bottling plant came up with the following WIG: “Increase bottling from 45 million gallons to 50 million gallons by the end of the year.”

At first, the company struggled to understand the difference between lead and lag measures. Their early suggestions for lead measures were to keep track of water production by day or month—these might be more frequently measured than the WIG result, but they’re still lag measures. Then, the production manager **identified a problem that stopped the company from producing more water—the machines had too much downtime.**

The next step was to translate the problem into a lead measure. They came up with: complete preventative maintenance on each machine once a week.

Water production increased at a rate faster than anyone expected. **The plant had known that the factor they chose as a lead measure was important, but instead of focusing on only this factor, they’d been trying to tame the whole whirlwind at once.** Their efforts were so spread out they had little effect on anything.

### A Note on Process-Oriented Lead Measures

**If your WIG comes out of a process (for example, a ten-step sales process), you might find your lead measure within the process itself.** Look at the individual steps of the process. Where are the leverage points? Where is performance failing? Make those leverage points your lead measures. For example, if step 4/11 is business analysis, and this is a place that would have the most impact on the process result, look for a lead measure there.

If you try to improve the whole process at once, you’re forgetting Discipline 1.

### A Note on Project WIGs

**Project milestones aren’t necessarily good lead measures.** They have to be predictable and influenceable like any lead measure, and they also need to take long enough and be significant enough that a team can make weekly commitments to them.

If your WIG is multiple projects, it’s more useful to choose lead measures that apply to all projects, such as procedures like project communication.
