## Implementing 4DX Across an Entire Organization

(Shortform note: The authors are part of an organization called FranklinCovey, which provides 4DX training. In this section, when they write “leader” or “coach,” they mean a person who’s gone through their training program and been certified.)

It’s more challenging to roll out 4DX on a large scale than it is to get it working with individual teams. There are three things to keep in mind:

  * **4DX isn’t a one-off event** , it’s a long-term process with six steps.
  * **Start with a pilot** that includes a maximum of 20 teams. These teams must be able to contribute to the overall WIG (vs.isolated leaders). As the pilot teams succeed using 4DX, other teams will get interested.
  * **An internal leader,_not_ an outside consultant from FranklinCovey, must implement 4DX.** This is important because:
    * Leaders who know they’ll have to teach something learn it more completely.
    * A teacher naturally becomes an advocate for the subject.
    * To advocate 4DX, leaders must lead by example.
    * An internal teacher has more credibility than an external consultant.



### Six-Step Process

There is a six-step process for implementing 4DX that works with 10+ teams at once. Steps 1-3 involve training with FranklinCovey and take six to eight weeks. Steps 4-6 take an additional three to four months.

#### Step 1: Find the Overall WIG

Leaders use the 4-step process for determining an overall WIG. The senior leader gets to make the final decision.

#### Step 2: Find Possible Team WIGs and Lead Measures

Each leader chooses a team WIG using the 4-step process. Here, senior leaders guide their leaders in choosing something relevant to the overall WIG, and veto ideas if necessary. Each leader chooses team lead measures.

This step is not complete until the team members have been consulted on the team WIG and lead measures.

#### Step 3: Certification of Leaders

FranklinCovey teachers leaders to launch 4DX. They roleplay practice WIG sessions and the launch meeting, and the leaders learn:

  * Scoreboard design.
  * How to teach their teams a basic understanding of 4DX.
  * How to communicate the WIGs and lead measures.
  * How to get feedback and make adjustments.



Once this step is completed, leaders are certified to launch.

#### Step 4: Launch

Leaders hold a launch meeting and kick off 4DX with their teams. The launch meeting should last two hours. 45 minutes are for presenting 4DX and the rest of the time is used to discuss everything else including:

  * The overall WIG, which is set in stone.
  * The team WIGs and lead measures, which are open to feedback.
  * The scoreboard design and scorekeeper assignment, which are open to feedback.
  * A practice WIG session. (In addition, the team may also attend another more experienced team’s WIG session.)



#### Step 5: Guided Execution

The weekly process of making WIG sessions, making commitments, and scoring begins.

FranklinCovey and 4DX coaches help leaders:

  * Stick to the schedule and process.
  * Deal with any resistance.
  * Prepare for step 6.



#### Step 6: Leader Meetings Every Quarter

Every few months, leaders attend a meeting with their senior leaders and report on 4DX. (A quarter is enough time to see both the lead and lag measures moving.) Make sure the most senior leaders are present to increase the sense of urgency and the pressure to produce results. For example, the governor of Georgia attended the meeting for five state government agencies.

This may be the first time certain leaders meet with senior leaders, and the first time they get to talk about their ideas and be celebrated. These meetings make leaders accountable and also give them a chance for recognition.

### 4DX Coaches

**Naming an internal 4DX coach can help make organizational implementation successful.** (The authors write that every highly successful implementation they’ve seen has had a good coach.) The coach helps when there are problems with the 4DX process and guides leaders who need help with any of the disciplines. The coach also acts preemptively, to make sure the teams stick to the process and don’t get sucked into the whirlwind.

**Every organization should have two coaches.** It’s not a full-time job, but this helps avoid schedule conflicts. Make sure when you get a second coach, you keep the first one on so they can be consistent with each other and maintain continuity.

Coaches benefit the organization by:

  * **Always being available.** An internal coach can provide immediate support and knowledge.
  * **Providing self-sufficiency.** An internal coach means an organization doesn't have to pull in outside help.
  * **Training new leaders.** The coach can quickly onboard newly hired or promoted leaders.



When selecting your coaches, look for:

  * **Competence**. A coach should be knowledgeable about business, a good communicator, and good at workplace relations. They’re more effective when they influence rather than formally order change.
  * **Interest.** The person should be passionate about 4DX.



### Dealbreakers

If you encounter any of the following three situations, fix them before trying to implement 4DX:

  * **Non-critical WIGs.** If you don’t have an important—wildly important—goal, you won’t get the same commitment from your organization members, and they won’t get on board with 4DX as a process
  * **Uncommitted senior leader** (the person who’s in charge of 4DX, not necessarily the CEO). The leader of 4DX must lead by example or else no one else will embrace the process.
  * **Leaders at the wrong level.** If you train leaders that are too high, they WIG won’t make it all the way to the front lines. If you train leaders that are too low, they may not know how to lead or create good WIGs. AIm for the lowest full-time leader above the front lines.
    * For example, a store manager would be the correct level. A plant manager would be too high; it should be the shift supervisor. A grocery store bakery manager would be too low, as they’re not full time leaders.



**Make sure leaders have enough discretionary time to lead WIG sessions and fulfill weekly commitments. Team members also need to have the time.**

### Five Lessons from a Successful Organizational Implementation

The following five lessons come from Dave Grissen, who implemented 4DX across Marriott hotels.

  1. **Consider your organization’s culture.** How will culture affect people’s initial response to 4DX? Will you need to generate buy-in?
  2. **Acknowledge that it’s harder to implement 4DX in an organization that’s already doing well.** When everything’s going well, people may not see the need to make any changes.
  3. **Remember that accountability is important at the leader level too** —the senior leader must keep all the other leaders in line. Team members take their cues from their leaders, and if their leader isn’t treating 4DX seriously, neither will they.
  4. **Make sure you have enough 4DX resources.** This includes talented leaders, 4DX coaches, training materials, and systems.
  5. **Remember the ancillary benefit that 4DX increases engagement.** This may change your organization’s culture—for the better.
