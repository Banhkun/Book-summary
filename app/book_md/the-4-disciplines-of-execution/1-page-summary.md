## 1-Page Summary

How often have you or your organization come up with an amazing plan, showed it off, admired it, been _sure_ that it’s the solution to all your problems—only to have it die a slow death over the following months? _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_ authors Chris McChesney, Jim Huling, and Sean Covey say this isn’t uncommon, because strategy (making the perfect plan) is much easier and better-studied than execution (actually carrying out your plan). **Execution requires behavioral change, which is one of the hardest things to generate in yourself, your team members, and your organization.**

McChesney, Huling, and Covey’s system—or 4 Disciplines—addresses this challenge with a framework for achieving important goals in spite of the deluge of day-to-day activities necessary to keep an organization running. This deluge, which the authors call “the whirlwind,” often occupies 100% of an organization’s time and energy, making it the biggest barrier to execution and behavioral change. While they acknowledge that deluge activities are essential, they say organizations need to dedicate 20% of that time to **executing important strategies through the 4 Disciplines of focus, leverage, engagement, and accountability.**

> **Overcome the Deluge With the Eisenhower Matrix**
> 
> The Eisenhower Matrix, a time management tool developed by former US president Dwight Eisenhower and popularized by Stephen Covey, is a systematic way of prioritizing the deluge of day-to-day activities. The Eisenhower Matrix divides tasks into four categories and gives advice about how to handle each category:
> 
>   * **Urgent and important: Do it.** If you have a task that’s both pressing and significant, you should get it done as soon as possible. Examples include filing time-sensitive reports and attending (some) meetings.
> 
>   * **Important, but not urgent: Schedule it.** If there’s something that you need to do, but don’t need to do _right now_ , make a plan for when and how you’ll handle it. Examples include employee reviews, team-building activities, and planning sessions. Your work with the 4 Disciplines will fall into this category.
> 
>   * **Urgent, but not important: Delegate it.** Eisenhower defined this category as tasks that need to be done, but that don’t require you, personally, to do them—hence his suggestion of delegating those tasks to somebody else. In _First Things First_ , Covey says these are tasks that you trick yourself into wasting time on because you mistake time-sensitive tasks for important tasks. Either way, this category is a dangerous time sink and an excellent place to start if you’re trying to free up some time for more important tasks. Which of the tasks in your company’s day-to-day deluge fall into this category?
> 
>   * **Neither urgent nor important: Ignore it.** Tasks that aren’t significant or time-sensitive are, almost by definition, things that you can safely ignore. Examples might include going through old emails or scrolling social media.
> 
> 


Besides helping you achieve a specific goal, **the 4 Disciplines also create behavioral changes that permanently raise an organization’s overall level of performance.** Furthermore, the authors claim that their system works for any kind of team, no matter the team structure or the industry; it even works in personal or family settings.

McChesney, Huling, and Covey are executives and consultants for FranklinCovey, a leadership and consulting firm. _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_ is based on their observations and methods. FranklinCovey also offers services in teaching and implementing the 4 Disciplines.

In this guide, we’ll connect the authors’ ideas with those from other popular self-help and business guides such as _Awaken the Giant Within _and _Smarter Faster Better_. We’ll also examine where the authors’ methods may be incomplete or unproven in practical settings. Taken together, this guide will provide the background and tools to effectively tackle the processes within this book.

> **The Wire Cable of Discipline**
> 
> The authors chose the word “disciplines” to let us know that implementing these changes will require hard work and consistent effort. In _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ , Robin Sharma says that we can picture discipline as a wire cable—numerous small wires braided together like a rope. Individually, each wire is weak and easily broken; when they’re all together, they create a strong cable.
> 
> In the same way, numerous small practices and habits reinforce one another to create the discipline and inner strength to carry out your plans and achieve your goals. The introduction of _The 4 Disciplines of Execution_ says something similar: The authors assert that the 4 Disciplines’ greatest benefits come from how they all work together, leading to much greater gains in productivity than if you tried to apply any one discipline on its own. Much of this book (and therefore this guide) is devoted to practical techniques and principles you can use to start creating your own wire cable of discipline.

### Discipline 1: Focus

**In Discipline 1, you will choose which goals to make your top priorities—ideally one or two goals, three at the absolute most.** The authors call these “Wildly Important Goals (WIGs)” in order to emphasize that they should be your primary focus. The authors add that choosing so few goals may feel counterintuitive, but narrowing your focus is crucial for success because the human mind can only devote its best efforts to one thing at a time.

(Shortform note: Although the authors begin this book by separating _strategy_ and _execution_ , in Section 1 they acknowledge that the lines between the two are blurred—that a good strategy must, by definition, be executable. That’s why the first of their 4 Disciplines is about setting effective goals and devoting the proper amount of energy to them, which is generally considered to be part of strategy, not execution. **In other words, in order to execute your strategy, you must first make sure that your strategy is a good one.**)

**For an organization, senior leaders choose the main goal or goals. Then, each team comes up with its own goals to support the organizational goal.**

> **Consider BHAGs—Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals**
> 
> If you’re a senior leader choosing a goal for your entire organization, _Built to Last _authors Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras suggest choosing something bold, risky, and long-term: what they call “Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals (BHAGs).”
> 
> The authors argue that such goals are highly motivating, leading to greater efforts and, therefore, better results than “safe” conservative goals. They say that’s true even though BHAGs can take anywhere from 10 to 30 years to accomplish, and even then they only have a 50% to 70% success rate. The important thing is to _believe_ you can achieve your BHAG and put forth the necessary effort to do so.
> 
> Your BHAG should be:
> 
>   * **Clear:** Make your goal concrete and specific (for example, “sell X units” rather than “be the best”). Couch it in simple language that’s easy to remember and communicate to others.
> 
>   * **Compelling:** BHAGs are meant to be inspirational and motivating. Therefore, it’s important to pick a goal that you and your employees can get excited about.
> 
>   * **Challenging and risky:** Pick something that has a chance to fail, even if you do everything right while trying to achieve it. If you’re guaranteed to accomplish your goal, then you’re not thinking big enough.
> 
>   * **Appropriate:** Your goal should reinforce your company’s image and ideology (or the desired image and ideology). For example, a company known for exclusive, highly expensive luxury goods might want its goal to relate to quality or customer satisfaction; it wouldn’t want to set a sales-based goal that drives it to sell cheaper, lower-quality merchandise.
> 
> 

> 
> Note that BHAGs are for organizational goals—they’re _not_ appropriate for small team goals. _4 Disciplines_ will explain in a later section that team commitments should be short-term and revisited on a weekly basis.

McChesney, Huling, and Covey give four rules for choosing _team_ goals:

  * **Rule #1:** No team may choose more than two goals.
  * **Rule #2:** Team goals must directly support the overall goal.
  * **Rule #3:** Teams get to choose their own goals. Senior leaders can veto goals they don’t feel will support the organization, but they cannot choose the team’s goal. 
  * **Rule #4:** All goals must include an end point, expressed as follows: “From (current situation) to (desired situation) by (deadline).”



Having laid out four rules for goals, the authors suggest _choosing_ goals by following these four steps:

**1\. Brainstorm.** Ask yourself what kind of change would have the most impact on your organization or team. Consider things that aren’t working and things that, if they worked even a little better, would have a large impact. Involve peer leaders and your team in the brainstorming.

(Shortform note: Most people are familiar with brainstorming, but the person who invented the process—advertising executive Alex Osborn—included a step that many people overlook: Combine and improve the ideas. In other words, many “brainstorming” sessions consist entirely of people throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks, but _true_ brainstorming means looking for common ground between those ideas and seeing how they can build upon each other.)

**2\. Appraise.** Consider the list of team goals you brainstormed. Which ones will have the highest impact on the company goal?

(Shortform note: You might reasonably be concerned about picking the wrong goal or goals—what if your appraisal is flawed, or the market situation changes? To combat this fear, bear in mind that _Rework_ authors David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried say that the single most dangerous thing you can do in business is fail to make a decision. A bad decision—such as choosing the wrong goal to pursue—can always be reevaluated and changed; a non-decision leaves you stuck, with no feedback to help you choose a wiser course of action.)

**3\. Check.** Make sure that the goal you’ve picked is reasonable. The authors’ criteria for a reasonable goal are: The goal must support the company’s overall goal, must be measurable, must be driven by the team rather than the leader, and shouldn’t depend more than 20% on another team.

(Shortform note: It will be tempting to set easily achievable goals that you can feel good about accomplishing, but it can be more effective to set ambitious goals, or even impossible ones. In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins explains that setting big goals inspires you to work harder than setting goals you’re confident about reaching—**so long as you work with the mindset that progress toward your goal constitutes success, and falling short of the goal is _not_ failure.**)

**4\. Write.** Choose your goal and write it in the format specified in Rule #4: “From (current situation) to (desired situation) by (deadline).”

(Shortform note: Writing down goals isn’t just for recordkeeping, it also makes you more likely to follow through and achieve those goals—20% to 40% more likely, according to one study. This is because when you write something down, you’re more likely to retain it and consider it important than if you just trust yourself to remember your goal.)

### Discipline 2: Leverage

**Discipline 2 focuses on getting from your current situation to the desired situation you defined in Discipline 1.** McChesney, Huling, and Covey call this Discipline “leverage” because it’s about using your effort more effectively. Instead of trying to push a big, heavy goal directly, you channel your energy into related goals that you can actually influence, which in turn moves your company closer to its main goal (like using a lever to move a heavy rock instead of trying to lift it yourself).

The authors say one major problem with implementation is that people generally measure results. Butresults, or _lag measures_ , are fixed—**they can’t change once they’re measured, and they don’t give you any information on how to proceed.** For example, if your goal is to save up a certain amount of money, your only measurement might be the number in your bank account: If it’s lower than your goal, you don’t learn anything about how to increase it.

That’s why McChesney, Huling, and Covey recommend that you**find a way to measure your efforts, or _lead measures_ , rather than just your results.** So, if you’re trying to save money, you might measure how many hours you worked in a week and how much money you spent during that week (results). But if you focus on working more and spending less (increasing your efforts), you’ll naturally reach your goal of saving up money—this is much more effective than simply checking your bank account and hoping that it’s higher than before.

The authors explain that whatever lead measures you use must have two essential characteristics: It must be _predictive_(a change in the effort will yield a change in the results) and it must be _influenceable_(your team must be able to directly impact the measurement without relying on other teams).

So, how do you choose good effort measurements for a team or a company? **The authors suggest using the same four steps that you used for goal setting.**

  1. **Brainstorm:** Ask yourself what kind of changes would affect your team’s goal or goals. Consider things you’ve never done before, things you could improve, and things you’re doing badly that might hamper you. Look at successful companies’ measures for inspiration. Involve your team in the brainstorming.
  2. **Appraise:** Consider the list of effort measures you brainstormed. Which ones will have the _most_ effect on your team’s goals?
  3. **Check:** Your effort measure must be predictive, maintainable, measurable, and impactful. It must have an effect on the team goal, be driven by the team rather than the leader, and it must be influenceable—your team needs to have control over it—so it shouldn’t depend more than 20% on another team.
  4. **Write:** The effort measure statements don’t have a strict format like a goal statement, but they should still be specific, start with a simple verb, and be concise. They should be clear about expectations—does the lead measure need to be done daily or weekly? How often, how much, and how well? Are they concerned with _team_ or _individual_ performance?



> **How Athletes Do Their Best**
> 
> The focus on effort, rather than results, echoes the mindset that many athletes use to consistently play at their best. According to sports psychologist Jim Taylor, focusing on results (like winning or losing the game) is ineffective for a couple of reasons:
> 
>   * Worrying about results (especially bad results) makes you nervous, which can stop you from performing your best.
> 
>   * The results are largely out of your control—they depend on your teammates, your opponents, and to some extent on random chance.
> 
> 

> 
> Therefore, Taylor instead suggests having these three goals:
> 
>   * **Pre-game: Prepare.** Do everything within your power to be as ready for the game as you can possibly be.
> 
>   * **In-game: Give your all.** Don’t settle for playing “well”—play your absolute best. Go all-out, take chances, and push yourself to the limit.
> 
>   * **Post-game: Regret nothing.** No matter what the outcome was, know that you did your best. Rather than wasting time and energy regretting what happened in the last competition, start preparing for the next one.
> 
> 

> 
> All of these same principles apply to business as well: Focusing too heavily on results can lead you to make short-sighted, reactionary decisions that prevent your company or team from doing its best. It’s better to prepare as best you can for whatever challenge you’re facing, give your all, and then start getting ready for the next challenge.

### Discipline 3: Engagement

**In Discipline 3, the authors tell you to engage your team by making the 4 Disciplines into a game that they can win.** You already did some engagement work in the previous two disciplines by consulting your team members about the team goal and lead measures. When people choose their own goals and feel ownership, they’re more engaged. They’re also more engaged when they enter a competition their team can win—**humans have a natural urge to compete and love to win.**

McChesney, Huling, and Covey suggest **designing a scoreboard to go with the game; better yet, have your employees design and create it.** This scoreboard must tell your team if they’re winning (if they’re on track to meet the goal), and it’s a constant reminder of the game you’re all trying to win. For example, the scoreboard might be a graph with two lines: one that goes from your starting situation to your desired situation over the time allotted (as stated in Discipline 1) and another that shows your actual progress toward that goal.

The authors recommend creating a separate visual for your effort measurement—perhaps a chart where each team member tracks what they’ve accomplished so far that week.

> **Counterpoint: Gamification Is Unproven**
> 
> What the authors describe in this section is known as _gamification_ : using gaming elements like scores, leaderboards, and achievement badges to make work more engaging. However, gamification is a relatively new idea, and it’s currently unclear how effective it is.
> 
> Gamification started with the observation that gamers will happily spend hours doing repetitive tasks—superficially similar to what they might do at work—with no _tangible_ reward. If managers and executives could make work similarly enjoyable by applying gaming elements, the theory goes, they’d reap benefits in employee morale and productivity—the workers would be happier and the company would be more profitable, creating a win-win situation.
> 
> Unfortunately, gamification has had underwhelming results. Common criticisms of the practice include:
> 
>   * **It’s a new name for old ideas.** Employee competition and leaderboards are hardly new ideas (for example, “Employee of the Month” awards existed long before gamification).
> 
>   * **It can feel condescending.** Employees work for money; trying to boost engagement with prizes and badges can feel like you’re trying to win them over with cheap gimmicks instead of increased wages.
> 
>   * **It misses the point.** Gamers play games because they’re fun. Applying gaming mechanics to something that _isn’t_ inherently fun won’t get people engaged, so gamification is doomed to fail.
> 
> 


### Discipline 4: Accountability

**In Discipline 4, the authors recommend holding a weekly accountability meeting—what they call a WIG (Wildly Important Goal) session.** Because achieving the goal is now a game, people are accountable to their teammates as well as the boss. When people know others are depending on them, they’re more motivated and engaged, they try harder, and performance becomes a matter of personal pride. Regular goal sessions and mandatory attendance are key to this discipline—accountability requires consistency.

**According to the authors, the goal session should take place at least once a week, last less than 30 minutes, and have a specific agenda:** Review the scoreboard, report on last week’s commitments (and celebrate them), and come up with new commitments.

McChesney, Huling, and Covey say that goal session commitments must influence your current effort measurements (deluge tasks—the endless day-to-day business of running the company—do not belong in these meetings). Commitments must be focused, specific, impactful, and take no longer than a week to complete. The person who makes the commitment must be able to do most of the work themselves.

**The authors add that leaders should make weekly commitments too.** The most effective commitments for leaders are ones that help their team achieve _their_ individual commitments and improve their execution. For example, if a team member requires a new piece of software, a leader could secure approval for the purchase.

> **Accountability Requires Empowerment**
> 
> To hold employees accountable for their commitments, you must first empower them to carry out those commitments. The authors say that team members should choose their own goals, and that any individual commitment must be achievable by the person who made that commitment, but they never directly address employee empowerment.
> 
> _The Leadership Challenge_ explains _how_ to empower employees, noting that empowerment directly leads to accountability. In brief, it works like this:
> 
>   * Give employees the authority to make decisions and carry them out—remove as many managerial controls and approval processes as possible.
> 
>   * Hold employees responsible for the decisions they make and the actions they undertake, both the good and the bad.
> 
>   * Employees will naturally develop feelings of accountability. Because they’re acting on their own authority and reaping the benefits (or penalties) of their decisions, they’ll develop a sense of ownership for their work: It truly feels like _their_ work, rather than something they’re doing for their boss or for the company.
> 
> 

> 
> _The Leadership Challenge_ also notes that empowered, accountable employees will be much more engaged with their work (remember Discipline 3)—because they feel responsible for their own projects, they’ll naturally go beyond their specifically assigned roles and tasks in order to achieve the best results possible.

### Implement the Four Disciplines at the Organizational Level

The authors provide six steps to implement the 4 Disciplines across an entire organization:

  1. **Choose the overall goal.** Use the steps in Discipline 1.
  2. **Choose team goals and lead measures.** Use the steps in Disciplines 1 and 2.
  3. **Train leaders in the 4 Disciplines.** The training covers what the disciplines are, how to teach and communicate them to their teams, how to solicit feedback, and roleplay practice. The authors have free resources for doing this on their site, and also offer paid consulting and training services.
  4. **Launch the program.** Team leaders hold a two-hour launch meeting with their respective teams, during which they explain what the 4 Disciplines are, communicate and solicit feedback on the goals and lead measures, and explain the scoreboard. 
  5. **Guided execution.** Someone deeply familiar with the 4 Disciplines helps everyone through the weekly practice of attending goal sessions, making commitments, and keeping score.
  6. **Quarterly meetings.** Every few months, leaders attend a leader version of a goal session. Each team leader will discuss their team’s progress, and they can also be recognized for their successes.



> **Overcome Resistance to Change**
> 
> One thing McChesney, Huling, and Covey don’t explicitly address in this process is the need to get people on board with the new direction you’re taking. Major changes in company or team processes (such as implementing the 4 Disciplines) often lead to pushback from employees and team members.
> 
> Heading off that resistance—and dealing with it if it does arise—can be key to successfully implementing the 4 Disciplines and other major changes. Here’s one method of overcoming opposition to change:
> 
>   * **Raise awareness.** Get people talking about the change, even if what they have to say about it isn’t good at first. Allow your employees to have intense discussions about it, and welcome criticism and feedback.
> 
>   * **Explain why.** Once employees know _what_ is happening, tell them _why_ it’s happening; how the new process will benefit them and the company as a whole.
> 
>   * **Adjust the process.** Take employee feedback seriously, especially from the ones who are most opposed to the change. Addressing their concerns can often make a good change even better, and they’ll feel more engaged with the process if they’re able to contribute to it.
> 
>   * **Acknowledge past mistakes.** If your company has a history of making bad changes, even if you had nothing to do with those changes, you may have trouble convincing employees or team members that this new process will be for the best. The best way to overcome past failures is to admit to them and, if possible, to correct the past mistakes.
> 
> 


#### Benefit From Permanent Behavioral Changes

**As your team and organization move through the _4 Disciplines_ process, the behaviors your team members have adopted in each Discipline (like engagement and accountability) will start to become habit.**

The authors say there are five stages of behavioral change during this process:

  * **Set the stage.** In this stage, your team gets involved in choosing the team goal and lead measures and settling on a time for the weekly goal session.
  * **Begin the process.** Officially launch the program. The top 20% of your team will get on board right away, 20% will resist, and 60% will be somewhere in the middle. Make sure everyone keeps following the process and, as the leader, demonstrate commitment to the method.
  * **See good results.** Once your team starts to see results, they’ll stop being so resistant to the new changes, become more engaged with the process, and become more accountable for their own contributions to it.
  * **See even better results.** Now the team members are actively changing their behavior, often even more than the lead measurements require. The whole team’s performance improves.
  * **The 4 Disciplines are second nature.** By the time your team achieves its goal, the behaviors they adopted to reach it will be habits. Your team will be well-prepared for the next challenge, and the achieved goal goes back into the daily deluge.



> **Counterpoint: Don’t Get Complacent**
> 
> It’s not always enough to go through an organizational change like the 4 Disciplines and trust that the changes will stick. That’s why the business fable _Our Iceberg Is Melting _has another step after you reach your goal: Don’t get complacent.
> 
> Rather than patting yourself on the back and going back to business as usual, _Iceberg_ authors Holger Rathgeber and John Kotter say there are two necessary things to make sure your organization continues to benefit from the work your team did:
> 
>   * **Make sure the changes will stick.** The authors of _4 Disciplines_ are confident that people will naturally keep using their method—however, it’s more effective to officially write the process and expectations into your company or team policy. Doing so will ensure that employees (even those who weren’t involved in the process the first time) will know how to effectively set and reach goals and why it’s important to do so.
> 
>   * **Be ready to do it again.** There will always be changes to adapt to and new goals to strive for, so you must always be ready to go through the 4 Disciplines again. The good news is that it will be easier after the first time, because your employees will (mostly) be familiar with the process and will have seen that it’s effective—therefore, there will be less resistance and less time lost to teaching the process.
