## Exercise: Choose a Team WIG

There are four steps to creating a team WIG.

* * *

Invent an overall WIG for your organization. (If you’re not clear on the overall goals of your organization (not uncommon), or you’re not having a brainwave, you can use this one, which should apply to most organizations: increase profit from point A to point B over the next year.)

Brainstorm a list of possible WIGs for your team. Think of your own ideas first, and then imagine what your coworkers and peer leaders might suggest.

Assess the impact of your brainstormed team WIGs on the overall WIG. Your team WIG should _directly_ contribute to the overall WIG. Consider if the overall WIG is financial, strategic, or quality-related.

Test your best three team WIGs, keeping in mind their impact on the overall WIG. Are the team WIGs measurable? How would you measure them? Would your team depend on another team to achieve them? Is it the leader or the team members driving the results? How do you know?

Write your final WIG in the format [Simple verb] from [point A] to [point B] by [deadline].
