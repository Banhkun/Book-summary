## Implementing Discipline 1: Focus

**A WIG must challenge your team, but it must also be achievable**. Don’t game your team by choosing something impossible while privately thinking if they manage 75% of it, you’ll be happy. Long-term, this will affect your ability to engage your team and produce results.

There are four steps to selecting WIGs:

### Step 1: Brainstorm a List of Possible WIGs

To brainstorm, come up with ideas on your own and consult team members and peer leaders, if applicable.

##### Brainstorm on Your Own

Brainstorm a list of possible WIGs even if you think you already know what the WIG should be. **Ask yourself, “If everything about my organization stayed the same, where would a change have the most impact?”** (Don’t ask, “What’s most important?”—you’ll get distracted by the whirlwind and other people’s opinions.) Come up with as many ideas as you can. The more ideas you have to choose from, the better your final WIG will be.

To come up with ideas, look within and outside of the whirlwind, and consider your mission.

  * If you’re choosing a WIG from inside the whirlwind, your options are:
    * Something that’s very badly broken that absolutely must be fixed, for example, going over budget
    * Something in your value proposition that isn’t working, for example, unsatisfactory customer service
    * Something that’s already going well but would have a large effect even if it was only improved a little, for example, an increase from 80% to 90% satisfaction could generate a lot more revenue
  * If you’re choosing from outside the whirlwind, your WIGs will usually be about strategy. (This kind of WIG will be totally new to your team and will require an even bigger change in behavior.)
    * For example, you might want to launch a new product
  * If you’re choosing something to align with your mission, consider results beyond your organization
    * For example, a thrift-store chain got a new president. The old president had done a good job and the company was doing well financially and operationally, so the company looked at choosing a WIG to do with their mission, which was to help people with disabilities and people who are homeless become more self-reliant. They eventually decided that the WIG should be to help workers with disabilities find jobs _outside_ their organization. The thrift-store company couldn’t hire every person with a disability, but they did have the capacity to train them in retail. 



##### Brainstorm with Team Members

**Including team members in the discussion of choosing a WIG increases their engagement with that WIG.** They have different skill sets and knowledge bases than you, so they might come up with ideas you never could have. They’ll also be the people doing a lot of the work in the next three disciplines, so it’s important they be consulted.

In addition to the same things you would consider yourself, consult your teammates on the following:

  * To achieve the overall WIG, what area of team performance do you want to improve? (Assuming that all current performance stays the same)
  * In areas where the team is already succeeding, what one strength would you improve even more to contribute to the overall WIG?
  * In areas where the team is struggling, what one weakness most needs to be improved?



(If your team is really big, you can talk to a representative group.)

##### Brainstorm with Peer Leaders

**Peer leaders are particularly important to consult when your organization has an overall WIG.** These leaders may depend on you, or you on them. While brainstorming with peer leaders, in addition to the same things you’d consider alone, ask for ideas regarding:

  * If your team is part of an organization with many goals, figure out which goals are most important.
  * If your organization already has an overall WIG, come up with ideas that will directly contribute to it.
  * If the team is the whole organization, come up with ideas that will grow the organization or support the mission.



**If your team is a support function (HR, finance, IT, and so on), wait to choose your team WIG until after the line functions finalize theirs.** Then, you can use your WIG to help them achieve theirs. For example, if a sales team wants to move to a new model, HR can choose a WIG that involves helping people get the training they need.

#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Brainstorming

Each implementation section, throughout the whole summary, will reference the experience of the production department of a publishing house.

Maria is the leader of the production department of a large publishing house. When the publishing house started implementing 4DX, the senior leaders came up with this overall WIG: “Decrease costs from $1 million to $800,000 by the end of the year.”

The production department (and all the other departments of the publishing house) brainstormed team WIGs that would support the overall WIG. Maria and her team came up with a list of ideas such as:

  * Reduce the need for outside help such as freelance designers and photographers
  * Reduce the number of at-press changes (once the printer has set up files, there’s a charge per changed page)
  * When purchasing stock images, avoid the more expensive rights-managed agencies



### Step 2: Assess Impact

Once you have a list of possible WIGs, determine the ones that have the most impact on the _overall WIG_.

Some guidelines:

  * If the overall WIG is financial, then the team WIG should have something to do with money: revenue, profitability, cost savings, etc.
  * If the overall WIG is quality, then the team WIG could have something to do with productivity or customer satisfaction.
  * If the overall WIG is strategic, then the team WIG could address the mission, new opportunities, or how to reduce threats.



#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Assessment

Maria and her team calculated the possible savings of all their ideas. **Maria now knew which WIG would reduce costs most in her department, but she was looking for a WIG that would have the greatest contribution to the _entire publishing house_.** At-press changes were not only expensive, they also caused a delay. When books printed a week later than scheduled, the marketing department had to pay for rush rather than regular shipping to ensure books made it to events on time. Marketing would also benefit from the stock image idea. Every time a rights-managed image is used, there’s a fee. If book covers used royalty-free images instead, marketing could then reuse the image in press kits and promotion materials without any additional cost.

### Step 3: Test the Top Team WIG Candidates

Test each potential WIG. If the answers to all of the following questions are yes, the WIG passes the test.

  * **Does it support the overall WIG?** Review step 2.
  * **Is there a way to measure it?** There must be a way to measure it from the very first day. If you have to build a measurement system, choose a different WIG, because there’s no point starting 4DX without a score.
  * **Can your team achieve the WIG without significant help from another team?** Your team should have at least 80% ownership. If it doesn’t, your team won’t feel engaged and accountable. However, it’s fine for two teams to have the same WIG, though, as long as they’re aware they share the outcome (both succeed or both fail)
  * **Are the results driven by the team rather than the leader?** The team needs to have an impact on the results or they won’t be engaged.



#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Testing

Maria and her team tested all their ideas and chose to reduce at-press changes. This supported the overall goal, was easy to measure, didn’t depend on other teams, and the results were team-driven.

### Step 4: Write the WIG in the “From Point A to Point B by Deadline” Format

**Start with a simple verb.**

  * Good: Cut costs...
  * Bad: In order to create a reduction in costs, we anticipate...



**The lag measure must be expressed as “from point A to point B by deadline.”**

  * Good: from 85% to 95% customer satisfaction by February 28
  * Bad: Increase customer satisfaction



**Be concrete, precise, and simple.**

  * Good: Reduce time lost incidents from 8 per year to 1 per year by March 31.
  * Bad: Our aim is to increase safety, according to our mission, which is...



**Don’t put in any language about how you’re going to do it.**

  * Good: Increase profit from $8 million to $10 million over six months.
  * Bad: Increase profit from $8 million to $10 million over six months by increasing revenue in the following five areas…



#### Shortform Example: Book Production Department: Statement

Maria and her team came up with this WIG: **“Decrease costs for at-press changes from $4000 to $1000 by the end of the year.”**

### Yield

After implementing Discipline 1, you’ll have a WIG statement in the form of**“[Simple verb] from [point A] to [point B] by [deadline].”** If you’re applying the discipline across an organization, all of your teams will have their own WIG statement in this format, and the team WIGs will directly support the overall WIG.
