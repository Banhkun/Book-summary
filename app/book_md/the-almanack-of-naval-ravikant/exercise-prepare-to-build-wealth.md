## Exercise: Prepare to Build Wealth

Ravikant offers several practical tips for building wealth. In this exercise, you’ll consider how you can take steps toward financial success.

* * *

Ravikant considers passive income to be one of the most effective ways to build wealth. If you don’t yet have any passive income streams established, consider what opportunities you may have to establish such a stream of income. Typically, experts recommend a few different avenues of passive income, such as traditional investments that pay dividends, owning real estate, selling products, and so on. In the space below, identify at least three potential passive income opportunities you might pursue over the course of this year.

Now consider what steps you might take in the next month to make one of those passive income opportunities a reality (for example, if your goal is to buy property to rent out, you could start touring houses for sale). Write a brief plan in the space below.
