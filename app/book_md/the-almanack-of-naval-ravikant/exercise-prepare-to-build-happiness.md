## Exercise: Prepare to Build Happiness

Happiness, to Ravikant, involves caring for both your mind and your body. In this exercise, you’ll consider how you can take steps on both fronts.

* * *

If you don’t already regularly exercise, write three to five activities that interest you. Maybe you’re interested in dancing or rock climbing, playing baseball or swimming. Once you’ve done that, brainstorm when you might try one of these activities this month.

In the space below, reflect on your experiences with meditation. Have you tried it? Do you find it intimidating and frustrating, or intriguing and enriching? If you find yourself resistant to it, briefly explain why.

Finally, note how you might experiment with meditation in a way that’s exciting to you. This might mean meditating only for a few minutes a day or exploring new guided meditations to refresh your interest.
