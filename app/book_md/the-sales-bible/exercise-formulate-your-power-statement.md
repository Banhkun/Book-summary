## Exercise: Formulate Your “Power Statement”

Use a strong opening statement to get prospects more interested in what you have to offer.

* * *

What product or service do you offer?

How does your product or service benefit your customer?

What sets you apart from your competitors? (For example, better quality materials or an innovative product feature.)

Bring it all together: Write an opening statement that gives the customer a clear picture of how your product or service can make their lives or their business better. (For example, instead of saying, “I’m a travel agent,” say, “I help people plan the vacation of their dreams.”)
