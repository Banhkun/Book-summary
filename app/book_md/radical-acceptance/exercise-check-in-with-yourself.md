## Exercise: Check in With Yourself

Recognizing habitual thought patterns and worries is the first step toward accepting yourself. As you do this, make sure not to judge yourself or your responses to these questions; just accept them for what they currently are.

* * *

Is there something about your body that you don’t accept? This could mean something about your appearance, your fitness, or your general health, such as blaming yourself when you get sick. What is it, if anything?

Is there something about your mind that you don’t accept? For example, do you tend to tell yourself that you’re not smart enough, or that you’re boring, or do you scold yourself for having mean-spirited or inappropriate thoughts about others? What about your mind don’t you accept, if anything?

Is there something about your moods and emotions that you don’t accept? Are you afraid of your negative feelings, or critical of yourself for being impatient or irritable? What about your feelings don’t you accept, if anything?
