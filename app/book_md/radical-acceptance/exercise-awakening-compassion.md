## Exercise: Awakening Compassion

We can have compassion for others or for our own suffering. Sit in a comfortable position that allows you to be both relaxed and focused, and bring a painful experience to mind. The pain can be your own or that of someone close to you—a family member, a friend, or even a pet.

* * *

What is the experience you thought of?

What prayer or expression of compassion comes to mind when you think about it? The statement could be as simple as “I care about your pain,” or “may you be freed from your suffering.”

Now consider all of the living beings in the world that are experiencing that same type of pain. Meditate on the realness of that suffering; breathe in their pain, and as you exhale, release it to your higher power or awareness of choice. As before, what prayer or compassionate expression comes to mind?
