## Exercise: Do a “Forgiveness Scan”

Forgiving yourself is an important practice, but you may find that sometimes you don’t even know what you need to forgive yourself _for_. Before going to bed for the night, take some time to remember the day and scan your feelings to see if you’re holding anything against yourself from the day. Examples might be a mistake you made at work, or something you regret saying to someone else.

* * *

What are you regretting from the past day?

What, if anything, is blocking you from forgiving yourself for it?

If you can’t forgive yourself, can you forgive the feeling and let it be what it is?
