## Shortform Introduction

In _Good to Great_ , renowned consultant and business-school professor Jim Collins and a team of research assistants set out to learn (1) whether _good_ companies can become _great_ companies and (2) if they can, _how_.

Collins’s answers to those questions, which are detailed in the following chapters, have made _Good to Great_ a touchstone text for managers and consultants alike. (It helps, too, that the book’s findings are empirically based and its concepts straightforward.)

It’s important to note, however, that the book was published nearly 20 years ago, and Collins and his team performed their research in the five years before that.

What this means for a contemporary, moderately informed reader is that some of Collins’s case studies may seem odd, given that they failed to sustain greatness.

For example, among the companies Collins lauds are:

  * **Circuit City**

    * Filed for bankruptcy in November 2008 due in large part (but not only) to the 2008 financial crisis
  * **Fannie Mae**

    * Was taken over by the U.S. Government in September 2008 due to a critical lack of capital
  * **Wells Fargo**

    * Was fined $185 million by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2016 for the creation of millions of fraudulent accounts

    * Paid a $1 billion penalty in 2018 to federal regulators as part of a settlement for abuses in its auto- and home-loan programs

    * Paid a $2.09 billion civil penalty in 2018 as part of a settlement for abuses in its home-loan program that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis




We at Shortform won’t be entering into the debate about whether these examples undermine Collins’s findings. According to his criteria at the time of his writing, the companies Collins dubs “good-to-great” were indeed great, and he remains an in-demand authority on management techniques.

It’s also possible that a follow-up study to _Good to Great_ would find that Circuit City and the other troubled good-to-greats **_abandoned_ the principles that made them great in the first place**. For example, as it lost ground to Best Buy in 2007–2008, Circuit City laid off its most talented (and well-paid) workers for a quick cash boost. A move like this contradicts Step #2 of Collins’s program, which emphasizes the hiring and retention of good people.

We also believe Collins’s ideas are useful outside of the business realm, and the fate of a Circuit City or Fannie Mae doesn’t disqualify people from using Collins’s precepts in their daily lives.
