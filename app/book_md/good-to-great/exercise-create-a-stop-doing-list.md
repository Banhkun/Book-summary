## Exercise: Create a “Stop Doing” List

It's important to focus. Use the prompts below to draft your own “stop doing” list.

* * *

Revisit the previous exercise, where you explored your own Hedgehog Concept (or, simply, a concept that intrigued you). Now, in the space below, list what you need to stop doing in order to realize that concept. Feel free to list several items, and for each item, describe how your stopping it fits with your Hedgehog Concept.

Look at your “stop doing” list and brainstorm some strategies you might use to stop yourself or your company from doing these things. What are those strategies?
