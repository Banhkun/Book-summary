Which of Collins’s steps did you find _least_ useful and why?

Given your own life and work experience, how would you _change_ Collins’s program? Would you reorder the steps in any way? Would you remove a step entirely?

Review your answer to the previous question and, using Collins’s steps as a loose guide, take a stab at designing _your own_ six-step good-to-great program. You’re welcome to think in terms of your personal life, your job life, or both!
