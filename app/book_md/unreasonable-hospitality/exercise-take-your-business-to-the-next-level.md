## Exercise: Take Your Business to the Next Level

Guidara turned Eleven Madison Park into the World’s Best Restaurant by practicing unreasonable hospitality. In particular, he streamlined priorities and policies, and he took care of employees and helped them flourish. Think about how you can apply these lessons to your business.

EMP had a 30-minute meeting every morning to discuss the priorities for the day as well as the team’s successes. Describe how you could introduce a similar routine to your team. For example, you might hold a weekly meeting or send out an update email every Monday.

Guidara found ways to make use of employees’ strengths. Think of a specific team member. What are this person’s strengths? How are these strengths being used in their current role? Can you think of a way to further leverage these strengths?

Guidara learned that it’s crucial to acknowledge your failings so that you can work around them. Think back to a time when things didn’t go your way, and reflect on your role in that situation. What could you learn from that experience? For example, Guidara realized that EMP was suffering after he refused to promote anyone to general manager; this taught him to put more trust in his employees.
