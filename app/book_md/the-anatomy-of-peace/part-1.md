## Part 1: What Is Conflict and Why Does It Matter?

The Arbinger Institute notes that we all struggle with conflicts, both on a smaller scale—in our businesses and families—and on a grand scale—politically and intergovernmentally. **Often, the Institute says, we find that conflicts grow out of our control and sometimes spread so far outside of ourselves and our opponents that they drag in everyone around us**. Therefore, as the world grows more complex and connected, it becomes increasingly important to know how to manage conflict well. Despite the need, we rarely see it handled equitably, considerately, and proactively.

(Shortform note: Even when an accord is met, conflicts often reignite; there’s evidence that over a third of the ceasefires and peace agreements made since the 1950s have fallen apart within five years.)

In this chapter, we’ll identify what Arbinger says our goal should be in a conflict, examine what it argues is wrong with our approach, and highlight what it recommends we focus on in seeking to improve our methods.

### The Problem of Conflict

Arbinger tells us that being able to manage conflict efficiently and effectively is critical. Very quickly, a conflict begins to affect more than the relationship in question. It gets in the way of your work, and it puts a strain on your other connections. When you’re stressed and unhappy in one area of your life, the Institute says, you carry those feelings with you. Further, Arbinger notes that the longer a conflict continues, the more time and energy you spend worrying about it, and the more that conflict interferes with the rest of your life. As the cycle continues, conflicts tend to expand and drag in the people around you as well.

(Shortform note: James Clear notes in his book _Atomic Habits_ that prolonged stress shifts your whole outlook, twisting your perspective until even the little things become stressful. Over time, it gets harder to stay calm and reasonable. This likely contributes to the tendency of conflicts to worsen over time.)

According to the authors, **a conflict can only be resolved when at least one side seriously considers how they might be wrong.** Even if your position is correct and your intentions are good, the Institute stresses that you can still be wrong in your _approach_ to conflict—your words, behaviors, and mindsets speak louder than your position. And it doesn’t matter how good your position is if the way you express it creates further conflict. We’ll explore this in more detail in Part 2.

First, let’s take a big-picture look at the two primary things Arbinger says most people do wrong when they approach interpersonal conflict.

#### 1\. We Try to Correct the Behavior of Others

The authors suggest that we often have trouble resolving conflict because we approach the problem from the wrong angle. In conflict, we tend to focus our interactions with others on trying to get them to change by correcting their behavior, and that doesn’t work.

According to the Arbinger Institute, there are two main problems with trying to correct the people you’re in conflict with:

  1. It’s not helpful to correct someone who’s upset with you because they don’t want to listen. They’ve already decided you’re wrong, so even if you feel their reasons are foolish or invalid, arguing with them doesn’t help. (Shortform note: Dale Carnegie, author of _How to Win Friends and Influence People,_ notes that criticizing others makes them defensive and prone to rationalizing their actions. Carnegie recommends using praise and appreciation when suggesting change.)
  2. You’re trying to correct things that have _already_ gone wrong instead of being proactive and preventing them from going wrong in the first place.



We’ll discuss how to help others change in Part 4. For now, just remember that resolving conflict requires a proactive approach; **get involved _before_ things go wrong, and _before_ the other person shuts you out.**

> **Dynamic Systems Research Shows that a Bottom-Up Approach to Conflict Works Best**
> 
> The Arbinger Institute takes a bottom-up approach to interpersonal conflict. Instead of attacking top-level behavioral problems by trying to correct what’s going wrong, the Institute focuses on mitigating the underlying causes that lead to those behaviors. **The Institute discourages prioritizing correction because when you aim for the nail that sticks up, you miss the factors that pushed the nail out in the first place.** Taking drugs away from a teenage addict won’t prevent them from accessing more, but a stronger support network and a more loving home might neutralize their need for drugs in the first place.
> 
> According to science writer Dan Jones, **analysts and mediators of large-scale conflicts around the world have begun to shift their attention to a bottom-up view** similar to the one Arbinger recommends. Jones explains that in long-running conflicts like the one between Israel and Palestine—which has been ongoing for more than 70 years—broad fixes and corrections are doomed to fail. A ceasefire, a peace accord, or a change in leadership doesn’t address the underlying causes of the hostility that generated the conflict in the first place.
> 
> Jones interviewed mediation expert and dynamic systems researcher Robert Ricigliano, who says that **it’s important to see an ongoing conflict as a system of pressure dynamics.** Ricigliano and his team use complex computer simulations to model the actions of the different agents in a competitive system, all of whom are influenced by many smaller-scale pressures—such as resource availability, local allegiances, and social dynamics. As the simulated agents work to satisfy their individual needs, they compete and cooperate, forming alliances and making enemies. **Because the agents “remember” how they’re treated by other agents, the whole system occasionally ends up locked in an aggressive cycle of recrimination.**
> 
> Like these digital agents, Ricigliano says, humans hold grudges and carry hostility forward, leading to intractable conflicts that resist resolution. When we intervene in such conflicts, he argues, we have to adjust our perspective: Addressing the _result_ of the hostility isn’t enough to prevent future conflict. Instead, **the goal is to shift an underlying aspect of the system so that hostility begins to naturally decrease over time.** If we can do that, Ricigliano suggests, we can consider the intervention a success, because the conflict begins to wind down as well.
> 
> In _The Anatomy of Peace_ , Arbinger explains that **the “underlying aspect of the system” that we need to address in our interpersonal conflicts is the way we treat people whose interests conflict with ours.** To do this, the authors recommend adopting a new mindset—one centered around being respectful of the humanity of others—thus addressing the underlying cycle of hostility that drives these conflicts**.** Additionally, treating others with respect builds mutual trust, allowing us to resolve future conflicts cooperatively rather than competitively.

#### 2\. We Refuse to Correct Our Own Behavior

The Institute says that if it’s been a while and a conflict hasn’t been resolved, it’s important to **accept the possibility that you’re misunderstanding something and are partially at fault.** If your actions aren’t at least leading _toward_ a resolution, examine them. (Shortform note: Jordan B. Peterson, author of _12 Rules for Life,_ explains that we should do this _regardless of how we feel_ : In any dead-end conflict, he says, we should assume we’ve done something wrong along the way, even if the error was small, or long ago.)

To resolve conflicts fairly, Arbinger explains, it’s important to approach them cooperatively. That means **_you_ need to act and change, too**—you can’t just suggest corrections and wait for the other person to do all the work.

> **Personal Change Is Contagious**
> 
> According to some authors, changing your own behavior is the key to getting others to change. In _Smart Change_ , Art Markman says that hypocrisy doesn’t work here; you can’t demand a behavior from someone that you don’t effectively embody yourself.
> 
> But, Markman says,**if you can show others, by your own actions, how to be better—and the benefits of being that way—your behavior becomes contagious.** Markman particularly emphasizes _visibility_ ; the people whose behavior you want to change need to _see_ you embodying the principles you want them to adopt.
> 
> Some researchers note that when others trust you, your goals become contagious as well. This is particularly noteworthy in ongoing conflict—**if your goal is to find a healthy, equitable resolution to the conflict, make sure your words and actions show that.** We’ll explore this in more detail in Part 4.

### Your Mindset Fuels Your Conflicts

In the following sections, we’ll examine the mindset that Arbinger says leads us into cyclical conflicts, learn how to escape that mindset, and explore a different approach to relationship-building that the Institute claims leads to lasting peace.

#### Defining “Mindset”

**The Arbinger Institute suggests that in improving our approach to conflict, the first and most important step is always to change our mindset.** Everything about the way our conflicts happen, Arbinger says, rises from our mindset, so it’s important to understand what the authors mean by this term.

Arbinger describes a mindset as running deeper than just the way you _think_ ; **it’s the way you see yourself, others, and the world _—_ and the conclusions you come to and the behaviors you choose as a result.** The authors note especially that the undercurrent of our thoughts, words, and actions has a strong impact on how we come across to others.

You can’t just fake a positive mindset, either; it’s important to actually mean what you say and do.**** As Arbinger notes, **when others can see that your words and actions don’t match the way you think and feel, it doesn’t matter how good your strategy is or how right you are.** Until you address the way you’re failing in your mindset toward others, your efforts will fall flat.

(Shortform note: It’s critically important to be genuine due to the harm disingenuous behavior can do. In the long run, disingenuous behavior damages trust in relationships. Most people have a sense for when another person is being insincere, and it leads to feelings of being manipulated, lied to, and used.)

#### The Two Mindsets

The authors describe two primary mindsets. One perpetuates conflict and one eases it:

**1) The Combative Mindset:**

  * The combative mindset sees others as obstacles in the way of our needs, hopes, and goals—in other words, as objects, rather than people.
  * **When we embody this mindset, we view others according to how they affect _us_.** We focus on how they get in our way, how they make us look and feel, and how they create problems and work for us to deal with. 
  * We judge quickly, and we hold grudges. We interpret people’s words and deeds as malicious acts grounded in sinister intent, and we see ourselves as maligned, mistreated heroes struggling in a cruel world. 
  * We push others away, so we don’t get the chance to productively discuss our needs.



(Shortform note: If you often feel angry, resentful, and self-righteous, consider what those feelings are doing for you, and why you cling to them. It can feel good to be angry. When others wrong us unjustly, it’s easy to indulge in feelings of self-righteousness, of, “how dare they,” and, “I’m so much better than that!” Those emotions provide an escape, a rationale, and a justification for avoiding the hard work of empathizing, communicating, and challenging yourself to improve. If you decide that the conflict is someone else’s fault and _you’re_ not the one who needs to apologize, the conflict can continue forever and you’ll never feel obligated to participate in resolving it.)

**2) The Cooperative Mindset:**

  * The cooperative mindset sees others as people _—_ with needs, struggles, pains, hopes, and goals as important as our own.
  * **When we embody this mindset, we see the person behind the other’s words and actions.** Instead of judging what we see on the surface, we remain open to learning from and about them, gaining access to understanding and insight. 
  * We put ourselves in other people’s shoes and use what we learn to respond to what they need, taking their circumstances and feelings into account. 
  * Seeing others as people _—_ and treating them as such _—_ deepens our relationships and allows us to be genuine with each other. 
  * We invite communication, Arbinger says, by showing that we’re open to it.



(Shortform note: Responding to others with empathy provides two powerful benefits: For ourselves, being able to see that the cruelty, anger, and aggression others show us comes from a place of misdirected pain humanizes them in our eyes. It shows us that we don’t have to survive a world filled with evil monsters—just people, like us, who don’t manage to be as perfect as we’d all like to be. The other great benefit of showing empathetic compassion is that when you allow a person to be heard—really heard, without judgment or criticism—they find themselves willing to hear others, as well. All it takes to begin resolving a conflict is for one of us to listen openly. Arbinger asks us to be the one who listens first.)

Arbinger points out that the cooperative mindset is a much more useful mindset in approaching conflict of all kinds and is thus the mindset that you should shift to. **Taking into account the needs of others lets you treat them better and find resolutions that are more satisfying to all parties** —for example:

  * In the case of a defendant arrested for stealing bread, a judge with a combative mindset prescribes the maximum sentence. He sees the defendant as a criminal, and the applicable law as a universally appropriate punishment.
  * A judge with a cooperative mindset sees the personhood of the defendant, and is curious about the circumstances behind the theft. She might discover that the defendant's family is starving, and that the circumstances validate the crime. Because she's open to seeing that, she might better serve a struggling community than a judge whose mindset is combative toward criminals.



Maintaining a cooperative mindset doesn’t mean avoiding conflict entirely, Arbinger says; instead, **the cooperative mindset seeks a method of resolving conflict that’s respectful of the humanity of all participants.**

We’ll discuss how to embody the cooperative mindset in Part 3, and how Arbinger recommends we make use of it and encourage others to adopt it in Part 4. For now, we’ll move on to Part 2, where we’ll take a closer look at the combative mindset and examine the behaviors the Institute says lead us into conflict.

> **Mindset Adjustment and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy**
> 
> Mindset adjustment like that advocated by the Institute above is a common vehicle used by therapists and psychiatrists to aid in the personal and social growth of their clients. In each case, **the goal of the adjustment is to mitigate or eliminate the negative effects of a person’s current perspective.** This method of shifting mindset is called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT.
> 
> David D. Burns, M.D., author of _Feeling Good_ —a seminal work in the field of CBT—explains that **we feel the way we think.** For various reasons, Burns says, we develop habitual ways of thinking—mindsets—that determine what things mean to us. Our brain must process the inputs it receives and filter these through our mindset before we can feel any kind of way about an event, and if our thinking is biased, our feelings will be, too.
> 
> **Further, strong negative feelings are often caused by ways of thinking called cognitive distortions.** These distortions, according to Burns, can take many forms, but they usually lead us to believe firm statements or claims that aren’t entirely true. Here are a few examples of cognitive distortions we may make in a conflict:
> 
>   * **Overgeneralizing:** Your boss says she’s unsatisfied with your performance on your latest project, and you take this to mean she’ll never be satisfied with _anything_ you do.
> 
>   * **Personalizing:** Your partner didn’t do the dishes, and you think, “he’s a lazy bum!”
> 
>   * **Jumping to conclusions:** You make eye contact with your coworker, and he quickly turns away. You take this to mean that he’s furious about your earlier disagreement.
> 
>   * **Fortune telling:** You have an argument with your wife, and she storms out. You think, “we’ll never be able to fix this,” and feel certain you’re headed for divorce.
> 
> 

> 
> These distortions, Burns says, negatively affect our feelings, thinking, and behavior moving forward, but in each case, we’re feeling and acting based on an inaccurate assumption. **Instead of accepting the distorted thoughts, Burns tells us to examine them; to find the inaccuracies and correct them.** This shifts us toward a more positive mindset. In making the shift, we free ourselves to see the world as it really is and broaden our options.
> 
> To look at Arbinger’s ideas through a CBT lens, **the Institute teaches us to shift our mindset and see others as whole people because doing so helps us avoid a host of cognitive distortions that make managing conflict more difficult.** A people-focused mindset makes it feel less reasonable to respond to interpersonal conflicts with violence, criticism, and judgment—responses that fuel hostility and prevent cooperation.
> 
> According to Arbinger, cognitive distortions help us justify choosing to act against our internal desire, or conscience. For instance, personalizing and seeing your partner as a lazy bum helps you justify shouting at him, slacking on your own chores, or giving up on trying to resolve the conflict at all. We’ll examine the mechanics and effects of justification in more detail in Part 2.
