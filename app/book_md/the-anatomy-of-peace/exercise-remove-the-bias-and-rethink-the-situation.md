## Exercise: Remove the Bias and Rethink the Situation

Revisit the situation you described in the previous exercise. What follows are the second and third steps at the core of the cooperative mindset: Remove the bias, and rethink the situation. Repeat this process whenever you find yourself holding a bias, or in a conflict; it’ll help you to maintain a cooperative mindset, and prime your conscience to give you an actionable push.

* * *

Think about a person you’re not biased against, and write down their name. Describe an experience you shared with that person where you felt he or she acknowledged and respected your needs and the weight you were carrying.

From this perspective, take another look at the person you described being in conflict with before. What are the weights they’re carrying, and which of their needs aren’t being met?

How are you adding to those weights? In what way have you neglected their needs or mistreated them?

How are the biases you listed blinding you to the truth about that person and yourself? How are those biases interfering with potential solutions?

Take another look at what you’ve written in this exercise. How can you help this person like your “safe” person might help you? What are you feeling you should do? When you’re done answering, act.
