## Exercise: Use the Mental Models to Make a Change

 _The Great Mental Models_ series is designed to provide useful tools for everyday life. Let’s explore how you can use some of the models from _Volume 2_ to make a meaningful change in your life.

* * *

Describe a problem you’re facing or a change you’d like to make in your life. Name some specific factors that are holding you back through _friction_ and/or _inertia_.

What _incentives_ could you use to motivate your progress? What _catalysts_ could make your job easier?

Name someone who could help you toward your goal. How would you _alloy_ or _cooperate_ with this person to advance your aims? How could you use _relativity_ or _leverage_ to get that person on your side?

How would you measure your progress toward your goal to make sure you maintain _velocity_ in the right direction?
