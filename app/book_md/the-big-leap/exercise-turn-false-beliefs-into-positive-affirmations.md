## Exercise: Turn False Beliefs Into Positive Affirmations

Create positive affirmations out of your false and negative beliefs about yourself.

* * *

Which of the false beliefs Hendricks identifies do you recognize in yourself? Can you think of any other false or negative beliefs you might have about yourself that weren’t mentioned here? Write down _any_ false or negative beliefs you can think of.

Now, for each false belief you identified, rewrite that statement in a positive way. For example, “I am flawed so I can’t be successful” might become “I am _resilient_ , and I _can_ be successful.” Reword these in any way you like, appropriate to yourself, as long as you replace any negative words with positive ones.

Reflect here on how this feels for you the first time, and then notice how the feeling shifts over time. Do the statements become easier to believe the more you repeat them?
