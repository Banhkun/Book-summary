## Exercise: Practice Engaging With Complexity

One major barrier to learning from failure is oversimplifying the story. When we scapegoat, simplify, and distort the facts, we obscure what’s really going on and prevent learning. To overcome this, practice engaging with complexity.

* * *

Describe a situation in your personal life where someone close to you made a mistake and you jumped to conclusions.

As Syed explains, we often tell simple stories to feel better—but they tend to obscure the truth. In the situation you’ve named, how might the story be more complex than you initially thought? (For example, maybe you assumed that your spouse was being snarky to annoy you, but it also had to do with their stress and lack of time for relaxation.)

The next time someone else makes a mistake, how might you respond differently? For example, think about slowing down and looking for more details before casting blame.
