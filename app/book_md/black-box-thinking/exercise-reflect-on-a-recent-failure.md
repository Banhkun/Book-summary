## Exercise: Reflect on a Recent Failure

Reflecting on our own mistakes can help us to course-correct and better understand how to achieve our goals. Here, consider a recent mistake and what you might’ve done differently.

* * *

Describe a recent mistake you made in your work or personal life—something notable that might have caused you to feel uncomfortable. For example, maybe you had an argument with a colleague or spouse that went a little too far.

Now, “gather data,” as Syed suggests, by reflecting on that mistake. Specifically, _what_ went wrong, and _why_ did things end in failure?

Finally, take the last step of Syed’s process and write out what you can do next time. In other words, what simple change could you make that would result in a better outcome?
