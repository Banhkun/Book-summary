## Exercise: Practice Viewing Failure as Positive

When we view failure negatively, it hinders our ability to learn. Practice seeing your mistakes in a positive light.

* * *

Syed explains that your view of failure determines how you respond to it. Reflecting on your own mindset, when are you hardest on yourself for making a mistake?

Changing your mindset involves seeing failure as intrinsic to learning. Building on your answer to the previous question, what is a positive learning experience that could come from that mistake?

To solidify your understanding of this principle, write one sentence in your own words about what “failure is intrinsic to learning” means. Use this mantra the next time you make a mistake.
