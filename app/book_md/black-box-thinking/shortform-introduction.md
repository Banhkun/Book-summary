## Shortform Introduction

In _Black Box Thinking_ , Matthew Syed argues that learning from failure drives human progress. It’s how we adapt to an ever-changing world, how we innovate in science and business, and how individuals and organizations improve. While modern society benefits from this tradition of rational learning (inherited from the ancient Greeks and the European Enlightenment), Syed explains that we still need to apply rational, failure-driven learning to our social institutions.

Namely, our politics, courts, and hospitals stigmatize failure and perpetuate a culture of false exceptionalism that prevents them from improving. If we neglect to improve our stagnating institutions, they’ll continue to take the lives of innocents—whether it’s death due to preventable medical error or wrongful conviction that leads to life in prison.

Syed explains how certain organizations have distinct cultures and systems that _promote_ learning, while others’ _prevent_ learning. Fortunately, any organization can change its view of failure to transform its culture and systems, thus becoming a learning organization.

### About the Author

Matthew Syed is a British journalist and author, as well as a former table tennis player. As the number one English player through the 1990s, he represented Great Britain in the 1992 (Barcelona) and 2000 (Sydney) Olympic Games.

In an interview with F1 Champion Nico Rosberg, Syed discusses how his loss of a key Olympic match directly sparked his desire to examine mindset and performance psychology. His background as an athlete informs the examples in _Black Box Thinking_ , from F1 Racing to soccer and cycling _._

Since the end of his sporting career in 2000, Syed has written for _The Times_ , a London-based newspaper, and authored six books. Today, he also commentates for the BBC and Eurosport, mainly on sports, culture, and politics. He works with businesses to develop organizationwide growth mindsets—a topic he covers at length in _Black Box Thinking_ — through Matthew Syed Consulting.

Syed has received numerous awards for his work, including:

  * Sports Journalist of the Year (British Press Awards, 2009 and 2015)
  * Number 1 Thought Leader and LinkedIn Top Voices in the UK (LinkedIn, 2016)
  * Best New Writer (British Sports Book Awards, 2011)
  * Best British Book Award in Children’s Non-Fiction (2019)

### The Book’s Publication

_Black Box Thinking****_ was published in 2015 by Penguin Random House. This was Syed’s second book, after his debut _Bounce_ —an international best seller on the role of talent and practice in success. Syed has since written two adult nonfiction books, _The Greatest _(2017) and _Rebel Ideas _(2019), and two children’s books— _You Are Awesome_ (2018) and _Dare to Be You_ (2020)—to extend his ideas about learning and growth to a younger audience.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical and Intellectual Context

In _Black Box Thinking,_ Syed draws from the work of Francis Bacon, a 17th century English philosopher who helped resurface the scientific tradition begun in classical Greece. Syed situates his argument as a continuation of this historical discourse on rationality, firmly supporting an empirical approach to learning and growth.

He also references Karl Popper, an influential 20th-century philosopher of science who argued for an empirical approach to science and opposed inductive reasoning (inferring general laws from observations of a phenomenon). This perspective runs throughout _Black Box Thinking_ , where Syed argues for an empirical, data-driven approach to learning from failure.

In short, Syed thoroughly supports the view that reason à la the European Enlightenment is humanity’s way forward. Steven Pinker, author of _Enlightenment Now_ and _Rationality_, is perhaps the most vocal public intellectual espousing this view—that reason drives human progress, peace, and knowledge.

_Black Box Thinking_ also overlaps with well-known books such as _Grit_ (Angela Duckworth), _Mindset_ (Carol Dweck), and _Outliers_ (Malcolm Gladwell), with their shared themes of resilience, trial-and-error learning, and mindset-based success.

Finally, Syed introduces a nuance to learning from our mistakes—that neglecting to learn from failure is tantamount to moral irresponsibility. Specifically, he argues that it hinders the development of more effective social institutions, and that society must adapt through failure to keep pace with technological change.

#### The Book’s Impact

While _Black Box Thinking_ didn’t reach the same heights as his previous book _Bounce_ (an international bestseller), it led directly into Syed’s subsequent projects: In an interview, Syed explains that parents reached out to praise _Black Box Thinking_ and express their concern that their children needed to hear his message. In response, Syed wrote two children’s books titled _You Are Awesome_ and _Dare to Be You_ to bring his ideas to the next generation.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Online reviewers praise Syed’s writing style as captivating, with well-told and broad-ranging stories to illustrate the ideas. Some call _Black Box Thinking_ clear and concise, and they explain how its message has positively impacted their own relationship to failure.

Reviewers who disliked the book complain that the main argument comes in the first two chapters, and the rest is repetitive. Others find Syed’s thesis obvious, saying that the book offers nothing new on the “why” of learning from failure, nor enough detail on the “how.” Some readers also complain that Syed’s examples include irrelevant details, causing the book to become unnecessarily fluffy.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Syed builds his argument narrative-first: Each chapter features anecdotes that illustrate the main ideas, followed by a discussion of the principles. Many of these effectively demonstrate the argument, and Syed grabs the reader’s emotions with high-stakes tales of real-world failures and learning (or lack thereof).

_Black Box Thinking****_ contains a substantive argument for the importance of learning from failure as individuals and organizations. Despite this, Syed often repeats the main point and the anecdotes begin to feel repetitive, adding only marginal value.

Toward the end, Syed takes on a mildly polemic tone, exhorting the reader about the gravity of the issue. This helps to drive his argument home, given his solid reasoning about our lack of empirical improvement systems in many areas of society. On the other end, the book ends with a collection of actionables that feel tacked-on, rather than well-developed.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_Black Box Thinking_ unfolds in six parts of two to three chapters each. Each part broadly discusses a component of Syed’s argument, ranging from the logic of failure (Part 1) to putting the ideas into action (Part 6).

Within each part, the structure is somewhat unclear. Each chapter features three to five sections that loosely treat distinct ideas, but the prose returns to the main point: Learn from your failures. Because of this repetition, it’s difficult at times to identify and order the sub-points of the argument. In other words, the over-emphasis on Syed’s main point obscures the nuances of his argument.

Since each major part covers different aspects of the argument, it’s easy to dip back into the book to revisit various sections. This helps offset the difficulty of parsing Syed’s argument amidst the sea of anecdotes.

### Our Approach in This Guide

We’ve reorganized _Black Box Thinking_ ’s six parts into four parts, clarifying and distilling the key arguments. In Part 1, we introduce the book’s inquiry—how and why to learn from failure, as individuals and organizations—and explain the historical context of learning from failure. In Part 2, we discuss organizations that learn from failure and how they do it. Conversely, in Part 3, we discuss organizations that _don’t_ learn from failure and the dangers that such neglect presents. Finally, Part 4 explains the changes that help us embrace failure-based learning as individuals and organizations.

Here’s how our guide maps onto the book’s chapters:

  * Part 1 → Chapters “Coda,” 1, 2, 3
  * Part 2 → Chapters 7, 8, 9, 10
  * Part 3 → Chapters 4, 5, 6, 11, 12
  * Part 4 → Chapters 13, 14



Given Syed’s focus on organizational development, we’ve buttressed his perspective with ideas from _The Fifth Discipline_ by Peter Senge, which discusses how companies can use problem solving and systems thinking to become “learning organizations.” We’ve also brought in actionables from _Tribal Leadership, _by Dave Logan et al., which discusses how to improve your organization by upgrading its culture, dovetailing with Syed’s argument that an organization’s culture must change before its systems can.
