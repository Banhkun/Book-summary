## Exercise: Identify Your Generational Role

According to Strauss and Howe’s theory, everyone fits into a generation that plays a specific role in each Turning. Identify what generation you belong to and how that affects your role.

* * *

Based on your birth year, which generation do you belong to? In what ways do you relate to the authors’ descriptions of your generation? If you’re a Millennial (of the Hero generation), for example, did you feel highly protected by your parents as a child?

What is your generation’s role in the Fourth Turning, and how do you see that manifesting? If you’re a Millennial, for example, do you feel your generation has united under a sense of collective duty to tackle the problems of the Crisis?

What actions could you take to make the best use of your generation’s skills and traits to minimize the negative impacts of the Crisis? If you’re a Millennial, this may include teamwork-driven activities like fundraising for oppressed groups, volunteering to help with campaigns for politicians who reflect your values, or raising awareness of issues like income inequality.
