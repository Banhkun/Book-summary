## 1-Page Summary

In _The Fourth Turning_ , William Strauss and Neil Howe explain that human history is characterized by a cyclical progression through four “Turnings,” which the authors liken to seasons. Each Turning lasts around 15-25 years (approximately the length of one of four phases of a human life—childhood, young adulthood, middle age, and elderhood) and is defined by the behaviors of the generations passing through them, specifically by how they react to societal changes and events.

William Strauss (1947–2007) was an author, playwright, historian, and lecturer who worked for the U.S. Department of Energy and later the Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation, and Government Processes. Neil Howe is an author, consultant, and a senior associate for the former Global Aging Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Together, Strauss and Howe authored several other books including _Generations_ , _13th Gen_ , and _Millennials Rising_.

In our guide, we’ll explore the four Turnings and the societal trends that accompany them. We’ll then explain the four generations that Strauss and Howe describe and their roles in society at different life phases. Finally, we’ll look at the past three Turnings in American history and the authors’ predictions for the Fourth. We’ll also examine the authors’ theories in the context of history and modern society, as well as how their predictions about the Fourth Turning have played out in the years since the book’s publication in 1997.

(Shortform note: The authors further explain generational archetypes in _Generations_ , and much of the information in _The Fourth Turning_ builds on the “generational theory” they presented in this book.)

### The Four Turnings

Like a single phase of a human life, a Turning lasts around 15-25 years. A single cycle of these four Turnings is called a saeculum. Turnings aren’t characterized by the events that occur during them, but rather by society’s reactions to those events. According to the authors, a First Turning is a High, a Second Turning is an Awakening, a Third Turning is an Unraveling, and a Fourth Turning is a Crisis. The saeculum theory is based on a cyclical view of time—the idea that the same themes and types of events recur and will continue to recur throughout history—as opposed to the chaotic theory, which views time as a series of random and unrelated events, or the linear theory, which views time as a non-recurring progression with a definite start and end.

(Shortform note: Other writers have proposed a fourth theory of time known as the spiral theory. This combines the cyclical theory with the linear theory. It suggests that, while themes and events do recur throughout history, we can also learn and improve as time goes on and shift the spiral up—or we can continue to make bad choices and shift the spiral down. In the spiral theory, “turnings” and “saecula” don’t exist because there’s a greater focus on change than on recurrence. Like the cyclical theory, the spiral theory shows that we can better handle upcoming changes if we’re aware of them and prepare for them, but it also grants us the agency to improve ourselves and society in the long term.)

The actions of a society can’t stop the cycle, but we can prepare for each Turning by studying previous cycles and the effects they had on society. We can then ease transitions by shifting our activities based on the Turning we’re currently in and anticipating the next one. On an individual scale, this means preparing in advance for the financial and cultural challenges the next Turning might pose. On a societal scale, this means governments should anticipate the shifts in public sentiment and alter their programs and agendas to suit them.

(Shortform note: The types of large-scale, society-wide changes needed to prepare for a Turning require the ability to shift cognitive sets—to switch behaviors or mindsets to fit different tasks or contexts. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the prospect of returning to previous modes of life—a monumental transition for society—experts claim that society at large will need to utilize this ability to help make the transition easier for all of us. While we don’t know exactly when the transition will happen or what it will look like, knowing that it _will_ happen will help us maintain some control over it so we can navigate the changes smoothly.)

#### The First Turning: A High

According to the authors, a High occurs after a period of great turmoil is resolved. During a High, a new social order is put in place. Government is strong and active, and public services are expanded. New institutions like schools are established and infrastructure is strengthened. Public trust in these institutions is strong.

Values like individualism fall out of fashion and are replaced by more collective values. This includes an emphasis on self-sacrifice and duty for the greater good of the community, as well as a strong expectation for conformity. Income inequality and unemployment fall and productivity increases. Class inequality also falls, but gender gaps increase as society’s values begin to reflect a strict division between masculine and feminine roles. Children are given greater autonomy and parents become less protective.

> **Generational Theory in Other Cultures**
> 
> The authors focus exclusively on Anglo-American history in their analyses and don’t address if or how these theories apply in other countries or geographic areas. Many of the cyclical shifts they describe don’t appear in other cultures.
> 
> For example, much of Chinese culture matches the authors’ descriptions of a High and has for centuries. Strong government, collectivism, duty, family stability, and strict gender divisions have long been hallmarks of Chinese culture, suggesting that they haven’t experienced the cyclical trends the authors describe. China has shown greater fluidity in areas like income inequality, which has fluctuated significantly over the past few decades, spiking between the 1980s and 2008 and then falling slowly. However, experts argue that this has to do with the increasing globalization and technological advancement being seen across the world, suggesting that it’s not a cyclical trend.

#### The Second Turning: An Awakening

The authors describe the Second Turning as an Awakening. An Awakening occurs when people pull away from the social order imposed during the High, resulting in a cultural revolution. People question and defy the institutions and regulations established during the High as the need for them falls out of living memory. The establishments from the High now seem stifling and inequitable, and people reject them to seek out spiritual fulfillment.

People also reject collective values and the ideals of duty and conformity in favor of individual rights. Government weakens and free markets begin to overshadow public services. Violence and crime increase, as do income inequality and class divisions. Gender divisions become less strict, and child-rearing becomes more lenient and laissez-faire. Risk-taking becomes more common.

(Shortform note: The authors’ description of an Awakening parallels the phenomenon of teenage rebellion in many ways. Like a society fresh off a High, teenagers are leaving the protection of childhood, seeking their own individual identities, flouting childhood rules that they feel don’t apply to them anymore, rejecting conformity, and taking more risks. Also like an Awakening, some degree of teenage rebellion can’t be prevented and is actually a necessary part of psychological development, according to experts.)

#### The Third Turning: An Unraveling

The authors describe the Third Turning as an Unraveling. An Unraveling occurs when society embraces the new order put in place during the Awakening. Trust in government and establishments continues to decline, and people become more passionate about and extreme in their beliefs. Communities become divided over morals and unified action becomes more difficult. People begin to feel like they’re hurtling toward a catastrophe.

People become tribal or nationalistic and suspicious of anything that doesn’t fit their values. Individualism is at its highest, government power stagnates, and free markets become even more favored. Violence, crime, and income inequality reach their peak. Gender divisions are even less strict and society becomes more protective of children.

(Shortform note: The sense of impending cataclysm during an Unraveling may help explain the psychology behind the extremism that grows in this period. Research suggests that when we perceive potential risks, we’re compelled to seek safety among groups, and these groups are often ideological in nature. The greater our sense of danger, the more closely we adhere to such group ideologies, and the stronger and more polarized our beliefs become. During an Unraveling, these perceived dangers would be exacerbated by increased crime and inequality, further eroding trust in large organizations and cementing trust in tribal groups.)

#### The Fourth Turning: A Crisis

A Crisis occurs when a catalyst—a major event or series of events that creates a mood shift—occurs and ignites a significant change in society. According to the authors, major events can happen in any Turning, but only after an Unraveling do they create a society-wide crisis because the anxious, pessimistic, and pre-cataclysmic mood of the Unraveling primes people to respond in a way that creates a societal upheaval.

These events are the culmination of threats that the nation saw coming but failed to properly prepare for, which creates a panic about the nation’s ability to handle such events. In response to this panic, people begin to unite as communities to establish a new social order that demands collective sacrifice to resolve the nation’s problems. The government is appointed to implement and enforce this social order, usually with mixed results. Still, people are willing to endure the government’s missteps—even catastrophic ones—for the sake of decisive action, which can give inordinate power to poor leaders.

Violence, crime, and income inequality decrease as the Turning progresses. Gender divisions increase again as women and the elderly are expected to leave the workforce to make room for young men. Protectiveness over children is at its highest.

Eventually, the Crisis peaks and the social order is at its strongest. Though violence at the public level is low, the risk of national violence such as revolution, civil war, and foreign war increases. Leaders characterize foreign enemies and political opponents as immoral and refuse to compromise, and the use of highly deadly or destructive weaponry increases for the sake of decisive victories in war.

As a result of the Crisis, society is unrecognizably transformed, for better or worse. The resolution of the Crisis cements the new social order and results in an end to wars and conflicts via treaties, the punishment of the “losers,” and the renewal of public life.

> **The Third Reich: A Fourth Turning in Germany?**
> 
> While the authors focus on Anglo-American history, readers may note some similarities between the descriptions of the Fourth Turning and events that occurred in other countries, such as the rise of the Third Reich and the Nazi party.
> 
> The harsh penalties imposed on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles after World War I created an atmosphere in Germany that was rife for exploitation by a leader like Adolph Hitler. The country was forced to pay reparations so large that its currency became practically worthless, and economic hardship spread throughout the populace.
> 
> People placed the blame for their suffering on the country’s democratic government and on groups like the Jewish community, leading to both a strong distrust of the government and extremist and nationalistic beliefs that set the stage for the Holocaust’s horrific human rights abuses and genocide. The atmosphere was now right for a Crisis, and the Depression of 1929 served as the catalyst, propelling the nation into the embrace of the authoritarian Nazi party and Hitler, who promised to restore Germany to its former glory.
> 
> In keeping with the authors’ descriptions of a Fourth Turning, people were willing to put aside individual rights for the sake of collective duty. They were also willing to accept poor leadership and heavy collateral damage for the sake of returning to their pre-World War I status. Women were cast as inferior to and subservient to men, and groups viewed to be harmful to children, such as the Boy Scouts, were banned and replaced with the Hitler Youth.
> 
> Ultimately, by painting their chosen enemies as purely evil and deserving of extermination, the Nazi regime succeeded in murdering more than 10 million people and created a nation that was unrecognizable from what it used to be. Since this Crisis in Germany coincided with a Fourth Turning in America, analyzing saecular Turnings in the context of larger global conflicts may yield greater insights than studying them exclusively in one culture or nation.

### Generational Archetypes

According to the authors, each generation in society fits into one of four different archetypes: the Prophet generation, the Nomad generation, the Hero generation, and the Artist generation. Archetypes help characterize the generations and explain why they behave in certain ways during each Turning. The birth range of a generation is about 15-25 years—approximately the same length as a Turning—and the pattern proceeds almost universally in this order. Those born on the cusps of generational divides can be sorted based on the generation they most identify with—for example, the Boomer generation spanned from approximately 1943 to 1960, but someone born in 1961 might identify with the Boomer generation, while someone born in 1959 might identify with Generation X.

(Shortform note: Critics of generational theory argue that distinctions between age groups like the ones Strauss and Howe make are arbitrary and unsupported by solid evidence. They point out that different theories on generations contradict each other and often use such vague criteria that they become useless. Others point out that generational divisions presume that people have more in common with strangers their own age than with older or younger people they know very well. Further, such divisions are often just used as marketing tools to target groups for certain products.)

#### Archetypes and Their Roles

The authors explain that, for every archetype, each phase of life is accompanied by unique social roles. The **childhood** phase is defined by receiving support from others and learning morals. The way society views and treats children varies with the Turnings, shifting back and forth between the belief that children need to be highly protected and looked after and the belief that they need little protection with a tendency toward hands-off parenting.

(Shortform note: Some experts have addressed the past few decades’ shift toward more protective parenting and attribute it to societal factors rather than cyclical changes. They point out that society has shifted away from tight-knit neighborhood communities where parents and children all know each other, so there are fewer opportunities for children to socialize away from home. Additionally, schools have become more and more dominant in children’s lives, and the idea of a pedagogical method of child-rearing has spread from schools into the home. This causes parents to feel they need to constantly monitor their children rather than trusting them to play and grow freely.)

**Young adulthood** is defined by service to society and the testing of morals. It’s the age where people are building and pursuing their dreams, forming families, and carrying out the work that keeps society moving such as lower-level work and military service. The degree to which young adults respect and carry on the work of older generations varies with the Turnings, shifting between dutiful conformity and rebellious individualism.

(Shortform note: Some experts suggest that there is an intermediary life stage between childhood and adulthood called emerging adulthood, which spans ages 18 to 25. Research shows that the brain continues to develop during this age range, and most people in this age group report still feeling like children in some ways. During this period, people are still figuring out their identities and what kind of future they want to build. The addition of this generational category may better represent the roles of people under 25 than a category that places a 21-year-old and a 39-year-old in the same life phase.)

**Midlife** is defined by managing society and upholding morals. This is when people are reaping the rewards from their work during young adulthood, making their dreams a reality, and beginning to take on leadership roles in society. Depending on the Turning, mid-lifers’ leadership roles shift between being more pronounced in politics and being more pronounced in culture.

**Elderhood** is defined by leading society and passing on morals to younger generations. People are relieved of the burden of work and spend their time in leisure and recreation, or they take on society’s most powerful leadership positions. The influence that Elders have on society shifts with the Turnings between culture and politics—when mid-lifers are wielding greater influence in politics, elder influence shifts to culture and vice versa.

> **How Age Affects a Group’s Influence on Society**
> 
> Research indicates that young people have a greater influence on culture than Strauss and Howe’s theory may suggest. While it’s easier to study culture in midlife and elder generations because their traits are more fixed, much of social change is prompted by young people, and cultural change is generally more rapid in groups that include both younger and older individuals.
> 
> Political participation across the generations, however, matches up with the authors’ descriptions, with participation and leadership levels increasing with age. For one, younger people are less likely to vote than older people, which may be due to factors like less free time and less stable housing for younger generations. Younger people are also underrepresented in political office, and research suggests that financial barriers play a large role in preventing younger people from running—it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to run a political campaign and usually takes up too much time to be compatible with a typical work or school schedule.
> 
> In the US, elderhood has more political sway than ever, as political participation and leadership are extending later and later into elderhood, leaving midlifers and especially young adults behind. The median age of Members of Congress has increased by more than seven years over the last three decades, from around 53 to over 60, and around 25% of Congresspeople are now over 70. Additionally, the 2020 presidential election resulted in the election of the nation’s oldest president in history—Joe Biden at age 78.
> 
> This trend has raised concerns that America’s government is becoming a gerontocracy, which disproportionately represents the interests of the elderly who may have less investment in the nation’s future than younger people. It has prompted some to call for maximum age limits on political office, which the majority of Americans support, but which experts say are unlikely to be enacted.

As they go through the phases of life, the archetypes take on new roles and characteristics, such as the following:

  * Prophets are born during a High. In childhood, Prophets are coddled, and they grow into self-centered rebels who seek societal change. They are judgmental in midlife but can provide wise judgment in their elder years. 
  * Nomads are born during an Awakening. In childhood, Nomads are loosely parented or neglected. They feel estranged and are stigmatized in young adulthood, but they become sensible mid-lifers who provide practical leadership, and they’re hardy and reliable in elderhood.
  * Heroes are born during an Unraveling. In childhood, Heroes are heavily protected. They have a strong sense of teamwork, duty, and self-sacrifice in young adulthood, but grow arrogant in midlife. As elders, they find the values they fought for under attack by the Prophet young adults.
  * Artists are born during a Crisis. In childhood, Artists are overprotected. In young adulthood, they’re thoughtful and deferential. They make for ambivalent midlife leaders and compassionate elders.



> **Archetypes and Story Arcs**
> 
> These generational archetypes and their life progressions are similar to some of the classic story archetypes.
> 
> The Prophet generation could represent a tragedy story arc, as they progress from the High in which they’re born through a lifelong dismantling of the High, ending in a Crisis where they have gained the wisdom of learning from their many mistakes.
> 
> The Nomad generation represents a “voyage and return” story arc, living their youth feeling disconnected and cut off from other generations but growing strong and practical from their isolated journeys.
> 
> The Hero generation represents an overcoming the monster story arc. In their youth they’re faced with an overwhelming threat they have to solve by putting aside their own needs for the greater good, after which they can bask in the aftermath of their victory.
> 
> The Artist generation represents a rebirth story arc. Born during the tumult of a Crisis, in their youth they experience the rebirth into the renewed society of a High, growing sensitive and thoughtful from their experience and retaining that sensitivity as society descends back toward the Unraveling and Crisis.

The authors discuss generations throughout history, but for the purposes of this guide we’ll discuss the following:

  * The Lost generation, a Nomad generation born between 1883 and 1900
  * The G.I. generation, a Hero generation born between 1901 and 1924
  * The Silent generation, an Artist generation born between 1925 and 1942
  * The Boomer generation, a Prophet generation born between 1943 and 1960
  * Generation X (or Xennials), a Nomad generation born between 1961 and 1981
  * The Millennial generation, a Hero generation born beginning in 1982 (the authors don’t give a firm end date for this generation’s birth years)



(Shortform note: Some of these generational monikers were coined by Strauss and Howe themselves, specifically the G.I. generation and Millennials. Gertrude Stein is responsible for coining the Lost Generation, and the first known use of the Silent Generation designation was by an unnamed writer in _Time_ magazine in the 1950s. Baby Boomer was first used in the late 1970s by _The Washington Post_ , and Generation X was first used in a photo essay by Robert Capa. The generation after Millennials is generally known as Generation Z, but some other proposed names include Founders, Homelanders, and iGeneration.)

The generations both shape and are shaped by the Turnings as they pass through them. Below, we will explain Turnings and how the generational archetypes play into them.

### America’s Most Recent Turnings

The authors published this book in 1997, at which point they explained that the US was nearing the end of a Third Turning. America’s current saeculum began in 1946, just after World War II (America’s most recent Crisis), which is where we’ll start.

#### The American High: A First Turning

The First Turning of our current saeculum lasted from 1946 to 1964, explain the authors. With the Crisis of the war over, the G.I. generation returned from war with renewed optimism and a sense of collective purpose. They were welcomed back home as brave champions and began forming secure, prosperous families.

(Shortform note: The success of the American High depended largely on the Allies’ victory in World War II. Critics before the war cautioned that a loss would result in America being dismantled and taken over by the victors, which would essentially be the end of the American empire. Modern scholars suggest that although there was very little chance of an Allied loss by the time America entered the war, a loss would have resulted in the complete extermination of Jewish people and large-scale support of Nazis in America. In either case, it would be difficult to term the resulting era a “High” for the general population.)

During this Turning, the elder Lost (Nomad) generation was leading with the wisdom built by living through two world wars and the Great Depression. They willingly and self-sacrificially paid high taxes to support the younger generations. The (Hero) G.I.s in midlife built their nation to its greatest point in history so far. The young adult Silent (Artist) generation married early and avoided risk, working mostly to help the older and younger generations in their efforts rather than pursuing a generational cause of their own.

> **Prosperity During a High: Will Millennials Be Left Behind?**
> 
> Experts note a large difference between young adult trajectories in the American High compared to today, which may be attributable to the economic opportunities available to the American High G.I. and Silent generations (that Turning’s midlife and young adult generations, respectively) compared to the opportunities available for today’s young adults, Millennials.
> 
> Research shows that greater financial stability results in earlier and more common family-building and child-rearing, which explains the huge rise in birth rates that resulted in the Baby Boomer generation (the offspring of the financially successful G.I. and Silent generations). However, today’s experts point out that Millennials are on track to be the most financially disadvantaged generation in American history.
> 
> Even while Boomers and Xennials (today’s elder and midlife generations) were subject to the same economic recessions as Millennials, Boomer and Xennial wages largely recovered, while Millennials’ did not. This is because the recessions disrupted the _early_ careers of Millennials, knocking them off the traditional trajectory of wage growth and wealth accumulation, which they haven’t been able to make up for.
> 
> In 2020, despite making up a plurality of the US workforce, Millennials controlled less than 5% of the nation’s wealth. Though a new High should be on its way, experts suggest that Millennials, who will be in the midlife stage at that point, are likely to never recover from the blow to their finances, unlike the previous midlife, Hero generation (G.I.s) who enjoyed great economic prosperity during the American High.

During the American High, trust in government and institutions was high, and governing power was strong and had plentiful resources to implement social change. Income inequality dropped and the middle class flourished. As families grew, their need for housing increased as well, leading to the mass building of suburbs. However, beneath the upbeat mood of the High, racism and sexism brewed, materialism was rampant, and nonconformity was stigmatized.

(Shortform note: The American High may have actually represented a net loss in opportunity for some marginalized groups, as people who entered the workforce during the war were pushed out again in favor of white men. Black women in particular saw greater economic prosperity during the Crisis, as 600,000 of them took over jobs left by soldiers going to war. However, when the war ended and the soldiers returned home, those women lost those jobs and consequently their income despite their integral role in maintaining American industry during the war.)

#### The Consciousness Revolution: A Second Turning

The Awakening that followed the American High lasted from 1964 to 1984, and the authors termed it the Consciousness Revolution. According to the authors, its beginning was sparked by the assassination of John F. Kennedy at the end of 1963, which shook the nation and incited new social movements rebelling against the now well-established government and social institutions from the High.

Confidence in the nation’s G.I.-built institutions—such as government regulation and spending, labor unions, and corporations—began to waver. People no longer accepted the costs of these institutions, which included the massive power of corporations compared to individuals, police abuse of the poor, and the suffocation of creativity by academia.

(Shortform note: Many of the social movements taking place in this era started as consciousness-raising movements, largely begun by feminist groups. These movements were focused on bringing attention to oppression that people—particularly people in the oppressed group in question—might not be aware of, as opposed to movements that focused on immediate action. Such efforts provided the bedrock for more concrete changes that came later, and consciousness-raising continues to be an important means of promoting modern social movements. The popularization of movements like this in the 1960s and 1970s may be what prompted Strauss and Howe to label this Turning the Consciousness Revolution.)

Boomer Prophets entered young adulthood with no memory of the wartime plights that necessitated these systems. Hero G.I.s (now elders) watched on as the Boomers rebelled against what they had built. Simultaneously, Boomers and the Silent Artist generation (young adults and midlifers) were raising Nomad Xennial children with hands-off parenting styles and little supervision, as the normalization of no-fault divorce led to the highest divorce rates the nation had ever seen.

(Shortform note: No-fault divorce laws allowed spouses to file for a divorce without having to provide evidence that the other spouse did something wrong, whereas prior to the 1970s a couple could only be granted a divorce if one party could be proven to be at fault. The authors suggested that divorce laws would become stricter during the Fourth Turning as a way to reinforce the nuclear family structure, but so far this hasn’t happened. Divorce rates have gone down on their own, though, suggesting that more children are being raised in two-parent homes and that family structures may indeed be getting stronger since the Awakening.)

Violence spread, both in the public eye with the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and on a smaller scale with protests against government and institutional overreach. The Vietnam War further eroded public faith in leadership, not only because it lacked the moral righteousness of World War II, but also because the young Boomer generation rejected the idea that duty to the country outweighed individual rights. As with the moon landing, people felt that the resources spent on this endeavor would be better applied on the homefront for ending poverty and social and racial inequality.

(Shortform note: Though the Vietnam War dealt one of the heaviest blows to the public’s trust in the American government, in the early years of the Turning, public sentiment was largely neutral or split on the topic. Historians note that much of the antiwar attitude came from media coverage showing the brutality and cruelty being carried out by American soldiers. The draft was also a major contributor, as people were forced to fight or die for a cause they didn’t believe in. Others acknowledge that, even while it degraded the public’s faith in the government, the war may have helped promote desegregation, as soldiers of different races worked together and built camaraderie and trust between them.)

The clash between social movements and American materialism led to economic conflict in the 1970s. Environmentalist movements called for a reduction in energy consumption and construction, which led to a decrease in economic supply while demand for goods stayed the same. Inflation from fluctuating oil prices added to this economic crisis and resulted in a stagnation of wages that America still hadn’t recovered from by the time of this book’s publishing in 1997.

(Shortform note: Though the authors attribute the 1970s economic crisis—often referred to as the Great Inflation—to environmentalists’ calls for reduced production of goods, others suggest that it was largely the result of monetary policies enacted by the Federal Reserve. In the early 1970s, the Fed lowered interest rates in an attempt to bring the country out of the recession of the 1960s. While these policies succeeded in that goal, some argue that they flooded the economy with too much money, resulting in a nearly two-decade-long crisis that included four economic recessions.)

The focus on the individual created a culture of self-centeredness that rejected the idea of duty to one’s nation. At the beginning of the Awakening, young people’s focus on individual rights related mostly to civil rights and issues of culture. However, as the Turning came to a close, individualist sentiment spread to the realm of politics and economics. Conservatives embraced this new ideology and capitalized on the country’s newfound fierce individualism to reignite the Republican party, electing Ronald Reagan, whose first term brought the end of the Awakening.

(Shortform note: Some argue that Reagan’s presidency is what began the successful dismantling of the institutions established during the American High, as his administration cut over $22 billion of social welfare spending. Though these policies increased poverty and economic inequality, they reflected the renewed American ethos of individualism that has existed since the founding of the nation itself. Additionally, some modern critics suggest that the Reagan era’s embrace and popularization of individualism has led to issues like the massive toll the COVID-19 virus has taken on America, as collective mitigation efforts continue to be overruled by principles of personal liberty and individual responsibility.)

#### The Culture Wars: A Third Turning

The Culture Wars following the Consciousness Revolution began in 1984 and were still ongoing at the time of this book’s publication in 1997. The authors roughly estimated that it would last through 2005 but acknowledged that it could end a few years earlier or later. During this time, the new system of individualistic values established during the Awakening had become part of mainstream culture.

(Shortform note: In 2020, Neil Howe addressed the events that had taken place since his book’s publication and identified the 2008 financial crisis as the Fourth Turning’s catalyst, which would establish the dates of the Third Turning as 1984 to 2008.)

The elder Silent Artist generation led ineffectually and indecisively during this time.Though this was the era when they should have been dominating the highest leadership roles, they failed to produce a single president during this Turning, a generational anomaly that had never happened before in U.S. history. They instead took on helper roles as White House staff and congresspeople, but the authors note that their generation of leaders has become notorious for working diligently but getting very little done. They explain that, compared to the G.I. leaders in the 1960s, the Silent leaders in the 1980s had twice as many hearings and four times the staff, but only one-third as many laws passed.

(Shortform note: The Silent generation did eventually see a president elected in 2020 with Joe Biden, though as of 2021 they made up only about 7% of Congress, vastly outnumbered by Boomers. Furthermore, accusations of government laziness and inaction have been directed at various administrations for decades but have picked up steam recently, partially as a result of increasing political polarization, which makes it more difficult to reach bipartisan compromises. Biden hasn’t been immune to these accusations, as critics have pointed to a lack of action on his part to stop such changes as the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade. However, supporters of the president have praised his commitment to non-confrontational compromise.)

Meanwhile, Boomer Prophets entered midlife as judgmental leaders heavily fixated on black-and-white values that they were unwilling to compromise on. Xennial Nomads came into adulthood feeling alienated and ignored and with a fragmented generational identity.

(Shortform note: Strauss and Howe’s assessment of Boomers may seem somewhat harsh, but other writers describe the generation similarly, even suggesting that it’s a generation of sociopaths. However, other experts note that animosity between generations is unproductive and fails to account for the ways in which people across the generations support and help each other.)

Trust in the government reached its lowest point in the saeculum, but polls showed a high level of individual self-esteem. People began dividing into groups based on shared interests or characteristics such as gender, race, class, and religion, which led to discord between groups and a lack of unifying public sentiment. Each group saw themselves as victims of their opposing group, and paranoia fed these beliefs. Distrust grew between social groups of every kind.

The three main cultural “wars” during this time were over inclusivity and diversity, religion, and free market economics. Citizens, politicians, and the media all chose sides and stuck to them staunchly. Individuals on both sides of these conflicts viewed the other side with vitriol and deemed them stupid or evil. Voters became more polarized, with polls during the 1994 election showing a greater ideological divide than the nation had ever seen, and the number of independents and nonvoters grew. Politicians and political ads became brutally hostile.

> **Group Divisions and Polarization**
> 
> Research shows that humans have a strong tendency to divide into groups that they identify closely with, a tendency which probably developed because it was beneficial when we were evolving to be able to quickly differentiate between people who were like us and people who were different. We often choose these groups based on unifying traits like race or religion, but studies have also shown that we quickly form group identities when assigned to groups based on random criteria and that we view members of our own group more favorably than those in other groups.
> 
> Unfortunately, closely identifying with a group can lead us to accept ideas that we hear from other members without examining them closely—a phenomenon known as groupthink—particularly when we hear those ideas from a leader. Some experts suggest that this is what gives politicians the ability to affect people’s behavior so strongly and that this could explain the extreme resistance to mask-wearing and other COVID-19 prevention measures among specific groups.
> 
> In _The Coddling of the American Mind_ , Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt explain that American politics over the last few decades has become defined by negative polarization, or the tendency to engage politically based on fear of the other party rather than support of one’s own party. Lukianoff and Haidt note that this type of polarization and fixation on the “evilness” of the opposing group is harmful to democracy and free thought.

Income inequality continued to grow, and homeless people were funneled out of shelters and public spaces into prisons. Companies laid off workers while their stocks continued to grow. Society became cynical, fragmented, and mistrustful—both of other people and of the government. There was a general sense that society was declining and heading toward disaster and there was nothing that could be done about it.

> **Social Decline Toward the End of the Unraveling**
> 
> Research shows that America’s income inequality increased by more than 100% between 1989 and 2016 and that Black people disproportionately bear the negative consequences of inequality. Tracking of the homeless population was limited in the 1980s and 1990s, but estimates suggest that today there are more than half a million homeless people living in America. Research shows that experiencing homelessness significantly increases the risk of going to prison and vice versa, a phenomenon the authors allude to. Black people are also overrepresented in the homeless and incarcerated populations.
> 
> Other writers in the late 1990s noted that American corporations had begun using mass layoffs as a business strategy to achieve massive financial gains, even though they were experiencing record profits. This trend has continued over the past two decades, and experts note that it negatively affects workers’ morale and loyalty to the company and has damaging psychological effects on the laid-off employees.
> 
> Regarding the sense of impending catastrophe, some experts note that today we often romanticize the 1990s as a golden age, but they point out that the issues and mistakes made during that era caused many of today’s most serious problems.

### Predictions About the Crisis

The authors predicted that the Fourth Turning—a Crisis—would begin within the first few years of the 21st century, around 2005. Because the catalysts for a Fourth Turning are always foreseeable based on the trends that are established during the Unraveling, the authors make a handful of predictions about what the next catalyst might look like:

**A terrorist attack by a foreign group purporting to have nuclear weapons** , leading the US to declare war and begin searching people’s homes. Suspicions that the president fabricated the event would lead to a nationwide strike and the loss of foreign capital.

(Shortform note: This prediction bears a striking resemblance to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. As the authors suggest in the book, there were some warnings of this attack in advance, including a memo sent to the FBI by Special Agent Kenneth Williams in July of 2001 warning of a potential terrorist plot by Osama Bin Laden. The memo was not acted upon, and experts have suggested that it could have been used to mitigate or prevent the September 11 attack if it had been dealt with properly. However, Neil Howe has noted that the attack didn’t have the lasting impact of a Crisis catalyst.)

**A new, highly contagious virus spreads** , resulting in significant deaths and causing the government to create and enforce quarantines. The National Guard is deployed to isolate areas hit hardest by the disease, and the president is pressured to declare martial law.

(Shortform note: As of March 27, 2023, COVID-19 had claimed over 1,150,000 American lives, and though the National Guard was not deployed and martial law was not declared, most state governments issued stay-at-home orders. This pandemic occurred too late in the Turning to serve as the catalyst but still contributed to a major shift in the country’s culture and mood and may comprise part of the Turning’s climax.)

**Conflicts in and around Russia** result in civil wars and the capture of American diplomats, leading the US to send ships into the Black Sea and Congress to consider reinstating the draft.

(Shortform note: In 2014, Russia annexed Crimea, leading to armed conflicts in the area, and in February 2022, the country invaded Ukraine, sparking a full-scale war. Though the US has limited its involvement to financial and humanitarian aid, a few Americans have been captured by Russia, and some have indeed wondered if Congress may reinstate the draft. This conflict also occurred too late to be the catalyst but may be contributing to the climax.)

The authors note that these exact scenarios are unlikely and that whatever does happen, the nation will be able to mitigate it before it becomes truly devastating. However, it will arise from some problem that the country had failed to deal with soon enough, which will spark outraged calls to action.

(Shortform note: As discussed above, Neil Howe has identified the 2008 financial crisis as the catalyst for this Crisis Turning. As the authors predicted, the nation was able to avoid total cataclysm, but it experienced an undermining of public faith in financial institutions that has continued throughout the Turning.)

#### After the Catalyst

As a result of the catalyst, the authors predicted that people would lose all faith in the government, struggle financially and begin to panic about their future, and that a recession or depression may occur. People will have to form a new social order, peacefully or otherwise.

One political party will achieve a decisive win early in the Crisis and will maintain its power throughout the Turning. Its leaders will exaggerate and deliberately exacerbate the country’s problems to accelerate change and enact a more and more extreme agenda.

At the beginning of the Turning, income inequality will stop growing. Toward its end, the economy will begin to recover and may become stronger than ever. It will be more unionized and more independent from the global economy. The public will again trust the nation’s institutions and demand that they restrict choices by standardizing certain options in goods and services and by establishing a single dominant political party to relieve people of the onus of having to choose.

The rights of certain groups will come under attack by powerful organizations. Criminal justice will become increasingly harsh, and the harming of innocent people will become acceptable collateral damage for protection against those considered dangerous to society.

> **What the Authors Got Right—And Wrong**
> 
> Several of the authors’ predictions about the unfolding of the Fourth Turning haven’t yet come true. In contrast to their prediction about a single party maintaining dominance throughout the Crisis, America saw Republican Donald Trump win after two terms from Democrat Barack Obama, and then another Democrat win in 2020 with Joe Biden.
> 
> Additionally, income inequality has not slowed but has instead continued to grow. In 2021, the wealthiest 10% of Americans held more than two-thirds of the nation’s wealth, while the bottom 50% held just 2.5% of the wealth. Union membership has also fallen even though research suggests that public support for unions is nearly the highest it’s ever been.
> 
> However, as the authors predicted, attacks on the rights of certain groups have increased in the past few years. In June 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed people the right to abortion. Hundreds of bills targeting LGBTQ+ rights have been introduced by state lawmakers, and hundreds of others have been introduced that seek to impose greater restrictions on voting—measures that have been shown to have a disproportionate impact on Black voters.

Through some combination of larger conflicts, the nation’s issues will coalesce into one large problem that forms the climax of the Crisis. People will unify around this problem, setting aside differences for the purpose of healing the nation and putting it on track for a new rebirth in the upcoming High. Whether the results of the Crisis’s resolution are positive or negative, the nation will be unrecognizable from what it was at the beginning of the Crisis.

(Shortform note: A possible downside of recognizing the pattern Strauss and Howe describe is that people and leaders may be tempted to push the nation toward deliberate disaster in order to hasten the post-Crisis High by exaggerating and worsening the nation’s problems. Some accuse leaders of right-leaning political parties around the world of actively pushing for conflicts to happen for this purpose, calling such an approach _disaster nationalism_ —the promotion of conflict to pave the way for authoritarian leadership in response.)
