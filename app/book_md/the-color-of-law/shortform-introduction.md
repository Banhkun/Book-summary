## Shortform Introduction

Widely reviewed and discussed when it was published in 2017, Richard Rothstein’s _The Color of Law_ makes the case that **racial residential segregation** —the fact that African Americans largely live in discrete areas separate from white Americans—is the result of **explicit government policy** (“de jure” segregation) rather than personal preferences or random processes (“de facto” segregation). That is, historically, **African Americans didn’t _choose_ to live almost exclusively among themselves**; rather, they were compelled to do so by**an array of discriminatory policies designed and implemented by government at the federal, state, and local levels**.

The distinction between de jure and de facto segregation is key. This is **because segregation “by law” is unconstitutional** and so remediable by legislation and litigation, whereas the Supreme Court has ruled that segregation “by personal choice” isn’t rectifiable under the Constitution.

Rothstein proves his claim that racial residential segregation was government-sponsored by examining the various means public officials used to promote segregation. Each chapter in the following summary focuses on one of these means, from the **segregation of public housing** to the **exclusion of African Americans from federal home loans** to the **continual disadvantagement of African Americans in the labor market**.

To emphasize the individual strategies government employed to segregate US localities, Shortform has had to omit some of the many examples Rothstein includes of racial residential segregation. (Those familiar with the book will also notice that we’ve **redistributed the material that appears in the book’s first chapter** and **combined some shorter chapters**.) As always, if you enjoy the summary and are curious to know more, we encourage you to consult the author’s work itself.
