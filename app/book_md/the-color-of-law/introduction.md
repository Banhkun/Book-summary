## Introduction

Before he delves into the discrete means by which government sponsored racial residential segregation, Rothstein discusses the terminology he’ll be using throughout the book and offers a brief history of de jure segregation.

### A Note on Terminology

The use of the term “ghetto” to refer to predominantly Black neighborhoods has become unacceptable, but Rothstein argues the term accurately denotes the situation of racial residential segregation, and therefore uses it in his work. A ghetto describes a residential area with a concentrated minority, a shortage of opportunity, and significant barriers to exit. **These three conditions apply to contemporary African American neighborhoods**.

It is also habit to despecificate the African American experience by referring generally to “people of color.” Rothstein resists this habit, because**the policies he discusses were designed to disadvantage _African Americans_ specifically**.

Rothstein uses “African American” and “Black” interchangeably in accordance with contemporary norms. He also occasionally uses the (now unacceptable) term “Negro” in historical contexts when that was the preferred nomenclature.

### The History of De Jure Segregation

As noted in the introduction, **de jure segregation is unconstitutional** : It infringes the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the US Constitution. It was also outlawed by the 1866 Civil Rights Act, which prohibited any law that echoed the characteristics of slavery by disadvantaging African Americans.

Unfortunately, in 1883, the Supreme Court determined that**** housing discrimination didn’t represent a continuation of the “badges and incidents of slavery.” It wasn’t until 1968—when the Supreme Court overturned the 1883 decision and, separately, Congress passed the Fair Housing Act—that**racial discrimination in housing was unambiguously prohibited**.

Between 1883 and 1968, African Americans were systematically and repeatedly disadvantaged in the housing market due to government policy—specifically through the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration—with repercussions that extend into today.

For example,**the primary source of wealth for American families is their home**. Because Black Americans were unable to obtain financing, from either the government or private banks, to purchase homes in the middle of the last century, their descendants haven’t inherited the same wealth that white Americans have.

These descendants are also unable to file suit for remuneration on account of this historical discrimination. Because the Supreme Court ruled housing discrimination legal between 1883 and 1968, **descendants of those discriminated against have no legal standing to sue.**

### The Denial of De Jure Segregation

Even after 1968, the **Supreme Court continued to minimize the government’s role in creating housing segregation**. For example, in 1974, in a case concerning the desegregation of urban and suburban Detroit’s public schools, Justice Potter Stewart, who wrote for the majority, claimed that the racial disparities between the city of Detroit and the suburbs were the product of diverse private acts rather than public policy. Ultimately, the Court ruled that the predominantly white suburbs couldn’t be included in a compulsory desegregation program.

(It’s worth noting that Potter’s decision overturned the ruling of a district court judge who found that **federal, state, and local policy did indeed bear outsized responsibility for racial residential segregation**.)

Potter’s position was echoed more recently by the Court. In 2007, in a case involving Seattle and Louisville public schools’ consideration of race in filling classes, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that racial residential segregation (and thus public school segregation) **was the product of private choice (“de facto”), and so the Court couldn’t allow a public remedy**.

De jure and de facto segregation can indeed be hard to separate. “Structural racism,” which describes a societal condition in which both private attitudes and public institutions disadvantage people of color, illustrates this point.

Rothstein’s argument is not that de facto or private segregation doesn’t play a role in housing segregation. Rather, his point is that **jurists like Stewart and Potter have overlooked the clear role of government policy in racial residential segregation** , and so have unjustly excused governments from remedying it.
