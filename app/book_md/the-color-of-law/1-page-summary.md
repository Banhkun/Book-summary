## 1-Page Summary

Richard Rothstein’s _The Color of Law_ argues that racial residential segregation—the fact that some neighborhoods are almost exclusively African American while others are almost exclusively white—is**the result of explicit government policy** rather than personal choice. In other words,**racial residential segregation in the United States is _de jure_(“by law”) rather than _de facto_**(in this context, “by virtue of personal choices or random circumstances”). The distinction between _de jure_ and _de facto_ segregation is paramount, because **_de jure_ segregation is unconstitutional:** It infringes the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.

Each section below covers a specific way in which racial residential segregation was realized, from the segregation of public housing to labor-market discrimination.

(A note on terminology: Rothstein uses “Black” and “African American” interchangeably, and refers purposefully to “ghettos.” A “ghetto” describes a residential area with a concentrated minority, a shortage of opportunity, and significant barriers to exit. **These three conditions apply to contemporary African American neighborhoods**.)

### Public Housing as a Segregating Agent

One of the most important methods by which government segregated cities was **the construction of segregated public housing**(“projects”)**** from World War I through to the 1960s and 1970s. By confining African Americans to subpar public housing in undesirable areas, federal, state, and local authorities promoted (1) the segregation of their cities and (2) the transformation of predominantly Black areas into slums.

**Projects were segregated as a matter of policy.** For example, they had to abide by the “neighborhood composition rule”—that is, they had **to reflect the racial composition of the neighborhood around them**.

During WWII, segregated projects were constructed near shipyards to house the influx of war workers.**Black workers were housed close to worksites in shoddily constructed units** , while white workers lived in sturdier projects further inland. (White workers were also subsidized to rent rooms from private landlords.)

After WWII, city-level public housing authorities used segregated **public housing to ghettoize their African American residents**. For example, in 1952, the NAACP took the San Francisco public housing authority to court, claiming that though the authority had promised to make all new construction integrated, it was trying to build a new segregated project. Under oath, the authority’s chairman**** admitted that the agency was **purposely trying to confine African Americans to particular locations in the city.**

### Exclusionary Zoning Laws

Another key cause of racial residential segregation in the US was the enactment of discriminatory zoning laws. Zoning laws are local ordinances that limit how certain “zones”—or areas—in a municipality can be developed; racial zoning laws restricted African Americans from owning property in certain areas.

After the Supreme Court ruled racial zoning unconstitutional in _Buchanan v. Warley_ ,**city authorities found workarounds and subterfuges that allowed them to continue segregating by race**. Two such strategies were:

#### 1) Economic Zoning

Officials passed ordinances**limiting certain neighborhoods to single-family homes affordable only to middle-income people**. Because African Americans had been historically and systematically discriminated against in the job market, many were lower-income and so could only afford housing in apartment buildings—**structures that were banned by these ordinances.** **The result was that areas zoned for single-family homes stayed or became white** while areas that allowed multiple-family dwellings stayed or became African American.

#### 2) Industrial Zoning

Certain areas in municipalities are zoned specifically for industry to protect residents from nuisances like noise and air pollution. To further segregate their cities in the wake of _Buchanan_ , city officials zoned areas near predominantly Black neighborhoods for industry. This move **lowered property values in those areas** , thereby reducing the current residents’ wealth and **limiting their opportunities to move out**.

An example of this method can be seen in South Central Los Angeles, a predominantly Black area. In the 1940s, **the city began using “spot” rezoning ordinances to move automobile junkyards and commercial factories into the area** , thus ghettoizing the residents.

### Federal Loan Discrimination

The shortcoming of economic zoning—at least as far as segregationists were concerned—was that it was race-blind: **If a Black family were wealthy enough, they could live in an economically zoned neighborhood.** In order to keep African Americans confined to particular neighborhoods, the federal government pursued a two-pronged approach. First, it appraised areas that were majority African American as “risky” (a process known as “redlining”); then **it denied loan guarantees and financial support to Black families attempting to live outside those areas.**

The agency doing the denying was the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”). Created to increase home ownership by insuring private bank mortgages and facilitating more advantageous terms, the FHA systematically discriminated against Black families. Their reasoning was that **integration led to a “reduction in [property] values.”**

### Private Sector Abuses

Not all efforts to maintain and further residential segregation originated with the federal government; three common strategies—restrictive covenants, blockbusting, and contract sales—developed among private enterprises. **Nevertheless, the federal government consistently condoned—or, at the very least, ignored—these injustices**.

#### Restrictive Covenants

Restrictive covenants are stipulations in deeds that obligate the owner of the property to undertake certain actions or follow rules. For example, a restrictive covenant might prevent the owner from painting the house a certain color. It might also—as it often did in the first half of the 20th century—**forbid the owner from selling or renting to an African American.**

However, if a white homeowner wanted to violate the covenant and sell a property to an African American, there was little his or her neighbors—who would be the ones “hurt” by the sale—could do about it. To get around this wrinkle in the law, developers began making it a requirement that people purchasing their properties join a community association—**an association whose bylaws often included a whites-only clause.**

The FHA, for its part, supported restrictive covenants by awarding low-risk ratings to properties that had them. Even after racial restrictive covenants were ruled unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in 1948, the FHA continued to **withhold loan guarantees unless deeds barred sale to African Americans**. The justification?**That the presence of African Americans reduced property values and so comprised greater risk**. (In fact, the evidence shows that the presence of African Americans actually _raised_ property values, because they often had to pay higher prices than whites for the same properties.)

It wasn’t until President John F. Kennedy issued an order forbidding the FHA to contribute to racial discrimination that FHA appraisers ceased this discriminatory practice. For racial restrictive covenants _in general_ to be outlawed, however, **African Americans would have to wait until 1972**.

#### Blockbusting

Despite the fact that the**presence of Black homeowners raised property values rather than lowered them** , unscrupulous real estate agents were happy to take advantage of white fears of neighborhood decline. One way they did so was “blockbusting.”

First, real estate agents would gin up fear among whites in a given neighborhood that African Americans were starting to move in. Because whites believed the stereotype that an influx of Black residents meant declining home values and neighborhood distress,**these white homeowners would sell their homes quickly and at a discount** , thinking they were still coming out ahead.

Then, the real estate agents would **turn around and sell the homes to African Americans at a premium**. The African American families would move in, precipitating greater fear among their white neighbors and further discount sales. Before long, the neighborhood would be exclusively African American. (“Blockbusting” and “white flight” go hand in hand.)

Sometimes, agents wouldn’t even have to actually _sell_ a home to an African American. For example, agents were known to **pay African American women to walk through white neighborhoods** with their babies in carriages, or African American men to drive through neighborhoods with the radio turned up, to frighten whites into selling cheap.

#### Contract Sales

When agents _did_ sell to African Americans, they often employed a particular type of agreement called a “contract sale.” Under the terms of this agreement, the deed to the home would transfer to the buyer after fifteen or twenty years, but only if the buyer made _every monthly payment_ over the term of the contract. If the buyer didn’t, they could be evicted immediately—**because the payments didn’t earn the buyer equity in the home**.

The repercussions of these burdensome payments—**which were inflated by discriminatory real estate agents** —were many and varied. It forced buyers to work multiple jobs or take in boarders to earn enough just to make their payments (many were evicted for nonpayment despite these efforts). The additional boarders created overcrowding in homes and local schools—**so much so that many schools had to switch to morning shifts and evening shifts.** The shifts gave rise to gangs, which gave rise to criminality, which caused whites to move out of integrated neighborhoods even quicker.

### The Failures of the IRS and Other Government Agencies

Many other federal agencies besides the FHA contributed to racial residential segregation. The IRS, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve all, in one way or another, exacerbated it.

One of the central responsibilities of the IRS is **determining the tax-exempt status of various US entities**. Although its rules require the agency to **withhold tax exemptions** from organizations that countermand official public policy or promote prejudice and discrimination, the**IRS regularly conferred tax-exempt status on entities that contributed to racial residential segregation**. For example, tax-exempt religious entities like **churches and synagogues regularly promoted segregationist policies** like racial restrictive covenants.

Tax-exempt colleges, too, promoted segregation. The University of Chicago subsidized local property owners so that they could keep Hyde Park and its surrounds segregated. From 1933 to 1947, **the University covered $100,000 in legal fees for the defense of restrictive covenants and the eviction of recently arrived African Americans**.

### The Role of Localities

As much as federal policy contributed to racial residential segregation, **the small-scale efforts by state and municipal governments to keep their communities segregated** , when considered in their totality, clearly point to a system of _de jure_ segregation in the United States.

#### Slum Clearance

White community groups and public officials weren’t only concerned with excluding African Americans from residential areas—they also made concerted efforts to **remove them from urban downtowns and business districts**. (These were the areas into which Blacks had been pushed due to discrimination in the suburbs.) To reserve these economically important areas for whites, officials practiced “slum clearance”: the condemnation and demolition of dilapidated structures and the forced relocation of their current residents.

The most common impetus for slum clearance was infrastructure projects, in particular the federal interstate highway system. For example, in 1956, the Florida State Road Department routed a section of I-95 through a Black enclave adjacent to Miami’s downtown. By the time of the highway’s completion in the 1960s, the area’s African-Ameircan population of 40,000 had been reduced to 8,000.

#### School Placement

Prior to _Brown v. Board of Ed._ , the famous 1954 Supreme Court case ending the doctrine of “separate but equal” in US public schools, many states **used the location of segregated public schools to practice racial residential segregation**.

One prominent example concerns Austin, TX. In its 1928 “Master Plan,” the city evaded a Supreme Court ruling that housing segregation on the basis of race was unconstitutional by placing a variety of Black-only services, including public schools, on the city’s Eastside. The effect was significant: In 1930, the African American population of the integrated Wheatsville neighborhood was 16%; **by 1950, after the segregated school for African Americans was shuttered, it was 1%**.

#### State-Sanctioned Violence

In general, government can’t be held responsible for the intimidation tactics used by white supremacists to defend segregation. However, when public authorities either turn a blind eye—or, worse, encourage that intimidation—**it amounts to an unconstitutional infringement of African Americans’ rights** and _de jure_ segregation.

Some of the earliest instances of state-sanctioned abuse of African Americans for the purposes of segregation occurred in Chicago. In the early 1900s, white gangs would throw rocks through the windows of African Americans to coerce them into moving. In the early 20s, whites firebombed African American homes on the border between white and Black areas. **Despite two deaths from these firebombings, Chicago law enforcement neither made arrests nor pursued prosecutions**.

This sort of vandalism persists into living memory. In 1985, an African American couple who’d moved into Sylvania, a suburb of Louisville, had their house firebombed twice.

### Labor Market Discrimination and Residential Segregation

One explanation of racial residential segregation is that **it isn’t the product of purposeful governmental policy but rather African Americans’ lower incomes** —if African Americans had higher earnings, they could live wherever they want. However, this argument fails to account for**the public policies whose express intent was to depress African American wages.**

African Americans endured discrimination in the labor market as soon as they were able to _participate_ in the labor market. Although famously promised “40 acres and a mule” by the Union at the conclusion of the Civil War, many formerly enslaved people ended up sharecroppers—**essentially indentured servants on the land of their former owners.**

Later, during the Depression, because FDR needed southern Democrats’ votes to pass the New Deal, **he allowed exceptions into the laws that specifically excluded African Americans**. In fact, the National Recovery Administration (NRA), the agency responsible for implementing and enforcing the Deal’s new wage protections, **excluded African Americans with brutal efficiency**. For example, within the category of industrial work—which featured both white and Black workers—the NRA denied wage-and-hours standards to canning, citrus packing, and cotton ginning workers. **These workers were predominantly African American**.

Labor unions, too, discriminated against Black workers. Because African Americans were either shut out of or marginalized within unions during the war and after,**they missed out on the high wages negotiated for union workers in industries like shipbuilding and housing construction**. Although the NLRB ceased to certify white-only unions in 1964, no effort was made to compensate previously excluded Black workers, leaving them still well behind their white counterparts economically. Because African American wages have always been depressed, their ability to escape present-day ghettos is commensurately limited.

### Enduring Challenges

Racial residential segregation is difficult to reverse for three reasons in particular:

#### 1) Housing Unaffordability

The Federal Housing Act, passed in 1968, enshrines in law African Americans’ freedom to live wherever they can afford to. But**historical discrimination in labor and housing markets has created intergenerational wealth and income disadvantages** for African Americans that prevent them from living in middle- and upper-class—that is, predominantly white—areas.

Making matters worse, the value of homes in predominantly white neighborhoods has appreciated considerably in the last 50 or so years while the values in African American neighborhoods haven’t. This development has a dual effect: It makes homes in white neighborhoods even more unattainable for African Americans _and**it entrenches the intergenerational wealth gap between Blacks and whites**_ (because the homes white parents pass on to their heirs have appreciated significantly while those that Black families pass on haven’t).

Homes in and around the famous Levittown subdivision provide a stark example of these effects. In 1948, a one-bedroom in whites-only Levittown went for about $75,000 in today’s dollars. Today, that home—even without major remodels or updates—sells for about $350,000. A one-bedroom in nearby Lakeview, NY, a predominantly African American town, also went for $75,000 in 1948. Today, **the Lakeview home is only worth $90,000–$120,000.**

#### 2) Unintended Consequences of Race-Blind Policy

Although many policies passed in the 20th century had no explicitly discriminatory purpose, the fact that segregation was already entrenched**meant that these race-neutral policies exacerbated housing inequality**. The most salient example is the mortgage interest deduction, the tax break given to homeowners. Because homeownership for many African Americans was unattainable—due to the _de jure_ policies of the FHA and other agencies, among other bodies—**they were largely excluded from this government subsidy**.

#### 3) Flawed Social Programs

Federal and local governments have enacted programs to help low-income families secure affordable housing. Unfortunately,**these programs tend to redouble segregation rather than remedy it**.

For example, the Housing Choice Voucher program (also known as “Section 8”), which provides families with financial support to rent apartments they couldn’t otherwise afford, **offers amounts too meager for families to escape low-income areas**. Landlords in better-off areas also **frequently refuse to accept housing vouchers as payment**.

### Potential Remedies

Given the challenges enumerated above, Rothstein is loath to offer remedies to racial residential segregation for fear they will inevitably come up short. Nevertheless, he proposes some initial steps that may, in time, lead to a more integrated, and thus more equitable, society.

#### Acknowledging _De Jure_ Segregation

Americans must realize that racial residential segregation isn’t the result of personal choices or housing and labor market cycles. **Rather, it is the legacy of explicitly discriminatory public policy that flouted the US Constitution and US laws**. Acknowledging this fact opens the door for government to enact bold changes to rectify past injustices.

#### Financing Integration Directly

One of those bold reforms could be to **subsidize African Americans to purchase homes in predominantly white neighborhoods.** For example, the government could purchase homes at market rates in areas segregated by FHA policy and sell them to African Americans at historically pegged prices. Another strategy would be to subsidize low- and middle-class Black families directly to allow them to move to and integrate into predominantly white neighborhoods.

#### Banning Exclusionary Zoning and Implementing Inclusionary Zoning

Zoning ordinances prohibiting multi-family homes and requiring large lots are still on the books in many localities, effectively excluding lower- and lower-middle-income buyers—**many of whom are African American** —from living there. A blunt instrument is simply to ban these zoning laws (which were often racially motivated in the first place).

Another possibility is to **withhold the mortgage interest deduction from homeowners in discriminatorily zoned areas** or areas that aren’t taking steps to accommodate low- and middle-income families. The affected families would then put pressure on officials to promote integration.

In addition to mitigating the effects of exclusionary zoning laws, states and municipalities can enact _inclusionary_ zoning laws. **These laws actively promote the construction of affordable housing and the attraction of low- and middle-income families to mostly white areas**.

#### Reforming Section 8

**With the right reforms, the Housing Choice Voucher program could be a powerful tool for integration**. One key reform would be to **increase voucher amounts.** Another would be to increase Section 8’s overall funding **to ensure all people who qualify for a voucher get one.** The program’s funding is currently limited and applicants are often denied vouchers due to the program’s running out of money. (In 2015, **six million qualified people went without vouchers.**)
