## Exercise: Make a Soothing Plan

Karp explains that every baby will respond differently to the different strategies he describes. Use these exercises to determine the most effective way to soothe your baby.

* * *

Does your baby respond particularly well to one of Karp’s techniques (swaddling, holding on side/stomach, shushing, swinging, or sucking)? Do some work better in certain situations?

Try to mix and match several of Karp’s techniques. What specific combination do you think will work best for you and the baby?

If none of Karp’s techniques tend to work well for you, look over the symptoms of the most common medical causes of colic (allergies, constipation and other digestive issues). Note which do and do not apply to your baby.

Does your baby struggle with sleep? If so, which of Karp’s techniques for improving sleep (night feedings, shorter naps, and teaching self-soothing) seem to improve your baby’s sleep? Which ones are you interested in trying?
