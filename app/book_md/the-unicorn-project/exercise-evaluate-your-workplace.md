## Exercise: Evaluate Your Workplace

Kim lists a set of principles that can increase a business’s productivity while making it a healthier, more pleasant place to work. These include a focus on simplicity, a culture of openness, and a commitment to improvement. Think about your work environment, whether you’re the boss or an employee, and consider how well it stacks up against Kim’s ideals.

* * *

Are the projects your organization currently pursues relatively simple or overly complex? In what ways could your work be streamlined or made more efficient? Conversely, are there any types of projects or tasks that you feel would benefit from added complexity?

How does your current place of work respond when a project goes wrong or an employee makes an error? Do managers and colleagues start by focusing on the problem or by deciding whom to blame? If you were to make a mistake in your work, how safe would it be to admit it?

How often does your organization improve a policy or procedure? What traditional ways of doing things have been in place for years? What’s one improvement you’d like to make at your workplace, and how well do you think your idea would be received?
