## Exercise: Plan Your Peak State Experiences

Using the authors’ recommendations, brainstorm and plan how you could reach a peak state.

* * *

Recalling the range of peak states the authors describe (flow, mystical experience, psychedelic experience, and group flow), which do you find most compelling? Why?

With that variety of peak state experiences in mind, recall the routes you could take to reach it. For instance, you could pursue a mystical experience through meditation, yoga, martial arts, religious contemplation, or a psychedelic-shamanistic ritual. Below, reflect on which of these routes most appeals to you and why?

Now, consider the authors’ variables, as well as any additional factors relevant to your situation, and evaluate the route you’re most interested in. How does this measure in _risk, reward, and time_?

Based on your subjective assessment of the risk, reward, and time costs of your chosen route, when will you schedule time to explore it? Consider how you could try this route during your daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly plans. (For instance, you might try a daily habit of contemplation with your preferred sacred text, or you could schedule one weekend each quarter to explore with psychedelics.)
