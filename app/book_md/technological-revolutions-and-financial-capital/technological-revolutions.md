## Technological Revolutions

A **technological revolution** is a cluster of new technologies, products, and industries that causes an upheaval in the economy and propels a long-term surge in development.

These technological breakthroughs spread far beyond the industries and sectors from which they originated - they cause broad jumps in productivity for a **broad span of economic activities**. Economically, the technology brings a shift in price structure (often by making things significantly cheaper) that guides economic agents toward use of the new technologies. Hence Carlota Perez calls these “techno-economic paradigms.”

Even further, the technological revolution penetrates **social practice, legislation, governance, and ideology**. It becomes the general and shared “common sense” of the period, a new way of doing things that approaches something like the ‘ideals’ of the period. It creates new mental maps of all social actors and institutions.

There have been 5 technological revolutions in the past 2 centuries. We’ll give an overview, then dive further into how each one fits the above model:

**Revolution** | **Core country** | **Big-bang event** | **Year**  
---|---|---|---  
Industrial Revolution  | Britain  | Arkwright’s mill in Cromford  | 1771   
Steam and Railways  | Britain  | ‘Rocket’ steam engine for Liverpool-Manchester railway  | 1829   
Steel, Electricity, and Heavy Engineering  | USA and Germany  | Carnegie Bessemer steel plant in Pittsburgh  | 1875   
Oil, Automobile, and Mass Production  | USA (and Germany)  | First Model-T out of Ford plant in Detroit  | 1908   
Information and Telecommunications  | USA  | Intel microprocessor announced in Santa Clara, CA  | 1971   
  
### Properties of Technological Revolutions

The innovations that create the technological revolution gestate for some time before they make their huge impact. But **a revolution needs a highly visible attractor to appear, symbolizing the new potential and sparking the imagination of pioneers**. Often the attractor is not only a technological breakthrough, it is also cheap or opens new**cost-competitive possibilities** for industry. Perez calls this a **big-bang**. Often, these events can only be identified in hindsight, since at the time they’re obvious only to a narrow community.

Geographically, the revolution often gestates in a particular region, and propagates from core to periphery. This means the time that the new technology is deployed is not the same for all countries and can be delayed by decades. Globally, the full revolution may take a full century.

The new technologies prompting revolutions are not isolated; often many products had existed for some time playing minor roles, until the new technology offers it unprecedented value and scale. Oil and automobiles had both been developed since the 1880s, but the combination of them with mass production in the 1900s led to a revolution in affordable automobiles for the general public. Likewise, transistors and semiconductors were available in the 1950s, but the microprocessor made visible the potential of _cheap_ microelectronics, the “computer on a chip.”

Each revolution consists of several technology systems that develop at different rhythms and in a sequence depending on feedback loops. The information revolution began with chips and hardware, leading to software and telecom, leading to the Internet, leading to mobile. **Each of these can appear as separate revolutions rather than interdependent systems under a wider umbrella** \- each smaller system benefits from the previous mini-revolution, while also reinforcing the overall paradigm to which it belongs.

Revolutions often involve significant changes in direction, uninstalling what was previously installed, unlearning much of the old to learn the new, closing dead end paths as others are jumping onto new bandwagons. Thus, often the radical innovations come from outsiders who have not been imbued with the previous paradigm.

The nature of the paradigm can favor certain comparative advantages unique to a society or nation. The fourth revolution of mass production favored large homogeneous populations, thus favoring the USA and the Soviet Union over more heterogeneous populations like Europe.
