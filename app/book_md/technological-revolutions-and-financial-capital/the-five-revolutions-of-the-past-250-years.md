## The Five Revolutions of the Past 250 Years

In _Technological Revolutions_ , Carlota Perez outlines five revolutions that each upended the economy. We’ll summarize the new technologies that appeared, the infrastructures enabling the revolution, and new principles that became common wisdom.

### Industrial Revolution - 1771

**New technologies and industries**

  * Mechanized cotton industry
  * Wrought iron
  * Machinery



**New or redefined infrastructures**

  * Canals and waterways
  * Turnpike roads
  * Water power



**“Common-sense” innovation principles**

  * Factory production
  * Mechanization
  * Productivity, time keeping, time saving - Taylor’s scientific management
  * Fluidity of movement (through waterways)
  * Local networks



### Steam and Railways - 1829

**New technologies and industries**

  * Steam engines and machinery (made in iron, fueled by coal)
  * Iron and coal mining
  * Railway construction
  * Rolling stock production
  * Steam power for many industries



**New or redefined infrastructures**

  * Railways (using steam engine)
  * Universal postal service
  * Telegraph (mainly nationally along railway lines)
  * Great ports, worldwide sailing ships
  * City gas



**“Common-sense” innovation principles**

  * Economies of agglomeration
  * Industrial cities
  * National markets
  * Scale as progress
  * Standard parts/machine-made machines
  * Energy where needed (steam)



### Steel, Electricity, and Heavy Engineering - 1875

**New technologies and industries**

  * Cheap steel
  * Steam engine for steel ships
  * Heavy chemistry and civil engineering
  * Electrical equipment industry
  * Copper and cables
  * Canned and bottled food
  * Paper and packaging



**New or redefined infrastructures**

  * Worldwide shipping in rapid steel steamships
  * Worldwide railways
  * Telephone (mainly nationally)
  * Worldwide telegraph
  * Electrical networks (for industrial use)



**“Common-sense” innovation principles**

  * Economies of scale of plant
  * Vertical integration
  * Distributed power for industry
  * Science as a productive force
  * Worldwide networks and empires
  * Worldwide acceptance of London-based gold standard
  * Universal standardization worldwide
  * Cost accounting for efficiency



### Oil, Automobile, and Mass Production - 1908

**New technologies and industries**

  * Mass-produced automobiles
  * Cheap oil and fuels
  * Petrochemicals (synthetics)
  * Internal combustion engine
  * Home electrical appliances
  * Refrigerated and frozen foods



**New or redefined infrastructures**

  * Networks of roads, highways, airports
  * Networks of oil ducts
  * Universal electricity
  * Worldwide analog communications



**“Common-sense” innovation principles**

  * Mass production
  * Mass markets
  * Economies of scale of product and market volume
  * Horizontal integration
  * Standardization of products
  * Synthetic materials
  * Functional specialization
  * Hierarchical pyramids
  * Centralization-suburbanization
  * Homogenization of consumption
    * First nationally, then as platform for international expansion



### Age of Information and Telecommunications - 1971

**New technologies and industries**

  * Cheap microelectronics
  * Computers, software
  * Telecommunications
  * Control instruments



**New or redefined infrastructures**

  * World digital telecommunications
  * Internet and e-services
  * Electronic mail
  * High-speed physical transport links



**“Common-sense” innovation principles**

  * Decentralized network structures
  * Knowledge as capital - intangible value added
  * Heterogeneity, diversity
  * Segmentation of markets, proliferation of niches
  * Personalization and customization, anti-mass market
  * Economies of scope and specialization, combined with scale
  * Globalization, interaction between global and local
  * Instant global contact



(Shortform note: the transition between the previous technological revolution of mass production and the current one of information technology may be the most familiar to readers, so it’s worth elaborating on this.

A key point of the book is that the technological revolution not only shapes the economy but also social mindsets. In this case, information technology allowed distribution at zero marginal cost, which allowed for the proliferation of niches and emphasis on diversity.

In the past, distribution used to cost a lot of money - newspapers had to be printed, retail stores needed rent. Thus producers benefited from large economies of scale, encouraging homogenization of consumption.

The internet made distribution nearly free, reduced startup costs, and enabled discoverability. Thus niches could thrive without needing mass economies of scale. In turn, this developed into a general social acceptance of diversity and individuality. And thus technology shapes society.)
