## Exercise: Reexamine Everyday Objects

We typically don’t think about the design of things around us unless they present a problem. This exercise will help you think critically about items you use every day.

* * *

This chapter looks at how the design of common items like doors, chairs, and kitchen appliances can influence how we interact with them. Take a moment to look around your environment right now. Choose one object within arm’s reach. Imagine showing the object to a friend who had never seen anything like it before. Do you think they would be able to figure out what it does? Would they be able to use it correctly?

What signifiers or perceivable affordances does the object have that would help your friend figure out its purpose? (Remember: Signifiers are signals that tell us where or how to interact with something, such as a “push” sign on a door. Perceivable affordances are obvious ways we can interact with an object, like a flat surface for supporting weight, or a hollow vessel for holding liquid.)

If you were to redesign this object to make it easier to use and understand, what changes would you make? (For example, adding signifiers, or rearranging controls to naturally map onto the object.) How would these changes help?

Now that you’re thinking like a designer, look around the room again. What other obvious signifiers do you see on other objects or appliances?
