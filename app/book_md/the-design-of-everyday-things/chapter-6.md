## Chapter 6: Design Thinking

“Design thinking” is the process of examining a situation to discover the root problem, exploring possible solutions to that problem, testing those solutions, and making improvements based on those tests. This process is _iterative_ , which means it is repeated as many times as necessary, each time with slight improvements based on previous iterations.

Design thinking is an important part of the philosophy of human-centered design. This chapter describes two models for thinking about the process of design thinking and compares these approaches to the traditional design process. But these approaches represent the ideal, and they’re not always feasible in practice. The chapter ends with a discussion of the practical constraints that prevent designers from working through each step of the design thinking process in full.

(Shortform note: Chapters 6 and 7 are new to the 2013 edition.)

### The Design Thinking Process

Design thinking has two phases: finding the right problem and finding the right solution. Each of the two phases has two steps. The entire process is often described using “the four D’s”: discover, define, develop, deliver.

The first step in the design process is **discovering the problem**. This seems like it would be easy, since designers are typically hired to solve a particular problem. But the problems designers are asked to solve are often downstream effects of the “real” problem. In other words, designers are hired to address symptoms, but good designers will go beyond that and dig into the root cause (tools like root cause analysis and “The Five Whys” are especially useful at this stage).

The next step is **defining the problem.** In the “discover” phase, design teams will brainstorm all the factors that could be influencing the problem, then investigate each of those factors to see which are most relevant. This helps the team decide on the actual problem they will attempt to solve.

Once the real problem is discovered and defined, designers can begin **developing solutions.** This is the part of the process that most people picture when they imagine designers at work—a flurry of new ideas, rapid sketches, and rough prototypes. Instead of committing to a solution right away, good designers brainstorm as many solutions as possible, including ideas that are obviously not feasible. Even a seemingly ridiculous solution might have an underlying principle that ends up guiding the real design.

Lastly, designers will choose the most promising solution and refine it into final form by continuously testing, making changes, and retesting. This process culminates in **delivering the final design** to the client.

#### The Double Diamond Model

An iterative design process can be represented visually with the “double diamond diverge-converge model." The first step of each phase of the process is _divergent_ , which means designers focus on expanding the problem by generating a wide range of questions and ideas. The second step of each phase is _convergent_ , which involves selecting one of those questions or ideas and refining it until everyone converges on a single outcome.

### The Cycle of Iteration

The double diamond model is a helpful conceptual overview of the process of design thinking, but it doesn’t give us much practical guidance for how to go about that process. **In practice, there are four main tasks of design thinking: observation, idea generation, prototyping, and testing.** This process is iterative, so it continuously repeats itself until the final product is developed. Human needs are complicated, so it’s hard to get any design right on the first try. Even defining the problem correctly can be difficult, since people’s observed behavior is often very different from their self report of the same behavior.

An iterative design process conflicts with traditional product development mindsets that avoid failure at any cost. Instead, iterative design is designed to _produce_ failure as often as possible, since failure gives designers valuable feedback about what needs fixing. A popular mantra at IDEO, one of the most influential design firms in the world, is “fail frequently, fail fast."

#### Observation

The first step in addressing any design problem is observation. The most useful observation for design teams takes place in the real world, not in a controlled setting like a lab. **One way to do this is through _applied ethnography_ , which involves observing users in their usual environments, carrying out everyday activities, for as long as possible.** This gives the designer the most comprehensive picture of users’ needs and expectations. Applied ethnography is based on techniques of academic anthropology but has been adapted to be much faster and have a more specific aim.

It’s important that the people being observed are part of the intended audience for the final product. The nature of the product determines the type of approach designers take to choosing people to observe. Activity-based approaches are useful for products that are used in more or less the same way, regardless of cultural differences (like cars, computers, and phones). At first, this may seem like a contrast to human-centered design, since the focus is no longer on individual users. **But activity-based design is ultimately a tool of human-centered design, since it focuses on helping the user create a working conceptual model.**

  * For example, driving a car is a complex activity that requires operating multiple systems at the same time (like working the pedals while also steering, checking the mirrors, and following traffic laws). This makes learning to drive difficult, but the fact that each of those tasks serves the broader activity of “driving” makes them easier to learn than they would be in isolation. The activity helps us make sense of disconnected components. 



It’s important to distinguish activities from tasks. In the example above, “driving” is the activity, but “steering” and “checking mirrors” are tasks that serve that activity. This distinction relates to the goal of each action: Activities relate to “be-goals," or goals that relate to our choice and self-image, while tasks are “do-goals," or simple steps that only matter because they are part of a higher level activity.

When the product is culturally specific or meant to indicate status within a particular group, a culture-based approach to observation can be useful. This is especially true for products like eating utensils and clothing. This type of observation is best done in person, with native members of the particular culture in their local environment. This is the only way to get a true sense of how and where the product will be used.

##### Design Research Is Not the Same as Market Research

The process of observing people to figure out how they might use a certain product might remind you of market research. The two processes are similar, but have fundamentally different aims.**Designers want to know what people need and how they might use certain products, while marketers want to know which groups of people are most likely to buy the product.**

Another difference in the two disciplines is breadth versus depth. Market researchers typically survey as many people as possible. They are interested in averages, not specifics, and typically use quantitative data collection methods.In contrast, designer researchers typically study far fewer people in much greater depth, often observing one person for hours or even days. Their methods are qualitative and are useful for uncovering specific needs and problems rather than averages.

**A successful product is both well-designed and well-marketed.** Without a solid marketing strategy, even the best product will fail, since users can’t appreciate the design if they’re never enticed to buy the product in the first place. Without quality design, even the best marketing strategy only goes so far, since users are unlikely to become repeat customers if the product design is clunky and confusing.

#### Idea generation

Observation provides the necessary background knowledge to both discover and define the problem. The first step to exploring solutions is idea generation. There are three rules for successfully generating ideas.

  * First, **focus on quantity over quality.** Generating as many ideas as possible increases the odds that at least one of them will be useful. 
  * Second, **don’t censor yourself.** Don’t kill ideas before they have a chance to make the list. Even “silly” ideas can spark useful discussion. 
  * Third,**question everything, especially the obvious.** Asking “obvious” questions allows the opportunity to reexamine basic ideas, which often leads to the most revolutionary new designs. 



#### Prototyping

The next step in the design process is to explore the most promising ideas in more detail. This is done through rapid prototyping, which focuses on creating very rough models of several ideas instead of a more accurate model of one specific idea. Rapid prototyping can happen through sketches, cardboard models, arrangements of sticky notes, spreadsheets, or even skits. More detailed prototypes can be tested once the list has been narrowed down to one or two ideas.

The “Wizard of Oz technique” can be helpful for testing early prototypes. Just like the wizard in the classic story uses smoke and mirrors to make himself appear larger and more powerful, designers can create a facade that mimics the experience of the final design (for example, by having a research assistant play the part of a future computer program and supply answers in an “automated” chat with users).

#### Testing

Once the team has narrowed the list of possible solutions to one idea and developed that idea into a more sophisticated prototype, it’s time for the testing phase. This begins with bringing in members from the target user group (usually five is enough) and having them use the product how they normally would.

If the product is meant to be used by just one person, it’s useful to put them in pairs, with one using the prototype directly and the other offering suggestions, commentary, and questions. This requires users to talk through their thought processes out loud, which is helpful for designers observing the testing session.

Testing only five people might seem small, but keep in mind that testing is part of an iterative process. **After the first testing session, designers will use the feedback from the first five users to tweak the design of the prototype.** Then, a new set of five potential users will be tested with this iteration. This method allows for continuous feedback on increasingly successful iterations, rather than testing a large group just once and hoping the changes made as a result will be successful.

### Is an Iterative Process Always the Best Option?

Unlike the cyclical process of iteration, the traditional design process is linear. It often uses a “waterfall” method, where decisions are made sequentially without pausing to test and reexamine. Linear design can also use “gated” methods, where periodic management reviews that serve as a checkpoint before proceeding to the next stage of the design process.

Linear methods are traditional for a reason. They make logical sense and are usually far more cost-effective up front, since they typically proceed faster and spend less time in the observation and testing stages. The downside is that the lack of iterative testing means some design flaws may not be discovered until the product is already on the market, which can be a costly mistake.

**In general, linear methods are useful for large-scale, high-budget projects, where the benefits of iteration would be outweighed by the high cost of failure.** On the other hand, iterative methods are best suited for smaller projects where prototyping and testing can be done without enormous financial investment.

There are hybrid methods that balance these two approaches to maximize the benefits of each of them. An adapted gated method has tightly scheduled management reviews, but allows for free iteration between those reviews. This keeps the process moving along while still allowing designers to hone in on the true problem and best solution. It’s also possible to use iterative design for the problem definition phase of a project, then switch to a linear method for the solution development phase.

### Design Thinking in the Real World

Human-centered design has become a buzzword, and even well-intentioned companies often fall short of the ideals. Pushing a product through a lengthy iterative design process that involves weeks of field observations is a great idea in theory, but in practice, budget and time constraints play a much bigger role. This is why the author proposes his own eponymous “Law of Product Development”: that all product development projects are “behind schedule and above budget” from the moment they start.

#### What Makes the Design Process Difficult?

Beyond time and budget, the makeup of the product development team can present difficulties. The best teams are multidisciplinary, combining unique knowledge from different specialties and from every phase of the product development process. The downside of this arrangement is that **every team member typically thinks their own discipline is the most important.** To manage this, it’s important for teams to reach a mutual understanding of each other’s strengths and needs, and why those needs are important for the overall success of the product.

Strong management is crucial to prevent individual departments from making independent changes to the design, but getting everyone on the same page takes time. To streamline the process, Norman recommends having the design research and market research teams working in the field consistently, even before there is a specific product to be tested. This gives the entire team a head start with a solid foundation of user needs and motivations that can be honed through the rest of product development.

#### Designing for Special Populations

Another hurdle in the design process is conflicting product requirements. Designing a single product that satisfies all members of the product development team _and_ meets the needs of a diverse group of users is a tall order.

One tool for designing to suit as many users as possible, despite the wide range of human needs and traits, is _physical anthropometry_. This field studies measurements of the human body, both at rest and while performing specific tasks (like range of motion for reaching behind you). These standardized measurements allow designers to work within percentiles, ensuring that the final product is likely to work for as many users as possible. But no one design works for everyone, and even the most inclusive designs can be unusable for tens of millions of users.

Not all products are meant to be used by every type of person. The author gives the example of clothing—we don’t expect every piece of clothing to fit every person. Instead we design and produce different sizes for different people. Designing for users with disabilities is an important area requiring designers to focus on specific needs rather than averages.

Traditionally, the design of assistive devices like mobility aids has focused exclusively on function. This is why when we think of a walker or wheelchair, most of us picture a clunky contraption that looks more at home in a hospital than anywhere else. **The institutional look of these designs contributes to the social stigma already faced by people with disabilities.** After all, there is little functional difference between a wheelchair and a bicycle, but the two objects provoke very different social reactions.

##### Universal Design

A universal design approach offers a different perspective on designing for disability. **Universal design creates products that are usable by the widest range of people, not by designing for the “average” person, but by designing for the highest need.** If a product, environment, or service is designed with disability access in mind, it will also be usable for those without disabilities.

A great example of this is OXO, a company that designs and manufactures kitchen utensils. The founder of OXO started the company by designing a vegetable peeler that wouldn’t put stress on his wife’s arthritic hands. The resulting product replaced the thin metal handle of traditional peelers with a thick, ergonomic rubber grip. It was then marketed not as a medical or adaptive product, but as simply a better vegetable peeler, and launched the company into a household name. **The lesson here is that designing for disability typically ends up benefiting _everyone_**(Shortform note: this principle is known as the “curb cut effect”).

One of the keys to universal design is flexibility. Flexible designs that allow users to customize the environment to their own needs can serve the greatest number of people with a single product. We often see this kind of flexibility in products like ergonomic office chairs, where users can adjust the height of the seat, headrests, and armrests to fit their specific needs.

### When Is “Bad” Design a Good Idea?

Until now, this book has focused on identifying and working toward more user-friendly designs. But there are also cases where _deliberately_ designing something to be difficult to use is the best design choice. For example, think back to Norman doors. **A door with hardware mounted in a hidden recess at the very top of the door would normally be a nuisance. But if the door is part of a school and is only meant to be operated by adults, not children, mounting the hardware where only adults can see and reach is good design.**

“Bad” or intentionally confusing design has many applications. For example:

  * Security systems and exterior doors that should only be operated by authorized people.
  * Dangerous equipment, materials, or operations (such as safeties on guns, computer dialogue boxes that require entering a password before permanently deleting files, and child-proof caps on medicine and chemical bottles).
  * Games and puzzles where challenge is an essential part of the fun. 



However, there is a difference between sloppy design and intentionally designing confusing products. **Intentionally confusing designs still need to be easy to use and operate for _some_ users, just not _all_ users** (for example, a child-proof cap on a medication bottle is not an example of good design if an adult can’t open it either). In other words, you need to know the rules in order to break them well. This can take many forms, such as:

  * Making controls invisible, or positioning them so that only certain people will be able to see and use them (for example, a doorknob placed much higher than normal on a daycare center door to ensure only adults are able to operate it). 
  * Using unnatural (but specific) mapping, so that only those with appropriate training know which control operates which function. 
  * Making controls impossible to operate with only one person (for example, by spacing them across the room and requiring simultaneous action). This ensures that no single person can activate dangerous operations. 
  * Making feedback delayed and unintuitive, or removing it entirely.
