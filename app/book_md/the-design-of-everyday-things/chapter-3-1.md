## Chapter 3.1: The Mechanics of Memory

In this chapter, we’ll explore the interaction between “knowledge in the head” (memory) and “knowledge in the world” (design features). A significant chunk of the chapter is dedicated to an overview of different types of memory and how they function. This section isn’t overly technical, and as we’ll see, having a basic understanding of memory has important implications for design.

### “Knowledge in the Head” vs. “Knowledge in the World”

Norman refers to any information stored solely in memory as “knowledge in the head." This applies to things like passwords on your computer (unless you’ve written them down) as well as knowing how to use a computer in the first place. Knowledge in the head can be either declarative or procedural.

  * **Declarative knowledge is knowledge _of_ something (like knowing your address or the fact that red traffic lights mean stop).** Anything that can be written as a fact is declarative knowledge, _regardless of whether it’s true_. You may know for a fact that Thomas Edison invented the lightbulb, and that knowledge might impact how you think about the technology of lightbulbs in general—the fact that Edison did not actually invent the lightbulb is not important in your interaction with that technology. 
  * **Procedural knowledge is “knowledge _how_."** This applies to things we do without being able to precisely explain how we do them. Procedural knowledge is built up with repeated practice and can’t be easily taught to someone else. A master musician can describe the notes she plays and the time signature, but she probably can’t articulate the flow of her movements as she actually plays. Even describing the mechanics of playing an instrument (“I put the first finger of my left hand here, and strum this string with my right hand”) is not the same as truly knowing how to do it—if it were, all it would take to master any skill would be to read about it. 



**“Knowledge in the world” is anything we know without having to store it in memory.** People learning to use a keyboard can look at the letters—they don’t need to memorize the location of every key in advance. Students take notes in lectures instead of attempting to memorize every word they hear. Even something as simple as putting your wallet under your keys so you don’t forget to bring it when you leave the house counts as knowledge in the world since it takes the burden off your memory. The design principles in Chapters 1 and 2 are examples of knowledge in the world. Signifiers, perceived affordances, and feedback all give us clues on how to use something, eliminating the need to memorize it.

#### The Limits of Knowledge in the Head

Human memory is an incredible tool that stores massive amounts of information from every part of our lives. But that same power imposes certain limitations. To free up space to remember the things that are most important for our survival, **our brains naturally offload any information that is readily available in the environment.**

The advent of cell phones is a great example of this. Before cell phones, it was common to have the phone numbers of your closest contacts memorized, making them easy to dial on any available phone. Now, our devices store this information for us. We’ve moved that knowledge into the world, and in response, most of us have completely forgotten many of the numbers we once had memorized.

Furthermore, **knowledge in the head is typically imprecise**. We don’t need an exact understanding of every detail of an object or situation when a rough working model will do. To safely cross the street, you don’t need to be able to identify the make and model of every nearby car—you only need to be able to tell whether or not it’s moving, and at what speed. In other words, the knowledge we keep in our heads is the bare minimum that we need to function in any given environment.

##### Example: Common Coins

A 1979 study demonstrated this using American coins. The study found that fewer than half of American college students could identify the correct image of a United States penny from a set of similar images when small details were changed (like reversing the direction Abraham Lincoln’s silhouette faces or moving the word “liberty” to a new location).

This task is difficult because our knowledge of coins is stored mostly in the world. Since most of us rarely need to tell the difference between real and counterfeit coins, our brains only store the necessary details to distinguish one type of coin from another (for pennies, this is color, size, and texture). Given a set of images that have all these distinguishing details in common, we struggle to choose the real penny because the knowledge in our head is so imprecise. But in a pile of dimes and quarters, you would pick the penny out easily every time.

Our imprecise knowledge of details is usually all we need for day to day life. But if those details change significantly, our approximate models may no longer be enough. Coins provide another great example, this time with real-world consequences. In 1979, the United States released the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, which was nearly the exact size, shape, color, and weight of the existing quarter (but worth four times as much). Suddenly, correctly counting change required precise knowledge of details, causing mass confusion and frustration.

Why is it that two similar coins can cause so much confusion, but we can easily distinguish a one dollar bill from a twenty dollar bill?**Cultural and historical context determines how we distinguish one object from another.** Because American paper money uses identically-sized bills, we are used to relying on the images on the bills themselves to tell them apart. So introducing a new bill of the same size and color would be no problem for Americans, but would cause uproar in countries that use size to distinguish between different values of paper money.

#### Constraints and Memory

Constraints are conditions that limit the ways we can interact with an object or system. These conditions can be physical, cultural, semantic, or logical. (The four categories of constraints will be covered in depth in Chapter 4.) Norman uses the ancient practice of traveling performers reciting epic poetry as an example. Reciting even a third of an epic poem like Homer’s _Odyssey_ or _Illiad_ requires memorizing nine thousand lines, roughly equivalent to two and a half hours of recitation. This feat sounds impossible, in part because it is. **Studies show that skilled performers are not reciting the poem word for word from memory, but actually recreating it on the spot using the constraints of poetry.**

Depending on the form, poems have to follow certain rules of structure and rhyme. These rules act as constraints. If a performer tries to remember the last word of a line of poetry from the full English lexicon, they’re sunk. But if they know the word has to rhyme with the line before it, and it also has to convey a certain meaning, those constraints make it much easier to recall the right word.

Imagine trying to remember a certain word while reciting a poem. If you know from the rhyming structure that the word has to rhyme with “ear," that narrows the field, but not by much: The word could be “fear," “dear," “sneer," and so on. But if the word also has a constraint on its meaning, and has to mean “a unit of time," the combined restraints allow for only one answer: “year." With these constraints, a performer only needs to know the narrative of the story and the form of the poem to be able to produce what looks and sounds like an exact, word-for-word recitation.

Another example of this is taking apart an appliance to replace a part. Without memorizing, how do we know which parts go where when it comes time to reassemble? Physical constraints simplify this process: Certain size screws will only attach to certain size nuts, and parts of a particular shape will only slot into spaces that accommodate that shape. **The physical nature of the objects themselves limits the ways they could be assembled, reducing the need to memorize the layout.**

For designers, understanding constraints is crucial for creating a positive user experience. Designing objects and programs that are constrained by physical, cultural, or semantic rules takes the burden off the user, since the object itself limits the possible ways to interact with it.

### Types of Memory

This section dives deeper into the different types of memory. It’s important for designers to have a working understanding of each type of memory, particularly in the digital age, as increasingly complex technology requires users to combine “knowledge in the head” with “knowledge in the world” in more and more sophisticated ways.

Digital passwords are an especially important example of this effect. **While new technologies make it much easier to store knowledge in the world, doing so makes the information far less secure, since knowledge in the world is accessible to anyone in that environment.** To protect private information, computer systems require passwords. Simple passwords were sufficient at first, but the rise of hacking and the ability to store sensitive information like bank records online quickly required a new approach to security. Now, most programs have complex password requirements that use a combination of numbers, letters, and symbols. Some programs require the password to be changed on a regular basis.

**Unfortunately, all this added complexity has created _less_ security, not more. **The design of this system does not account for the limits of human memory. Simple passwords that held personal meaning were easy to remember, but long strings of random characters are not. To cope, we write them down. We store sensitive information (like banking information or medical records) in the world, then require knowledge in the head (a password) to access it. But that knowledge is too complex to remember, so we put it back into the world. The system has defeated itself.

**The most secure systems _combine_ the two sources of knowledge by requiring both “something you have” and “something you know." **A physical object like a key is knowledge in the world—it doesn’t need to be stored in memory, but can be used by anyone, not just authorized users. But a security system that requires both a physical object _and_ a password allows for privacy without putting all the burden on human memory.

#### Short-Term Memory

As the name implies, short-term memory is the automatic storage of recent information. Short term memory is also called “working memory” because it is the information we keep in our minds in order to complete any given task.

The information held in short-term memory is constantly being replaced as we encounter new stimuli, so **holding onto any piece of information for more than a second requires _rehearsal_ , or consistently repeating the information until it’s no longer needed **(like when you hear a phone number spoken aloud and repeat it to yourself over and over while you search for a pen to write it down).

The science of memory is complicated, but a simplified conceptual model is all we need for design purposes. **Think of short-term memory as five to seven mental “slots” where recent information is stored.** If all the slots are filled when a new piece of information comes along, it will knock out an older piece of information and take over that slot. It is possible to keep more information in working memory through the use of _mnemonics_ , or techniques that enhance memory by making meaning out of meaningless data.

##### Guidelines for Designers

  * **Don’t require people to use short-term memory at all if possible** , but certainly not for more than a few seconds or for more than five items (although the average person can store five to seven items in short-term memory, Norman recommends erring on the side of caution and using three to five as a practical limit). For example, for computer programs, let users keep relevant information (like confirmation codes) on screen until they manually exit the window.
  * **Use multiple sensory modalities to convey information** (such as audio and visual, or visual and tactile). The brain processes information from different sensory channels separately, so one piece of information is less likely to overwhelm another. This is why GPS devices give audible instructions while the driver visually focuses on the road.



#### Long-Term Memory

If information is important enough or rehearsed often enough, it moves from short-term memory into long-term memory. Long term memory is more robust, and memories encoded here do not automatically replace other memories. **While we encode and access short-term memory automatically, it takes time to encode long-term memories, and it typically takes time to access them later.**

We still don’t know exactly how short-term memories become encoded into long-term memory, but most scientists agree that this process happens during sleep. This is important for anyone designing a product or system that requires users to store information in long-term memory—that process typically is not instant, and it might require several encounters with the information with periods of sleep in between.

Information stored in long-term memory is much more durable, but there is an important caveat here: **memories are encoded based on our interpretation of events, not as they really happened.** Much like performers reciting epic poetry, we don’t remember every single detail of an event, but rather the main details and our subjective interpretation of them. This also means that each time the memory is recalled, we are recreating it based on that limited information. So each time we access the memory, we inadvertently change small details of it and then re-encode that version of events. This process has powerful implications for law and criminal justice settings, since it demonstrates just how unreliable eyewitness testimony can be.

##### Guidelines for Designers

  * **Keep formatting consistent across products.** For example, while each new iPhone model introduces new features, the basic layout and mechanics (like pinching to zoom and locating volume buttons on the left edge) have stayed consistent. The knowledge of how to use an iPhone is already encoded in users’ long-term memory, and Apple takes advantage of this to create an experience where users can feel a satisfying sense of mastery, even with a brand new product. 
  * **Design for the whole experience.** Because we encode long-term memories subjectively, memories formed as part of a positive experience will be remembered positively, even if the actual information being remembered is emotionally neutral.
