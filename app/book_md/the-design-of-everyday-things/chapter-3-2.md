## Chapter 3.2: Memory and Design

The subjective way memories are encoded affects how we retrieve them later on. Details of an event that were especially meaningful to us might be remembered as much more important to the overall story than they were at the time. In fact, whether information is meaningful is one of the biggest factors influencing our ability to remember it.

**Meaningful things are easy to remember.** They don’t need to be meaningful to our personal lives, as long as they have a meaningful relationship to each other, or to something else we know. Meaning helps us connect the information to a bigger picture. **Arbitrary, unrelated things are much more difficult to remember.** This is why rote learning is so difficult to do—the information being learned has no underlying structure to provide meaning. Typically, we cope with this by imposing structure of our own.

For example, the order of letters in the alphabet is arbitrary information. There is no underlying meaning explaining why C comes after B, except that we collectively agree that it does. To make this arbitrary sequence easier to learn, we impose structure in the form of the alphabet song.

  * Mnemonics are designed for this exact purpose. When learning to read music, remembering which notes correspond to which lines on the staff is arbitrary. Imposing the mnemonic “Every Good Boy Does Fine” turns an arbitrary series of notes (“EGBDF”) into a meaningful phrase, making it much easier to remember.



Another way we turn arbitrary information into meaningful information is through interpretation. The author gives an example of his friend, Professor Yutaka Sayeki, learning to use the turn signal on his motorcycle. The signal was mounted on the left handle bar, and signaled a left turn by pulling the lever backwards and a right turn by pushing forwards.

  * At first, Sayeki struggled to map the direction of the signal lever (forward or back) onto the direction of the signal light (left or right), since the connection between the two seemed completely arbitrary. To fix this, Sayeki adjusted his mental model of the turn signal so that the lever corresponded to the direction the handlebars moved when turning, as opposed to the direction of the motorcycle itself. Since pulling the left handlebar back turns the motorcycle to the left, and pushing the left handlebar forward turns the motorcycle to the right, this connection made sense—the information became meaningful and was then much easier to remember. 



Designers can make this process much easier by **creating meaningful controls.** For example, in a traditional car, the turn signal is pushed up to signal right and down to signal left. This takes advantage of our sense of clockwise and counter-clockwise direction: If we could extend the motion, the turn signal lever would be like the hand of a clock, and pushing up on it would ultimately send it to the right.

### Approximate Models

Professor Sayeki’s mental model of the turn signal doesn’t account for all the mechanics of turning a motorcycle (like that fact that executing a left turn often means first steering slightly to the right). But the model works—it imposed meaning on the direction of the signal lever, making it easy to remember and use. **For most everyday situations, approximate models are all we need to successfully interact with our environment.**

We use approximate models all the time, often without realizing it. Mental math is a great example. For instance, if your job pays weekly and an official form asks for your monthly income, you need a precise answer. You’d multiply your weekly income by the number of weeks you work in a year and divide the resulting number by twelve months to get an average monthly income. But most of us would struggle to do that math without a calculator.

  * On the other hand, if you want to know your monthly income to determine if you can afford that new streaming service, you could just multiply your weekly income by four (the average number of weeks in a month). This mental math is much easier to do, but the model ignores the fact that not all months have exactly four weeks, so the answer is not exact—it’s an approximate model. 



Even this chapter has relied on approximate models when describing short-term memory. In reality, there are no “slots” in the brain where information sits, waiting to be replaced by new information. For neuroscientists, this model is too simplistic to be useful. But for designers, it gives a close enough explanation of the process to inform design.

### “Out of Sight, Out of Mind”

As we’ve seen, human memory is not a particularly reliable tool, and we are much more likely to remember something if we transform it from knowledge in the head to knowledge in the world. This process can have extremely critical consequences, as in the case of airline pilots. When pilots are preparing to take off or land the plane, they are also listening to a steady stream of instructions and important information from air traffic control, most of it delivered rapidly and in technical language.

Because the stakes are so high, pilots are taught to immediately translate this information into knowledge in the world. They program instruments as the correct settings are announced and write down any important or unfamiliar information.

Airplane technology is evolving to make this process even easier by relaying this information digitally, allowing instruments to be set automatically and important information to be displayed visually. **The idea is to create a design that takes as much burden as possible off the pilots’ memory, which reduces the risk of dangerous mistakes.**

#### Reminding

Transferring information from short-term memory into external knowledge is relatively simple when the information is immediately relevant. But what about remembering things that haven’t happened yet, like the date and time of a dentist appointment several months from now? That requires**_prospective memory_ , or remembering to do something in the future. **We typically think of memory as relating only to the past, but prospective memory functions in the same way: to avoid forgetting an item in prospective memory, it must be continually rehearsed or transformed into knowledge in the world.

How do we remember things that haven’t happened yet? To do this, we need reminders—external cues that will trigger our memory for an event at precisely the right time in the future. Effective reminders rely on the concept of **_memory for the future_ , which is our ability to predict future states based on our memory of the past. **

So, to create a reminder of that future appointment, you need to remember the date and time of the appointment itself (prospective memory) as well as what you’re likely to be doing at that time based on your typical schedule (memory for the future). This tells you where and when to place the reminder so it will trigger your memory.

(Some future events can be easily remembered without reminders. The difference between arbitrary and meaningful information applies here too: While you might need a reminder for that future appointment, you’ll most likely have no trouble remembering the date of your upcoming wedding or important presentation.)

Effective reminders have two components: signal and message. **The signal alerts us that there is something to remember; the message tells us what that something is.** For a digital example, imagine entering a reminder into the calendar on your phone. If you set the date and time for the reminder to alert you, but don’t enter the name of the event, you’ll be left wondering what on earth you were supposed to remember when the alert goes off. On the other hand, if you enter the event details but don’t set an alert to go off at the correct time, the lack of signal means you’re likely to forget the message exists at all.

Reminders can take several different forms. Physical reminders like a note taped to the door combine signal (the sight of the note) with message (whatever is written on it). These types of reminders act as knowledge in the world, removing the need to rely on memory.

Knowledge in the head, on the other hand, needs to be cued. The message is there, but without a signal to prompt retrieval, it does us no good. As we move to increasingly digital formats for getting things done, incorporating appropriate signals is an important challenge. Massive amounts of information are available to us through technology, but because it’s not immediately visible on screen at all times, the burden is on our memory to remember that it’s there at all.

**Designers can reduce this burden by providing a “roadmap” with meaningful headings that can serve as memory cues,** usually in the form of a menu. Let’s use digital photo storage as an example. If you store every photo you’ve ever taken in one folder labeled “Photos," you’re likely to completely forget what specific photos are in there. But if that folder were broken down into nested subfolders based on certain categories, a quick glance at the headings would act as a memory cue. Imagine the difference between searching for a photo of a specific person in one big “Photos” folder versus a folder with nested subsections that help you narrow the search to “Photos>2020>Family>Mom’s birthday party."

### Combining Memory With Knowledge in the World

Reminders are not always set up in advance. Sometimes, we can work collaboratively with others in our environment to remind ourselves of information we’ve forgotten. For example, if you’re with a group of friends and collectively forget the name of a famous actress, you might list the name of a few movies she was in, which reminds one friend of another of her film roles, which in turn reminds another friend of an award she won. The group circles closer and closer to the answer until finally someone remembers the correct name. **This process is called _transactive memory_ , in which we combine knowledge from multiple sources to reach an answer none of those sources could come up with on their own. **

Transactive memory applies to more than just groups of people. Imagine the same scenario where you’ve forgotten the name of a famous actress, but without a group of people around to help. Instead, you type the name of one of her movies into a search engine. The first results are about the remake of that film, so you refine the search further by adding the year the movie was released. Now you’re able to comb the cast list for the correct film and ultimately discover the name you’ve forgotten.

This type of transactive memory is powerful. The correct answer was in the world, somewhere on the internet. But in order to retrieve it, the search engine needed information stored in the user’s memory (the year the film was released). Even an incredibly powerful machine like the modern computer could not produce the correct answer alone. (The powerful effects of combining human brain power and modern technology are explored further in Chapter 7.)

#### Natural Mapping

The search engine example is an effective combination of knowledge in the head and knowledge in the world. Not all attempts to combine these sources of information are quite as successful.

Think back to the discussion of mapping in Chapter 1. Mapping describes the relationship between controls and the objects they control. Ineffective mapping requires storing the knowledge of how to operate those controls in long-term memory, which takes time and effort to retrieve. In contrast, natural mapping takes advantage of basic properties of physics and psychology to make the control/object relationship intuitive. **In other words, mapping is a tool for putting knowledge into the world and reducing the burden on memory.** The closer the controls are to the object they control, the more understandable the relationship.

  * **The best-case scenario** for natural mapping is controls that are incorporated into the object itself. Gesture controlled faucets are an example of this: to operate the faucet, the only object you need to interact with is the faucet itself. 
  * **The second best** natural mapping approach is to have controls located immediately next to the object they control. This approach uses proximity to show the user which controls to use.
  * **The third best** natural mapping approach is to create an arrangement of controls that maps onto the arrangement of objects. For example, in a car, the driver’s window controls are typically arranged in a way that maps onto the car windows themselves as seen from a bird’s eye view (so the upper left control operates the driver’s window, the upper right the passenger seat window, and so on). 



##### The Stovetop Problem

Think back to the stovetop example of mapping from Chapter 1. This example pops up often in design textbooks because the problem itself is relatively straightforward, but the solution is almost never implemented into stove designs. This means that almost everyone has encountered the issue of trying to figure out which knob controls which burner.

In the case of stove burners, it isn’t possible to use the best or even second-best natural mapping strategies, since mounting controls directly onto the burners or in close proximity to them is a major safety hazard. The third best mapping strategy is relatively intuitive here: If the burners are arranged in a square, the knobs should also be arranged in a square. But this type of configuration is almost never seen. Instead, we see layouts like these:

![the-design-of-everyday-things-8.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-8.png)

All four of these designs can be found on stovetops currently on the market. The layout of the burners doesn’t change, but the layout and location of the knobs change each time. The lack of standardization alone would make things confusing, but on top of that, each of them requires mentally mapping a one dimensional line (the controls) onto a two dimensional square (the burners). This requires some complicated mental gymnastics, and mistakes can easily lead to serious accidents and injury.

The easiest way to reduce the risk of accidents is through natural mapping.**Effective natural mapping puts the knowledge of how to use the stove completely in the world rather than in the head.** Compare these layout designs to the ones above:

![the-design-of-everyday-things-9.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-9.png)

A slight change in layout makes a huge difference. If the solution is so easy, why does this problem still exist? One major reason is that**the people buying appliances are often not the same people who will be using them.** As an individual, we typically only have to replace major appliances like stoves a few times in a lifetime at most, so we’re more likely to make usability an important factor when choosing a new model. On the other hand, construction and housing companies often buy appliances in large quantities to supply newly constructed homes, and are much more likely to make their decision based on cost and available features. After all, it’s easy to ignore the usability factor when you’ll most likely never use the appliance yourself.

#### Culture Influences Mapping

Although natural mapping makes user interaction more intuitive, what is considered intuitive in one culture may be completely different in another. This presents a particularly tricky problem: **Cultural differences impact how people interact with design, but most of us are so immersed in our own culture that we don’t recognize the places where our viewpoint might not be universal.**

For example, the way we represent time is culturally dependent. People in western cultures typically think of time as a road stretching out before them. Each individual person is walking forward on their own road, with the future in front of them and the past behind them. But this view is not universal. For some cultures, it’s not the person who moves, but the “road” of time itself, with future events always moving toward us. Other cultures represent the time line horizontally, with the future either to the left or the right (typically corresponding to whether the local language reads right to left or left to right).

Why is this important when it comes to design? As more and more products come equipped with digital displays, understanding the differences in how people visualize abstract concepts becomes crucial. The author gives an example from his experience of giving a talk in Asia with an accompanying slideshow projected onto a large screen. The remote control for the projector had two buttons arranged vertically. When it came time for the next slide, Norman pushed the top button—but the presentation moved backward, not forward.

  * While Norman was visualizing the presentation as a series of images that he would move forward through, whoever designed the projector had visualized that type of presentation as a set of images that users would move _toward_ themselves. In that case, the lower button (closest to the body) is the obvious choice to bring up the next slide. The two models have a similar structure but differ in their concept of who or what is actually moving. This difference caused a brief technical hiccup, but in another setting, such a minor issue could have powerful consequences. 



The question of “Who is moving, the user or the object?” also impacts the way we read text on a screen. As you read this summary, which direction do you scroll to keep reading? On modern touchscreens, swiping up with a finger almost always makes the text scroll down. This is the same action you’d use to move printed material in real life (like reading a newspaper lying flat on a table and pushing the newspaper away from you in order to bring the bottom sections into your view).

But there is another way to visualize this. Before the advent of touchscreens, computer displays used a “moving window” paradigm, where the text was visualized as static display, and the screen as a small window onto that display that showed a certain amount of the text at a time. To read more, the window would move, not the text. In this case, the cursor controlled the window, not the text, so scrolling down meant physically moving the cursor down, not up.

**These examples make it clear that the “right way” to do something depends on our mental model of it, and mental models can vary by culture.** To design a successful product, designers need to understand how the majority of target users will visualize the concepts needed to use the product. If designers try to introduce a new paradigm, users will be confused and frustrated. If this is a widely-implemented change, the product is not necessarily doomed to fail, but there will be a significant adjustment period.
