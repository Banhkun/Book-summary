## Exercise: Redesign Reminders

This chapter covers a lot of information, and it can be difficult to connect it to concrete situations in our daily lives. This exercise asks you to redesign an element of your daily life using your new understanding of memory.

* * *

Think of a time recently when you created a reminder to help you remember a task or appointment. This could be any type of reminderâ€”an alert in a phone app, a note placed somewhere prominent, a loved one you asked to help you remember, or even a mental association between two situations. What did you need to remember, and what type of reminder did you use?

In your reminder, what was the signal? What was the message? (Remember, the signal is your cue to remember something, and the message is what should be remembered.)

Did your reminder rely more on knowledge in the head or knowledge in the world? Did this work well for you?

If you were asked to remember the same type of information in the future, would you choose this type of reminder again? Why or why not?
