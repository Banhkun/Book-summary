## Chapter 4: Guiding Behavior With Design

Building on the lessons of the previous chapters, we’ll now explore a new way to guide behavior with design: constraints. **Constraints limit the ways users can interact with an object.** They create affordances, but they also guide users on which affordances to focus on. There are four main types of constraints: physical, cultural, semantic, and logical.

### Physical Constraints

**Physical constraints are physical qualities of an object that limit the ways it can interact with users or other objects.** The shape and size of a jar lid act as physical constraints that prevent it from being attached to the wrong jar; different-sized holes on some electrical outlets constrain the way plugs can be connected; the height of a doorknob constrains the type of people who can use the door.

Physical constraints can be deliberately designed to ensure an object is used correctly, but this doesn’t always result in increased usability. Cylindrical batteries are a common example: Although the shapes of each end of the battery are slightly different, that difference only constrains the electrical circuit, not the placement of the batteries. This is why most of us have experienced accidentally inserting a battery backwards and having to pry it out without damaging the terminal.

#### Forcing Functions

Forcing functions are physical constraints specifically designed to prevent certain actions from occurring at the wrong times or in the wrong contexts. Three important forcing functions are interlocks, lock-ins, and lock-outs.

  * **Interlocks constrain the _sequence_ of interactions with a given device,** usually by blocking potentially dangerous functions until safety measures are in place. Interlocks are at play when microwaves and dryers automatically turn off when opened, or when a car won’t shift out of park until the brake is applied. 
    * The “dead man’s switch” function of dangerous machinery like chainsaws and riding lawn mowers is another common example of an interlock. This spring-loaded switch requires continuous pressure: If it is released, the device immediately shuts off, ensuring that dangerous equipment will not run wild if the user becomes incapacitated. 
  * **Lock-ins constrain users to a particular activity, area, or pattern.** Physical barriers like jail cells are lock-ins, as are digital programs that make it difficult for users to quit out of an application accidentally. Lock-ins can also be more abstract: When tech companies create products that are only compatible with products of the same brand, they are locking the user into a continuous pattern of brand loyalty. 
  * **Lock-outs prevent users from entering dangerous areas or performing dangerous functions.** Like the names suggest, lock-ins are designed to keep people _in,_ while lock-outs are designed to keep people _out._ Childproof caps on bottles of medicine or dangerous chemicals are common lock-outs. Home security systems lock unwanted people out of private areas. 



### Cultural Constraints

Cultural constraints are the “rules” of society that help us understand how to interact with our environment.**** These rules operate through _schemas_(also called “scripts” or “frames”): mental models that help us interpret our environment. **Schemas help us navigate new situations based on our knowledge of similar environments.**

Imagine you wander into an unfamiliar building in a new city. You see tables all around, some of them with groups of people sitting and eating. Other people are carrying trays of food to and from the tables. These people are wearing aprons and name tags. All of these clues combine to activate the “restaurant” schema in your head—now you know not only what type of building you’re in, but how to behave appropriately in the situation.

#### Conventions

Schemas help us interpret our environment, but conventions and standards tell us how to interact with it. In the restaurant example, a schema helped you interpret the environment by combining the information from your senses and matching that to an existing mental model of “restaurant." Now that you understand the environment, you need to choose how to act appropriately within it. For that, you’re more likely to rely on conventions. **Conventions are culturally-dependent agreements about how things are done.** They are social rules that constrain our behavior.

  * (Shortform note: The distinction between schemas and conventions can be confusing. Generally speaking, schemas describe how we _think_ , while conventions describe how we _act_. But understanding this subtle difference isn’t crucial for the rest of the book, so don’t worry too much if it seems a bit muddy.)



**Conventions also act as cultural constraints that affect how we interpret signifiers and perceived affordances**. Think of a typical doorknob. The knob itself is the same shape and size as a cupped hand, so “grasping” is an intuitive perceived affordance. But nothing about the knob itself tells us it should be twisted, or that its purpose is to open and close doors. Those functions are cultural conventions that are learned from other people in our environment. To illustrate this, think of a doorknob mounted on a regular wall. You probably wouldn’t attempt to twist it, or expect it to open or close the wall, because the knowledge that “knobs open doors, not walls” is a universal cultural convention.

##### Case Study: Destination-Control Elevators

Conventions are valuable, but they also present a challenge to new technologies. One form of this is the _legacy problem_. **The legacy problem is the extreme inertia faced by any design that attempts to revolutionize a fundamental product or service.** Drastically changing the design of a common item (like an elevator or a house key) requires a complete logistical overhaul. The social and economic cost of implementing the new design is too high, so the existing design (the legacy) will win out almost every time, regardless of how difficult it is to use.

A classic example of the legacy problem is the use of destination-control elevators in large buildings. These elevators only travel to set floors and have no panel of buttons inside for passengers to select a floor. Instead, a control panel in the lobby directs users to the correct elevator based on their desired floor.

  * For example, in a building with thirty stories and ten elevators, each elevator would stop at three predetermined floors. If you wanted to go to the fifth floor, you’d find the control panel, enter “5," and be directed to the elevator that services that floor (perhaps “Elevator B," since the elevators themselves are typically given non-numerical labels to avoid confusion). 



For large buildings with many elevators (like hotels or office buildings), this design is far more efficient than the traditional elevator, where the person going to the highest floor has to wait while the elevator stops at every other passenger’s desired floor in between. In spite of this, destination-control elevators are still rare. Cultural convention is to blame here, since implementing this new system would require overhauling a cultural convention about how elevators work. For designers and developers, the increased efficiency was not worth the cultural taboo of violating convention, and the legacy of less-efficient elevators won out.

**The lesson of destination-control elevators is that consistency is important, because there will always be cultural resistance to change.** Typically, it’s not worth fighting ingrained conventions for small changes. But if there is a revolutionary new way of doing things that is objectively better, that change needs to be implemented _universally_ to avoid confusion.

#### Standards

Conventions are informal rules governing behavior. Standards are more official and can be applied cross-culturally. **When a convention is codified into law or written into the official literature of an industry, it becomes a standard.** Standards are typically very slow to develop, since they require so many people to officially agree to one set of overarching rules. For example, when cars were first adopted into popular use, there were no official traffic laws. Informal conventions arose quickly (for example, what side of the street to drive on), but these were not enough to reduce the enormous accident rate. Eventually, these conventions were written into official standards.

  * Laws are not the only official standards. Cars must be produced and operated according to certain laws, but the transportation industry as a whole has its own set of official standards, as does each specific automotive company. 



The purpose of standardization is to alleviate confusion. The modern environment is complex by nature, with so much information available at all times and so many different tasks needing attention. **Complexity is a fact of life, but _confusion_ is a design problem** (these definitions are addressed in more depth in the author’s book _Living with Complexity_). Easily discoverable and understandable designs can alleviate confusion by providing a clear conceptual model.

When design itself is not enough to avoid confusion, standardization is an important tool. **Norman calls standardization “the principle of desperation."** For design questions where there is no way to put the knowledge of how to use something into the world, standardization at least ensures that everyone only needs to learn how to use the device once, since that knowledge will transfer to every other encounter with that type of device.

For example, telling time on analog clocks is not intuitive. We have to be taught the meanings of each hand. But imagine how much harder this process would be if there were no standard design for clock faces. Try it out on the nonstandard clock below.

![the-design-of-everyday-things-10.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-10.jpg)

Establishing standards is not an easy task. Different groups will have different ideas about the proper standard, and compromise is not always possible when those ideas are fundamentally different. **Beyond that, companies who are already manufacturing whatever design is chosen as the new standard will have an edge**(since they won’t need to spend time or resources changing the production process), so corporate representatives often lobby hard for whatever model they already produce.

### Semantic and Logical Constraints

(Shortform note: Norman pays much less attention to these types of constraints in this chapter, so they have been collapsed into one section.)

**Semantic constraints dictate whether information is meaningful.** They help us filter the information in our environment and decide what is important. If you’re driving on a crowded city street, you might see colorful lights all around you. But you automatically pay more attention to red lights on the back of other cars (brake lights), or tri-colored lights that hang over an intersection (traffic lights). In this situation, the combination of color and location conveys semantic information so that you know which lights to focus on and which to ignore.

Meanings can change over time, or in response to new technologies. If self-driving cars become widespread, we may no longer need to pay much attention to brake lights on other cars, and future generations who grow up with that technology may not associate any particular meaning with red lights at all.

**Logical constraints make use of fundamental logic to guide behavior**. For example, if you take apart the plumbing beneath a sink drain to fix a leak, then discover an extra part leftover after you’ve reassembled the pipes, you know you’ve done something wrong because, logically, all the parts that came out should have gone back in.

The natural mapping demonstrated by the stovetop example earlier in Chapter 3 is made possible by logical constraints. If controls are arranged in the same shape as the objects they control, it makes logical sense that each control will correspond to the object in the matching location.

### Discoverability

Physical, cultural, semantic, and logical constraints aid in discoverability. This section applies these concepts to common objects like doors, switches, and faucets.

#### Norman Doors

Doors are infamous examples of bad design that we encounter in everyday life. In the first edition of this book, Norman laid out the concept of “discoverability” and showed how a huge portion of modern doors violated this principle. This section of the book was revolutionary in the design community, and was the first exposure many designers had to the idea of discoverability and the importance of user experience. The door example became so popular that confusing, poorly-designed doors are now often referred to as “Norman doors."

**In contrast to Norman doors, modern emergency doors are examples of discoverability done right.** In the past, emergency fire exit doors often opened inward. People rushing to get out of the building instinctively pushed against the doors and often became trapped. Now, the law requires emergency doors to open outward, and to be equipped with a panic bar. Unlike a regular door handle or a smaller metal plate, a panic bar spans almost the entire width of the door. It’s immediately visible and doesn’t require dexterity or precise movements to open. In other words, panic bars are highly discoverable.

#### Switches

Switches are another notorious offender when it comes to discoverability. **The design and placement of switches need to provide two types of information: what type __ of object they control, and which specific object in the room corresponds to that specific switch. **Traditionally, switches for all the lights in a room are grouped into one panel. This makes it easy to control everything from one spot but gets confusing quickly if the switches aren’t arranged logically. For public spaces with many different users, this may require adding homemade labels as signifiers.

![the-design-of-everyday-things-12.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-12.jpg)

Is there a better way? The author recommends two solutions: a natural mapping approach (as discussed in Chapter 3) or an activity-centered approach. In the stovetop example, natural mapping is fairly straightforward, since all four controls and all four burners are in view simultaneously. For a lighting system where not all the lights are in view from any one spot, an overhead diagram of the room or entire floor makes mapping much easier.

![the-design-of-everyday-things-13.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-13.jpg)

**Another option to streamline multiple controls is an _activity-centered approach_ , where controls are grouped by activity rather than by type. **Lecture halls are a great candidate for this approach. Typical lecture halls have all the light controls grouped together on one panel, all the projector controls on another, and any other system controls randomly placed elsewhere. An activity-centered approach would instead group these controls based on activities, with options like “lecture mode” or “video mode." For example, in “lecture mode," the projector screen would lower into place, the projector itself would turn on and allow for presentation controls, and the lights would calibrate to illuminate both the screen and the speaker.

  * One caveat with activity-centered approaches is that it is impossible to predict _every_ activity that will happen in a space. There needs to be a way to override the system to allow each control to be adjusted independently for those cases. 



#### Faucets

You’ve probably encountered a faucet that didn’t immediately work the way you expected it to. Maybe the hot and cold taps were switched, or the drain mechanism had no visible controls, or the knobs looked like they should be twisted when in reality they needed to be pushed. Nearly every residential and commercial building has at least one faucet, so why haven’t we found a universal standard that gets it right?

The most basic purpose of a faucet is to allow the user to control both temperature and flow rate of the water. Controlling flow rate is relatively simple, but temperature control involves two separate pipes (one for hot water, one for cold). So the user has just two needs, but the design of the plumbing system requires three separate operations to control flow rate, hot water, and cold water. **Designing a control that makes it easy and intuitive to meet two separate goals through three separate requirements is more difficult than it seems.**

There are many ways to address this problem, which is why we encounter so many different faucet designs on a regular basis. Almost all of these designs will have either one or two controls.

  * Possible solutions with one control:
    * Control only temperature, keeping flow rate constant. 
    * Control only flow rate, keeping temperature constant. 
    * Control only on/off, keeping both temperature and flow rate constant (as in the case of automatic faucets). 
    * One integrated for both temperature and flow rate (for example, a knob that controls temperature when twisted left or right, and flow rate when pushed in or pulled out). 
  * Possible solutions with two controls:
    * One control for hot water, one for cold (flow rate is controlled by the degree to which each tap is opened).
    * One control for temperature, one for flow rate. 



**The fact that there are fewer controls than necessary functions puts the burden on the user to figure out which control does what.** For example, for designs with one control for hot water and one for cold, how do you know which is which, and how do you know how to turn each control on or off?

Cultural conventions can be helpful here—in most of the world, the left control is for hot water, the right is for cold. In the United States and the United Kingdom, though, this rule is considered more of a loose guideline at best.

The design of the handle also presents a problem. For knobs that need to be twisted, we have another convention to help: Any mechanism with a screw thread is tightened by turning clockwise and loosened by turning counterclockwise. We intuitively think of knobs as screwed-on caps blocking water from flowing out of the pipe, so we understand that they need to be turned counterclockwise to open (unlike temperature controls, this is a universal convention).

But what about lever-style controls? Do we push away from us, since that is technically turning counterclockwise? Or do we pull toward us, envisioning the tap as a push/pull mechanism instead of a screw mechanism? If the levers work the same as knobs, pushing the right one away from us would increase flow rate, but doing the same on the left would decrease flow rate by turning the screw mechanism the opposite way.

Solutions where the left and right controls do different things when used the same way assume that we always use two hands to operate the controls. But what if you’re holding something in one arm, or otherwise have use of only one hand? In that situation, you now have to remember which control gets turned in which direction. The potential for error is high.

Designs with one control present similar problems. When one control is used for two separate functions, how do we know which does which? Does turning change the temperature, or the flow rate? If it’s temperature, does turning clockwise make it hotter or colder?

![the-design-of-everyday-things-14.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/the-design-of-everyday-things-14.jpg)

The fact that there are so many possible configurations for faucet controls means most of us resort to trial and error. While not ideal, this usually allows us to figure things out pretty quickly and go about our day. **But when feedback is not immediate—when moving the control doesn’t create an immediate change in temperature or flow rate—we have no confirmation that the system registered our input, so we repeat it.** This is a particular problem with shower controls, as the distance between the control and the faucet causes a slight delay in feedback (which is how we end up cranking the heat up in a freezing cold shower, only to be scalded moments later).

#### Using Sounds as Signifiers

As we’ve seen, signifiers play a huge role in discoverability. But signifiers are not always visual. **Sound signifiers are especially useful in situations like driving because they don’t interfere with visual attention.** On the other hand, sound signifiers can be distracting if not properly designed. It’s also difficult to direct sound to just one person without using headphones, which presents a privacy concern in some settings.

Using sounds as signifiers is a powerful tool, but tricky to get right. **To be effective, sounds have to be inherently meaningful, not arbitrary.** Users should be able to understand them without knowledge of the device. For example, the crunching sound of car tires on a gravel road combined with the rumble of an engine instantly tells us not only that something is coming toward us, but what that something is (a car), how it’s traveling (on gravel), and the direction it’s coming from. If the car were able to float above the gravel and instead emit a consistent beeping, we’d have no idea how to interpret that sound without previous knowledge of that type of car.

##### Case Study: Electric Vehicles

We may not need to worry about floating cars just yet, but adding artificial sounds to vehicles is already an important safety concern in the case of electric cars, which are almost silent at lower speeds. While this silence can be a perk for the driver, it poses a major threat to pedestrians. Blind people in particular are at risk, since they use sound as the primary signal to determine whether it’s safe to cross the street. Silent vehicles also pose a danger to sighted pedestrians if they are distracted (looking at a phone, for example). To address this design issue, electric car manufacturers add artificially produced sound.

But deciding _which_ sounds to add is more difficult than it seems. Some companies initially tried to artificially mimic the sound of gasoline engines. **This is called _skeuomorphic design_ , or adding features of older designs to new technology for aesthetic (not functional) reasons** (for example, digital “save” icons in the shape of floppy discs or manilla file folders). Skeuomorphic design can ease transition to new technology and provide helpful signifiers, although some designers argue it hinders creativity.

On the other hand, some companies designed unique artificial sounds to use as brand identifiers. But this presents a new challenge: how would blind pedestrians know the sound they’re hearing is from an approaching car without memorizing every brand’s unique sound?

Ultimately, various government bodies created sets of research-based standards that ultimately allow each manufacturer to create their own sounds, so long as those sounds meet certain safety requirements. Specific standards vary by country, but they all include three main requirements:

  * Sounds need to **alert** pedestrians to the presence of a vehicle. 
  * Sounds need to be **orienting** —they need to make it easy for pedestrians to figure out which direction the car is heading, how far away it is, and how fast it’s going. 
  * Sounds should **not annoy** pedestrians, since annoying sounds tend to be especially distracting.
