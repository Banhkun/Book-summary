## Chapter 7: Design in the Real World: Competition, Innovation, and Ethics

In an ideal world, every company would implement a human-centered design approach using a research-intensive, iterative design process. In the real world, this is far easier said than done. Producing well-designed products requires keeping the company afloat, which often translates to making concessions in the design process.

### The Pressures of Business

To keep profit margins high, manufacturers typically focus on price, features, and quality (in that order), so a lengthy and expensive design process that drives up the ultimate price of the product isn't practical. Even with the perfect combination of those three factors, products (and companies) can still fail purely due to timing. Successful products capitalize on the _zeitgeist_(German for “spirit of the time”), hitting the market at just the right moment in the cultural and economic climate. On top of all that, businesses also need to identify and market to the “real” customers—not the end user, but the distributors who decide which products to sell in their stores. Each of these pressures has an important impact on the design of the final product.

#### “Featuritis”

Competitive pressures can create unexpected consequences. For example, “featuritis” is the “disease” affecting product development, characterized by what Norman calls **“creeping featurism," or the temptation to add more and more features to an already well-designed product.** There are several possible sources of creeping featurism, including:

  * satisfying existing customers’ desires for new features;
  * keeping up with competitors who offer similar products; 
  * enticing customers to upgrade. 



The problem with creeping featurism is that it often degrades the overall quality of a product. Instead, Norman recommends companies focus on their strengths, and develop them even further. **Rather than winning over customers with new features, it’s better to do one thing better than anyone else on the market.**

### Turning Ideas Into Successful Products

Technological change happens quickly, and new product designs are developed quickly enough to keep up. But turning an idea into a successful product happens much slower, if it happens at all. Early models of new technologies are often prohibitively expensive, as was the case with digital cameras. Apple’s 1994 QuickTake digital camera was one of the first on the market, but it failed quickly, as consumers found the new technology confusing, expensive, and unnecessary.

Another cause of delay is the risk-averse attitudes of large corporations. **Radical innovation has a high failure rate, and most big companies would rather stick to a proven product.** Smaller companies are more willing to take these risks, but often don’t have the resources to withstand initial struggles. This is why most start-up companies fail, regardless of the quality of their ideas.

Because most of the product development process happens out of the public eye, many of us don’t realize just how long it can take to turn a product idea into reality. Looking deeper into the development of video calling technology and the QWERTY keyboard can help illustrate this point.

#### Case Study: Videophone

The idea of communicating via two-way video was first proposed in 1879, just two years after the invention of the telephone. The first working videophone was created in the 1920s but did not become commercially available in the United States until the 1960s, where it quickly failed. It wasn’t until the 2010s that technology finally caught up to the 150 year-old vision, and video calling exploded in popularity.

In the 1879 cartoon that first publicly imagined videophones of the future, the invention was credited to Thomas Edison. But Edison did not invent the videophone. This is an example of Stigler’s Law, where famous names are attached to products purely by reputation. We associate videophone technology with the names of companies who finally successfully popularized it, not with any of the actual inventors or original distributors. **The lesson here is that being first is not always an advantage if the timing is not right.**

#### Case Study: QWERTY Keyboards

Keyboards are another example of the long and winding road of product development. The modern QWERTY keyboard was first developed in the 1870s for mechanical typewriters. On these machines, each key was connected to the interior typebar by a metal lever. Using keyboard designs with more logical layouts (alphabetical, for example) often resulted in these levers crossing and jamming the machine. The QWERTY arrangement was created for the specific purpose of spacing out these levers to make them far less likely to jam.

We no longer need to worry about jamming metal levers, and many updated keyboard designs exist that make typing easier and faster. So why do we still use a keyboard layout designed to accommodate outdated technology? **This is a classic example of the legacy problem.** The QWERTY layout was adopted by Remington, the first company to successfully produce and market mechanical typewriters to a wide audience. An entire generation learned to type on Remington typewriters, and thus on the QWERTY layout—a powerful legacy.

By the time modern computer keyboards were invented, the existing keyboard layout was so universally ingrained that introducing a new design was nearly impossible. It doesn’t matter that alternate keyboards are faster and more efficient, or that extensive use of the QWERTY layout can contribute to symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome; the cost of updating technology and retraining entire generations is too high.

#### Radical vs. Incremental Innovation

Technological innovation takes two forms: radical and incremental. **Radical innovation refers to the revolutionary, paradigm-shifting ideas that change the fundamental nature of a product. Incremental innovation refers to the slower, iterative process of refining those ideas to make them better and more user-friendly.** For example, the invention of the automobile was a radical innovation, but incremental innovation is responsible for the steady stream of small changes that turned the first automobile into the modern car.

Incremental innovation happens through repeated iterative design cycles of observation, idea generation, prototyping, and testing. This happens not just within a single design project, but across the industry and over years or even decades. This process is sometimes called “hill climbing," based on the metaphor of climbing a hill blindfolded. Each step is a test: if you move your foot in one direction and find higher ground, step forward—if not, pivot and try again.

Radical innovation happens through the invention of new technologies as well as the combination of existing technologies. For example, music, television, and book publishing were once entirely separate industries. Now, internet streaming services have collapsed these industries into one platform, completely changing the way media is made, distributed, and consumed.

Radical innovation can be especially important for vital services (like housing, transportation, education, and medicine) where incremental change hasn’t addressed underlying fundamental issues. The complicated infrastructure of these fields makes change especially difficult, but the potential benefits of radical innovation are also much greater.

### The Future of Technology

All this innovation raises questions about the future. With technology evolving at such a rapid pace, how will our relationship to it change? On one hand, humans and technology are more linked than ever. Artificial intelligence and advanced medical technology like pacemakers and bionic prosthetics are blurring the line between human and machine in a brand new way. Our cultures have also changed to reflect this new relationship.

However, while people continue to evolve, our _needs_ remain largely the same. We still need food, water, sleep, shelter, and social interaction, among other things. The changes in our technology affect how we meet those needs, but not the needs themselves. Phones have become smaller and now contain cameras, but the need to talk to one another from a distance and to record history in a visual way has not changed. Keyboards have evolved and may eventually be replaced entirely, but there will always be a need to record information in written form. **In other words, human needs won’t change, but the way they’re satisfied will.**

#### Do We Rely Too Much on Technology?

With technology becoming so integrated into our daily lives, are we becoming too dependent on it? Do our devices make us _more_ capable, or less? These questions are not new—even Socrates argued that the invention of books would decimate the human capacity for memory, discussion, and independent thought. But books have arguably made us _more_ intelligent, not less. Not having to memorize every story or essay we encounter has made it possible for us to engage with more sources than ever before.

In the same way, technological innovation has made it possible to automate tasks that once took up huge amounts of time and energy—resources that can now be applied to more than just the necessary activities for survival. **Our intelligence hasn’t changed, only the tasks we apply it to.**

The key is in using technology to do the jobs technology can and _should_ do. This frees up time and effort for humans to do even bigger and better things than before. **Relying on human skills for part of a task and technology for another part is called _distributed cognition_ , and the combination typically outperforms what either people or machines could do alone. **

Pitting human chess masters against computer opponents is a classic example of this effect. In a one to one competition, modern computer programs almost always win. But when a human player and the computer work as a team, they beat both human _and_ computer opponents. This doesn’t require the human team member to be a grandmaster (or the computer to be running the world’s most advanced chess software) so long as they work effectively as a team.

### The Ethics of Good Design

Design impacts people on a cultural and societal level, not just individuals. It can be a powerful force for social change, which means it must be used responsibly. What does that mean for designers?

**The Future of Content Creation**

The almost universal availability of new technologies is changing the way we create and engage with information. Tools like blogging sites, integrated cameras, and free editing software make it possible for anyone to publish new media on any subject and reach a wider audience than ever before. Norman calls this “the rise of the small."

Easy access to technology is a game changer for parts of the world with less developed infrastructure. Access to information and low-cost technology has made it possible for people to innovate in brand new ways and develop solutions for their needs based on the resources they have available (like bicycle-powered water pumps and solar chimneys). These designs can then be shared online and adopted wherever they might be useful, even across the world.

**While technological advances make amateur content creation easier and more accessible, the opposite is true for professional content creators.** The programs and devices required to make professional-quality media are more sophisticated (and more expensive) than ever before. This leveling of the playing field is a double-edged sword: while accessing information is easier than ever, not all that information is true, and creating media that has been fact-checked by experts requires expensive professional resources.

#### Consumerism and Sustainability

Like content creation, the design of durable goods is also changing as technology evolves. The ability to compare items from different companies online before deciding which to purchase has made competition between manufacturers fiercer than ever. In this environment, more emphasis is placed on aesthetics and features that are likely to entice buyers and give companies an edge. A product can be perfectly designed for its function, but will still lose out to more attractive versions, even if they’re far less functional.

The need to attract buyers creates another hurdle.**While services like healthcare and food distribution are self-sustaining (because there will always be a need for them), durable physical goods are not:** If everyone who needs a particular product purchases one, there’s no one left to sell it to. One way manufacturers get around this is through _planned obsolescence_ , the practice of designing products that will break down after a certain amount of time and need to be replaced.

Trends are another tool companies use to entice repeat buyers—if there is a newer, more fashionable version of a product, buyers are more likely to upgrade. This creates a cycle of consumption: buy something, use it until it breaks or goes out of style, throw it away, and buy another. While this cycle is good for business, the waste it generates is horrible for the environment.

Thankfully, the combination of new technologies and a growing cultural awareness of sustainability issues is creating a new paradigm. It is easier than ever to design sustainable versions of products (like streaming services rather than physical copies of movies), and environmental friendliness is now a selling point.
