## Exercise: Observe the Right Users in the Right Settings

We know that observation is the first step of the design thinking process, but choosing the right users and settings can be difficult. Letâ€™s practice this now.

* * *

Imagine you were asked to design a new type of computer keyboard. What types of people would you choose to observe? How would you choose?

What settings would you observe these people in?

If you had the chance to carry out these observations in the settings you chose, what specific things would you observe? What might be important for helping you identify problems with the current keyboard design? (For example, whether people have added wrist rests or other supports to their keyboard setups.)
