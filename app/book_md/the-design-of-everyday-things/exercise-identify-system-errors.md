## Exercise: Identify System Errors

This chapter discussed the ways that systems are often designed without human needs in mind. Let’s connect this to your own experience.

* * *

In your field of work, is there a common error that seems to happen over and over, either to you or to colleagues?

If you experienced this error personally, did you blame yourself at the time? If you haven’t experienced this error, do you think you would blame yourself if it happened in the future?

Now, think about the error in light of what you learned in this chapter. Is there an underlying cause? (Remember, this could be the design of a physical object, but also company culture, work schedules, digital programs, and so on.)

Let’s use the idea behind “the five whys” to push this thinking even further. Keep asking yourself “why” until you get back to a fundamental issue underlying all the others. How many “whys” did it take to find the source?
