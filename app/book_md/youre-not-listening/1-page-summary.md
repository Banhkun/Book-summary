## 1-Page Summary

In _You’re Not Listening_ , journalist Kate Murphy makes a case for the value of listening more effectively. She argues that people are struggling to pay attention to each other, largely thanks to our self-centered culture, technological distractions, and a toxic political atmosphere. This carries a host of detrimental effects—including loneliness, damaged mental health, and increased hostility and misunderstanding between people of different beliefs.

**Fortunately, these problems can be reversed if we learn to listen _effectively_.** This guide will explain how _effective listening_ differs from _simply hearing_ and what steps you can take to become a more effective listener. We’ll cover Murphy’s ideas in three parts:

  * **Part 1: The Value of Effective Listening** explains Murphy's definition of effective listening and explores its value in building relationships, encouraging personal growth, and increasing social cooperation. 
  * **Part 2: Barriers to Effective Listening** discusses Murphy's reasons why people have such a hard time listening to each other—such as distractions, discomfort, and incorrect assumptions.
  * **Part 3: How to Listen Effectively** digs into Murphy's advice on how you can improve your listening skills.



Throughout, our commentary further explores the psychology and neuroscience of listening. We also extend Murphy's advice with tips from other communication experts.

### Part 1: The Value of Effective Listening

Most people understand listening as simply hearing someone talk. However, **Murphy advocates a more developed model of listening that we’ll call _effective listening_.** Effective listening goes far beyond merely processing someone’s words. It requires prioritizing the speaker and helping them _feel_ heard. It requires reading their body language, encouraging them to continue sharing, and putting your assumptions aside. Effective listening includes trying to understand how the speaker is feeling and why they’re trying to share something with you.

As we’ll explore throughout the guide, many find effective listening challenging—but, according to Murphy, it’s well worth the effort. She notes three main benefits of effective listening: creating connections, fostering growth, and enabling cooperation.

(Shortform note: It's likely that you think you _already_ participate in effective listening, but researchers have found that many people overestimate their listening abilities. One study found that over 96% of survey respondents consider themselves "good listeners." However, when tested, the average person retains only about half of what they hear. This suggests a widespread need for developing listening as a skill.)

#### Benefit #1: Effective Listening Creates Connections

Murphy explains that **effective listening creates empathic connections between people.** Scientific research shows that listening causes the brain waves of both the listener and speaker to start mirroring each other. This attunement creates strong feelings of personal connection that enable both speaker and listener to feel each others’ emotions and develop an empathic bond. Murphy explores three core benefits of these empathic connections.

(Shortform note: When Murphy discusses brain wave synchronization, she is referring to a process called _neural entrainment_. Brain activity naturally waxes and wanes in an oscillating pattern. The frequency of these oscillations can synchronize itself with external stimuli, such as the rhythm of a song. Researchers have found that synchronization depends on attention: The more closely someone listens to a song, the more their brainwaves will sync to its rhythm. As Murphy states, this also happens when people listen to each other. Scientists have even discovered that students' brain activity will sync to each other when they’re more engaged in class and will diverge when they’re disengaged.)

##### 1) Creating Connections Alleviates Loneliness

**Creating connections has the power to help us overcome loneliness.** Murphy explains that people feel lonely when they’re emotionally disconnected from others. This could be either because they’re physically isolated, or because they’re unable to connect with others around them. Because effective listening forges empathic connections at the neurological level, it has the power to alleviate emotional isolation and loneliness.

(Shortform note: Many researchers argue that people in developed countries have become much lonelier in the past 50 years. The UK has even declared loneliness a national health concern and appointed a Minister of Loneliness. Researchers suggest several contributing factors. First, many people focus more heavily on their careers and getting ahead in life than on their relationships. Second, home entertainment systems have made it easier for people to stay home instead of gathering in public spaces like bowling alleys or pubs. Finally, the stigma of loneliness itself keeps people isolated. Those with few friends feel reluctant to disclose their isolation, keeping them from reaching out—and thereby deepening their loneliness.)

##### 2) Creating Connections Strengthens Intimate Relationships

**Strong** **connections have the power to build more satisfying intimate relationships.** Murphy explains that the deeper connections that come from effective listening enable _trust_ : People are more likely to trust someone if they believe that person understands their feelings. Because effective listening allows you to understand someone else’s feelings on a deeper level, this will increase the likelihood that they’ll trust you.

Furthermore, Murphy states that trust is one of the most important foundations for a satisfying romantic relationship. Relationships without this foundation are more likely to fail.

> **Signs That You’re Not Listening Effectively In Your Relationship**
> 
> Relationship experts agree with Murphy's position that listening builds stronger relationships. Recall that _most_ people overestimate their listening abilities—to keep your relationship strong, avoid behaviors that relationship experts say are signs that you may not be listening effectively to your partner.
> 
>   * Changing the subject. Many partners will avoid difficult subjects by bringing up something else. This will leave the person raising the issue feeling unheard.
> 
>   * Trying to convince. Some people will respond to a relationship problem by trying to persuade the other person out of their point of view. This will also leave them feeling like you're not listening.
> 
>   * Shifting responsibility. By trying to reframe a problem as your partner's fault, you’ll shut down any chance to really hear what they’ve to say because they may become closed off and defensive.

##### 3) Creating Connections Supports Healthy Development in Children

**By forging strong connections through effective listening, parents can help their children grow into healthier adults.** Murphy explains that children need to feel heard to build trusting relationships with their parents. When children grow up, their relationships with their parents will form the template for their future relationships with others. Children who don’t form strong connections with their parents may struggle to form strong connections with others later in life.

> **How to Listen More Effectively to Your Children**
> 
> Even if you feel that you’re effectively listening to your child, Murphy explains that to gain the developmental benefits of a listening parent, children need to _feel_ heard. Psychologists offer several pieces of advice for showing a child they’re being heard.
> 
>   1. Prepare yourself to listen. When your child has something to say to you, take the time to prioritize listening. Put away whatever you’re doing and give them your undivided attention.
> 

>   1. Ask your child what kind of feedback they're looking for. Your child may be looking for affirmation, advice, or simply a chance to vent. Clearly understanding your child's needs in the conversation will help them feel heard.
> 

>   1. Acknowledge your child's emotions. Recognize what your child is feeling and reflect it back to them with a simple statement like, "That must have been frustrating." This helps children feel understood and teaches them to manage their emotions.
> 


#### Benefit #2: Effective Listening Fosters Growth

Murphy explains that, beyond creating strong connections, effective listening leads to learning and growth for __ both the listener _and_ the speaker.

##### 1) Effective Listening Helps the _Listener_ Learn and Grow

**Listening to others helps you learn more about people and the world around you—leading to a more interesting life with more personal growth.** Murphy states that when you talk about yourself, you’re only talking about things you already know. However, when you listen to _others_ , you also get to hear about things you _don’t_ already know. This has the potential to help you grow in three ways.

1) By considering ideas that wouldn't have occurred to you, you develop new perspectives and come to new understandings that you wouldn't have reached on your own.

(Shortform note: We can clarify the benefits of taking in many perspectives by understanding the differences between divergent and convergent thinking. Divergent thinking includes generating new ideas, making unexpected connections, and exploring new perspectives. Convergent thinking involves synthesizing, judging, and analyzing the ideas generated through divergent thinking. These two modes of thought work together to develop insights and understanding. Thus, we can see effective listening as a form of divergent thinking—it allows us to stay open to new ideas without judging or analyzing them during the conversation.)

2) Discovering new points of view allows you to challenge your own beliefs. This has the power to help you discover errors in your thinking and make you more secure in your convictions. Murphy explains that we’re most afraid of our ideas being challenged when they’re untested. By testing your own beliefs, you can become less afraid of these challenges. This will actually make you _more_ secure in your beliefs because you know they can stand up to challenge.

(Shortform note: In _Antifragile_ , Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that people rise to the occasion when they’re challenged—and become complacent when they’re not. Therefore, encountering beliefs that challenge your own could force you to think more deeply than you would have otherwise. By rising to the challenge and thinking through issues, you’re not just testing ideas and becoming more secure, you’re also rigorously cultivating your intellect in ways that you couldn't by surrounding yourself with familiar and unchallenging viewpoints.)

3) Listening to others can enrich your inner voice. People's inner voices typically pull from the voices they’ve listened to throughout their lives—such as parents, teachers, or close friends. By listening effectively to people, you can bring a greater variety of perspectives and wisdom to this inner voice.

(Shortform note: Psychologists have identified a wide range of benefits to developing your inner voice. They find that it helps children develop, improves working memory, enables silent reading, and increases motivation. However, when not properly managed, your internal monologue may also distract you. Therefore, many psychologists recommend deliberately cultivating a practice of healthy and encouraging self-talk.)

##### 2) Effective Listening Helps the _Speaker_ Learn and Grow

Murphy also states that **being effectively listened _to_ can help the _speaker_ learn and grow by providing an opportunity to process and solve their own problems. **Recall that listening builds trust between both parties. When the speaker feels they can trust their listener, it allows them to open up and explore their thoughts and feelings in greater depth.

By talking about their feelings in greater depth, the speaker has the opportunity to process problems, see new solutions, or come to a deeper understanding of themselves. All of these can aid the speaker in their personal growth by helping them to better understand their needs and challenges in life.

(Shortform note: Beyond coming to a deeper understanding of problems, researchers have found that talking about emotionally painful experiences also helps people heal from them. By naming and identifying their emotions, people have the power to alleviate distress and experience feelings of peace. This happens because talking about emotions can shift the brain's emotional activity from reactive parts of the brain, like the amygdala, to thinking parts of the brain, like the prefrontal cortex. This allows emotions to become less overwhelming.)

#### Benefit #3: Effective Listening Enables Cooperation

**Finally,** **Murphy argues that listening enables _cooperation_. **Recall that effective listening allows the speaker to open up and share things they might not normally share. This helps the listener and speaker find common ground and discover opportunities for compromise—which, in turn, allows for greater cooperation, collaboration, and coalition-building.

(Shortform note: Listening also enables cooperation because it impacts people’s _moods_. Researchers have found that whether someone cooperates is heavily determined by their emotional state and previous experience with cooperation. This contradicts previous social theories that maintained that individuals cooperate largely based on their self-interests. Recall that listening effectively to someone has the power to give them a sense of connection and validation. Because these feelings will improve their _mood_ , this can also increase their willingness to collaborate.)

### Part 2: Barriers to Listening

If listening is so important and beneficial, then why aren’t people doing it? Murphy identifies four main barriers to effective listening: distracting technology, discomfort, a culture of self-centeredness, and assumptions about other people.

#### Barrier #1: Distracting Technology

Murphy argues that **people don’t listen well because they’re distracted.** She explains that people are prone to distractions because the human brain _thinks much faster than people speak_. Therefore, you can easily get bored with someone speaking and focus on something else.

While listening without distraction may be difficult under normal circumstances, **Murphy suggests that two recent developments in technology have made this problem even worse** : increased background noise and technology designed to distract.

**1) Increased background noise breaks the listener's concentration.** Murphy contends that we live amid higher levels of background noise than ever before. In public and private spaces, people are used to constant music or television playing in the background. This pulls people's attention away from their conversations.

**2) Technology is designed to distract.** Murphy states that many software companies use information about psychology and neuroscience to design apps that are hyperstimulating and addictive. This distracts people because they’re always tempted to check their apps. Furthermore, these apps condition people's brains to crave a higher level of stimulation. This makes it even harder to pay attention as normal conversations won’t be as stimulating.

> **The Science Behind Distraction**
> 
> Murphy identifies three core reasons we have such a hard time with distraction: boredom, background noise, and overstimulation. Here we'll review scientific key findings on each of these problems and discuss how they relate to disrupted attention.
> 
> **1\. Boredom** : Psychologists have defined boredom as an experience when 1) people have difficulty paying attention or engaging in an activity, 2) they’re aware of it, and 3) they consider the environment responsible for their situation. People find boredom so distressing that it's linked to adverse outcomes in life like anxiety, depression, binge eating, drug and alcohol abuse, and gambling addiction. However, researchers argue that how people react to boredom determines how much it will distract their attention.Those who find ways to keep their mind stimulated while staying on task can overcome this powerful feeling.
> 
> **2\. Background noise** : Unfortunately, you may not have much control over how distracting you find background noise. Research has shown that some people are much more sensitive to background noise than others, which may be genetic. Noise-sensitive people who are often exposed to excessive loud background noise are also at greater risk for health problems like sleep disturbances and heart disease.
> 
> **3\. Overstimulation from technology** : There are conflicting views on whether technology diminishes people's attention span. Some mental health practitioners report that patients struggle to control their focus if they become too used to the immediate gratification of electronic media. However, some studies have shown no difference in attention spans between frequent and infrequent users of social media, suggesting that this correlation may be overhyped.

#### Barrier #2: Discomfort

Murphy points out **many people have trouble listening because they find it uncomfortable.** She highlights two distinct ways listening makes people uncomfortable: It forces them to deal with uncomfortable silences and it exposes them to views that challenge their beliefs..

##### 1) Uncomfortable Silences

**Murphy explains that listening causes discomfort because it requires you to be silent—and many people find that silence distressing.** Therefore, many people try to fill up the silence by talking. The pressure to avoid silences creates two problems for effective listening.

  1. To avoid silences, listeners will often think about how they'll respond when the other person finishes talking instead of paying attention. 
  2. Listeners will also jump in and speak as soon as they notice a pause coming up—whether or not the other person has finished speaking. This prevents the speaker from finishing their thoughts and sharing what's on their mind.



(Shortform note: Researchers may have pinpointed why silences in conversations can be so uncomfortable. Studies show that when conversations flow naturally without awkward pauses, people feel a greater sense of belonging, validation, and self-esteem. Conversely, when awkward pauses break up conversations, people fear exclusion and incompatibility. Therefore, people may rehearse their responses and interject prematurely because they fear exclusion and incompatibility. However, by charging ahead with the conversation instead of listening, they may actually _increase_ the likelihood of an awkward, incompatible conversation.)

##### 2) Views That Challenge Your Beliefs

**Murphy asserts that listening can also be uncomfortable because it exposes you to views that challenge your beliefs.** Citing research, she says confronting views contrary to your own activates the same parts of the brain as physical danger. Therefore, listeners may steer the conversation away from uncomfortable topics or avoid listening to certain individuals altogether. This leads people to listen to each other less on topics they find uncomfortable.

(Shortform note: To ease the discomfort of political debate, experts on political dialogue recommend finding common ground with someone before talking about politics. They argue that forming close personal ties creates trust, and trust enables people to listen to each other when they disagree politically. Therefore, if a subsequent political conversation gets heated, you can fall back on that shared trust and mutual respect.)

#### Barrier #3: A Self-Focused Culture

Murphy explains that people also don’t listen to each other **because their culture encourages them to be self-centered.** Society teaches that in order to belong and to deserve others’ attention, people need to prove their worth by displaying it to others. This encourages people to talk more about _themselves_ during conversations instead of listening to _others_.

**Murphy notes that, paradoxically, talking about yourself all the time may _diminish_ your feelings of worth. **Recall that listening to others creates a sense of empathy and connection. Many people derive their sense of self-worth and belonging from these feelings—but if someone always talks instead of listening, that essential feeling of connection can’t happen. Therefore, in trying to display their worth all the time, someone may feel _less_ self-worth and belonging than if they gave others a chance to speak.

(Shortform note: Similarly, psychologists have found that people overestimate how much fun they'll have talking about unique experiences that set them apart and underestimate how much fun they'll have talking about mundane experiences they have in common with others. In studies, participants felt more satisfied after talking about a mundane experience that everyone shared than after talking about an extraordinary experience that only they had. This happens because points of commonality lead to richer experiences of mutual engagement.)

#### Barrier #4: Making Assumptions

Murphy states that **people also fail to listen effectively because they’ve formed assumptions about the person speaking.** When you rely on your assumptions about others, you become less curious about who they are and what they have to say. This will lead you to listen less—there's no need to listen if you already know what they’ll say. Therefore the assumptions listeners hold about the person speaking become an obstacle to effective listening. Murphy identifies two main reasons why people make assumptions: stereotyping and personal familiarity.

  1. Stereotyping occurs when someone makes assumptions about another person based on external characteristics or social categories. Murphy points to a common modern example of this: assuming that someone has bad morals or character because of the political camp they fall into.
  2. Paradoxically, knowing someone really well can make you listen to them less. This happens because when you feel you know someone very well already, you become less curious about them and believe that you have less to learn. This lack of curiosity leads listeners to "tune out" when someone is speaking and therefore listen less effectively. 



> **Why We Tune Others Out—and How to Stop It**
> 
> We can overcome the negative impact of our assumptions on listening if we have a clearer sense of why this happens and what experts recommend. Neuroscience has shed light on why we’re so likely to tune out things when we believe we understand them. Because the brain's attention is a limited resource, we’re hardwired to spend it on the information we need most to survive. Therefore, our brains naturally look for changes in our environment and new developments that we need to process and understand. This is why people can naturally ignore the sound of fans or clocks. Their brains don’t notice the sounds because they’re so _consistent_. There are a couple of strategies to help break through this automatic tuning out:
> 
>   * **To overcome stereotypes** , experts advise first educating yourself on possible stereotypes you may hold about others. They also recommend _individuating_ others, that is, elevating their individual traits over group ones. Finally, they recommend staying in contact with people from the stereotyped group. A lack of experience with a group makes it easier to maintain stereotypical views.
> 
>   * **To overcome familiarity in your relationship,** experts advise trying a new activity together, going to a new place together, or even talking about something you don't usually discuss. Any new stimulation has the power to wake your brain up again to attentiveness.
> 
> 


### Part 3: How to Listen Effectively

Murphy says that, fortunately, you can overcome the barriers standing in the way of understanding others and become a more effective listener. We’ve grouped Murphy’s suggestions into three main categories: Stay curious, respond well, and pay close attention to the person speaking.

#### Suggestion #1: Stay Curious About the Person You’re Listening To

To start listening more effectively, Murphy argues you should **prioritize being curious about the _other_ person.** Focus on the things you _don't know_ about the speaker and the possibilities for learning. She provides two strategies for fostering curiosity: Make room for the unexpected and notice your own thoughts and feelings.

##### 1) Make Room for the Unexpected

Murphy argues that when **a listener assumes they already know where a conversation is going, this undermines their curiosity**. By staying open to the possibility of an unpredictable or surprising conversation, a listener can stay curious about the person speaking.

> **The Two Types of Curiosity**
> 
> Not all types of curiosity are going to help you be an effective listener. Psychologists have distinguished two types of curiosity, only one of which is helpful.
> 
>   1. **Negative curiosity** is born out of the need to reduce uncertainty. This arises in situations where an important piece of information is missing: For example, not knowing whether your symptoms are the result of a serious disease. Negative curiosity feels uncomfortable and is alleviated by the discovery of new information.
> 

>   1. **Positive curiosity** is intrinsically motivated and born out of the enjoyment of discovering new things. For example, you may decide to spend an afternoon watching documentaries about cuttlefish. This type of curiosity is _stimulated,_ rather than alleviated _,_ by new information. In other words, the more you learn, the more curious you become. Positive curiosity will help you become a better listener because it is inexhaustible. You can cultivate positive curiosity while listening to others by focusing on your _intrinsic desire_ to learn about people. 
> 


##### 2) Notice Your Own Thoughts and Feelings

Furthermore, Murphy recommends that **you notice your _own_ thoughts and feelings while listening to someone.** For example, you may feel under attack if someone's views contradict yours. This could lead you to react with anger or disgust instead of curiosity. By paying attention to yourself, you can notice these emotional responses and choose to stay curious.

(Shortform note: You can pay attention to yourself more effectively by understanding your _emotional triggers_. Psychologists assert that people have "buttons'' that trigger emotional responses that are disproportionate to the scenario. These are often the result of past traumas—reservoirs of intense emotion that can be triggered in ordinary situations. Some psychologists recommend that you begin by _identifying_ your triggers. When was the last time you reacted strongly to something someone said? Is there anything in your past that may have shaped this response?)

#### Suggestion #2: Respond in Ways That Encourage Sharing

Murphy states that **you can become a more effective listener through your responses to the person speaking**. Specifically, she recommends finding responses that encourage the speaker to continue sharing. In this section, we'll explore nonverbal and verbal responses that can encourage a speaker to share.

##### 1) Nonverbal Responses That Encourage Sharing

To start, Murphy recommends that you **adjust your nonverbal communication to show you are listening.** Maintaining strong eye contact and a relaxed posture comes across as inviting and encourages sharing.

Also, allow for pauses in the conversation instead of speaking as soon as the other person stops. This gives the other person time to get their whole thought across—which is important because people often don’t say exactly what they mean on their first try. Additionally, encountering a pause often prompts a speaker to elaborate on their point, sharing details they may not have shared otherwise.

(Shortform note: While you're making eye contact and allowing pauses, make sure that the rest of your body is sending the right signals. Body language experts extend Murphy’s advice, explaining that mirroring a person's emotions signals active listening. So if someone tells a sad story, it would signal a lack of understanding if your facial expressions reflect delight instead of sadness. During pauses, you can also lean in slightly to clearly hear what someone is saying. Finally, avoid fidgeting with nearby objects or squirming in your chair, as these actions signal boredom and discomfort, even if you’re making strong eye contact.)

##### 2) Verbal Responses That Encourage Sharing

Murphy identifies two types of responses that encourage sharing: open-ended questions, and assisting responses.

**Open-ended questions allow the speaker to direct the conversation** —in contrast to closed-ended questions that steer the conversation in a particular direction. By asking open-ended questions, you can encourage the other person to speak freely about whatever they want.

For example, if someone tells you about getting lost while traveling abroad, you could ask an open-ended question like, "How did you react?" instead of a closed question like, “Did you have a map?” The first question allows the speaker to choose the direction of the conversation, while the second one narrows the conversation to a detail chosen by the listener.

**Assisting responses encourage and help the speaker in sharing.** We assist someone in sharing when we ask questions that encourage them to elaborate on what’s most important to them. Murphy contrasts this with a redirecting response, which steers the conversation away from what they're trying to share.

For example, someone tells you they've recently gotten into mountain biking. An assisting response would encourage them to talk more about their new hobby, like, "How did you get into mountain biking?” or, “Where do you like to ride?" A redirecting response would steer the conversation away from what they'd like to share, like, "I've never really liked outdoor sports. I prefer crossword puzzles."

(Shortform note: In addition to allowing the speaker to feel heard, open-ended and assisting questions give the speaker a sense of _control_. When someone can direct the conversation as they see fit, they’re more likely to feel a sense of personal agency and empowerment. In _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Voss explains that maintaining the speaker's sense of control is crucial for effective negotiations. If someone feels a lack of control, they may become _defensive_ and thus more reluctant to accept your offer or continue the conversation. We can extrapolate this from negotiations to ordinary conversations. Someone who feels out of control in a conversation may also be reluctant to continue sharing and open up to you. This would undermine the benefits of effective listening, such as building trust and connection.)

#### Suggestion #3: Pay Close Attention to the Speaker

You can also become a more effective listener by **paying close attention to the person speaking.** Murphy states that you’ll notice much more about what they’re communicating. Speakers reveal a lot through nonverbal communication and word choice. By paying attention to more than their words, you can learn how the speaker is feeling and why they want to share something.

> **How to Read Body Language**
> 
> Body language experts extend Murphy's advice with specific clues to look for in a person's body language to better understand their feelings and intentions. In _What Every Body Is Saying_ , Joe Navarro recommends paying close attention to a person's feet. People often point their feet away from situations that make them uncomfortable. If someone points their feet toward you during a conversation, this could signal their comfort with you. However, if one foot is pointed toward the door, this could indicate a readiness to leave.
> 
> That said, Navarro cautions you against inferring too much about the body posture of someone you just met. He recommends observing someone first to understand their "baseline"—or default—body language. Once you know what’s normal for someone, you’ll be better equipped to spot deviations from their baseline that reveal the most about their emotional state.

##### Optimize Your Attention: Resist Distractions

To pay close attention, **Murphy stresses** **the importance of resisting distractions.** If you're mainly distracted by external things, you can alter your environment to minimize the potential for distractions. For example, if you know your phone will be a distraction, you can turn it off. If you're mainly distracted by internal things, such as boredom, you'll have to be aware of this tendency and _choose_ to pay attention to the speaker.

Murphy suggests that when you do get distracted, you should ask the other person to repeat themselves. While it may feel uncomfortable to admit you became distracted, the repetition ensures that you understand them more than if you just guess what they said based on context.

(Shortform note: It's a good idea to start strengthening your ability to resist distractions now because researchers have found that this ability may get weaker with age. This happens because focusing requires two separate neurological systems. One system pays attention to the task. The other system suppresses and ignores irrelevant stimuli. People have a harder time focusing as they age because the system for ignoring and repressing irrelevant stimuli becomes weaker. You can counteract this by reducing distracting stimuli, such as decluttering your home.)

#### Suggestion #4: Be Aware of Your Limitations

Lastly, Murphy recommends that **listening effectively requires you to understand your limitations and emotional capacity.** Attention is a finite resource, and paying close attention to someone drains people too much to do it _all_ the time. Your life will also involve time-sensitive obligations that may be more important in the moment than listening.

If you try to listen when you don’t have the time or emotional energy to listen, you won’t listen _effectively_. The other person will notice this and won’t feel understood, and neither of you will feel connected. Instead of trying to simply power through your limits, you should set boundaries for yourself by giving yourself permission to postpone or altogether avoid listening when necessary.

(Shortform note: In maintaining your emotional capacity, many psychologists recommend making a regular practice of checking in with your emotions. They argue that you don't suddenly exhaust yourself all at once, but that you deplete your emotional energy _gradually_. Therefore, by regularly checking in with your emotions, you can recognize when you're running low on energy and give yourself short breaks before hitting a wall.)
