## Exercise: Develop Your Effective Listening Skills

This exercise provides a chance to develop your effective listening skills using Murphy's strategies and advice.

* * *

Think of a time when you wish you’d listened more effectively. Which obstacle do you think was getting in the way and why? Recall that the main obstacles are: distractions, discomfort, a self-focused culture, and making assumptions.

Murphy states that we often fail to listen effectively to family, friends, and loved ones because we presume that we’ve nothing new to learn from them. Who is someone in your life you’d like to listen to more effectively? What can you do the next time you talk to them to listen more effectively?

Murphy explains that technological distractions prevent people from listening effectively. How could you limit your technology distractions the next time you have a conversation with someone?

Murphy provides three major pieces of advice for improving listening skills: staying curious about the person you're talking to, responding in ways that encourage sharing, and paying closer attention. Which of these pieces of advice could benefit you the most right now and why?
