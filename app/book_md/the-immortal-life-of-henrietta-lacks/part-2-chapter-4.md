## Part 2 | Chapter 4: Lacks’s Funeral and the Growth of Her Children

Upon learning that Henrietta had passed, George Gey asked Henrietta’s doctors to perform an autopsy in the hope of extracting more “immortal” cells. But, whereas doctors could take cell samples from a living patient without permission, autopsies and extracting tissue from the dead _did_ require permission. At first Day denied the doctors that permission, but he eventually relented.

The pathologist removed many of Henrietta’s organs, including her bladder, uterus, appendix, and heart; **many of these organs were covered in tumors**. The official cause of death was terminal uremia (blood poisoning): Tumors had entirely blocked Henrietta’s urethra, preventing her from passing urine and doctors from inserting a catheter.

Henrietta was buried in Clover. It rained for days leading up to her funeral, and on the day she was buried, as soon as her coffin was lowered into her grave behind the home-house, the sky turned black and a massive gust of wind tore the metal roof of a barn and sent it flying above Henrietta’s grave. The wind was so strong, according to the Lacks cousins that attended the funeral, that it tore one cousin’s cabin out of the ground, killing the cousin inside.

After Henrietta passed, Galen, Henrietta’s cousin, and his wife Ethel moved into the Lacks house in Turner Station to help take care of the children. At the time of Henrietta’s death, there were three children under the age of four—Sonny, Deborah, and Joe—and Lawrence, who was a teenager. (There was also Elsie, Lawrence’s younger sister, who had been institutionalized.)

It was known among the Lacks cousins that Ethel was jealous of Henrietta—Galen reportedly had much preferred Henrietta to Ethel—**and Ethel proceeded to take out her anger at Henrietta on Henrietta’s children**. Ethel’s abuse took many forms: She starved them, forced them to perform hard labor, and beat them with whatever was at hand—extension cords, shoes, or her fists. Joe, the youngest, received the worst of it. Ethel would tie him up and leave him in the basement for hours on end, even overnight, with instructions to stand on one foot. If she came downstairs and one foot wasn’t in the air, she would whip him.

Lawrence, meanwhile, though only 16, had been drafted into the military (he’d lied about his age to get into the local pool halls, but that lie also made him eligible for the draft). When he returned in 1953, he moved into his own house and so had no idea what Ethel was doing to his siblings. Day, too, was either unaware or in denial—rumor had it he was sleeping with Ethel.

In 1959, Lawrence moved in with his girlfriend, Bobbette Cooper, and she demanded that Lawrence’s siblings come live with them. This saved the boys from Ethel but didn’t save Deborah from Galen, who had begun touching her inappropriately. Deborah was only ten years old at the time, and she saw Galen as a surrogate father (Day was working two jobs, and Deborah felt closer to Galen than Day).

One day, when Deborah was 12, she was walking with a friend named Alfred “Cheetah” Carter when Galen pulled up in his car. He demanded that she get in the car with him. When she refused, he sped off. Soon he returned with Day in the passenger seat. **Galen got out of the car, calling Deborah a “whore,” and threw her in the back seat of the car. Once she was in, he punched her in the face, splitting her eyebrow**. Day just sat there.

When Deborah got back to Bobbette and Lawrence’s, Bobbette forced Deborah to tell her what had happened. Deborah told Bobbette that Galen had hit her and that he said inappropriate things to her, but she omitted the fact that he had molested her (she feared that Bobbette would kill Galen if she knew). **Bobbette immediately went to Galen and Ethel’s house and threatened to kill them if either of them touched a Lacks child again**.

Bobbette also told Deborah to fight off her cousins if they ever tried to have sex with her and to wait until she was an adult before she had babies. As Deborah grew, her male cousins _did_ assault her, but she managed to fight them off.

Bobbette believed that Deborah’s sister Elsie’s disability might have had something to do with the fact that Day and Henrietta were first cousins. (All of the Lacks children suffered from hearing loss, which Bobbette also attributed to Day and Henrietta’s relation.) Deborah had long been disturbed by what had happened to her sister: For much of her childhood, Deborah hadn’t even known of Elsie’s existence; and when Day did tell her about Elsie, Deborah was afraid her sister, on account of her ignorance of sign language, had been abused and had no way to tell anyone.
