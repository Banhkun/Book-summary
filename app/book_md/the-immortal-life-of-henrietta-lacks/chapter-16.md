## Chapter 16: Meeting the Lackses

On New Year’s Day 2000, two months after Skloot initially went to Baltimore to meet Sonny Lacks and he turned her down, Skloot was finally able to meet the Lacks men.

The first Lacks she met was Sonny, who picked her up at her hotel to bring her to Lawrence’s. He was about 5’9”, with a manicured mustache and a kind affect.

In the car, Sonny told Skloot that he didn’t remember his mother; everything he knew he’d learned second-hand. He’d been told she was “nice” and attractive and a good cook. And he knew that her cells had played a role in medical advances like the vaccine for polio.

Sonny brought Skloot to Lawrence’s but didn’t come inside—he drove off immediately after Skloot exited the car. Inside Lawrence’s, Skloot found Lawrence cooking pork chops. He was six feet tall and close to 300 pounds.

Skloot accepted Lawrence’s offer of food, and while he cooked, he told Skloot about life in Clover and tobacco farming. Whenever Skloot brought up Henrietta, Lawrence changed the subject. **Finally, he admitted that he’d repressed his memories of his mother** , and that the only thing he remembered about her was that she was strict with him.

They sat at a table in the living room, and Lawrence described what he knew about his mother’s cells. His understanding was that they were still growing, and he thought they would be turned into a serum that would allow a human being to live until he or she was 800 years old. When it became apparent that Lawrence didn’t know exactly what a cell was, Skloot explained it to him.

In the middle of their conversation, Sonny returned—with Day. Day was silver-haired and wrinkled with age, and he was forced to wear sandals due to gangrene in his toes. The doctors wanted to amputate the affected toes because the gangrene was spreading, but Day refused on account of what the doctors had done to his wife. Sonny, too, needed an operation but was set against it for the same reason. While the Lacks men and Skloot were talking, Bobbette, Lawrence’s wife, descended the stairs and walked past everyone into the kitchen without saying a word.

Presently Sonny handed Day Skloot’s tape recorder and told him to say what he knew about his wife. Rather than talk about Henrietta’s life, however, Day told the story of the day he went to Hopkins and signed off on Henrietta’s autopsy. **He said that no one told him anything about keeping her cells alive** ; the doctors only said that, by performing the autopsy, they might be able to save Day’s children and grandchildren from cancer.

As Day spoke, Sonny and Bobbette chimed in, expressing their skepticism of the doctors’ intentions. According to them, Hopkins was known for experimenting on African Americans during that time, even going so far as to abduct them. **Bobbette told Skloot that, as a child, she was forbidden from going near Hopkins after dark for fear of being kidnapped**.

### Hopkins in its Community

Unfortunately, Bobbette’s fears reflected the historical and sometimes monstrous mistreatment of African Americans by the American medical establishment.

Since the early 19th century, African Americans had traded tales of “night doctors” who would abduct people in the middle of the night for gruesome experiments. These tales weren’t just the product of superstition: **During slavery, doctors _would_ in fact test new drugs or surgical procedures—the latter without anesthesia—on slaves**.

Later, in the early twentieth century, deceased African Americans were exhumed from their graves and sent north to medical schools desperate for cadavers to study. Hence the belief among African-American Baltimoreans that Hopkins was built among poor black people to have easy access to research subjects.

**The irony was that Johns Hopkins Hospital was founded to help poor people and especially African Americans**. Johns Hopkins’s father, a Maryland plantation owner, freed his slaves long before emancipation, and Johns Hopkins himself donated $7 million of his fortune to establish a medical school and charity hospital. In letters to the trustees he’d chosen for the board of the hospital, he mandated that the hospital treat those who couldn’t otherwise afford medical care and set aside funds for the express purpose of serving orphaned African-American children.

Despite its founding mission, Hopkins did indeed, at various times, breach the trust of the community it was meant to serve. In 1969, a researcher examined blood samples from 7,000 neighborhood children without consent in an effort to determine whether there was a gene for criminality. **And in the ’90s, researchers intentionally exposed black children to lead to study lead-abatement techniques**.

**The gravest offense of all, however, according to black Baltimoreans, was how the doctors at Hopkins had exploited Henrietta Lacks**. The Lacks family, for their part, were furious over and devastated by how they’d been treated. They told Skloot that they were given no information about what was happening with Henrietta’s cells and hadn’t been compensated. (Even though Hopkins had said on numerous occasions they’d given the cells away, the family suspected that the hospital had turned a profit.) **That Henrietta’s cells had played such an outsize role in medical advances was especially painful given that the Lackses themselves were in poor health and could only afford insurance intermittently**.
