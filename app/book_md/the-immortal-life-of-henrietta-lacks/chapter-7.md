## Chapter 7: HeLa and Controversies in Cell Culture

By the time Southam’s and Mandel’s licenses were being reviewed, HeLa cells—and cell cultures—were ubiquitous. **HeLa cells accompanied both Russian and American astronauts into space (scientists wanted to study the effects of space travel on human cells)**. The magazine _Scientific American_ even offered readers instructions on how to culture HeLa cells at home!

HeLa cells were also the impetus for major institutional changes in the way cell cultures were handled. By the 1960s, scientists had begun culturing all sorts of cells from all sorts of species and organs. But despite this diversity of origin, researchers discovered that these cultured cells all met the same end: They either died or spontaneously turned cancerous. **And when they turned cancerous, they behaved exactly like HeLa**.

A group of major cancer researchers suspected that the reason for this behavior was that the cell cultures were being contaminated somehow, potentially with HeLa cells. This suspicion spurred the NIH to form a Cell Culture Collection Committee (CCCC), which eventually led to the creation of a state-of-the-art cell bank that held uncontaminated samples of cells from their original source. The first deposit was an immortal mouse cell. The second was HeLa.

At the same time that the CCCC was working to identify and preserve unadulterated cells, researchers were stretching the limits of what cells could do in culture.

One especially controversial advance was the development of human-animal hybrid cells. Scientists had discovered that cells could be made to fuse in culture—that is, they would combine their genetic material, much like sperm fertilizes an egg. **In 1965, two British researchers successfully fused HeLa cells with mouse cells**.

The sensational newspaper headlines predicting hideous mouse people notwithstanding, the hybridization of human and animal cells resulted in significant advances in our knowledge of how genes work. Researchers discovered that, as time went on, the human-mouse hybrid cells would lose their human chromosomes. This behavior enabled researchers to track which chromosomes corresponded to which cell traits (because when a certain cell trait disappeared, researchers could correlate that disappearance to a lost chromosome).
