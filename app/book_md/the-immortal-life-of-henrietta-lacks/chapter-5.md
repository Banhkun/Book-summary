## Chapter 5: HeLa and Polio

The first major use of HeLa cells was in the fight against polio.

Jonas Salk announced his polio vaccine in 1952, but he couldn’t judge its effectiveness until it had been tested on a massive scale. The National Foundation of Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) developed a trial—it would inoculate 2 million children with Salk’s vaccine and then test the children’s blood for immunity.

To test for immunity, the children’s blood would have to be mixed with cells infected with poliovirus. In the past, these cells came from monkeys, but the extraction procedure killed the monkeys and monkeys were expensive. (Animal rights activism wasn’t as prominent in the 1950s as it is today.)

The NFIP contacted George Gey, who had discovered that HeLa cells could grow “in suspension”—that is, unlike previous cell cultures, which needed a glass surface to adhere to, HeLa cells could grow floating in a culture medium as long as they were continually stirred. **This meant that they could grow in large vessels as long as there was ample medium**.

Once Gey and a colleague from NFIP determined that HeLa cells were in fact susceptible to poliovirus—some cells were naturally resistant—the colleague was tasked with overseeing an industrial-level operation for growing HeLa cells. **This operation was to be housed at the Tuskegee Institute, the renowned black university** ; the location had been advocated for by Charles Bynum, an executive of the NFIP, who was a science teacher and one of the first black foundation executives in the country.

In a matter of months, the HeLa Distribution Center was up and running. The operation began with six black scientists and technicians, but the staff eventually grew to 35, many of whom were women. **The Center produced 20,000 tubes of HeLa cells—6 trillion total cells—a week** , and those cells showed Salk’s vaccine to be effective. Ironically, at the same time that black scientists on Tuskegee’s campus were helping the American fight against polio, black Americans suffering from syphilis were being allowed to die on the same campus.

> **The Tuskegee Syphilis Study**
> 
> In the 1930s, US Public Health researchers at the Tuskegee Institute were curious about exactly how syphilis killed its carriers. To track the progression of syphilis in the human body, the researchers lured hundreds of syphilitic African-American men to participate in the study with free exams and meals, as well as a burial stipend for their families for when they passed away. These men were largely poor and uneducated, and their deaths were slow, painful, and entirely preventable: The doctors at the time knew that penicillin could cure them.

### Beyond Polio

Once the scientists at the Distribution Center realized there would be no shortage of HeLa cells for the polio study, they began to send the cells more widely and for a variety of studies.

HeLa cells were especially valuable for the study of viruses. Viruses reproduce by modifying the genetic material of the infected cell, and because HeLa cells grew so rapidly, scientists were able to observe viruses’ effects at an accelerated rate.

Using HeLa cells, scientists made a number of advances in a relatively brief period of time, including:

  * The development of a method for freezing cells without damaging them, which allowed researchers to “pause” the processes they were studying and then restart them without any effect on the cell;
  * The standardization of the field of tissue culture, which enabled researchers around the world to grow cells in their laboratories consistently and efficiently;
  * The discovery of a method for _cloning_ cells (HeLa cells grew from a sample of Henrietta’s tissue, and so were cultivated from a _cluster_ of cells rather than one specific cell; cloning allowed scientists to study the behavior of a specific cell in a variety of situations); and
  * The direct observation and accurate counting of chromosomes in a human cell (prior to 1953, scientists believed human cells had 48 chromosomes rather than 46; the confirmation of the correct count allowed scientists to determine the etiology of diseases like Down syndrome and Turner syndrome).



HeLa cells were exposed to high levels of radiation to explore the cellular effects of nuclear fallout—it was the era of the Cold War—and placed in centrifuges to simulate high- and low-gravity. They were also used by cosmetics manufacturers to test their products.

In its effort to standardize the recipe for culture medium and instructions for handling cell cultures, Gey’s lab partnered with a small biological supply company named Microbiological Associates. That company would become the first for-profit cell distribution firm, shipping out HeLa cells for less than 50 dollars a vial to customers like the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

Before long, the Tuskegee Center closed up shop, rendered obsolete by private, for-profit companies selling HeLa cells. And Gey, too, moved on from HeLa, attempting to culture cells from different patients. Intermittently, Gey lamented that HeLa cells had spread so widely—he’d failed to lay claim to his discovery by neglecting to publish his research and by sharing the strain so readily—but HeLa’s spread was well beyond his control.

Naturally, given HeLa cells’ ubiquity and their central role in medical research, journalists began to grow curious about the _person_ from whom the cells were taken. Although no laws governed the release of Henrietta’s name to the press, Gey, Howard Jones, and the rest of Henrietta’s medical team at Hopkins resolved not to reveal her real name to the public—they reasoned that compelling human stories could be written using a fictitious name. A 1953 newspaper article erroneously referred to the patient as Henrietta Lakes, a mistake Gey didn’t correct. He also used a pseudonym for Henrietta when he was interviewed in 1954: “Helen L.” Eventually, though no one’s quite sure how, the name most commonly associated with HeLa cells became “Helen Lane.”

Thus Henrietta’s family, because Henrietta’s real name never appeared in any of the press surrounding the cells, were completely unaware that her cells were still living.
