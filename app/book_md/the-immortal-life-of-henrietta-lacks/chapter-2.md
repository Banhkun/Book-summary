## Chapter 2: Diagnosis and Initial Treatment

In 1950, before she became pregnant with her fifth child, Joseph, Henrietta told two cousins that she felt a “knot” in her abdomen. Although the relatives suggested Henrietta see a doctor, she didn’t end up going. One of the relatives believed Henrietta didn’t go because she was afraid the doctor would remove her womb and prevent her from having more children. Shortly after Henrietta confided in her relatives, she became pregnant, and talk about the knot faded.

Four and a half months after Joseph was born, however, Henrietta discovered blood in her underwear. She ran a hot bath and performed a self-examination on her cervix. She found a lump next to the opening of her womb.

She told Day that she was bleeding but wasn’t menstruating, and he took her to see a local doctor. At first the doctor thought the lump was syphilis, but the syphilis test came back negative. The doctor recommended Henrietta visit the Johns Hopkins gynecology clinic.

Johns Hopkins had been founded as a charity hospital in 1889. By the 1950s, it was one of the most admired hospitals in the country. It was located in East Baltimore, and its public wards reflected its community: **Most of the patients were poor African-Americans unable to pay for medical care. The hospital was also segregated, with black patients confined to colored wards**.

(Shortform note: Skloot uses the terminology of the historical moments she’s describing. When her interview subjects use outdated terms like “colored,” she echoes their usage.)

Henrietta visited Johns Hopkins, where she was seen by a gynecologist named Howard Jones. Jones discovered in Lacks’s medical history an array of un- or undertreated illnesses, including asymptomatic neurosyphilis and gonorrhea. There was also abnormal vaginal bleeding and blood in Henrietta’s urine after her last two pregnancies.

Upon examining Henrietta, Jones quickly located the lump, whose color and consistency was unlike any other lesion he’d seen (he described it in his notes as “grape Jello”) Even though Joseph had been delivered at Hopkins scant months before, no one had noted any sort of cervical abnormality, either upon delivery or at Henrietta’s six-week checkup. **Which meant the lump had grown exponentially in just three months**.

A few days later, Jones received Henrietta’s biopsy results. **The pathologists had found Stage 1 epidermoid carcinoma**.

### Hopkins: A Hub of Cancer Research

Coincidentally, Jones and his superior, an internationally renowned gynecologist named Richard Wesley TeLinde, were currently researching cervical cancer. TeLinde had become a controversial figure among gynecologists due to his aggressive treatment of “noninvasive” carcinomas, which are carcinomas that grow on the surface of the cervix (carcinomas that penetrate the cervix are “invasive”). Whereas most gynecologists in the field believed noninvasive carcinomas (or “carcinoma in situ”) would stay on the surface of the cervix and remain nonfatal, TeLinde believed noninvasive carcinomas could _become_ invasive, and so he often treated them by removing the cervix, uterus, and part of the vagina.

Part of the reason there was disagreement about how to treat noninvasive carcinoma was that it was a relatively new field. Only ten years before Henrietta Lacks saw Howard Jones, a Greek researcher named George Papanicolaou had developed a test—now known as a Pap smear—that enabled doctors to diagnose carcinoma in situ.

Determined to prove that carcinoma in situ could morph into invasive carcinoma, TeLinde embarked on an ambitious study around the time Henrietta first visited Hopkins: He and his team compiled and reviewed the medical records of every Hopkins patient in the past ten years that had been diagnosed with invasive carcinoma to see if noninvasive carcinomas had been present first. **Many of the patients in the study were included without their consent: The logic was that patients being treated for free in the public wards—largely African-Americans—“paid” for their treatment by being available to researchers as subjects (again, without their knowledge)**.

TeLinde’s study found that 62% of patients diagnosed with invasive cancer had tested positive for carcinoma in situ first, proving his hunch correct. But he wanted to seal his argument by comparing healthy cervical cells with both invasive and noninvasive carcinoma cells. If he proved that invasive and noninvasive carcinoma cells behaved similarly in the laboratory, he would have an open-and-shut case for _treating_ them similarly as well. So he cut a deal with a tissue researcher at Hopkins named George Gey (pronounced like “guy”): If TeLinde provided Gey with tissue samples to experiment with, Gey would try to grow them in the lab he operated alongside his wife, a surgical nurse named Margaret.

### Henrietta’s Cells Excised

**Henrietta, unbeknownst to her, became one of TeLinde’s and the Geys’ subjects**. When she returned to the hospital after receiving her diagnosis—rather than tell Day or her family that she’d been diagnosed with a malignant tumor, she simply told them the doctors needed to evaluate her and give her some medicine—she signed a consent form to be operated on, was subjected to a battery of tests, and eventually treated with radium, the gold standard for cancer treatment at the time. (It was later discovered to cause cancer itself.) **Before her surgeon applied the radium to her cervix, however, he took a small sample of both healthy tissue and cancerous tissue and sent it off to the Geys’ lab**.

There, a lab assistant put Henrietta’s tissue samples into test tubes designed by George Gey himself. The tubes were specially made to fit in a cylindrical roller drum that would rotate extremely slowly—two or fewer revolutions per hour. The thinking was that cell cultures needed to be in constant motion, like blood and other fluids in the human body, in order for the cells to replicate. The Geys had also experimented with culture media, using everything from chicken plasma to umbilical-cord blood in an attempt to get cells to grow; and Margaret, drawing on her experience in surgical theaters, had instituted strict guidelines for keeping the lab sterile. There was no set method for growing cells in the lab, because no researcher had been able to keep cells alive in culture for more than brief periods.

**Henrietta’s cancer cells—labeled “HeLa” cells according to the lab’s sample-naming protocol— however, not only survived, they prospered**. (Her healthy cells died after a few days.) The number of cells doubled every 24 hours, forcing the lab assistant to divide them into ever greater numbers of test tubes.

Henrietta, meanwhile, was recovering from her radium treatment. After two days in the hospital, the radium plaques that had been affixed to her cervix were removed, and she was sent home with instructions to return in two and a half weeks for a second treatment.

At first, the radium seemed to have worked. When Henrietta returned to Hopkins for her follow-up treatment, the doctors saw that the tumor had shrunk. And after her second radium treatment, the tumor completely vanished. The doctors were confident enough in her full recovery that they fixed some minor ailments that had been bothering her, for example a deviated septum that had affected Henrietta almost her entire life. Nevertheless, the doctors started Henrietta on X-ray therapy to ensure that they’d killed all the cancer cells.

About two weeks after her second radium treatment, Henrietta began menstruating heavily, and the bleeding wouldn’t stop. She was still bleeding when she began radiation. The bleeding ceased with the radiation, and, incredibly, she seemed not to experience any of radiation therapy’s side-effects (nausea, fatigue). During this stretch of time, Day, whom Henrietta still hadn’t told about the cancer, would drop her off at Hopkins in the morning, then go to work; after her treatment, Henrietta would go to her cousin Margaret’s house to wait for Day to finish his shift and take her home. (Henrietta _had_ told Margaret.)

Near the end of her month of radiation, Henrietta asked her doctor when she would be well enough to have children again. Hopkins protocol was to notify patients that cancer treatment often led to infertility, but it seemed, in Henrietta’s case, the warning wasn’t given. **Her medical record quotes her as saying that if she’d known the treatments would make her infertile, she wouldn’t have gone through with them**. Henrietta loved her children deeply, and it had pained her to have to give up Elsie to an institution.

There were other physical complications as well. After three weeks of radiation, Henrietta complained of severe pain while urinating, and Day noticed a discharge of his own (which he blamed on Henrietta’s “sickness”). The culprit was gonorrhea; and Howard Jones, Henrietta’s gynecologist, opined that Day had likely given it to _her_. **The radiation had also burned the skin of Henrietta’s abdomen black**.
