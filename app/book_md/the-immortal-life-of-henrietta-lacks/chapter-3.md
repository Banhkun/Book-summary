## Chapter 3: Cells in Culture and Lacks’s Death

HeLa cells were unlike anything scientists had seen previously. **They were truly “immortal”—properly cultured, HeLa cells would grow indefinitely**.

The discovery of HeLa came at an important time in the history of cell science. Five years before Henrietta’s cancer cells thrived in Gey’s laboratory, a scandal had come to light involving a Nobel Prize–winning French surgeon named Alexis Carrel.

Although Carrel had won his Nobel for inventing a technique for suturing blood vessels, his notoriety was largely due to his breakthrough in the field of cell culture: He’d managed to maintain living chicken-heart cells in his laboratory.

This feat was greeted with all sorts of hyperbole: that Carrel had found the fountain of youth, that cell culture would lead humans to uncover the secrets to artistic and scientific genius.

Carrel himself, however, wasn’t much interested in the advancement of all humanity. He was a eugenicist and Nazi sympathizer, and he believed his work with cells would allow whites to outlive inferior peoples.

He was also an eccentric who, despite his scientific acumen, entertained mystical and occult beliefs. He thought telepathy and clairvoyance were real; and he turned his apartment into a house of worship, where he would give sermons on medical miracles.

And, as it turned out, he was a charlatan. After he died in 1944 awaiting trial for collaborating with the Nazis, it was discovered that his “immortal” chicken heart wasn’t immortal at all: **The original chicken-heart tissue had likely died within days, and Carrel’s culture medium, which itself contained chicken-heart tissues, gave the culture the _appearance_ of everlasting cells**.

HeLa cells, on the contrary, were the genuine article. Once Gey made his discovery, he began sending the cells to any cancer researcher who asked for them. **In short order, Henrietta’s cells reached scientists in Asia, Europe, and South America**.

### The Two Sides of HeLa

Of course, the cells’ resiliency, which made them so valuable to researchers, was less welcome in terms of Henrietta’s health. According to Henrietta’s doctors, the radium and X-ray treatments had rid her of cancer; yet she maintained the cancer was spreading: She said she could _feel_ it. She returned to the hospital twice, first with abdominal discomfort, then with an ache along her sides, but the doctors sent her home each time, writing in her record that there was no evidence that her cancer had come back.

(Latter-day research has shown that **African-American patients** were treated differently from white ones at the time Lacks was under medical care: They **were admitted to hospitals at later stages of illness than their white counterparts, and when they _were_ finally hospitalized, they received less pain medication and had higher mortality rates**. Henrietta’s doctor says Henrietta received the same care as white patients of the time, but it’s impossible to know for sure.)

A matter of weeks after her second visit, when she’d complained of an ache and the doctors sent her home, Henrietta returned to the hospital with sharp pain in her abdomen and difficulty urinating. A doctor administered a catheter to help her urinate and again sent her home. Two days later she was back, again with pain, and the doctor on duty felt a hard mass when he pressed on her belly. An X-ray revealed a tumor attached to her pelvic wall. **When Howard Jones arrived, he declared the tumor terminal and sent Henrietta home to bed**.

Shortly thereafter, one week after her 31st birthday, Henrietta was admitted to the hospital. At home she’d suffered from such severe pain that she screamed for God to help her; **at her intervening appointments, doctors had discovered tumors on her uterus, urethra, and both kidneys**.

She was again treated with radiation, not to cure her but rather to shrink the tumors and ease her pain. It didn’t work. She was also given powerful pain medications, including morphine, but these too were ineffective. Despite the radiation, tumors continued to appear in various parts of her body, her lymph nodes and hip bones among others. A doctor also harvested a tissue sample from her during this time, but her difficulty urinating had increased the toxicity of her body so significantly that her cancer cells were no longer viable in culture.

Day and the children came to visit at first, but the nurses soon told the family that it made Henrietta too upset—she would weep for hours after her family left. Day and the children took to playing on the lawn outside Henrietta’s window so she could watch them.

According to all but one of Skloot’s sources, George Gey never met Henrietta and didn’t come see her while she was dying. One colleague of Gey, however, remembers Gey visiting Henrietta and telling Henrietta that her cells would live on after she died and help save countless lives.

Henrietta died in October 1951. **In the two months she was in the hospital, tumors had colonized her body, appearing as high as her diaphragm and lungs, and she’d needed constant blood transfusions because her kidneys were failing**. The pain was tremendous. Her last words were to her sister Gladys. She implored her to make sure Day took care of the children.
