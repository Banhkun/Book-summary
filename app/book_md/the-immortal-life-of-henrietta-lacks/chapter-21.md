## Chapter 21: Recovery and Tragedy

The day Deborah left the hospital was Skloot’s birthday. Deborah called Skloot and left a calmly delivered message letting her know she’d had a stroke and wouldn’t be able to meet Skloot in Clover, as they’d planned. Though she wasn’t yet fully recovered, the doctors believed she would eventually regain full function.

Deborah told Skloot that her doctor had told her she needed to learn to control her blood pressure and blood sugar;**otherwise, a second stroke, which would likely be worse than the first, was probable**. Deborah took the doctor’s advice as another sign she needed to go back to school: She could take a nutrition class to learn how to eat healthily.

**Unfortunately, the obstacle to Deborah’s returning to school wasn’t her health or drive but poverty** : Her social security benefits simply weren’t enough to cover both her living expenses and classes and books. Eventually she set aside her own dreams of higher education and began concentrating on making sure her own and her siblings’ grandchildren had the opportunities she and her siblings hadn’t.

Shortly after Deborah’s discharge from the hospital, Skloot joined her at her church to watch the baptism of Sonny’s nine-month-old granddaughter. Pullum was the preacher that day, and almost as soon as the service began, he called Skloot to the pulpit. Surprised and nervous, Skloot resisted, but Pullum compelled her to join him.

**Once she stood beside him, Pullum announced that Skloot was going to tell the congregation what happened with Henrietta, Johns Hopkins, and Henrietta’s children**. Skloot did just that, gaining confidence as the congregation answered her speech with “Amen” and “Hallelujah.” When Pullum took back the microphone, he said that Henrietta’s story was no longer about her children, but her _children’s_ children—the baby being baptized that day, Davon, and the rest of Henrietta’s grandchildren.

### Deborah’s Final Days

In 2009, eight years after Deborah’s stroke, Skloot drove to Clover. When she got there, she found she was disoriented—the road into town seemed longer than it had the last time she visited. All of a sudden she realized what had happened: **The town had been razed**. She collected some of the debris from the vanished houses to give to Deborah.

Skloot hadn’t been in touch with Deborah for months, though Skloot had called her a number of times. In the years since the baptism, the Lackses had endured considerable hardship: Sonny had a quintuple bypass without insurance, a surgery that landed him $125,000 in debt; Zakariyya had been expelled from his assisted-living facility and a Section Eight housing project, the latter because he struck a woman with a forty-ounce beer bottle; and Deborah had divorced Pullum and moved into an assisted-living facility herself. **In 2006, when Deborah’s divorce was finalized, she had no money in her checking account, and her entire monthly income was $742: $732 from social security and $10 in food stamps**.

When Skloot returned from Clover, she called Deborah again and found her voicemail box full. Clover’s disappearance was too important to wait, so Skloot called Sonny. She announced herself, and Sonny said that he’d been searching for her phone number. Immediately Skloot knew that Deborah had died. Sonny told her the story. About a week before, Sonny had gone over to check on Deborah when she didn’t answer a call from Davon. He’d found her in bed, smiling, dead from a heart attack. It was just a few days after Mother’s Day.

The last time Skloot had seen Deborah, she’d made Skloot and Davon watch _Roots_ and _Spirit_ , an animated film about a wild horse, back to back. She wanted them to see the similarities between Kunta Kinte and Spirit, how they both fought for their freedom.

When the films were done, Deborah played one of the tapes of unaired footage from the BBC documentary on her mother. A much younger Deborah appeared on the TV screen with her mother’s bible in her lap. Deborah kept a long lock of her mother’s hair in the bible—the lock of hair and the bible were all Deborah had of her mother—and Deborah stroked it as she spoke into the camera. The young Deborah on screen said that Henrietta had been watching all that had happened with her cells, so that when Deborah died, she wouldn’t need to fill her in on anything.

Watching the screen, Deborah wondered aloud to Skloot and Davon whether, when she died, she would come back as some HeLa cells, so she and her mother could help people in the world together.
