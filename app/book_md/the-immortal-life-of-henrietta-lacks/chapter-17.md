## Chapter 17: Chasing Deborah

Although Skloot had already met many of Henrietta’s relatives and descendants, it would take almost a year for Deborah to consent to meeting Skloot. **During that time, Skloot would call Deborah regularly, leaving messages that described the aspects of Henrietta’s life she was uncovering through her research and reporting**.

Finally, in July of 2000, Skloot and Deborah met. Deborah was around five feet tall and 200 pounds, and she walked with a cane. She joked that her hair was gray because she was the one member of the family worrying about her mother.

Deborah had come to Skloot’s B&B, and the two went up to Skloot’s room, where Skloot gave Deborah a gift. Skloot had published an article on the Lacks men in _Johns Hopkins Magazine_ , and a Hopkins cancer researcher named Christoph Lengauer had read the article and gotten in touch with her. Lengauer had used HeLa cells to develop a technique for “painting” chromosomes with fluorescent dye, which, when viewed under fluorescent light, revealed aspects of the DNA that wouldn’t otherwise be detectable. Lengauer wanted to thank the Lacks family for Henrietta’s contribution to science, so he framed a picture of HeLa cells brilliantly lit by fluorescent light and gave it to Skloot for Deborah.

Deborah was delighted and expressed her desire to learn as much as she could about HeLa cells. Then she dumped out her bag onto the bed: She’d brought along the results of her own research into Henrietta Lacks—newspaper clippings, journal articles, and videotapes with uncut footage from the BBC documentary, among other items.

**Soon it became clear that Deborah didn’t distinguish completely between science fiction and reality**. When she told Skloot that there were women walking around London that looked just like her mother, she presented as evidence not only a newspaper article that spoke about the cloning of HeLa cells but also videotapes of _Jurassic Park_ and another movie called _The Clone_.

Skloot and Deborah spent the next three days together. They explored Baltimore as they got to know each other and visited Deborah’s childhood homes.

And they spent hours together on Skloot’s bed in her B&B, poring over articles and documents concerning Henrietta. One day, when Skloot noticed a sizable manila folder on her pillow, she reached for it, asking Deborah if it was Henrietta’s medical records. Deborah screamed and dived onto the folder, and in an instant she’d packed her bag and was speeding toward the door. **As she left, she told Skloot she didn’t know who to trust**.

### Meeting Zakariyya

The next day Deborah came to Skloot’s B&B as though nothing had happened and took Skloot to see Zakariyya. Skloot was worried—she knew about Zakariyya’s history of anger, and that he was the least inclined of the Lackses to talk about his mother—but Deborah assured her that if she noticed anything wrong, she’d remove them from the situation. Along with them for the visit were eight-year-old Davon and four-year-old Alfred, Deborah’s grandsons.

Zakariyya lived in an assisted-living facility—he had significant hearing loss and, without corrective lenses, he was nearly blind—where he was on probation for intimidating the other residents. He greeted his visitors in the parking lot in a surly mood: He said wasn’t ready to see them yet and smacked Davon across the face with some newspapers he was carrying for no reason. Zakariyya was average height but weighed about 400 pounds.

Zakariyya sat on a bench in front of the building and ignored his guests, who went to sit on a bench about fifteen feet away. Finally Zakariyya asked to see the _Johns Hopkins Magazine_ article Skloot had written. Deborah informed Skloot that he wanted Skloot to be there when he read it, so Deborah took her grandkids upstairs to Zakariyya’s room and told Skloot to sit with Zakariyya on his bench.

At a certain point in his reading, Zakariyya became agitated. He rose to his feet and yelled at Skloot about how the doctors stole his mother’s cells and created cures and cloned her, all without compensating—or even _telling_ —the family. Deborah reappeared to make sure everything was OK, and the three started heading for the building entrance. As they did so, Zakariyya echoed his brothers and father: **He told Skloot that Henrietta’s cells had only done good for wealthy people and that he and Deborah couldn’t even afford to see doctors**.

Zakariyya’s room was spartan: Two chairs, a small TV with a VCR, a full-size bed with no sheets or pillows. On the wall were photocopied pictures of Lacks and Elsie, as well as diplomas for training in specific trades.

Once everyone was in the room, Zakariyya vented. When he began to remember what Ethel had done to him, he said, he felt like he could kill her and his father, too. **He said that, even though his mother’s cells had helped people, he’d rather have had her alive to raise him**.

Then Deborah stood and led the group back outside to the car. She dug into the trunk of her jeep and emerged with the picture of Henrietta’s cells Lengauer had made for the family. She gave it to Zakariyya, and Skloot mentioned that Lengauer had invited the family to visit his lab. Zakariyya softened for the first time all day. With tears in his eyes, he said that the family should accept Lengauer’s invitation.

### Deborah’s Life and Health

Although by now Skloot and Deborah had developed a friendship, Deborah still occasionally suspected Skloot of trying to take advantage of her and her family. **There was a racial component to Deborah’s suspicions—people would advise her not to trust a white person, especially considering how white people had treated her mother**.

When Deborah would confront Skloot, asking her how much money she was being paid to write her book and how much she would give Deborah, Skloot told her that she wasn’t being paid anything—she hadn’t sold the book yet and was financing her reporting herself—and that journalistic ethics forbade her from paying for the story. **She promised that if the book was ever published, she would found a scholarship for the descendants of Henrietta Lacks**.

To further earn Deborah’s trust, Skloot promised to share everything she discovered with Deborah. She sent Deborah packages of research material, with notes that explained the significance of the items and warnings if some of the material might be upsetting. These tokens seemed to work: Deborah started calling Skloot “Boo,” which was her nickname for her own daughter, and urged Skloot to get a cell phone so she could keep in touch with her while she was on the road.

Deborah eventually allowed Skloot to visit her home. There, the two spent most of their time in Deborah’s office, where Deborah often slept (she and Pullum tended to fight, and it helped them both to have their own space). The room was small, and the walls were covered with photographs of animals torn from calendars. She kept videotapes of infomercials for luxuries—a Jacuzzi, an RV, a trip to Disneyland—to watch with Davon. She would ask him, “Where do you want to go on vacation?” and watch whatever video he chose.

Skloot showed Deborah how to get online with an old computer someone had given her, and Deborah stayed up late on Ambien researching Henrietta. Davon would often find Deborah asleep with her head on the keyboard. Once, Deborah called Skloot at three in the morning, her speech affected by the sleeping aid, to describe a discovery she’d made online about Henrietta.

At the time, Deborah was taking around 14 pills a day, and her prescription costs were $150 a month after Pullum’s insurance. **When a prescription’s cost went up or her husband’s insurance stopped covering a particular medication, she either stopped taking the drug or began rationing what she already had**. She’d been diagnosed with all sorts of ailments, from mental health conditions like anxiety and depression to diabetes, osteoporosis, and high blood pressure.
