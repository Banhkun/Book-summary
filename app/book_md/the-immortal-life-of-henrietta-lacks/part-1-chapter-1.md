## Part 1 | Chapter 1: Birth and Early Life

Henrietta Lacks was born in 1920 in Roanoke, VA, the ninth child of Johnny Pleasant and Eliza Lacks Pleasant. Her birth name was Loretta; no one knows how she ended up being called Henrietta.

**Henrietta was descended from slaves**. On her father’s side, she descended from slaves owned by a tobacco farmer named Pleasants (the _s_ was later dropped). On her mother’s side, she descended from a white owner of slaves and a former slave who’d continued to work on the Lacks tobacco farm after emancipation as a sharecropper. In their wills, both Henrietta’s white great-grandfather and his brother left land to their black heirs, and white and black Lackses were buried alongside one another in the tobacco farm’s graveyard.

(Shortform note: Skloot uses the word “slaves” rather than “enslaved people” and lowercases “black” and “white” when they denote race. We follow her usage in our summary.)

After Eliza died giving birth to her tenth child, Johnny packed up the entire family and moved them to the Lacks tobacco farm, which was located in Clover, VA.

Because there were so many Pleasant children, they were divided up among the relatives living on the farm. Henrietta, who by this time was four years old, ended up with her grandfather, Tommy Lacks, in the “home-house”—a log cabin with four rooms, gas lanterns, and no running water.

Tommy Lacks had another grandchild under his care at the time: a nine-year-old boy named David Lacks, whom everyone called “Day.” Day’s mother had abandoned him, and his father was an itinerant worker who’d once passed through town.

Day, Henrietta, and their many cousins spent their days farming: feeding and caring for livestock, tending a garden, and harvesting tobacco. Day was allowed to attend school through fourth grade; Henrietta, through sixth.

Although Henrietta had other suitors—she was considered the prettiest girl on the tobacco farm, which was called “Lacks Town”—she bore Day’s first child, a son named Lawrence, when she was 14. (She and Day had shared a room since Henrietta had moved to the farm, and so no one in the family was surprised when they became intimate.) Lucile Elsie, a second child, came when Henrietta was 18.

Elsie, as the daughter was called, suffered from a cognitive impairment. At the time, people referred to her as “simple.”

Henrietta and Day were married in 1941, when they were 20 and 25 respectively. Gladys, Henrietta’s sister, objected to the marriage because she thought Day would be a bad husband.

At the end of the year, a cousin who’d moved to Baltimore paid Lacks Town a visit. He’d gone north to work at the Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrows Point, and he was living in Turner Station, a community of black steelworkers situated just outside of downtown Baltimore. The war effort, thrown into high gear by the bombing of Pearl Harbor, had created new opportunities for African-American workers—Sparrow’s Point would become the biggest steel plant in the world—and the cousin convinced Day and Henrietta to join him in Turner Station.

Day went first to establish himself and buy a home for Henrietta and the two children. Mere months after Day arrived, the cousin was drafted and gave his savings to Day to help move Henrietta and the kids to Turner Station.
