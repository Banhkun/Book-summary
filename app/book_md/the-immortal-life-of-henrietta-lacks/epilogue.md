## Epilogue: Where They Are Now

(As of 2009)

  * Deborah’s son, **Alfred Jr**., is serving a 30-year prison sentence for armed robbery and assault. He has earned his GED and has taught GED class to fellow prisoners.
  * Skloot was unable to find **Dr. Sir Lord Keenan Kester Cofield.** He filed a lawsuit in 2008, his last to date, in which he sued 226 entities and people for over $10 billion.
  * **Howard Jones** , the Hopkins gynecologist that treated Lacks, is emeritus professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins and Eastern Virginia Medical School. He and his wife Georgeanna, also a doctor, oversaw the birth of the first test-tube baby in the United States.
  * Lacks’s sons, **Sonny, Lawrence, and Zakariyya** were profoundly affected by Deborah’s death. Zakariyya achieved inner peace through studying yogis, and he now treats his nieces and nephews with kindness and affection. Lawrence charged over $6,000 to his credit cards to pay for Deborah’s funeral. And Sonny has taken over Deborah’s quest to raise people’s awareness of Henrietta Lacks’s contribution to science.
  * **Christoph Lengauer** , the Hopkins scientist who invited the Lacks family to visit his lab, works for Sanofi-Aventis, a multinational pharmaceutical company, where he’s global head of oncology drug discovery.
  * **Davon and (Little) Alfred, Jr**., along with 22 other descendants of Henrietta, live in Baltimore.
  * **Roland Pattillo** , the organizer of the HeLa conference in 1996, is professor of medicine at Morehouse College. The HeLa conference is still held every year, and he and his wife plan to purchase a marker for Henrietta Lacks’s grave.
  * Deborah’s ex-husband, **James Pullum** , still preaches in Baltimore.
  * **Courtney Speed** continues to run her grocery store and hopes, someday, to open a Henrietta Lacks museum.
  * Remaining one of the most common cell lines used in scientific research, **HeLa** cells have been featured in more than 60,000 scientific articles.



**Afterword**

Skloot is often asked whether Gey’s taking of Henrietta’s cells without consent was illegal. **It wasn’t in 1951—and, as of 2009, it still wasn’t**.

**When Americans go to the doctor to have blood drawn, a mole removed, or any sort of “ectomy” (i.e., tissue or organs excised), it’s perfectly legal for doctors and hospitals to keep samples of that tissue for research**. A 1999 study from the RAND Corporation estimated that tissue from more than 178 million Americans was stored in the US and that the library of tissues was growing by more than 20 million samples a year. The samples are stored in a number of places—hospitals, laboratories, federal agencies, military facilities—and include everything from appendixes to blood to fat cells to foreskins from circumcisions.

And the tissue industry is only growing. For example, 23andMe, the company that provides customers with genealogical information based on a saliva sample, **will only analyze samples if the customer agrees to allow their samples to be used for further research**.

In the debate over people’s rights to their tissues, there are two issues of prime importance: consent and remuneration.

### Consent

In terms of consent, the Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects—more commonly known as the “Common Rule”—mandates that researchers must have informed consent before conducting studies or experiments on human subjects. **The problem is that most tissue research isn’t federally funded and the researcher never comes into contact with the actual human who provided the samples: the subject is the _sample_ , not the _human_**. Doctors must get informed consent from a potential subject if they want to remove tissue for research, but if they want to conduct research on already-removed tissue, they don’t.

While the medical establishment believes there are sufficient mechanisms and rules in place—institutional review boards, various guidelines, and ethical codes—tissue-rights activists argue that actual legislation is necessary to protect people’s tissue. **These activists believe that donors should have a say in who gets access to those tissues and what kinds of research their tissues are used for**.

Some unwitting tissue donors have tested these theories in the courts. In 2005, 6,000 patients sued Washington University to have their tissue samples removed from the institution’s cell bank. The patients lost their initial lawsuit as well as their appeal; the judges in both cases argued that patient ownership of tissue samples would stifle scientific research. In 2008, the patients appealed to the Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case.

**Hopkins’s release of Henrietta’s name and medical records, however,_would_ be illegal now: HIPAA protects patients’ privacy**. And the Common Rule features guidelines for naming and/or coding samples that renders them anonymous (i.e., samples are no longer named, like HeLa, using the subject’s real name).

**Contemporary bioethicists and scientists are divided on the issue of consent**. Some believe patients should have complete knowledge of and control over how their tissues are used, whereas others argue the complexity of a robust consent regime would have significant negative consequences for the advance of science.

### Remuneration

The other facet of the debate concerns money—**whether patients should be informed if their tissues will be used in commercial enterprise and whether they should be compensated**.

Under current law, it is illegal to sell human organs and tissues for research or transplants. However, companies turn profits processing those organs and tissues that humans donate freely.

Analysts in favor of compensating patients have proposed various systems for paying patients back: direct payments for donations, royalties on future earnings from donated samples, and tax write-offs are just a few.

Those arguing _against_ compensating patients fear that, if patients can sell their tissues, they will begin to withhold samples to achieve better financial terms, thereby stifling research. **But Skloot finds that very few tissue-rights activists seek cash awards for themselves**. Rather, they want to ensure that whatever treatments or medicines are derived from their tissues are freely available to all (rather than patented for profit).

**When Skloot was writing, the most contentious area of commercial science was gene patenting**. As of 2005, the use of approximately 20% of known human genes had been patented. This meant that laboratories or institutions that wanted to conduct research on those genes had to pay a licensing fee. **For example, to study the gene that caused hereditary hemochromatosis, a blood disorder, academic institutions were required to pay a $25,000 licensing fee to the company that had patented it** (commercial enterprises had to pay $250,000). Myriad Genetics, which held patents on two genes responsible for breast cancer, had a monopoly on the test for those genes (which cost $3,000 per patient) and charged peer companies and institutions to research those genes.

(Shortform note: The ACLU sued Myriad Genetics in 2009, arguing, ironically, that instead of spurring research, patenting discrete strands of DNA stifled research. After a number of appeals and a remand from the Supreme Court, the case was finally heard by the Supreme Court and decided in favor of the ACLU: **The Court held that companies couldn’t patent isolated strands of DNA found in nature**.)

Members of the scientific community, as they are on the topic of a far-reaching consent regime, are divided on the topic of commercializing science. **More capitalistic scientists believe that the possibility of profit incentivizes research and innovation, whereas less profit-driven researchers believe patents undermine the spirit and mission of science—to increase the world’s store of knowledge**.

In terms of the _patient’s_ interests in commercial science, the scientists Skloot interviews believe patients should have ownership of their tissues. Wayne Grody, a lab director at UCLA, argues that if patients can leverage their tissues to make a profit, more power to them.

**The problem, though, is that the majority of patients don’t know their tissues are valuable until _after_ they’ve already been (legally) taken**. Thus the only way they can reap the benefits of their tissues is if doctors and researchers voluntarily include them in any commercial venture—or if those doctors and researchers must get their consent.

John Moore’s lawsuit against David Golde and UCLA resulted in case law that recommended patients be notified if their tissues have commercial value. No legislation resulted from the judge’s decision, however, **so institutions have no obligation to inform their patients about the potential for commercial use**. And despite congressional hearings and federal reports on bioethics, no clear policy has emerged.

Although Lawrence and Zakariyya have expressed interest intermittently in suing Hopkins, no Lacks family member has actually filed suit. There are merits to their case—since HeLa cells are anything but anonymous, the family ought to be covered by the Common Rule; and since Henrietta’s descendants share DNA with HeLa cells, they ought, under the Common Rule, to be able to remove HeLa cells from circulation—but given the disruption a ruling like this would cause, legal experts are skeptical the suit would succeed. According to Sonny, the Lackses aren’t eager to keep HeLa cells from being used in research anyway. **He believes Deborah would want their mother’s cells to continue helping people**. HeLa’s miraculous role in 20th-century science is a source of pride for the family.
