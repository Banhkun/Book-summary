## Exercise: Which Language Are You?

Now that you know a few ways to determine your language, letâ€™s see if you can narrow it down to one or two.

What is something your partner did recently that made you feel loved more than usual? Which language does that action fall into?

If you were sad or upset, what could your partner do to make it better today? Which language does that action fall into?

What is something you frequently request of your partner? Which language does that request fall into?
