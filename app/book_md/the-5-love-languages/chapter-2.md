## Chapter 2: Everyone Has a Love Tank

Our **love tanks** are the parts of us that **represent our emotional need for love**. The desire for love stems from a primary urge within us to fill our tanks.

**When our love tanks are full, everything seems possible.** The world seems more open and beautiful.

When our love tanks are empty, our worldview can become narrow and pessimistic.

### Our Primal Need for Love

We are animals in nature. Just as the lion has a primal urge to hunt, **humans have a primal need to experience intimacy and affection**. Committed relationships are sought to address that urge and keep our love tanks full forever.

But **_being_ in love is not the same thing as _living_ with love**.

**When we fall _in love_ , we are experiencing a temporary filling of our love tanks **because of the _love high_ , regardless of how it is delivered. In this early state, we feel euphoric and understood. We feel powerful and confident.

But **the _in-love_ experience is short-lived**. As the euphoria wanes, our primal urge for our specific brand of love will reemerge. We will desire to receive love according to our language for it to remain over time.

**When we stop feeling our particular love needs being met, our tanks will slowly drain**. And a relationship with a foundation of empty tanks is not sustainable. When we feel our needs going unmet, our desire to meet the needs of our loved one diminishes. Empty tanks may lead to arguments, estrangement, and resentment.

Full tanks create an environment where love can be examined and curated for each partner’s needs.

**Maintaining a full love tank is as important in a long-term relationship as having a full tank of gas is for operating a car.** Without gas, our cars won’t run. We will be stranded on the side of the road. Likewise, with a full tank of love, we can venture forward on our journey with our partners unimpeded.

### But What Is Love?

The word **“love” has become a catchall** for expressing our likes or appreciation of something. For example, we may love it when it rains, but we also love pizza and our pets.

We love our partners, but we also may love a good joke or our favorite band. These **general uses create a washed-out significance** for the word, which can distance us from understanding what it really means.

When we talk about love **in a romantic relationship, we mean love that addresses our emotional selves**. These emotional selves are constructed by our early experiences of receiving love or the opposite.

For instance, a child that receives love, companionship, and support from their parents will have a more stable idea of self and love. A child that does not receive adequate love will likely have a confused and desperate need for love and become emotionally unstable.

To ensure full love tanks in our relationships, we must acknowledge that we each bring different experiences and expectations into a relationship. Once we understand our foundations of love, we can start addressing how to fill each other’s love tanks.
