## FAQ: The 5 Love Languages

**1\. What if I can’t figure out my love language or my partner’s?**

If the information in Chapter 9 doesn’t help you understand your language or your partner’s, **consider the 5-week experiment**. Monday through Friday, try speaking one of the languages consistently with your partner. Take Saturday and Sunday off.

Try a different language in each week. You may notice a stronger reaction in your partner one week than another. Whichever week they seem to respond more strongly may indicate which language they speak.

The week you were most comfortable speaking one of the languages or found the most joy in performing the specific acts can also speak to your preferred language.

**2\. Will my love language change over time?**

Like any inherent part of our personalities, our preferred love language tends to be developed when we’re young and stays with us. However, changes could occur if your priorities change.

  * You may love to be touched, but if you have a demanding workload, you might find you desire or appreciate acts of service by your partner more.
  * You may seek quality time with your partner and desire that most often, but if your schedules don’t allow for it, or you are in a long-distance relationship, words of affirmation or receiving gifts may begin to satisfy you.



**3\. Do children speak a certain love language?**

Yes! Children definitely have a preference for how they receive love the most, but that doesn’t mean they don’t need love in all ways. How children are loved will go a long way in determining how they love as adults and how they want to be loved.

Ensuring your child is loved through all languages will help build a well-rounded emotional individual.

Pay attention to how they behave with certain acts of love, and you can begin to understand what their primary language might be.

  * Your child may love bedtime stories and play days at the park, but if your child always requests a kiss goodnight or initiates hugs frequently, they may experience physical touch more deeply than anything else.



As a child grows older, their language is not likely to change, but they way want to receive love may change.

  * A child who loved compliments may still love them, but the type of compliment they desire may change.
    * If your child used to gush when you said how smart or cute they were, those comments might now make your teenager embarrassed. 
    * They might want compliments that focus on their growing individuality instead, such as “You’re developing a nice style” or “You’re getting really good at Math/Soccer/Painting.”
  * Look for signs that signify your child’s changing attitude about receiving love to ensure your love is always felt.



**4\. Are certain languages more common among men and women?**

The love languages stem from an emotional place inside us. Although stereotypes of men seeking physical touch more than women or women desiring affirming words more than men abound, each person is different. What makes a person feel loved has less to do with gender than with emotional satisfaction.

Because there are so many ways a certain love language can be spoken, the unique nature of the act for your partner may be vastly different than another act within the same language for someone else.

  * Your partner may feel loved most when you compliment their handiness around the house, while another person might prefer to be told they are attractive. 



**5\. What if my partner doesn’t respond to my speaking their language?**

There are many reasons why your partner may not respond to your efforts to speak their language.

  * They may hold resentments and don’t believe in your sincerity.
  * They may not believe your behavior will last.
  * You may be speaking the wrong language.
  * They may have turned their heart to something or someone else.



If your partner is not responding, the easiest choice to make is to give up. It’s not working, so why keep trying? But if you give up, you may be affirming your partner’s suspicions or convictions that your actions weren’t true or lasting. You may also stop too quickly, around the time when they were starting to come around or believe.

Instead, allow your partner time to get used to your new behavior. Communicate to gain an idea of how your efforts are being received.

Speaking your partner’s language is about showing them love, and you don’t need their approval to do so. Keep loving them as best as possible. If it looks like things are too far gone or they are unwilling to change, at least you know you loved them the best you could.

**6\. What if my partner won’t speak my language?**

You cannot force your partner to love you more or better. All you can do is communicate your needs and desires. If you partner knows how you want to be loved and doesn’t comply, you may need to rethink your relationship, including what you want from it and what you can or cannot live without.

**7\. Is it ever too late to rekindle love in a relationship?**

If love was there once, it can be there again if both people make an effort to learn to love the other well. If love has faded, it is likely because of hurt feelings or a perception of the other’s love fading as behaviors change.

Initiating the right kind of love to your partner can begin to fill their tanks. If they are willing to do what is necessary to fill yours, as well, love can start to be rebuilt.
