## Chapter 13: Final Thoughts

You and your partner are different, even if you have been together for a long time. As individuals, **you bring your histories and baggage into your relationship**. You have expectations for what you want or should receive from your partner. You have different ways of coping with anger and pain. You have different priorities.

**When your love tank is full, you can meet your partner in a positive place to deal with your differences.** With a full love tank, you are able to communicate better and appreciate each other.

With empty love tanks, the differences can turn to distance and resentment. An empty love tank can remove the desire to treat your partner with respect and compromise.

  * An argument with an empty love tank can become hurtful, violent, and damaging. 
  * An argument with a full love tank can become a platform for growth and companionship. 



Divorce is prevalent in society, and the cause is likely numerous love tanks that were allowed to drain.

  * The loss of the initial high of falling in love can leave some feeling lost and empty. 
  * Falling in love is easy. **Keeping love requires thought and effort.**



If your tank is empty, your partner’s tank is likely not far off. Taking time to learn each other’s love languages can start the process of rediscovering what love means to you and the enjoyment of building it and living with it every day.
