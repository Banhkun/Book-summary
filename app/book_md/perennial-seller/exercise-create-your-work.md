## Exercise: Create Your Work

If you want to create something great, you actually need to do it.

* * *

Do you feel that you spend more time thinking about doing what you want to do, than actually doing it? If yes, what’s holding you back?

It’s important to get feedback on your work. Who is trustworthy and credible that you can use to get feedback on what you’re creating?
