## Introduction

How do you create something that lasts for 10 years? This is a question most advice today don’t dare to ask. The Top “thought leaders” and experts are focused on _shortcuts_ to success - social media marketing, raising capital, hacking bestseller lists, chasing today’s trends.

As a creator, **longevity is worth aiming for**. Having a perennial seller maintains your influence over years, possibly decades.

Perennial sellers are the kinds of products we return to over and over again; that we recommend to others, even if they’re no longer trendy.

The book gives these examples as perennial sellers:

  * Shawshank Redemption had a poor box office but has grossed over $100MM since it left theaters.
  * Many restaurants have been open for decades - LA’s Original Pantry Cafe, NYC’s Katz’s Deli.
  * Iron Maiden has sold 85 million albums over 4 decades and continues to sell out concerts.
  * Ted Turner bought MGM’s classic film library when people didn’t value them (who would watch these old films?) and launched Turner Network Television and Turner Classic Movies.
  * Star Wars tells the classic tale of Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey and continues to be captivate new generations.
  * In 2015, catalog albums (>18 months old) outsold all new releases for the first time in music history.
  * “Happy Birthday” song - before this, what were people supposed to do at a birthday party?



**Every day something lasts, the chances that it will continue to last increase** (this is known as the Lindy effect).

_Perennial Seller_ is an attempt to codify the process of creating things that stand the test of time. Is there a common creative mindset? How does it differ from work that’s popular one day and gone the next? How do you capture an audience, build a platform, and develop marketing channels that endure?
