## Chapter 1: Sowing Doubt

Now that we know how science, uncertainty, and cause work (and we know that a lot of people don’t understand how they work), we can look at how merchants of doubt exploit this to cause widespread public confusion.

### Who _Are_ the Merchants of Doubt?

By nature, **science challenges the status quo and ruling class because its purpose is to change our understanding of the world around us.** Science often reveals market failures and suggests regulation as a solution, so merchants of doubt tend to be defenders of the free market such as:

**MOD Type #1: Free market fundamentalists,** who believe that free markets are the _only_ economic system that allows for freedom. These MODs are opposed to regulation, particularly international treaties because global governance reduces an individual nation’s powers.

**However, free market fundamentalism is unsound** —there are plenty of examples of market failure throughout history, such as the Great Depression. **Free market fundamentalism is particularly fallible in the case of the environment because it produces “negative externalities,” which are consequences and costs that aren’t reflected in the market system, so the market has no motivation to solve them.**

  * (Shortform example: If a company has a problem—for instance, mine explosions are killing people and slowing down work—and the problem affects the bottom line, the company has to figure out a way to solve it or else go bankrupt. If the problem _doesn’t_ have any effect on profit—for instance, the explosions are in remote areas—then the company can survive just fine. The remote explosions may be killing animals, but the company doesn’t have to pay for this, so it’s not motivated to stop the explosions.)



**MOD Type #2: Cornucopians or technophiles,** who believe that technology will fix every one of humanity’s problems as long as markets stay free (so inventors will be motivated to innovate by huge rewards).

This belief isn’t completely wrong—in many ways, modern life is better than medieval life, and there have been historical instances of governments oppressing their citizens with regulations. However, cornucopianism includes two potentially flawed assumptions:

  1. **Technology is guaranteed to advance fast and well enough.** Technology has advanced in the past, but things are different today. In the past, human-caused environmental problems were small and regional. Today, they’re global and have a time limit, and technology is not developing quickly enough to meet it.
  2. **All advances were entirely generated by the free market.** This claim originates from Milton Friedman—he wrote that _no_ technological advances had ever been generated by centralized government—but that’s untrue. (It only wasn’t dismissed as nonsense because he was an influential economist.)
     * For example, the communist Soviet Union was a technological powerhouse—it launched the first satellite, Sputnik, into space.



#### Individual Merchants of Doubt

**Four notable merchants of doubt were involved in doubt-mongering multiple scientific questions from the 1960s-2000s.** All of them media-savvy, well-connected, politically powerful, fiercely anti-Communist physicists (though none of them did much original science after 1970—they wrote reviews or editorials, but didn’t publish much in peer-reviewed journals).

They were:

##### Fred Seitz

**Fred Seitz** was a solid-state physicist. He contributed to building the atomic bomb and throughout his career held various high positions such as NATO science advisor, president of the National Academy of Sciences, and president of Rockefeller University.

Some of the following likely contributed to his becoming a merchant of doubt:

**1\. He loved science and technology and thought they were the only way forward.** He thought the public was anti-science and technology, and that environmentalists were anti-progress.

**2\. He disagreed with the mainstream scientific community:**

  * He thought scientists were grant-motivated. They only studied things they thought they could get grant money for, so they didn’t tackle more creative or non-mainstream ideas. 
  * He thought scientists were fickle and rigid. He clashed with other scientists on the Vietnam War (he supported it; they didn’t) and nuclear preparedness (he believed in a strong military with technological prowess; others were in favor of arms limitations and treaties and didn’t believe anyone could ever win permanent technological superiority).



**3\. He was fiercely anti-Communist** and always took the side of private enterprise. He believed that capitalism and freedom were intertwined, so any regulation, even if supported by science, was a no-go.

**4\. He was a genetic determinist** —he believed that health and behavior were determined by people’s genes, not their environment. He may have actually believed some of the doubt-mongering he helped spread—for example, that lung cancer was caused by genetics, not smoking.

**5\. He and the organizations he was part of received industry funding.** For example, the tobacco industry funded a lot of research at Rockefeller University.

##### William Nierenberg

**William Nierenberg** was a physicist. Like Seitz, he contributed to building the atomic bomb and was involved with Cold War weapons programs. He held positions including director of the prestigious Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and he was a member of Reagan’s transition team.

Some of the following likely contributed to his becoming an MOD:

  1. He thought nuclear power was the only way forward.
  2. He despised environmentalists—he thought they opposed progress.
  3. He clashed with other scientists who opposed military-sponsored work and the Vietnam War (like Seitz, he supported it).



##### Robert Jastrow

**Robert Jastrow** was an astrophysicist and popular science author. He was the director of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (part of NASA).

Some of the following likely contributed to his becoming a merchant of doubt:

  1. He believed that science and technology were critical to national defense.
  2. He believed that capitalism and freedom had to exist together. If one fell, the other would fall too. If capitalism and science were in opposition (for example, if science suggested regulation), he’d choose capitalism.



##### Fred Singer

**Fred Singer** was a rocket scientist. He was a director of the National Weather Satellite Service and chief scientist for the Department of Transportation under Reagan. Interestingly, in the 1960s, he was an environmentalist. He believed that human activity was affecting the planet, and he urged both more research and action. By the 1980s, however, he'd changed his mind. He came to believe that protection might come with too-high costs and that technological development driven by the free market would solve all of humanity’s problems.

Some of the following likely contributed to his becoming an MOD:

  1. He received funding for fighting environmentalism.
  2. He received attention—his contrary views, which he published in mainstream media, put him in the spotlight more than publishing a paper in a scientific journal would have. 
  3. He ultimately hated regulation. In 1989, he wrote that wanting to save the environment was just a cover for wanting to reform economic systems and regulate, and he regularly accused scientists of having anti-capitalist political agendas.



### Doubt-Mongering Techniques

Now that we understand some of the merchants of doubt’s motivations, we’ll look at some of the techniques they use to create debate around issues that are already scientifically settled:

#### Technique #1: Emphasize Uncertainty

**Merchants of doubt play up the natural uncertainty inherent in science to suggest that _everything_ is uncertain, **not just the details. If they can create a strong enough impression of uncertainty that people can’t even be sure there actually _is_ a problem, they can delay policy and regulation.

  * For example, climate modelers knew that their models had some uncertainty—for example, they couldn’t perfectly represent the effects of the ocean. However, they did know that the ocean effect wouldn’t be large enough to cancel out the warming. The MODs attacked the models for not considering all the factors.



#### Technique #2: Cherry-Pick Data

**MODs only cite or publicize data that support their position and ignore anything that doesn’t.**

  * For example, in a report about global warming, one MOD reprinted only the top part of a graph, because that part supported his position and the rest of it didn’t. (For more on the global warming story, see Chapter 8.)



#### Technique #3: Fund Other Studies in the Hopes of Getting More Favorable Results

**If MODs don’t like what mainstream science has discovered about a subject, they often spend large amounts of money funding research that might “debunk” mainstream science or show that uncertainty is greater than previously thought.** Sometimes they funnel the money through front groups or think tanks to disguise the connection.

  * For example, after scientists first discovered tobacco causes cancer, the tobacco industry funded other scientists’ work, hoping someone would discover that tobacco wasn’t that dangerous.



#### Technique #4: Create the Appearance of Debate in the Scientific Community

**MODs recruit people with good credentials (including scientists) to challenge evidence and repeat non-consensus claims.** They also put out publications that look like real scientific findings. This makes the public think that the scientific community as a whole is in debate.

  * For example, two MODs wrote an article and formatted it to look like the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_. (The National Academy of Sciences is prestigious and legitimate.)



#### **Technique #5: Call for** “Equal Time” and Balanced Media Coverage

**MODs convince journalists that it’s only fair to present “both sides” of a story when there’s a dissent.** Some journalists don’t understand that dissenters already received fair consideration during the peer review process, and they feel both views deserve to be aired. Other journalists allow themselves to be schmoozed, and still others don’t have enough time before their deadlines to dig deep into the research.

In fact, **“balanced” media coverage of science actually results in _more_ -_biased_ coverage because minority voices end up with proportionally more time than consensus ones.**

**Equal attention for all views only makes sense when applied to _opinions_.** For example, two political parties might have differing views on an issue, so it makes sense to hear both. However, there is no opinion in science—it’s either right, wrong, or unknown.

  * For example, tobacco industry MODs threatened journalists with the Fairness Doctrine—an FCC rule in effect from 1949-1987 that TV journalists had to give equal airtime to both sides of controversial issues. As a result, journalists gave the same amount of coverage to the industry as the mainstream science finding that smoking kills. (For more on the tobacco story, see Chapters 2 and 3.)



#### Technique #6: Publish in Mainstream Media

Most scientific research is first published in scientific journals, which the average person doesn’t read. Therefore, **if MODs can get their “facts” and views into mainstream media such as newspapers and magazines, those are the facts and views the public will see.**

  * For example, when MOD Fred Singer wanted to spread doubt about global warming, he published a piece in a magazine called _Cosmos_ rather than in a scientific journal.



#### Technique #7: Deflect and Distract

**MODs take public focus away from the real issue and direct it toward something else—often true or important, but irrelevant.**

  * For example, in discussions about the cancer-causing consequences of tobacco, MODs brought up other causes of lung cancer.



#### Technique #8: Claim the Solution is Worse Than the Problem

**MODs claim that the solutions to issues science has unveiled will create more problems than the original issue.** Therefore, it’s better not to act.

  * For example, after scientists announced that CFCs (chemicals used in refrigerators and aerosols) were destroying the ozone layer, MODs claimed that CFCs alternatives (which didn’t exist at the time) would be toxic, dangerous substances.



This technique is supported by rational decision-theory analysis—if there are unknowns, the best course of action is usually to do nothing because acting has costs, and if you’re not sure you’re going to get any benefits, they’re not worth it. (Additionally, the costs are usually in the present and the benefits in the future.) This is part of why doubt-mongering works so well.

#### Technique #9: Attack Other Scientists’ Reputations and Accuse Them of Having Political Motivations

**If a scientist discovers something a merchant of doubt doesn’t like, the MOD will often personally attack the scientist.**

  * For example, MODs accused Rachel Carson, who revealed that the use of DDT (a pesticide) was damaging the environment, of being “hysterical.”



#### Technique #10: Attack Science

The final technique is **to call science that doesn’t support your position bad or junk science.** MODs might make claims that scientists massaged the numbers or rigged the experiment to further their agenda.

  * For example, MODs accused the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of doing bad science on secondhand smoke. They claimed the EPA wanted to regulate so badly that it manipulated the science to support regulation.



### Ironies

There are two ironies related to the doubt-mongering techniques:

**1\. The means merchants of doubt use to justify their ends conflict with their free-market values.** Interestingly, many of the doubt-mongering techniques were used by communists, or enemies of capitalism—for example, the Soviet Union erased history with historical cleansing, and in Orwell’s _1984,_ the totalitarian government made up fake histories and destroyed any information it didn’t like.

  * For example, one tenet of the free market system working is that everyone has to have access to information. The MOD's techniques deliberately misinform people.



**2\. Delays create a greater need for regulation.** The worse the problems get (and they worsen as they’re not addressed), the more aggressively the government will have to step in to fix them. The MODs have likely prompted more extreme regulation than would have been necessary had they not interfered.
