## Exercise: Identify Doubt-Mongering and Expert Consensus

Doubt-mongering is a powerful tool, but since it doesnâ€™t have science (expert consensus) on its side, it is possible to see through it.

* * *

Think of a contentious scientific question that has the potential to change policy. (For example, you might consider plastic pollution.) Who supports policy changes and who opposes them?

What are the credentials of the parties involved? (For example, are they individual practicing scientists, institutions, spokespeople, and so on?)

What research have the parties done in the past, and what are they currently working on? Are they experienced in the same field as the question?

Where do the parties publish their findings? (For example, are they publishing in peer-reviewed journals, media outlets that are notoriously left- or right-wing, and so on?)

Where do the parties get their funding?
