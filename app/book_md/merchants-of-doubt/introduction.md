## Introduction

**“Merchants of doubt” (MODs) are people or organizations who create the impression that scientific findings that threaten their agenda or ideology are unsettled or flat-out wrong.** The goal is to stave off regulation.

The tobacco industry pioneered techniques for manufacturing doubt when scientists discovered that smoking caused cancer, and other MODs had been attacking science using the same techniques ever since.

In this book, science historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway cover how science and doubt-mongering work, and they look at doubt-mongering campaigns around the following scientific questions:

  * Are tobacco and secondhand smoke a health hazard?
  * Would a nuclear defense system actually work, and would a nuclear war make the planet inhospitable?
  * Is acid rain real, and will it damage the environment?
  * Is the ozone hole real, and will it endanger humans?
  * Is climate change real, and can we do anything about it?
  * Is the pesticide DDT dangerous to the environment or humans?



Finally, they offer tips for evaluating whether information is doubt-mongering or real science.

(_Merchants of Doubt_ was originally published in 2010 and then updated in 2020.)

(Shortform note: We’ve reorganized the book’s material for concision and clarity. Much of the original book’s front and end matter, as well as general information about merchandising doubt, appears in our Chapter 1. We’ve also rearranged the chapters to place the two smoking chapters beside each other.)

### What Is Science?

Most of us don’t really understand what science is. We think it’s iron-clad proof that something is true. In reality, **scientific knowledge is expert consensus—a group of qualified scientists agrees that a claim is correct when there’s enough evidence to support it.**

#### Peer Review

How does expert consensus come about? The basic system has been in place since the 1600s. When scholars first became interested in learning new information (in medieval times, learning was about studying ancient texts and preserving what was already known), they realized that there had to be some sort of way to check new ideas for validity, or people could just make things up and be taken seriously. To prevent this, **they built a system in which claims had to be backed up by evidence, and both the claim and evidence needed to pass the judgment of other scientists to be considered legitimate.** If a claim failed the process, it was just a claim, not science.

Today, the process is called peer review, and **no science is considered legitimate until it passes peer review.** Typically, the process works like this:

**Step #1:** A scientist comes up with an idea, collects evidence to support it, writes a paper, and then submits it to a scientific journal for publication.

**Step #2:** The journal sends the paper to three other scientists to review. The reviewers aren’t paid—since everyone’s work has to be peer-reviewed to be considered science, someone else will return the favor later.

Reviewers must be subject matter experts and mustn’t have a close relationship with the paper’s author. They look for bad science and mistakes such as:

  * Made up, tweaked, or manipulated data
  * Cherry-picked data—choosing to use only certain (favorable) data and leaving other numbers out
  * Claims that aren’t testable
  * Small sample sizes (Shortform note: If a sample is too small, results might be due to chance)
  * Unclear analysis (the reviewer can’t understand how the author got the data or made calculations with it)
  * Conclusions that don’t match what the results found
  * Conclusions drawn from too little or inconsistent data
  * Reputation of the author (if the author has a history of bad methods or unreasonable claims, reviewers will consider all of the above with more scrutiny)



If the reviewers provide conflicting comments, the journal might send the paper to more scientists or the editor might provide notes.

**Step #3:** The journal sends the reviewers’ notes back to the paper’s author to address. The author may write multiple drafts as she implements and receives new feedback. If the author ultimately fails to revise well enough, the journal won’t publish the paper. The author has to start over or try a different (less prestigious) journal.

Papers that are presented at conferences don’t have to go through the same process and aren’t considered serious (they aren’t taken into consideration for tenure).

#### How Does Uncertainty Work?

Even after a paper has passed peer review and been published,**there will always be some uncertainty regarding the details—science is always evolving, so while we may know a lot, we’re never going to know everything about any topic.** This is normal and important—it’s what drives scientists to keep discovering new things.

  * For example, climate modelers can’t effectively capture hurricanes because they’re too small (on a global scale). 



**When presented with an uncertainty, the question shouldn’t be whether there’s _any_ doubt, but whether there’s any _reasonable_ doubt.** If there’s reasonable doubt, the matter isn’t settled. If there’s doubt on the details, that’s normal.

Science has gotten a lot done even though it was never designed to provide certainty—for example, we landed astronauts on the moon. Feats like this don’t prove that science is perfectly, objectively right, but they do suggest that **when we act on the work of expert consensus, we can get a lot done.**

#### How Do Causes Work?

**Like science and scientific uncertainty, many of us don’t understand how cause works, or what scientists mean when they use the word “cause.”** For example, we think that if smoking causes cancer, then if a person smokes, she’ll definitely get cancer.

In reality, it’s more complicated than that. There are two types of causes:

  1. **Statistical.** This means that if you do something, you’re more likely to see a particular outcome. (If you smoke, you’re more likely to get cancer.)
  2. **Everyday.** This means that once a particular result has come to pass, you can find the cause, but the cause isn’t guaranteed to create that particular outcome every time. (Shortform example: If you fight with your partner because you’re jealous, jealousy caused that particular fight. Jealousy often, but not always, causes fights.)
