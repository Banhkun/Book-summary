## Chapter 7: Ozone Hole

In the last chapter, we looked at the “debate” over acid rain, which the merchants of doubt successfully fueled. In this chapter, we’ll look at the “debate” over the ozone hole, which _didn’t_ fall prey to doubt-mongering.

### Discovery of the Problem

The discovery of the ozone hole was roundabout—scientists found it while studying something else.

#### Supersonic Transports (SSTs)

In the late 1960s, the U.S. wanted to build supersonic transports (SSTs), commercial planes that could break the sound barrier. Unlike regular planes, the **SST would travel in the stratosphere, and scientists were concerned the plane’s exhaust** (composed of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and nitrogen oxides (NOX)) **might damage the environment** because:

  * Carbon dioxide and water vapor are greenhouse gases. (See Chapter 8 for more on the greenhouse effect and climate change.)
  * Water vapor contributes to cloud formation, which can change the weather. 
  * Water vapor and NOX might deplete the stratospheric ozone layer. By the 1970s, scientists knew that the ozone layer blocked the sun’s UV radiation, which could cause some types of skin cancer.



**In 1970, two notable studies tackled the issue** :

**1\. MIT** released a study (SCEP) about human environmental impact that, among other things, considered the effect of the SSTs on the stratosphere. Scientists found that an SST fleet _would_ increase the concentration of water vapor in the stratosphere but probably _wouldn’t_ change the planet’s temperature. The study also noted that NOX probably wouldn’t affect atmospheric ozone.

**2\. A Boeing Laboratories** scientist found that 850 SSTs wouldn’t have a large effect on surface temperatures. He did find, however, that the emissions would cause a 2-4% reduction in the ozone column.

#### Nitrogen Oxides (NOX)

In March 1971, the Department of Transportation held a conference on stratospheric flight. One of the attendees, **Harold Johnston, an atmospheric chemist, disagreed with the SCEP study’s conclusion that NOX wouldn’t significantly deplete ozone.** Johnston handwrote a paper while at the conference that showed that **NOX would have a huge effect—10-90% ozone depletion, depending on region.** The higher-air-traffic regions, such as the North Atlantic, would see the greatest depletion.

None of the other scientists were very worried about NOX, but **Johnston was so vehement they recommended doing more research on NOX at the end of the conference.** No one knew how much NOX was currently in the atmosphere, so it was impossible to know if the SST emissions would be a drop in the bucket or a huge amount.

**Johnston revised his handwritten paper and tried to publish it in _Science_. The peer reviewers rejected it** because Johnston hadn’t cited an important paper on NOX and because his tone was biased—he wrote that an SST fleet would deplete ozone concentration by 50% and cause blindness. **Johnston went to work revising it, but an earlier draft leaked to the press.** The PR department at the University of California released the leaked draft officially, which brought the issue of ozone depletion into public consciousness.

### Policy and Public Action

The House of Representatives ultimately voted to cancel the supersonic transport (SST) program because it was too expensive (not because of environmental concerns). However, other countries were looking at stratospheric flight too, and the Department of Transportation wanted to look at other types of SSTs, so **in 1972, Congress funded a Climate Impact Assessment Program (CIAP).** It was one of the first studies to preemptively assess a technology and it would take three years.

### Further Exploration of the Science

At the same time CIAP was going on, scientists started thinking beyond NOX and wondered what effect other emissions, notably chlorine, might have on ozone. Two notable studies addressed the issue:

**1\. NASA’s 1973 Environmental Impact Statement for their shuttle program.** Two scientists at the University of Michigan studied the exhaust of rocket boosters that used a chlorine-based fuel and **found that chlorine destroys ozone.** One NASA office tried to bury the results and the two scientists were asked to keep the shuttle out of their findings. They wrote a paper that shared the ozone-destroying effects of chlorine but mentioned only volcanoes as a source of chlorine.

**2\. Rowland and Molina, 1974.** These two scientists predicted that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)—industrial chemicals used in aerosols and fridges—would eventually make their way into the stratosphere and, due to UV radiation, break down into compounds that would destroy ozone. The reactions were complicated, but **the proof was simple—if chlorine monoxide was present in the atmosphere, it had definitely come from chlorine breaking down ozone, because there was no other way it could have gotten there.** However, it was hard to measure chlorine monoxide because it's so reactive that when it touches an instrument, it vanishes.

The press covered Rowland and Molina’s work.

### The MOD's Response

The CFC industry responded by doing their own research. The Manufacturing Chemists’ Association gave out millions of dollars in research grants, mainly to universities, and established two PR organizations.

MODs also tampered with the Climate Impact Assessment Program (CIAP) results. In January 1975, **CIAP’s scientists (almost 1,000) concluded that 500 SSTs would likely hugely deplete the ozone layer above the North Atlantic and generally deplete the layer by 10-20%.**

**The Executive Summary, however, didn’t give any of this information. It was written by the Department of Transportation,** and it discussed a yet-to-be-developed version of the SST that wouldn’t harm the ozone layer.

After the summary was released in a press conference, **the press attacked the scientists for being alarmists and unscientific. The public concluded that SSTs wouldn’t hurt the ozone layer.**

### Setting the Record Straight

Some of the scientists tried to publish the real findings behind the misleading executive summary. Newspapers wouldn’t print them. One scientist finally got _Science_ to publish a letter, which forced the Department of Transportation to acknowledge their meddling, but the exchange took place entirely in _Science_ , which the general public doesn’t read.

### Further Exploration of the Science

In January 1975, the Ford administration put together a panel to consider the Inadvertent Modification of the Stratosphere (IMOS). A few months later, **the panel recommended that unless new evidence cleared CFCs, they should no longer be used in any way that could release them to the atmosphere.**

**The IMOS panel asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to look into CFC regulations.** Normally, this job would go to a regulatory government agency, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the NAS’s leadership wasn’t happy with the assignment, but they did it. The president of the NAS put together two panels. Anyone who already had a position on CFCs wasn’t allowed to contribute to the reports.

### The MOD's Response

The CFC industry signed up Richard Scorer, a professor of theoretical mechanics. He went on a tour of the U.S. to denounce the Climate Impact Assessment Program (CIAP) study and in-progress work. **Scorer said that human activities were so small as to have a negligible effect on the atmosphere, and he called ozone destruction fear-mongering.** His tour wasn’t a success—a reporter discovered that he was connected to the CFC industry and he lost his credibility.

Next, **the CFC industry tried to blame atmospheric chlorine on volcanoes**(magma contains dissolved chlorine). If volcanoes, not CFCs, were responsible for the presence of chlorine in the atmosphere, the atmosphere would naturally contain a lot of chlorine due to volcanic eruptions and the effect of CFCs would be negligible.

There had already been some research on volcanic chlorine, but there was uncertainty around the numbers. When volcanoes erupt, they fire far more than just chlorine into the atmosphere. Water vapor is erupted too, and chlorine easily dissolves in water. As a result, **a lot of the volcanic chlorine falls back to the earth as rain rather than remaining in the atmosphere.**

However, no one had measured how _much_ chlorine rains out, so **the CFC’s Council on Atmospheric Sciences tried to prove that most of the chlorine _wouldn’t_ rain out and would instead make its way into the stratosphere. **They studied a volcano in Alaska, but results were deemed “inconclusive” and never released, so presumably, they weren’t favorable.

The CFC industry also tried to claim that there was no proof that chlorine destroyed ozone, or that CFCs broke down to make chlorine, or that CFCs even made it into the stratosphere.

### Further Exploration of the Science

Scientists discovered several important things from 1975-76:

**1\. Chlorine monoxide _was_ present in the stratosphere.** James Anderson built an instrument that could measure it, and he found it. This proved that the reactions Rowland and Molina predicted (CFCs reacted with ozone, breaking it down to produce, among other things, chlorine monoxide) really were happening.

**2\. One of the model numbers was outdated.** Sherry Rowland continued working on ozone and realized that the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) panels had been using a measurement in their models that was probably outdated. Chlorine nitrate breaks down into chlorine and nitrogen in sunlight, and the rate of breakdown hadn’t been measured since the 1950s when scientists found it broke down in the order of minutes. **Rowland remeasured and discovered that it broke down more slowly, which means that _less_ chlorine was in the atmosphere than the NAS’s model had predicted.** Even though Rowland supported a CFC ban, he released the information immediately.

**3\. If we kept releasing CFCs in the same quantities as 1973, the ozone layer would steadily deplete.** The NAS found that the depletion was approximately proportional to the CFCs released—if emissions halved, depletion would halve. Since it was beyond the scope of the NAS’s role to propose policy, they concluded that there was uncertainty in the predictions but that CFCs should be regulated within the next two years. Many organizations called for immediate regulation.

### The MOD's Response

The CFC industry wasn’t expecting such a timeline. **They tried to claim that the study said nothing should be regulated _for at least_ the next two years **when what the NAS actually said was that regulations should be in place _within_ the next two years.

### Policy and Public Action

Regulations were announced in 1977, but interestingly, the public had already turned away from CFCs and chosen to use alternatives, such as roll-on instead of spray-on antiperspirants. CFC use had dropped 75%.

The CFC ban went into effect in 1979.

### Discovery of the Problem—Again

By 1985, the scientific community thought that the science of ozone was fairly well understood. Scientists understood the nitrogen and chlorine reactions, and a shuttle flight had confirmed that the chemicals predicted to exist in the stratosphere actually did.

Then, **the British Antarctic Survey announced that they’d found a large ozone-depleted area over Antarctica.** They’d actually found it back in 1981, but they didn’t believe their results because nothing currently known about ozone chemistry could explain them, so they studied for another four years before announcing their discovery.

Other scientists didn’t believe the results either. In addition to having no chemical explanation, there were two other reasons to doubt them:

  1. One of NASA’s satellites _should_ have picked up the depletion and hadn’t.
  2. The Survey had used only one type of instrument that scientists knew wasn’t always accurate. 



However, when NASA’s**Richard Stolarski rechecked the satellite data, he found that the instrument actually _had_ picked up the depletion, but the concentrations were so low that the instrument’s programming and scientists working with it assumed that the data was bad** and the instrument faulty. The instrument _wasn’t_ faulty, and there really was an “ozone hole” (an area where the ozone concentration was below 150 Dobson units) over the entirety of Antarctica.

### Further Exploration of the Science

No one knew why or how the hole had appeared, but they did know that it was a problem—if it got much bigger, it would overlap with populated areas of Australia and South America, exposing people in these countries to UV radiation.

To find out more, NOAA and NASA sent two expeditions to Antarctica:

  1. **National Ozone Experiment.** Susan Soloman and her team took instruments to the McMurdo Bay research station and measured atmospheric chemistry from the ground.
  2. **The Airborne Antarctica Ozone Experiment (AAOE)** took 400 scientists to Chile and flew two planes out of Punta Arenas to consider the effect of meteorology on ozone. 



Almost every stratospheric scientist was involved with the study and by 1986, there were two theories for what had created the hole.

  1. CFCs reacting with ozone had destroyed it. (Most scientists believed this explanation and the press covered it.)
  2. Atmospheric currents in the Antarctic lifted air from the troposphere (which doesn’t contain much ozone) into the stratosphere. This would make it look like there was a hole when in fact there was no actual depletion.



**In 1987, the AAOE found that the hole was created by _both_ CFC breakdown and the Antarctic’s weather.** There are two weather effects unique to the Antarctic:

  1. **Polar stratospheric clouds** , which are made of ice crystals. Ice crystals speed up the breakdown of CFCs.
  2. **The polar vortex** , which is a strong wind that circles the pole. It prevents air from the rest of the atmosphere (which could contain more ozone) from mixing in with the air at the pole.



### Policy and Public Action

While the U.S. had banned CFCs in 1979, Europe and the Soviet Union hadn’t, and global emissions were increasing. **In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) put together the Montreal Protocol, which required that nations cut CFC emissions in half over a long period of time.** It also required nations to meet regularly to consider new evidence.

### The MOD's Response

In 1987, **Fred Singer argued that ozone depletion was natural and scientists were using “the ozone scare” to get more funding.** He published an article in the _Wall Street Journal_ in which he emphasized uncertainty, accused scientists of being self-serving and politically motivated, and tried to distract the public.

He wrote:

  * **Depletions weren’t serious, and no one had proved that CFCs caused them.**(Uncertainty did exist, as usual, since science always has uncertainty. However, the Montreal Protocol had taken uncertainty into account—it would be renegotiated regularly as scientists made new discoveries.)
  * **There are many causes of skin cancer besides UV radiation** coming in through ozone-depleted areas. (This was an attempt at distraction.)
  * **Scientists who had insisted supersonic transport emissions might destroy ozone had overreacted and were wrong.**(This referred to the Climate Impact Assessment Program (CIAP) study with the inaccurate executive summary written by the Department of Transportation.) Therefore, the scientists were probably overreacting now too.
  * **There were other explanations for what appeared to be an ozone hole.** For example, according to Singer, some scientists think ozone moves around the atmosphere, so while it might look like ozone is being depleted, it’s really just somewhere else. (This was ridiculous, because the satellite data covered the entire planet, so if ozone really was moving around, scientists would know about it.)



### Further Exploration of the Science

As Singer had pointed out, there were still uncertainties in ozone science. For example, the ground-based instruments didn’t agree with satellite-based ones, and no one knew which was right.

**Robert Watson established the Ozone Trends Panel to address some of the uncertainty.** In 1988, the panel found that it was the satellite’s numbers that were off but that they could be corrected. It also found that the models had underestimated the depletion.

#### Arctic Expeditions

Scientists also started studying the Arctic for two reasons:

  1. It had similar meteorological conditions to the Antarctic, so it might have a hole too.
  2. More people lived near the Arctic than the Antarctic, so if there _was_ a hole, it would be dangerous.



In 1988, scientists found that there wasn’t a hole but there was depletion:

  * A plane that was measuring chlorine monoxide in the Antarctic flew by Great Slave Lake in Canada. Great Slave isn’t even far enough north to be in the Arctic polar vortex, but the atmosphere above it still had high chlorine monoxide concentrations.
  * Aeronomy Lab scientists measured chlorine and nitrogen in Greenland and found that some of the same chemistry that was happening in the Antarctic was happening in Greenland too.



### The MOD’s Response

In 1988, **Singer tried to publish a letter to explain _his_ theory of what had caused the ozone hole—natural climate variability that resulted in warming of the Earth’s surface and cooling of the stratosphere.** (Cooler temperatures speed up the reactions that destroy ozone.)

Since the variability was natural, it would eventually tip back the other way and return ozone levels to what they had been previously. Nothing had to change.

**Singer cherry-picked sections of two papers that discussed the relationship between surface warming and stratospheric cooling to support his position.** (If read in full, both these papers discussed why warming of the surface and cooling of the stratosphere _weren’t_ natural.) But Singer just cited the parts that worked for him:

**1\. V. Ramanathan** predicted that as more heat was trapped closer to Earth’s surface in the troposphere, less would make it into the stratosphere, so it would cool.

**2\. James E. Hansen** made a graph of unnatural surface warming and Singer used the graph to suggest that it _was_ natural.

**Singer’s theory wasn’t impossible, but it discounted 10 years of evidence, and _Science_ refused to publish Singer’s letter.** He eventually published in _EOS_ , the American Geophysical Union’s newsletter.

### Further Scientific Exploration

Watson of the Ozone Trends Panel organized the Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE). A plane flew out of Norway throughout January and February 1989, and scientists found that the nitrogen and chlorine levels were similar to the Antarctic. The last flight found that chlorine monoxide concentrations were actually _higher_ than in the south. However, **the Arctic’s vortex wasn’t as strong and it wasn’t as cold as Antarctica, so that’s why there wasn’t a hole.**

### The MOD's Response

In 1989, Singer wrote a doubt-mongering letter in _National Review_ that:

  * **Complained about how hard it had been to get his 1988 letter published.**
  * **Attacked scientists,** accusing them of seeking funding, prestige, media attention, and having the desire to save the world. He also accused them of hastiness, which weakened his other accusations—if scientists really _had_ been after funding, they would have dragged out the research as long as they could.
  * **Claimed that a scientist named Dobson had actually been the one to notice the hole, and he found it back in 1956.** If the hole had existed this long, then it _couldn’t_ have been caused by CFCs because they weren’t in high concentrations in the stratosphere at that time. (Dobson had discovered some other things about ozone, but he definitely didn’t discover the hole.)
  * **Claimed that CFC substitutes would be ineffective, dangerous, and expensive.** (No substitutes existed at the time. However, when they _were_ invented, they weren’t toxic, corrosive, expensive, or energy inefficient—they were all better than CFCs.)



### Policy and Public Action

It was now clear that CFCs were damaging the ozone layer, and regulations could be based on evidence rather than the predictions. **The CFC industry realized they were damaging the ozone layer and stopped fighting.**

  * For example, one of the Ozone Trends Panel members was a chemist who worked for DuPont, a CFC producer. He convinced the company that the findings were critical, and DuPont’s executives decided that they’d stop producing CFCs within the decade.



**In June 1990, the Montreal Protocol banned the creation of CFCs and other chlorine-releasing chemicals.** The deadlines ranged from 2000-2040.

### Further Scientific Exploration

Scientists kept researching ozone depletion and the atmosphere, but mainly because they were concerned about CFC substitutes and their meteorological effects, not because there was any doubt that CFCs damage the stratosphere.

### The MOD's Response

It was common in the early 1990s for capitalists to believe regulating the environment would lead to socialism, and Singer and other MODs didn’t give up. The Marshall Institute, _Washington Times_ , _National Review,_ and other anti-Communist or pro-business publications published Singer, and other scientists joined him to blame ozone depletion on volcanoes (even though scientists had cleared up the volcano question years earlier).

  * For example, **in 1990, Dixy Lee Ray published _Trashing the Planet_ , a book that attacked science and the environmental movement.** She made use of doubt-mongering techniques—she left out scientific evidence that didn’t suit her and cited skeptics and critics, including Singer. Ray was a zoologist and had been the chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, so she appeared credible, and the book received a lot of media attention 



### Setting the Record Straight

In 1993, Sherry Rowland started to worry about the spread of this inaccurate information and tried to clear things up in a presidential address by re-explaining the science of volcanoes and how chlorine reaches the stratosphere. **It didn’t take—the media had spread Ray’s information to the general public.**

### The MOD's Response

From 1994-1995, Singer kept repeating his claims and in 1995 acted as a witness in congressional hearings on “scientific integrity.” **Singer said that Robert Watson’s testimony was inaccurate and ozone depletion wasn’t a problem.**

Then, **Sherry Rowland and two other scientists won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry** for their work on ozone in the stratosphere, which clearly demonstrated that their science was widely accepted. **Singer responded by attacking the Nobel committee for making a political statement.**

The Montreal Protocol held and CFCs stayed banned, but Singer’s work definitely had an effect—politicians still trusted him, and **Ray and Singer’s claims that scientists were untrustworthy and crooked was hard to shake and would persist into the future.**
