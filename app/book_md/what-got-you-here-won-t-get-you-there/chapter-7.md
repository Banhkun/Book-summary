## Chapter 7: Starting the Process of Change

You’ve gathered feedback from your colleagues. You’ve used that feedback to identify which bad habit you’re going to try to overcome. Now, it’s time to actually **start the process of change** : to begin to cut your bad habit out of your life.

It’s important that you **start the process of change as soon as possible** after deciding which behavior you’re going to tackle. For example, don’t fall into the trap of putting change off until a time when you’re “less busy.” As an already successful person, you’re _always_ going to be busy. Bite the bullet and start to cut out your bad behavior _now._ The sooner you start, the sooner you’ll begin to make progress.

### Shortform Note: The Practicalities of Change

Goldsmith doesn’t provide much information on the practicalities of making a behavioral change: for example, the steps you can take each day to reduce your temptation to engage in your bad habits and replace bad behaviors with healthier ones. Here are some practical tips we’ve devised to help you with this process:

  * Each day, **make a conscious effort to acknowledge and analyze each time you engage in your bad behavior.** Record all of the details about the circumstances that preceded you slipping into your bad habit—for example, who you were with, what you were working on or talking about, and how you were feeling. This will help you to identify the triggers and patterns of your bad behavior. For instance, you might find that you’re at particular risk of acting harmfully when you’re stressed or starting to get tired at the end of the day.
  * Once you’ve discerned the various triggers for your bad behavior, you can begin the work of **actively stopping yourself from engaging in it**. If you know that you’re about to enter a situation that, in the past, has led to you behaving badly, you can mentally prepare for this and consciously try to implement the alternative “healthier” behavior that corresponds to your bad habit.
  * Successfully cutting out your bad behavior may be difficult at first. Habits are hard to break. But over time, behaving in a healthier way will become easier and easier. 



### Avoid Getting Overwhelmed

The idea of changing your behavior may seem incredibly overwhelming, especially if you decide to**immediately jump from one behavioral extreme to another** —for instance, from being a rude jerk who makes destructive comments all the time to being a benevolent boss who’s incredibly polite and kind. Making such a huge personality change might seem too difficult to achieve or too daunting to even attempt.

To avoid feeling overwhelmed, you could start the process of change by **shifting into behaving neutrally** — in a way that’s neither harmful nor “good.” In practice, this means cutting out your bad behavior _without_ instantly trying to replace it with something “better.” For example, you could stop making destructive remarks to your colleagues without immediately switching to making lots of kind remarks.

While ”just” cutting out a bad behavior still takes a lot of work, it requires considerably less effort than ceasing a behavior _and_ introducing a new one all at once. It’s therefore a much less overwhelming prospect.

The one caveat to this option is that **it’s not always possible**. Some behaviors simply don’t have a “neutral” option—you must either engage in the bad behavior, or switch to its positive equivalent. Take the example of the bad habit of refusing to listen to other people. The only way to overcome this bad behavior is to actively start listening to people. There’s no neutral, in-the-middle alternative action to choose here.

If you find yourself in a situation where you’re feeling overwhelmed at the prospect of transforming your behavior but have no “neutral” option to fall back on, try to remind yourself that while the change ahead of you will be difficult and take a lot of effort, **it’ll be worth it in the end**. With time and hard work, you _will_ be able to successfully cut out your bad habit and introduce your new, healthier behavior.

Likewise,**don’t put pressure on yourself to fully change your behavior overnight**. Even if, at first, you only successfully implement your new, healthier behavior once each day, that’s still progress. This is a big transformation you’re making. Permit yourself to take your time with it.

### Resisting Change

You might think that once successful people learn that they’re behaving in a harmful way, they immediately decide that they want to change for the better. They want to quickly eradicate their bad habits so that they stop hurting their colleagues and their own reputation.

However, this isn’t always the case. Often, **successful people find the idea of changing their behavior very difficult to accept.** Goldsmith argues that this is due to successful people developing the superstitious delusion that their bad habit was a major factor in generating their professional success up to this point. They believe that if they cease their bad behavior, they’ll only experience failure in the future. Therefore, any calls for them to cut out the bad habit are met with extreme hostility.

To illustrate this superstition in action, Goldsmith relates the example of a past client of his named Harry. Harry was a respected executive who got great results for his company. However, he had one flaw: He was a terrible listener. This damaged Harry’s working relationships and made people reluctant to share ideas with him, since they knew he wouldn’t pay attention to them.

When people suggested to Harry that he should improve his listening skills, he became very defensive. At the root of this defensiveness was superstition. Harry believed that refusing to listen to others was the secret to his success because it meant his mind didn’t become cluttered with other people’s bad ideas. Instead, he could focus on his own, good ideas. He fundamentally believed that if he changed his behavior and started to listen to others, his performance would suffer.

Of course, this almost certainly wasn’t true. Harry could probably cope with the mental strain of both contemplating his own ideas and listening to other people’s. His performance wouldn’t suffer if he cut out this bad habit, and his reputation would definitely improve. But, his superstitious belief had convinced him that changing would be a disaster.

#### Overcoming Superstition

If you find that you’ve become superstitious about a bad habit and therefore feel reluctant to change it, Goldsmith suggests that you take the time to **fully analyze how beneficial this behavior has actually been to you**. You could start by making a list of all the ways in which you believe this behavior has helped you to succeed. For instance, Goldsmith’s client Harry would probably note down his belief that refusing to listen to people has helped to keep his mind clear of other people’s bad ideas.

Then, you could make a list of all the ways that your behavior has damaged your potential to progress—for instance, the ways in which it’s harmed other people, hurt your reputation, and stunted your growth as a person and a leader. For example, in this list, Harry might note that his refusal to listen has made his employees feel marginalized and ignored, and has consequently given him a bad reputation. Likewise, he might add that by refusing to hear other people’s suggestions, he’s not only shut himself off from their bad ideas, but from their good ones, too.

Once you’ve made these two lists, **you’ll probably find that your bad behavior does much more harm than good, and you’ve succeeded _in spite of_ it, not _because of_ it.** You’ll hopefully feel more certain that you _do_ need to change.

### Tips on Motivating Yourself to Change

Goldsmith provides two tips on how to motivate yourself to start and continue the process of change:

**Tip #1: Find a way to measure your progress.** For example, you could track how many times each day you engage in your bad behavior—for instance, get angry, or add value to someone’s ideas. Hopefully, as you progress, that daily number will go down—an achievement that will motivate you to continue. We tend to feel much more willing to continue the process of change if we can tangibly see the results of our hard work.

**Tip #2:** **Monetize the process of change.** Devise a rule that states you have to pay a fine every time you engage in your bad behavior. Set this money aside and tell yourself that you can’t get it back until you’ve consistently stopped behaving badly. This financial penalty for your bad behavior will motivate you to cut it out.
