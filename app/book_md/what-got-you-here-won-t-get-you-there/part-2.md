## Part 2: Overcoming Your Bad Habits | Chapter 6: Identifying Your Bad Habits

We’ve discussed the 21 bad habits that many successful people adopt. Now, it’s time to explore **how to overcome these bad habits** and improve your reputation in the wake of the damage you’ve caused.

**Overcoming your bad habits is a process consisting of three steps:**

  1. Identifying which bad habits you’ve adopted and which habit needs changing first
  2. Devising and implementing a “plan of action”—a framework for exactly how you’re going to break your habit
  3. Discussing your plan to change your behavior—and, eventually, your progress—with others



Following this process and overcoming your habits isn’t going to be quick or easy. It could take a year or more for you to totally cut out your bad behaviors, and doing so will require a lot of work. Likewise, it may take a long time for your reputation to fully recover from the damage your bad habits have inflicted.

However, **this process is well worth the time and effort it demands**. If you pursue it to its conclusion, you’ll develop the people skills and the good reputation required to progress to the top of the corporate ladder.

### How to Identify Your Bad Habits

The first step in changing your bad habits is identifying which of the 21 bad behaviors you’ve actually adopted. Goldsmith argues that the easiest way to do this is to **solicit feedback from your colleagues**. Actively approach the people you work with and ask them which elements of your behavior they’re unhappy with and would like to see improved. If many colleagues say that they’re unhappy with the same two or three behaviors, you’ll know that these are the major bad habits you’ve slipped into.

You might think that you don’t need to ask your colleagues what your bad habits are, because you’ve already identified them yourself. Even if this is the case, it’s still helpful to ask your colleagues for their views on your behavior. **Ultimately, even the most self-aware of people can be totally blind to some of their flaws.** Your colleagues may help you to identify a bad behavior that you weren’t aware of.

### How to Solicit Feedback

There are several ways to solicit feedback. One option is to simply ask your colleagues the open-ended question, “What do you think I need to do to improve as a colleague, team member, or leader?” This gives people free rein to describe your bad behaviors and areas for improvement.

Another option is to distribute a questionnaire in which your colleagues score you on how well you fulfill certain criteria—for instance, how good of a listener you are, or how good you are at sharing information with people. If you consistently get low scores on certain positive behaviors, or high scores on negative behaviors, you’ll know that these are your “problem areas.”

No matter which approach you take to soliciting feedback, make sure that your questions **specifically ask for comments on your behavior** , not simply people’s opinions of you as a person. For example, don’t ask general questions such as “What do you like and dislike about me?” or “How do you feel about me?”

While the responses to these questions will give a good indication of whether your colleagues like you or not, they probably won’t include information on _why_ exactly they dislike you and which of your behaviors they take issue with. In short, these questions won’t help you to figure out which bad habits you’ve developed and what you need to do to change.

### Who Should You Ask for Feedback?

Once you’ve decided _how_ you’re going to ask for feedback, you need to figure out _who_ you’re going to ask. Goldsmith argues that the most effective way to solicit feedback is to take a “360-degree” approach. **This means** **asking people from all levels of your organization for feedback** **on your performance:** your bosses, your peers, and your subordinates. Solicit feedback from multiple people at each level to make sure you receive a diverse array of opinions.

(Shortform note: You can find many sample 360-degree feedback forms and tools online. Here’s one example.)

Soliciting feedback from colleagues at every level will ensure that you identify _all_ of your bad habits, including the ones that only display themselves when you’re dealing with a certain type of coworker—for instance, just your subordinates. For example, imagine your bad habit is failing to listen to your subordinates specifically. If you only solicited feedback from your bosses and your peers, you might not ever realize that this habit is a problem.

When it comes to selecting precisely _which_ of your peers, bosses, and subordinates to ask for feedback, each potential candidate needs to fit four requirements:

  1. They need to be willing to **let go of the past** —specifically, how your past behavior has hurt them. If people remain too focused on your past sins when giving their feedback, they’ll lean towards giving you harsh criticism rather than helpful tips for improvement. They’ll want to punish you, not help you to become a better person.
  2. They need to **be truthful** and not downplay your issues just to spare your feelings. You’re not going to be able to fully improve upon your bad behaviors if you don’t get a clear and honest picture of how bad they are in the first place.
  3. They need to agree to **make the feedback helpful and supportive** , not overly negative or harsh. What you need right now is helpful tips on how you can move forward, not people telling you that you’re a terrible person who’s failed in numerous ways. 
  4. They need to **commit to improving an element of _their_ behavior**, too. This may seem like a big and counterintuitive thing to ask. After all, this process is supposed to be about _you_ improving, not the other person. However, if you can convince the person giving you feedback to change something about their behavior as well—and if you offer to help them through the process of change—you’ll create a bond between the two of you. You’ll both be going on the same journey of self-improvement, and this commonality of experience will bring you closer. Likewise, this person will be more willing to support you along your self-improvement journey if they think they’re getting support in return.



If you’re struggling to find anyone who fits these criteria,**start with your closest work friend**. It’s probable that they’ll already fit at least some of these requirements because of your close relationship. For example, it’s unlikely that they’ll be bitterly holding past events against you, because if they were, surely they wouldn’t be your friend. Likewise, since they care about you as a friend, they’ll naturally be more likely to offer supportive advice than harsh words.

### Who Should Do the Asking?

Now that you know who to ask for feedback, it’s time to figure out **who’s going to do the asking**. Goldsmith argues that **solicited feedback works best if it’s not requested by you, but confidentially by a third party**. If you personally ask people for feedback on your behavior, it’s very unlikely that they’re going to answer honestly. They may be afraid of upsetting you with negative comments or fear retribution if you don’t like what they say. Therefore, they’re going to keep what they say fairly positive.

In contrast, soliciting feedback confidentially through a third party takes away these reservations. People will no longer worry about how you’re going to respond to what they say because ultimately, you won’t know that they said it. Therefore, people will be encouraged to share their true opinions.

### Other Forms of Feedback

We’ve gone into great detail about how to directly solicit feedback from your colleagues. However, directly asking for feedback isn’t the only way to gather information about your colleagues’ perceptions of you and your behavior. There are two other forms of feedback that may help you to figure out what your problem areas are:

  1. Unsolicited feedback 
  2. Observational feedback



#### Unsolicited Feedback

Unsolicited feedback is, in simple terms, **feedback that you didn’t ask for or necessarily want.** It’s someone telling you that you need to improve in a manner that, to you at least, seems totally unprompted. In reality, your continued bad behavior is probably what triggered the person’s outburst. They probably became so frustrated with the way you were acting that they could no longer keep their opinions to themselves.

For example, imagine you’re hosting a meeting and, for what seems like the hundredth time, you fail to listen to what a colleague is saying. This colleague may finally snap and suddenly call you out for your poor listening skills. This spontaneous “call-out” is unsolicited feedback.

When we receive unsolicited feedback, we’re often completely shocked by the news that someone is upset with our behavior, and may even feel ashamed that our actions have been awful enough to trigger such an unexpected outburst. Goldsmith argues that these emotions may push us to actually change our bad behavior. We may be stunned into realizing that we can’t keep acting in a manner that upsets people this much.

The major downside of this form of feedback is that it usually takes a long time for people to become so frustrated with your behavior that they can no longer hold their tongue. This makes unsolicited feedback very infrequent and therefore unsuitable as a consistent source of information about your bad habits. For this reason, it’s a form of feedback that should probably only be used in conjunction with the others, not by itself.

#### Observational Feedback

**Observational feedback is feedback about your reputation that you can gain by watching how people behave in your presence**. It involves analyzing cues such as people’s body language, their tone of voice, and what they say to you to deduce whether or not you’re well liked.

For example, if you notice in a meeting that a certain colleague refuses to look you in the eye when you’re talking to them, or responds to all of your ideas in a brusque or rude manner, this would imply that you’ve upset the person in some way. Likewise, if a subordinate constantly acts in a closed-off manner around you—for instance, keeping their arms folded and directing their body away from you—they probably don’t like you very much.

Goldsmith argues that if, after gathering observational feedback, you notice that many people are acting in a way that implies they dislike you, this may be a sign that you’re engaging in a bad habit that’s alienating everyone around you.

The good thing about observational feedback is that you can collect it whenever you encounter another person in the workplace. You can quickly and thoroughly build up a picture of what people think of you.

However, the downside of this type of feedback is that it isn’t very specific. While it may indicate to you that you’re doing _something_ to upset your colleagues, it won’t necessarily tell you exactly _what_ you’re doing wrong. You’ll need to use a different type of feedback to figure out this missing piece of the puzzle.

### The Aftermath of Getting Feedback

Once you’ve requested and received feedback from your colleagues, your next step is to interpret and act on their recommendations. If you’re lucky, their feedback will indicate that you only have one bad habit. In this case, your next steps forward will be simple: figure out what you’re going to do to overcome that habit, and get started.

However, if your feedback suggests you’ve been engaging in two or three bad behaviors, the process of starting to change becomes a bit more complex. You’ll need to decide which of your bad habits to address first.

#### Deciding Which Habit to Change First

If you receive feedback that suggests you’ve got multiple bad habits, your initial instinct may be to try to overcome them all as quickly as possible. You may think that ceasing all of your bad behaviors at once will be the most effective and efficient way to become a better colleague and repair your reputation.

However, if you take this approach, **you’ll quickly become overwhelmed**. Unlearning even one bad habit is challenging—it takes a lot of time and energy. Overcomplicating this process by trying to change multiple habits at once will divide your time and energy in too many directions for you to make real progress. You’ll quickly become mentally exhausted and struggle to continue with the process. For this reason, it’s best to stick to fixing one behavior at a time.

So if you should only fix one behavior at a time, which should you choose to tackle first? Goldsmith advises **choosing the flaw that featured the most prominently in your feedback.** For example, if 10% of the people you asked for feedback told you that you were a bad listener, but 80% of respondents said you have a problem with anger, tackle your anger issue first.

Goldsmith argues that the more people bring up a flaw, the more likely it is to be a serious problem. Therefore, frequently mentioned issues should always be at the top of your list of things to change.

#### Resisting the Urge to Get Defensive

When you receive and start to interpret your feedback, it’s important to **resist the urge to get defensive**. In other words, don’t immediately jump to discredit the feedback and claim, either privately or publicly, that it must be incorrect.

In many ways, getting defensive following criticism of your behavior is a natural reaction. Nobody likes to hear that they’ve been acting in a way that other people disapprove of. It knocks your confidence and reminds you that you’re fallible—a concept that, as we’ve already discussed, successful people often struggle to accept. Therefore, you’ll likely do anything to avoid having to accept that you’re not perfect and may need to change your behavior—including outright rejecting your negative feedback.

Ultimately, when you receive your feedback, **you need to accept it as both truthful and probably accurate**. Look at the situation logically. If you’ve followed the process outlined above, you’ll have only asked for feedback from people who’ve promised to be honest. Therefore, it’s highly unlikely that what they’ve said about you is untrue. Likewise, if multiple people have given feedback that highlights the exact same problematic habits, it’s highly unlikely that they’re _all_ wrong.

Accepting that your feedback is correct and that you’ve developed bad habits will likely be a humbling and painful process. However, remind yourself that ultimately, this pain will be worth it. Admitting to and overcoming your bad behaviors will enable you to both progress further in your career, and grow as a person.
