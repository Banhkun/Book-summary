## Exercise: Review Your Science Literacy and Education

Sagan argues improving science literacy and education would greatly benefit society. Letâ€™s examine your scientific knowledge and education and think about what could be done better.

* * *

Think back on your education. Did you enjoy learning math and science? How much time did you spend learning and applying the scientific method or critical thinking skills? Do you think you should have been taught more in these areas? Why or why not?

How familiar are you with the scientific method? How often do you use it in your daily life? Do you regularly read articles about recent scientific discoveries? If so, do you think you do enough to determine if the evidence presented is valid or invalid? Do you feel you even have the know-how to make such a distinction? Why or why not?

How might you use the scientific method to evaluate claims you encounter from media sources? How might it help you determine if something is true or false?
