## Exercise: Examine Your Beliefs and Claims to Knowledge

Sagan argues that we often are resistant to new discoveries because they challenge our existing beliefs. Here, examine your beliefs and think about how they might affect your openness to new information.

* * *

Think about your core beliefs. Pick something you believe in that doesnâ€™t have enough scientific backing to be considered fact. This could be a religious or spiritual belief or simply an opinion you have that shapes the way you view the world. Why do you think you hold this belief?

How does this belief affect your life and the decisions you make, large or small?

What would it take for you to dismiss this belief or believe in something else? Are you more likely to investigate new information if it upholds your beliefs or if it opposes them? Why do you think that is?
