## 1-Page Summary

In his self-help book _Unfu*k Yourself_ , Gary John Bishop aims to increase your understanding of how your mind works so you can use its power to your advantage. Bishop argues that the way you think dictates your reality.**He** **offers seven specific phrases that you can use to reshape your thoughts to improve your outlook on life**.

Bishop has distilled years of research and experience as a life coach and personal development consultant into this book, which was published in 2016. Here, he presents his findings as a set of simple tools for anyone who wants to make profound changes in their life. He sets out to make happiness accessible to you, whatever your circumstances, by showing you how to relate to your experience in a healthy way. After the success of _Unfu*k Yourself_ , Bishop went on to write a companion workbook (_Do The Work_) as well as a sequel (_Stop Doing that Sh*t_), among other books.

(Shortform note: Bishop’s work is part of a trend in self-help publishing starting in the 2010s, with more books embracing an irreverent, informal, and humorous approach. _Unfu*k Yourself_ is often mentioned alongside books like Mark Manson’s _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ and Jen Sincero’s _You Are a Badass_ series. One possible reason behind the phenomenon is that authors and publishers want to reach a wider audience, including readers who don’t see themselves as the type to need or enjoy self-help.)

In this book, Bishop introduces seven phrases designed to combat common negative thought patterns and make you more action-oriented. He calls these personal assertions; we’ll refer to them as power statements. **Bishop says that if you incorporate these power statements into your self-talk, they’ll empower and motivate you to create the life you want.** For this guide, we’ll separate these statements into two groups: those geared toward ending negative patterns and those meant to encourage helpful attitudes. This is based on Bishop’s two steps to achieving freedom from the thoughts that are holding you back:

  * **Step 1)** Stop whatever you’re doing that’s keeping you stuck.
  * **Step 2)** Start doing the things that will get you where you want to go.



This guide presents the statements and explores how they can help you get out of your own way. Because they’re carefully crafted to instill a helpful mindset, we’ll include the exact phrasing Bishop uses, in addition to summarizing each of them. We’ll point out connections to recent scientific research that backs up Bishop’s assertions, as well as similarities to other popular self-help techniques. We’ll also consider some potential contradictions that emerge from Bishop’s approach, and we’ll suggest a few ways you might deepen your exploration if you find yourself wanting to incorporate this book’s advice into your life.

(Shortform note: Neuroscience and psychology studies back up many facets of Bishop’s approach in this book. His recommendations overlap with many techniques from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), which aims to identify problematic thought patterns and train you to think differently. Within this framework, Bishop’s use of power statements is an example of a cognitive restructuring technique because it trains you to notice what you’re thinking and offers you a set of alternative thoughts. Other strategies for cognitive restructuring include learning to question the accuracy of your thoughts and evaluating how helpful they are to you.)

### Take Control of Your Self-Talk

Before we get to the power statements, it’s important to understand what self-talk is and how it affects us.**The term self-talk covers everything we think to ourselves internally—and Bishop argues that it has the power to support or sabotage our efforts to make progress.** He explains that self-talk is powerful: The content of what we say to ourselves and the tone we use has a huge impact on our emotions, moods, and how we perceive the world around us. This, in turn, affects our choices and actions.

Bishop says studies show that people who have positive self-talk are not only happier and more confident but also more productive. The opposite is also true: If you speak harshly to yourself and generate a constant stream of negative messages, you may internalize them, become depressed, and see your performance suffer.

(Shortform note: One study Bishop mentions demonstrated that the language people used to describe an event impacted their mood and their feelings about the event. The article in which the study’s findings were published was later retracted amidst accusations of data manipulation by one of the researchers involved. However, there are numerous other studies that confirm Bishop’s larger point that self-talk impacts how you think, feel, and perform tasks.)

Most of our self-talk happens automatically as we go through daily life. Bishop calls this _narrative_ mode because it comprises the meaning we’re assigning to our experience as it happens, as if we’re telling ourselves a story. Though we’re usually not aware of it, this stream of internal commentary plays like a soundtrack underneath all the scenes of our lives—and it’s often negative. Instead, Bishop proposes switching to _assertive_ self-talk, which is active rather than passive. In assertive mode, you choose what to say to yourself, controlling the message you receive from your own mind.

For example, imagine you’re working at a job you find unfulfilling. You might go through your day thinking, “I can’t believe I’m stuck in this crappy job! How do I always end up in these situations? What’s wrong with me?” Now imagine you’re at the same job, but all day you have thoughts like this: “This job is only temporary! I know I can find something better. I deserve to feel inspired in my work.” With that kind of encouragement from your brain, you’re more likely to feel motivated to work on your cover letter when you get home, which gets you one step closer to getting a new job.

(Shortform note: While Bishop characterizes self-talk as _narrative_ and _assertive_ , which focuses on the mode of self-talk (passive or active), some research studies categorize it based on the content: _negative, positive, motivational, and instructional_. Some of Bishop’s power statements would fall into the motivational category, which is meant to empower and inspire. This type of self-talk has proven benefits, including improving athletic performance, mood, and mental sharpness.)

As the example illustrates, it’s not your circumstances (like a frustrating job) that make you unhappy—it’s the way you frame them. Bishop’s power statements are meant to help you intervene in your negative, narrative self-talk with self-affirming messages. By focusing on these statements, he argues that **you can gradually build the habit of using positive, assertive self-talk, profoundly shifting your way of interpreting yourself and your life.** Put another way, the power statements are a way for the conscious mind to speak directly to the unconscious.

Additionally, all the statements are in the present tense, Bishop stresses, because they’re designed to be a forceful intervention in the moment, not a description of what you’re hoping to be or do in the future. If you continue to reinforce these statements, they’ll eventually become as automatic and effortless as your negative thoughts are now.

> **Making Affirmations Count**
> 
> Repeating carefully chosen phrases is a widely recommended strategy for creating change at the unconscious level. However, one thing that distinguishes Bishop’s approach from other popular positive mindset tools is that he prescribes the same language for everyone. In contrast, other experts suggest writing your own affirmations, specifically tailored to the patterns you’re trying to overcome. Additionally, some experts add that you can reinforce your motivational phrases by adding a physical gesture or movement to accompany the words, repeating the phrases while walking, or focusing on a specific memory that brings up the feeling of the affirmation you want to instill.
> 
> Although affirmations are a widespread technique, there’s some evidence that they may not be effective for everyone, or that they may only work under certain circumstances. One study showed that in some cases positive affirmations had the opposite of the intended effect, making people who had low self-esteem feel _worse_ about themselves. In light of those findings, some experts propose targeting low self-esteem through other means, such as reducing the tendency to compare yourself to others, nurturing your interpersonal relationships, and practicing receiving praise. This could be pursued before or in conjunction with positive affirmations, in order to make them more effective.

#### Uncover Your Deepest Beliefs

**While the assertive power statements in the book are meant to redirect your self-talk, they also guide you to transform the underlying beliefs at the root of that self-talk.** You may not realize you hold these convictions at all, which is why they’re known as unconscious beliefs. As Bishop explains, neuroscientists have proven that while your conscious mind feels like it’s the one calling the shots, in fact, most of what you do is determined by your subconscious opinions about who you are and what you can expect from your surroundings. These opinions may have formed in response to early childhood experiences. As a result, they might be irrational, or even the opposite of what you consciously believe.

This becomes a problem because it’s extremely difficult to make changes that contradict your unconscious beliefs, even if you really want to. For instance, returning to the scenario where you’re stuck in a dead-end job, suppose a friend asked you why you were still working there. You’d probably have an explanation that made sense to your conscious mind, such as, “I’ve been so busy lately that I haven’t had a chance to look for a new job.” You probably wouldn’t say, “Failure is so painful that it’s best not to try.” But if, below the level of conscious thought, some part of you has decided that’s true, it could be the real reason you haven’t filled out any applications.

In this way, the obstacles to progress can often be found deep within you. That’s why three of Bishop’s power statements guide you to confront beliefs that might have been invisible to you until now. Next, we’ll take a closer look at each of these three.

> **Unconscious Beliefs Also Create Social Biases**
> 
> While Bishop’s focus in this book is on helping individuals reach their full potential, unconscious beliefs can also have an impact at a societal level, as in the case of implicit bias. In _Biased_ , Jennifer Eberhardt delves into the science and sociology of unconscious racial bias to show how the brain’s natural tendencies to make assumptions and sort people into categories, combined with a culture of pervasive anti-Blackness, results in widespread racial bias. According to Eberhardt, you may not be aware of these prejudices, but they affect what you notice in your environment and how you interact with others. She argues this type of bias has profound implications in areas like education, housing, and criminal justice.

### Step 1: Stop Holding Yourself Back

According to Bishop, **in order to pinpoint what’s prevented you from achieving your goals so far, you need to identify and transform any beliefs you have that might be holding you back.** This is the first step to freedom. It involves a lot of deep reflection, and Bishop says you’ll need to make sure all parts of you, conscious and unconscious, are fully on board and ready to tackle the challenge. The first three statements we’ll look at will guide you through an honest self-assessment and motivate you to take action.

#### Change Is Your Responsibility

**Power statement:** “I am willing.”

**Best used:** To assert that you’re ready to change

Bishop tells us that willingness is an energized, empowered state from which you can take action. To reach this state, recognize that**no matter what happens to you that you can’t control, you can always choose how to respond.** Claiming that power includes accepting that your own choices have brought you to wherever you are today, and you can’t place the blame on other people or outside circumstances.

It can be hard to admit that part of what’s been holding you back is that you haven’t been willing to make changes. In some sense, Bishop says, you’ve chosen to end up here, and you have tolerated the status quo—otherwise, you would have already made changes. Ask yourself if you’re willing to do what it takes to get unstuck and go after your goals, and answer honestly. If you’re ready now, you can embrace the idea that you are responsible for your own life, and let that sense of agency motivate you to get going.

As an alternative, Bishop suggests that **if it’s hard for you to feel enthusiasm for pursuing your goals, you can achieve the same results by focusing on your _unwillingness_ to accept the status quo any longer**. In this case, your drive and determination come when you decide you will _not_ tolerate the way things are. Either way, the hope is you’ll be eager to take action.

> **Responsibility Isn’t Blame**
> 
> Taking responsibility for your own life is a topic which, if not handled delicately, can cause feelings of anger, guilt, or self-hatred, as you realize that there’s no one but yourself to blame for where you’ve ended up.
> 
> In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson handles this in part by elaborating on the difference between blame and responsibility and how you can take responsibility for your actions without blaming yourself for things that aren’t your fault. One of the ways he draws this distinction is by asserting that blame exists in the past (how did this happen?) while responsibility exists in the present (it’s up to you what to do now). This echoes Bishop’s insistence on taking action in the present moment, and his reasoning for framing his power statements in the present tense.

On the other hand, if after careful reflection you discover that you’re not willing to do what it would take to change your life in a certain area, Bishop says that’s okay. In fact, consciously recognizing this can still help you feel better. Once you’ve acknowledged that the work to improve your situation is more than you’re prepared to do, you can stop wanting your life to be different and make peace with where you are. According to Bishop, this is particularly helpful if you struggle with jealousy or comparing yourself to others. What someone else has might be nice, but if you already know you’re not willing to do what it would take to get that for yourself, it can’t torture you anymore, and there’s no mystery of “why not me?”

> **The Power of Self-Awareness**
> 
> “I am willing” is the first power statement Bishop introduces in the book, and while we’ve tweaked the order of the others for the purposes of this guide, we start with this one because Bishop’s discussion of it implies that confirming you’re willing to change in at least one particular area of your life is a necessary prerequisite before you can begin the work of self-improvement.
> 
> Paradoxically, while Bishop frames this assertion as, “I am willing,” in his explication he treats it as a question you need to ask yourself, to discover whether you’re willing or not. Examining your own level of willingness requires self-awareness. In contrast to Bishop’s assertion that this self-awareness can help you make peace with your _unwillingness_ to change, others say that self-awareness tends to increase your willingness: When you’re clear-eyed about what’s holding you back, you’ll likely be more motivated to change.

#### Your Brain Wants to Be Right

**Power statement:** “I am wired to win.”

**Best used:** To motivate you to change your beliefs

According to Bishop, **this power statement serves to remind you that what you believe internally will determine the life you build externally.** By “wired to win,” Bishop means that our brains are set up to prove themselves right, subtly directing you to create a reality that confirms your unconscious beliefs. Therefore, in order to achieve the life you want, you’ll need to make sure you have the beliefs to match, even at the unconscious level.

(Shortform note: Although Bishop’s word choice—”I am wired to win”—sounds affirming and positive, it’s more nuanced. Bishop uses the word “win” to make the point that your mind ensures you bring all your beliefs to fruition, _regardless of what those beliefs are_. If you unconsciously believe you’re a loser, your life will reflect that—and in proving you right, technically you’ll be winning at being a loser. So rather than an affirmation, “I am wired to win” is more of a warning, as in, “Remember that your deepest beliefs will come true, so you better get to work on shifting them to align with your goals.”)

To bring your beliefs into alignment with your goals, **ask yourself what you want your life to look like, then consider what beliefs would be confirmed by that life**. Specifically, Bishop says to consider an area of your life where you’re struggling or feeling stuck, and ask yourself what belief is proven right by your current situation. For example, if you always seem to be broke, ask yourself what opinion that confirms. You may discover a belief that you need someone else to take care of you, or that financial success would alienate you from the people you love, or that stability would be boring.

Once you can spot the beliefs that don’t serve you, Bishop says, you can replace those old beliefs with new ones by focusing on your goals, imagining the steps and actions that will be required along the way, and considering what mindset you will need to successfully perform those actions at each stage.

> **How to Break Your Unconscious Thought Patterns**
> 
> In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins also advises you how to identify and transform your unconscious beliefs. Robbins goes into detail about how these beliefs form and promotes a process he calls Neuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC) to reshape these beliefs using the following six steps:
> 
>   * Determine what you want to change, and identify any pain or fear you associate with making the change.
> 
>   * Create a sense of urgency by focusing on what the negative consequences will be if you don’t change and the benefits you’ll gain if you do.
> 
>   * Any time you notice yourself falling into old patterns, disrupt them by doing something completely different. For example, if you realize that your thoughts are focused on self-doubt, stop and give yourself a big hug.
> 
>   * Create a new positive pattern that brings you as much satisfaction as the old one.
> 
>   * Reinforce your new pattern by visualizing and rehearsing that behavior in your mind.
> 
>   * Test the strength of your new habit by challenging it to see how you react: Put yourself in a situation that used to trigger your old pattern, and notice if you have the urge to act according to the old pattern or the new one.
> 
> 


#### It Is What It Is (Not What It _Should_ Be)

**Power statement:** “I expect nothing and accept everything.”

**Best used:** To challenge your expectations

Another aspect of our unconscious mind that plays a big role in how we relate to our lives is our expectations. **Without being aware of it, we hold expectations about what should happen or how we thought things would go, and we’re constantly comparing reality to that ideal.** Again, Bishop instructs, consider an area of your life that isn’t going well, and you may discover that your dissatisfaction is a result of expectations you’re unaware you were holding. He recommends writing down what you thought this part of your life would look like, and then writing down a description of how it actually is. The gap between the two is most likely what’s making you unhappy.

(Shortform note: Bishop’s power statements, as well as the thinkers he chooses to quote throughout the book, suggest he draws inspiration from stoic philosophy as found in books such as Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman’s _The Daily Stoic_.. In particular, the concept of “expect nothing and accept everything” closely mirrors the stoics’ view that you should closely observe and examine your assumptions, and that the best approach is to receive life as it is, without wanting it to be different.)

Maybe you expected that by your age you would have achieved certain career milestones, but they’re still far off, or you ended up in a different career entirely. Maybe your vision of what it would be like to have a baby isn’t matching up with your reality now that you have one. Bishop says if you could let go of the expectations, you wouldn’t be struggling. You could just respond to what’s really happening in your life. He clarifies that accepting everything doesn’t mean that you don’t have goals or make plans to achieve them—but instead that you leave room for flexibility so that you can respond to your experience on its own terms, rather than comparing it to an ideal that doesn’t exist.

In encouraging you to revisit your expectations, Bishop employs a similar logic as he does when discussing unwillingness. Though Bishop doesn’t explicitly connect the two ideas, they both assume you can improve your well-being by setting aside what you feel you _should_ do in favor of a more accurate assessment of what you truly _intend to do_.

> **How to Let Go of Your Expectations**
> 
> In _Solve For Happy_ , Mo Gawdat elaborates on the idea that your perceptions and expectations determine your happiness. Over the course of the book, Gawdat offers strategies for aligning your perceptions and expectations, and he lays out a multi-step process for replacing common misconceptions that prevent you from being happy with a more supportive framework. This involves:
> 
>   * Realizing your inner voice is not your self, so you can choose how to respond to it
> 
>   * Being less attached to your physical body, which is also not your self
> 
>   * Admitting your knowledge is limited, so being wrong doesn’t have to upset you
> 
>   * Letting go of ideas of the past and future in order to be present now
> 
>   * Putting in effort while accepting that the results may be beyond your control
> 
>   * Challenging your fears instead of believing they keep you safe
> 
> 


### Step 2: Ensure Your Success

So far, we’ve examined three power statements Bishop offers for identifying and changing unconscious thought patterns that might be holding you back. Next, we’ll look at the remaining four statements, which describe the attitudes the author urges you to cultivate in yourself in order to achieve happiness and success. Each statement addresses a type of resistance you will encounter as you go after your goals. Basically, **the solution is the same in each situation: do it anyway, and don’t give up**.

(Shortform note: Many self-help approaches agree with Bishop’s suggestion that you must take active steps to cultivate a new mindset. Some go as far as detailing specific instructions on how to integrate retraining your brain into your daily routine. In _The Happiness Advantage_ , for instance, Shawn Achor suggests writing about a positive experience for 20 minutes, three times a week. Alternatively, Hal Elrond’s _The Miracle Morning_ instructs you to incorporate positive affirmations into a daily morning routine that also includes visualization, writing, and other elements.)

#### You Can Handle This

**Power statement:** “I got this.”

**Best used:** When things don’t go your way

This affirmation is all about putting challenges into perspective, not letting them loom larger than they really are. **You’ve dealt with setbacks and found solutions before, Bishop counsels, and you can do it again.** The key is taking each problem on its own terms, not allowing feelings of overwhelm or failure to spread and affect your overall outlook.

Bishop explains how to use actual evidence from your past to give weight to the statement, “I got this.” Imagine your whole life stretched along a timeline from past to future, and visualize yourself walking along, reviewing all the times in the past that you had problems and overcame them. Along with the disappointments, this helps you review your greatest successes. The point is that life is full of ups and downs, and eventually the current incident you’re dealing with will take its place in the gallery with all the rest. Use this statement when unexpected challenges pop up, and don’t let yourself get derailed.

(Shortform note: This tendency your mind has to leap to a false conclusion when something goes wrong—”It’s all ruined! I can’t get anything right!”—is an example of what cognitive therapy calls _globalizing or overgeneralizing_. In _Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond_ , Judith S. Beck explains that you can counter a globalizing thought by replacing it with a more realistic one like, “This setback is disappointing, but the project can still succeed.” The idea is to shrink the problem back down to its proper size, which is the same work that Bishop’s phrase is performing, as the wording “I got this” implies the challenge in question is manageable.)

#### Just Keep Going

**Power statement:** “I am relentless.”

**Best used:** When you feel like giving up

**If you cultivate the ability to keep going, regardless of the odds or the obstacles you face, you can achieve great things.** Bishop says that progress is not always obvious while it’s happening, but if you refuse to give up, you’ll reach the finish line eventually. Bishop offers this statement as a tool to keep you moving forward even when you lose motivation, or when other people doubt or discourage you. Every time a problem gets in your way, he advises, direct all your energy to solving it, and don’t stop until you do.

> **Can You Become Relentless?**
> 
> The capacity to keep going no matter what, which Bishop calls relentlessness, is widely recognized as an important component of success. For instance, in _Grit_ , Angela Duckworth defines grit as the intersection of persistence and passion; in other words, having a goal you care deeply about and pursuing it consistently over time.
> 
> Just as Bishop argues that you can train yourself to become relentless, Duckworth maintains that grit isn’t something you’re born with, but a quality you develop through experience. That claim is debated, and studies show conflicting results. The answer matters because this quality is so crucial to achievement—if you can build it in yourself or instill it in your children, it would mean anyone could develop this key skill for success

#### You Don’t Need to Be Sure

**Power statement:** “I embrace the uncertainty.”

**Best used:** When you’re tempted to stick with what you know

Bishop maintains that any growth or achievement requires you to go beyond your comfort zone and accept some amount of risk. **In order to pursue your dreams, you need to be able to push on despite uncertainty.** Doing so is uncomfortable, because your natural tendency is to stay where you’re safe, but Bishop advises working against this tendency. He says the ability to tolerate uncertainty is a quality many highly successful people have in common.

Build up your threshold for uncertainty by starting with small, low-stakes risks that take you out of your daily routines. From there, you can slowly ramp up to making bigger moves that go against your habits or even your sense of who you are, if those behaviors or attitudes conflict with your goals. Keep in mind, however, this power statement calls for you to _embrace_ uncertainty, not just grudgingly _tolerate_ it—that implies he wants you to embark on these experiments in unpredictability with an attitude of celebration for the surprises to come rather than dread.

(Shortform note: One scientifically proven way to increase your tolerance for uncertainty is mindfulness meditation. One possible reason, which Dan Harris describes in _10% Happier_ , is that meditation requires you to focus on the present moment, presumably pulling your attention away from worrying about some uncertain future. As you sit in meditation, you naturally feel urges to talk, move around, check your messages, adjust the temperature, and so on. You notice them and let them go. Thoughts and feelings come up, but you don’t let them take over. By learning to observe these impulses but not focus on them or act on them, you are training yourself to keep pursuing your purpose despite feeling uncomfortable.)

#### You Are Stronger Than Your Negative Thoughts

**Power statement:** “I am not my thoughts; I am what I do.”

**Best used:** When motivation runs out and negative thoughts take over

**Bishop insists that your actions don’t have to match your thoughts and feelings—so you can still act in your best interest, even when you’re feeling low.** In fact, he says, by taking productive action, you actually build confidence and self-trust that reinforce the positive beliefs you’re working to instill.

It’s not that you ignore what you’re thinking and feeling, but rather that you understand them as one minor part of the whole picture, which doesn’t have to dictate what you do. Bishop acknowledges that the work of changing your unconscious mind through self-exploration and assertive self-talk takes time. As you’re on the journey, there will be times when the old beliefs and unproductive self-talk resurface. The key, according to Bishop, is not to let that stop you from taking the steps you know will get you closer to your goals. If you wait for the right mood or state of mind to come along before moving forward, he says, you’ll never get started.

Though Bishop doesn’t say so explicitly, you can understand this power statement as an aspect of another power statement, “I am relentless,” which we discussed above. If being relentless is the general attitude that lets you confront adversity, “I am not my thoughts” addresses a specific category of obstacle: the one presented by your own state of mind.

> **Which Comes First: Thoughts or Actions?**
> 
> In line with some readers’ criticism that Bishop contradicts himself at times, this advice to _take action despite your thoughts_ seems to counter the premise that _thoughts determine what you do_ and how you experience reality. Either might be true: Scientific studies continue to explore how your thoughts, feelings, and actions can all influence each other—the relationship is complex. So it makes sense that in order to maximize progress you might want to come at it from more than one angle.
> 
> James Clear acknowledges this paradox in _Atomic Habits_. He emphasizes that in order to successfully establish a new habit, it has to align with your sense of who you are—but the way to shift your sense of identity is by doing things that someone with that identity would do. That’s why Clear says you should start by performing the tiniest possible component of each new habit, until your mind builds up enough evidence of success that your self-concept starts to shift. It’s a similar conundrum to the one that confronts Bishop’s method, perhaps because any behavior change has to happen from the inside out and the outside in simultaneously.
