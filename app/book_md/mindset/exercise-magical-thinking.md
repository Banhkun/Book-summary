## Exercise: Magical Thinking

People with fixed mindsets believe that if two people are right for each other, their relationship should always be smooth sailing. The growth-minded view is that it’s not magic — they’ll work together to learn relationship and problem-solving skills.

* * *

When you first started thinking about relationships, what was your view of how they should be? How did your view change as you got older?

Do you or your partner have any fixed-mindset views about your current relationship — for instance, that women aren’t good with money or that your partner should know what you want? When/how do those views come up? How do you handle them?

In what area could you help your relationship by focusing on growth-minded thinking?
