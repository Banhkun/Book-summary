## Exercise: Constructive Criticism

When parents or teachers criticize children, they intend it to be helpful, but often it isn’t because they’re being judgmental, not constructive. To be constructive, criticism must help a child fix something or do something better.

* * *

Think of a time recently when your child made a mistake. How did you react? What did you say? (If you don’t have a child, think of someone you give feedback to, like a team member or a friend.)

How did the child react to your feedback? Was it the reaction you wanted?

How did your criticism help the child to do better next time? How could you have restated it to make it more helpful?
