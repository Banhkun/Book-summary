## Exercise: Groupthink

Fixed-mindset CEOs and organizations are prone to groupthink, in which everyone thinks alike — no one disagrees, raises issues, or criticizes. It can lead to disastrous decisions.

* * *

Can you recall an instance of groupthink in your company or organization? What was the result?

Why do you think dissenters failed to speak up? How could a diversity of views be encouraged in the future?

Does your organization have a fixed (“you either have it or you don’t”) or a growth mindset (“you can grow with effort and mentoring”)? How can you tell?

How does your organization’s mindset make you feel day-to-day at work?
