## Exercise: What’s Your Mindset?

You have a fixed mindset if you believe your intelligence is innate and can’t be changed (I’m just not good at math); that you’re a certain kind of person. You have a growth mindset if you believe you can learn and change basic things about yourself.

* * *

Think of a situation that challenged your abilities — for instance, being asked to give a speech or having to take a test. With which mindset did you approach it? Which was your first inclination: worry about being judged or anticipation for what you could learn?

What would your thoughts and actions have been if you had approached the above situation with the opposite mindset? How would the outcome be different?

Do you have a characteristic that you’ve always thought of as set in stone? What is it? Thinking of it from a growth perspective, how could you change it?
