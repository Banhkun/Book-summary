## Chapter 1: Introduction

In business, as in life, the only thing certain is uncertainty. How, then, can companies survive—even thrive—when the future is unpredictable? _Great by Choice_ , written by bestselling author Jim Collins and management professor Morten T. Hansen, gives some insight into that question through nine years of research, which started in 2002. Around that time, there were many extreme events that rocked the business landscape: The bull market crashed, the government’s financial position deteriorated, the terrorist attacks of 9/11 happened. And yet, some companies successfully navigated through the chaos.

Seeking to understand how some can weather great adversity better than others, the authors analyzed the performance of thousands of organizations during extreme situations. From an initial list of 20,400 companies, Collins and Hansen identified seven case studies that they dubbed **“10X” companies—those that performed better than the industry average by at least 10 times during periods of upheaval.** To get a clearer idea of what these high-performing companies did differently, the authors also identified a comparison company for each 10X company. These comparison companies didn’t perform quite as well, despite being in the same industry, in the same era, with similar opportunities as the 10X companies.

(Shortform note: Collins employs a similar method of comparative historical analysis in a previous book. Read our summary of Good to Great.)

### Narrowing Down the 10X Companies

To be considered a 10X case, an enterprise had to meet three basic criteria:

  1. It must have demonstrated consistently impressive results in both its industry and in the stock market over 15+ years.
  2. It must have achieved these results during tumultuous times marked by unforeseen events.
  3. It must have been a young organization and/or started small before its spectacular rise.



Given these parameters, the authors narrowed down the 10X cases—and their comparison companies (in parentheses)—to the following:

  * Amgen (comparison company: Genentech)
  * Biomet (Kirschner)
  * Intel (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. or AMD)
  * Microsoft (Apple)
  * Progressive (Safeco)
  * Southwest Airlines (Pacific Southwest Airlines or PSA)
  * Stryker (United States Surgical Corporation or USSC)



(Shortform note: To learn more about the authors’ research methodologies, refer to the appendix section "Research Foundations" in _Great by Choice_.)

While the findings common among the 10X companies are no guarantee that an enterprise will be able to weather any storm, following their principles will likely give you a better chance of success than if you followed the comparisons’.

Note that the research tracked only up until 2002, so it’s entirely possible that the 10X companies no longer boast the same performance they once did. (On the flip side, comparison companies might have also made the jump from good to great, as in the case of Apple under Steve Jobs.) The authors examined these companies during their dynastic eras, or the 15+ years largely before the 2000s, so the research gives a snapshot of a period of stellar performance. Think of it as looking at a sports team’s dynasty—analyzing a company’s sustained performance over an era can still give useful insights, even if that era has already passed.

### Debunking Myths

The research, which consisted of 7,000 historical documents that painted a picture of a company’s evolution from founding to 2002, dispels a lot of myths when it comes to successful organizations and leaders. Succeeding chapters will discuss all of these myths:

  * **Myth 1: Successful leaders are big, bold, visionary risk-takers.** The evidence suggests that successful leaders rely more on empirical data than vision, and more on discipline and obsessive preparation than big risks.
  * **Myth 2: Successful companies are innovators.** Some 10X companies didn’t innovate as much as their comparisons. They did, however, approach innovation in a way that increased their chances for success, combining it with creativity and discipline and having the ability to scale it. 
  * **Myth 3: Successful leaders have to move fast, all the time.** Instead of focusing on speed, 10X leaders focus more on timing.
  * **Myth 4: Successful companies keep up with a drastically changing environment by making their own drastic changes.** The evidence shows that 10X companies changed less than their counterparts, even when the world around them was changing wildly.
  * **Myth 5: Successful companies are just luckier than others.** The companies had a fairly even number of lucky breaks and misfortunes. The difference: 10X companies knew how to deal with the hand they were dealt.
