## Exercise: Practice the Three Discipline Steps

You may wonder what the techniques we’ve discussed in this guide look like in practice. Let’s examine how to put the three discipline steps into action.

* * *

Think back to the last time one of your children misbehaved. Briefly describe what happened and how you reacted.

Now, imagine you’re approaching the same situation using Siegel and Bryson’s discipline process. The first step is preparation, and the strategies are keeping the brain in mind, being mindful, and timing discipline right. How could you use these strategies to prepare to discipline your child? (For example, you might try being curious about why they behaved how they did.)

Now that you’re in the right frame of mind, the next discipline step is connection, and the strategies are using your body, acknowledging and affirming your child’s emotions, and letting them do the talking. Thinking back to your real-life scenario, how would you connect to your child in that moment?

Once your child is calm, you’re ready for the final step, teaching. The strategies are noticing (rather than criticizing), creating a dialogue, and using a “conditional yes.” How would you teach your child a better way to behave in the case of your example situation?
