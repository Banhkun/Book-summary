## Exercise: Prepare Your Response to Being Wronged

Bonhoeffer teaches that as a disciple, you should always seek to minimize the amount of sin that is committed. He points out that accepting a loss or injury with forgiveness instead of retaliation can prevent that sin from multiplying through mutual retaliation.

* * *

Think about the last time somebody wronged you. What did they do to hurt you?

How did you respond to what they did?

What was the result? Did your response escalate the situation? Did it defuse it?

If you were faced with a similar situation again, what could you do to prevent evil from multiplying or minimize the overall harm done?
