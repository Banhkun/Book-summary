## 1-Page Summary

Published in 1951, _The Wisdom of Insecurity _is religious scholar and philosopher Alan Watts’s treatise on the origins of and solutions to modern anxieties. He argues that we feel anxious because the only constant in life is change—which means that seeking security is futile and we should embrace a more realistic approach to life by accepting insecurity and living in the moment instead of worrying about the future.

Watts’s philosophy of insecurity is based on his unique interpretations of both Christianity and Eastern philosophies—he’s best known for translating Eastern concepts into terms Westerners can understand and apply to their lives. He’s the author of several other books on Eastern philosophy, including _The Way of Zen_ and _The Book_ , and his numerous lectures can be streamed through the Alan Watts Organization.

In this guide, we’ll cover Watts’s understanding of insecurity as an existential issue.

  * In **The Origins of Anxiety,** we’ll define insecurity, explain why it causes you anxiety, and discuss how pursuing security makes you _more_ anxious.
  * In **Religion, Science, and Insecurity,** we’ll discuss Christian and scientific perspectives on insecurity and explain why Watts believes Eastern religious beliefs about insecurity are more valuable.
  * In **How to Go With the Flow,** we’ll explain how embracing your animal self and living in the present can help you cope with insecurity—and change the world.



### The Origins of Anxiety

Before you can know how to deal with anxiety, you need to understand its cause: insecurity. In this section, we’ll explain what insecurity is, why it makes you anxious, and why trying to resist it can lead to further anxiety.

According to Watts, **insecurity—the state of being impermanent and vulnerable to change—is a fundamental quality of existence.** He explains that there’s no such thing as security because change is inevitable: One moment passes and is replaced by the next, which means nothing can be frozen in time. Every living thing changes each moment and ultimately transitions from life to death.

(Shortform note: In _The Myth of Sisyphus, _philosopher Albert Camus argues similarly that since death is inevitable and the meaning of life is indeterminable, insecurity is an essential facet of human life. He explains that there’s a mismatch between this reality and our psychological needs—to be well, we need to believe that we exist for a reason and that death isn’t the end of our existence, but we can’t know either of those things for sure. He refers to this paradox between our desire for security and the fact of insecurity as _absurdity_ —and he argues that the only way to deal with it is by embracing absurdity and making the most of our limited time on earth.)

#### Why Insecurity Makes You Anxious

Watts explains that every human has an _animal self_ and a _thinking self._ Despite the fundamental insecurity of life, many people continue to hope or strive for security because they identify with their thinking selves over their animal selves. Your animal self has two key qualities: It has sophisticated instincts (for example, hunger cues), and it lives in the moment, always in flux—transitioning from hungry to satiated, for example, or from sleepy to alert, depending on the internal and external sensations it perceives. Your animal self doesn’t think, and it’s never concerned with the past or the future; it simply exists in the here and now and acts according to its internal wisdom rather than any abstract rules.

On the other hand, your thinking self is conscious—it’s able to contemplate, remember, and imagine. It also has time consciousness (a sense of continuity between the past, present, and future). Time consciousness makes you believe that you’re a stable, independent entity—since you share memories with your 10-year-old self, you believe you’re the same person you’ve always been. Your thinking self wants to continue being a stable, independent entity—so it resists change and tries to achieve permanence, even though it can’t.

**Since your thinking self wants to become permanent, you become anxious about things that threaten your permanence—namely, painful experiences and death.** But Watts explains that pain and death are both necessary and valuable parts of life. He says that pain must accompany pleasure because if you experienced a constant stream of pleasure, you’d eventually become numb to it—or it would hurt you, the way too much alcohol can turn you into an addict. Pain punctuates your experience to make pleasure meaningful and enjoyable. Watts argues similarly that death is a good thing—you’d get tired of living if you lived forever.

> **Watts Versus Other Experts on the Self, Pain, and Death**
> 
> Like Watts, other experts argue that the human self is composed of multiple parts. For Watts, these are the animal and thinking selves; for psychologist Sigmund Freud, these are the id, ego, and superego. The id is the most essential part of yourself, since you’re born with it, and it’s like the animal self in that it’s motivated by instincts and is fixated on the present—for example, when the id feels sleepy, it drives you to go to sleep immediately (as opposed to waiting for a more socially acceptable time to sleep). The ego and superego are more like the thinking self—these parts of yourself take into account social norms and regulate your behavior accordingly (for example, by stopping you from falling asleep at work). They develop later (ages three to five).
> 
> Although Watts attributes time consciousness to the thinking self, other experts argue that it’s more complex than that. Some research suggests that you’re born with an innate sense of time, which would mean that your id or animal self has at least a primitive form of time consciousness. Other research indicates that as you grow up and develop higher cognition (your thinking self or ego and superego), your sense of time matures. And while Watts says that like your animal self, animals aren’t concerned with time, other experts disagree: Some animals seem to remember the past and anticipate the future. This could mean that time consciousness isn’t a product of higher cognition, as Watts argues, but a basic animal instinct.
> 
> Watts says that time consciousness makes your thinking self seek permanence, but research seems to suggest that both your animal self and non-human animals are also concerned with permanence. Humans and animals both have hardwired neurobiological survival instincts that cause them to behave in ways that prolong their lives and stave off death—like eating enough, for example. Additionally, when your survival is threatened, you suffer on a biological level, not just a cognitive level—your body automatically goes into a stress response (fight, flight, freeze, or fawn), and when that stress response is thwarted, you may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which has biological underpinnings.
> 
> Watts also says that your thinking self’s desire for permanence gives you anxiety about the inevitability of pain and death. First, let’s address how pain threatens permanence—in humans, both physical pain _and_emotional pain can indicate and even exacerbate a threat to your health, which equates to a survival threat. As for whether anxiety is the product of your thinking self, some research suggests the opposite—animals (who ostensibly don’t have thinking selves) that witness violent death or endure extreme pain exhibit anxiety and PTSD-like symptoms, which indicates that on some level, they understand and want to avoid pain and death.
> 
> While it seems that both animals and humans tend to avoid pain and death, some experts agree with Watts that pain and death make life meaningful: Psychologists note that painful experiences like conflict, loss, and emotional discomfort can help you figure out and prioritize your values. And as discussed earlier, the inevitability of death may motivate you to make the most of your life, as Camus argues in _The Myth of Sisyphus. _That doesn’t necessarily make pain or death less difficult to deal with—it just makes them valuable.

#### How You’re Making Your Anxiety Worse

**Watts notes that despite the utility of pain and death, your anxiety about these experiences leads you to pursue an endless stream of pleasure.** You know your time on earth is limited and that pleasures aren’t promised, so you want to cram as much pleasure into your life as possible. You probably engage in consumerism—the purchasing of goods and services beyond the bare necessities—to make that happen. Consumerism is a vicious cycle: Experiencing one pleasure makes you desire more and better pleasures (for example, you might always be chasing the high of obtaining the newest, fastest car). As a result, consumerism can never satisfy you. Watts says this means that the more you pursue pleasure, the more anxious you become.

(Shortform note: In _A New Earth, _Eckhart Tolle argues similarly that consumerism is a response to fear. While Watts says your thinking self drives you to consume because it fears pain and death, Tolle says that your ego has an innate fear of being _inferior_ and proves its superiority by accumulating material, thought, and emotional elements—including possessions and improvements to your physical body. Tolle also explains that consumerism has a negative effect on society and the earth, for example by engendering greed and producing toxic waste. Scientists agree that consumerism harms society and the environment—and while it’s unclear whether consumerism amplifies _anxiety_ specifically, research suggests it makes you unhappy because it doesn’t adequately address insecurity.)

As a consumer, you fixate on the future. When you’re __ experiencing pain, you try to make yourself happy by diverting your attention from your discomfort to ways you can maximize pleasure in the future. However, Watts says that you’ll never __ experience the future—you can only ever experience what’s happening in this present moment; in the next moment, you’ll experience what’s happening in _that_ present moment. This means that pursuing a future goal is futile. Also, distracting yourself from the present diminishes your ability to fully experience the present. You won’t fully enjoy any pleasurable experience, so you’ll keep seeking out future pleasures, and you won’t be able to deal with and move on from pain. This extends your anxiety.

(Shortform note: Watts may have drawn his advice to live in the present instead of focusing on the future from the Buddhist practice known as _mindfulness_ —a method of witnessing the present without judging or trying to influence it. Along with Buddhists, many psychologists believe mindfulness is good for achieving mental clarity and spiritual health. However, studies suggest that planning for the future—a process known as prospection—also has benefits, including better mental health, improved decision-making, and increased motivation. It may be best to find a balance between prospection and mindfulness because when you plan for the future, you increase the likelihood that you’ll enjoy living in the moment later on.)

Therefore, Watts argues that contrary to popular belief, the inevitability of pain and death isn’t what makes life difficult—**what makes life difficult is _your insistence on pursuing future pleasures and sparing yourself from future pain and death._**

(Shortform note: Psychologists agree that resisting life’s hardships (like pain and death) only makes life more difficult. They explain that many people believe that if they refuse to accept a hardship, they can make the experience less painful or avoid feeling pain at all. However, denying the reality of your hardship can actually _increase_ your suffering because it distances you from your emotions—which, in turn, decreases your capacity for joy _and_ contributes to greater depression, anxiety, and poor decision-making.)

### Religion, Science, and Insecurity

According to Watts, another way people cope with insecurity is by seeking comfort in religion or science. In this section, we’ll discuss why Watts believes Western perspectives (Christianity and science) on insecurity are inadequate, and we’ll explore the Eastern approach he says is more valuable.

Watts explains that**the thinking self attempts to impose order and stability on life by naming and classifying your experiences**. For example, labeling an animal you see with the word “dog” helps you predict how that animal will behave. Naming and classifying seems to make life more predictable. Watts says that for much of Western history, people seeking predictability have adopted Christianity, which promises eternal life, an unchanging God, and permanent values. Then, Westerners turned to science, which offered security in the form of immutable, universal laws and the potential of happiness on earth instead of in the afterlife (for example, by reducing suffering with the help of modern medicine).

(Shortform note: Some research suggests that Watts is right about the human desire for predictability—generally, we prefer to have as much information as possible about (and thus the ability to name or classify) future events, so much so that we find uncertainty more stressful than certain suffering. Research also supports Watts’s statement that religious beliefs serve to provide comfort in the face of unpredictability; belief in science provides a similar kind of comfort for those who are secular. Although Watts attributes finding existential comfort in either religion or science to Western culture, note that many Eastern religions also provide adherents with comforting wisdom about life’s uncertainties and that science isn’t a uniquely Western invention.)

However, Watts says that around the time he was writing this book (the 1950s), Westerners had found both Christianity and science unsatisfying for the reasons listed above: Focusing on the future is futile and dilutes your experience of the present. This made people feel like life had no meaning, and they turned to consumerism (also futile) for comfort.

(Shortform note: Although Watts writes that Westerners turned to consumerism because neither religion nor science could fully satisfy them, other experts say consumerism emerged in response to industrialization in the West in the latter half of the 1800s. Industrialization consolidated wealth in the hands of manufacturing plant owners, who were incentivized to seek further profits by promoting greater desire for non-essential goods. This resulted in a large-scale cultural and economic shift, where accumulating goods was seen as key to happiness. Economist and Christian ethicist Bruce P. Rittenhouse agrees with Watts that consumerism promotes happiness by serving a semi-spiritual purpose—accumulation imparts a sense of meaning, which combats fears about death.)

#### How Eastern Spirituality Helps You Accept Insecurity

Based on his understanding of Eastern philosophy, Watts says that using religion and science to cope with insecurity is inadequate for a few reasons. First, it strengthens your tendency to identify with your thinking self over your animal self—you believe you can classify experiences because you’re an objective, outside observer. Watts says that you’re not outside of experience—**you _are_ your experience**. He reasons that if everyone is their experience, then all of existence is composed of experience—which means that you’re part of an ever-changing, unified whole, rather than a stable, independent entity (your thinking self).

(Shortform note: While Watts doesn’t explain _which_ Eastern philosophies he draws from in this book, he notes in another book, _The Way of Zen_ , that Mahayana Buddhism offers similar wisdom. According to the concept of _maya_ in Mahayana Buddhism, the words you use contribute to the illusion that anything is separate from anything else (including your supposed separation from the rest of experience). And according to the Mahayana principle called _moksha,_ you can be liberated from this illusion and come to understand your true self as part of the integrated whole of existence. Mahayana Buddhists believe that _moksha_ enables you to understand and deal with insecurity.)

Second, Watts argues that religion and science are merely _representations_ of existence, so they’ll never be fulfilling; clinging to these representations is like clinging to a photo of your friends instead of to your friends themselves. He adds that though religions attempt to represent existence, existence can’t be understood by the thinking self—it can only be understood experientially by the animal self that’s living in the moment. Trying to name and classify existence as an independent, objective observer removes you from the experience, so you’ll miss out on aspects of the experience. For example, according to this logic, you’d learn more about running by going for a run than you’d learn by reading about running or watching others run.

(Shortform note: Watts believes that the best way to understand life is through experience, but you may not be able to learn everything you need to know through experience. For example, doctors need to know about a variety of illnesses, and they can’t (and probably shouldn’t) contract every known illness to gain that knowledge. In some cases, it’s more helpful to refer to shared human wisdom about how the world works (like religious wisdom or a body of scientific knowledge) than to rely on your own experience. However, experience can be a useful teacher—and some experts suggest that to maximize your learning, it’s best to pair experience with reflection.)

Finally, imposing order on existence by accepting religious or scientific beliefs is a form of your thinking self’s resistance to change, and Watts argues that**it’s only by _accepting_ insecurity that you can find spiritual understanding and fulfillment.** He says you can have spiritually meaningful experiences when your animal self is living in the moment and your thinking self admires the incomprehensible beauty of existence—a phenomenon he refers to as “wonder.”

(Shortform note: In _Radical Acceptance, _Buddhist psychologist Tara Brach offers some concrete advice to help you accept hardships like insecurity. This includes asking yourself questions about your feelings to help you understand them better, welcoming your fears once you understand them to make it easier for them to pass by, and finding refuge in the Buddha, the world’s natural laws, and/or your community. Some psychologists believe that experiencing wonder helps you deal with hardships like insecurity, too, by buttressing your sense of belonging in the world—to help your sense of wonder develop, they recommend spending time alone in nature.)

However, Watts says that traditional religious beliefs are useful when understood metaphorically. He explains that everything that exists is intricately, irrevocably interdependent and that all iterations of God, in all religions, symbolize the essential unity of all of existence. He encourages you to think of the Christian notion of an eternal afterlife where you’re joined with God as a metaphor—one that symbolizes that the present is the only thing you can ever experience and that you’re always already joined with all other existence.

(Shortform note: Here, Watts draws a connection between Christianity and Eastern religious beliefs. Zen Buddhist Thich Nhat Hanh echoes this in _Living Buddha, Living Christ_ , arguing that Christianity and Buddhism both conceive of death as something that dissolves the individual self and joins you with the divine. This thinking is also shared by the Baha'i faith, which teaches that all religions worship the same divine essence, albeit under different names, which represents the oneness of existence. However, some Christians argue against this kind of thinking because they believe lending credence to other religions is heretical or that the Bible should be understood strictly literally, not metaphorically.)

### How to Go With the Flow

Watts argues that according to Eastern religions, you have to give up your thinking self’s attachment to security and embrace your animal self’s capacity for living in the moment. In this section, we’ll discuss his advice for doing so and explore the benefits of this approach.

Watts explains that the thinking self and the animal self each have their uses—for example, the thinking self enables you to communicate with others, while the animal self alerts you to internal cues like pleasure and pain. However, he says that presently, **society is tilted heavily in favor of the thinking self** —evidenced by our overreliance on human concepts like religion, for example, to guide our decision-making (as opposed to also listening to bodily cues like the sensations that accompany feelings of guilt or comfort). Since you aren’t living in tune with your animal self, you’re anxious—you need time to just experience life, rather than always thinking and talking about life.

(Shortform note: Psychologists agree that in modern society, many factors contribute to identification with the mind over the body—these include a historical tendency to believe the mind is more important than the body, distractions like technology, and traumas that impair your ability to listen to your body. To help you overcome these issues, somatic therapists can teach you embodiment practices like dance, yoga, and singing—techniques that help you sense, fully feel, and move through physical sensations that are tied to your emotions. Mindfulness (the Buddhist practice of living in the present) may be another solution, since it enables you to savor your bodily experiences and therefore contributes to greater peace of mind.)

Watts says that **the solution to this problem is to integrate your thinking and animal selves.** This means living in the moment according to your body’s wisdom like an animal would do—eating, sleeping, and doing other activities when your body tells you it’s time to do so, rather than relying on an imposed schedule or dogma to guide your choices. As you do so, your thinking self should be focused on the present, not the past or the future. Watts explains that this is the true purpose of your thinking self—to help you more fully comprehend, or at least appreciate, the present moment. He also says that nobody can teach you _how_ to do this—you’re already doing it, even if you don’t believe you are, so all you have to do is continue and not let your thinking self get in the way.

(Shortform note: If you’re struggling to integrate your thinking and animal selves, psychologists offer some tips to help you listen to your body: First, make a regular, conscious effort to check in with yourself and determine how you’re feeling. Then choose to trust those feelings. One way to practice this is with _intuitive eating_ —a method of listening to your body’s hunger cues and responding accordingly—which experts Evelyn Tribole and Elyse Resch explain in detail in their book, _Intuitive Eating. _Other experts note that you can enhance your bodily awareness through mindfulness and meditation practices.)

#### How Embracing Your Animal Self Makes You Happier

**Integrating your animal and thinking selves transforms pain.** Watts says when your thinking self is in charge, you try to escape pain by distracting yourself from the experience with thoughts of the past or future. But this is futile because you can’t escape the present—recall that you _are_ your present experience. Distracting yourself from the present only disrupts your ability to understand and accept it, which is necessary if you’re going to move through it. Therefore, distracting yourself from pain only prolongs pain. When you embrace your animal self, you deal with pain like animals do: You’re able to endure the pain as it’s happening, and when it’s over, you move on. Your thinking self focuses on your present experience instead of avoiding it.

(Shortform note: While Watts advocates embracing your pain, other experts are divided as to whether this is an effective pain management approach. Some studies suggest that mindfulness meditation (which focuses your attention on your present experience) can make pain easier to endure by helping you separate the physical sensation of pain from the negative judgments you attach to that sensation; similarly, some studies suggest engaging with emotional pain helps you accept and move on from it. However, other studies suggest that distracting yourself is better for reducing physical pain and, in some cases, emotional pain. The idea is that since your attention is limited, focusing on something else stops you from perceiving or being consumed by pain.)

**Embracing your animal self also helps you more fully enjoy pleasure and avoid causing yourself _unnecessary_ pain. **This is because, as discussed, focusing your awareness on the present (instead of the past or future) allows you to get the most out of each moment—for example, you’re going to enjoy the act of gardening more if you’re focused on the sensation of working with plants and dirt than if you’re focused on whether your flowers will bloom in the future.

(Shortform note: In his book _Flow, _psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi argues that getting full enjoyment out of an experience requires more than merely living in the moment (or, in Watts’s terminology, embracing your animal self). Often, other criteria must be satisfied, which include pursuing a clear goal, feeling capable of achieving that goal, and receiving immediate feedback that suggests you’re making progress. With regard to the gardening example above, your clear goal could be removing weeds, your capability may be tied to the tools and know-how you have on hand, and immediate feedback could involve seeing the weeds disappear from your garden as you work.)

Watts says that embracing your animal self also prevents you from getting trapped in the painful, anxiety-producing cycle of consumerism.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree that living in the moment helps you escape the cycle of consumerism—they say that by increasing your awareness of the relationship between your thoughts and behaviors, mindfulness can interrupt the impulse to consume, giving you the opportunity to make a different choice.)

According to Watts, integrating your thinking and animal selves also gives **you a deep, bodily understanding—rather than an abstract idea—that everything that exists is part of an integrated whole. This will enable you to experience true freedom.**(Shortform note: It’s not clear what Watts means by “bodily understanding,” but some experts say that understanding always begins with the body, not the mind, since to know anything requires perception of physical stimuli.)

Watts argues that when you understand yourself as an individual thinking self, you tend to conceive of freedom as your ability to influence the world. But when you see yourself as part of the whole, you understand freedom as the ability to be part of existence—you can do anything that’s possible because you’re already part of the world of possibilities, and you’ll listen to your bodily cues instead of being restricted by human abstractions like schedules and religion.

Watts says once you have a bodily understanding of essential unity, you’ll stop making decisions based on the unnatural pursuit of pleasure or the avoidance of pain—**you’ll simply be going with the flow from moment to moment.** In his view, most immoral actions are the result of pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain—prioritizing the thinking self’s desire for permanence over your true momentary needs. Moral actions, on the other hand, are the result of being united with all of existence—which Watts argues is the equivalent of love, since love brings things together. He explains that the combination of living in the present and acting in a loving way is key to a more peaceful, united world.

> **The Link Between Mindfulness, Freedom, and Morality**
> 
> Watts argues that true freedom is the ability to live in the moment according to your body’s wisdom. In _A New Earth, _Eckhart Tolle argues similarly that every part of existence is constituted of and guided by an inherent wisdom called _pure conscious energy_ —a force that structures the universe and enables all kinds of life, including humans, to go on living. According to Tolle, pure conscious energy drives plants to photosynthesize and animals to survive—they’re free to simply exist. Humans have a similar freedom, but they’re uniquely aware of their own consciousness—like Watts, Tolle argues that uniting with that inner wisdom is necessary to achieve true freedom.
> 
> Tolle explains that uniting with your innate consciousness helps you experience freedom because it enables you to let go of attachments, stop making judgments, and accept reality instead of resisting it. When the majority of humans unite with consciousness, he says we’ll be liberated from our egos’ desire to engage in destruction. So for Tolle, like Watts, true freedom amounts to something like love—the ability to cooperate with the universe in life-affirming ways.
> 
> But how exactly does an embodied appreciation of essential unity lead to greater morality? One plausible explanation is that mindfulness enhances authenticity. Studies suggest that practicing mindfulness helps you make choices that are aligned with your values—it follows that if you value the essential unity of all of life more than your own pleasure or pain, you’ll be more inclined to behave in ways that promote togetherness as opposed to discord when you practice living in the moment (mindfulness). Whether you believe that prioritizing togetherness makes you more moral depends on your values, but some research suggests that universal well-being is one of the most basic and widely shared human values.
> 
> However, it’s likely difficult in practice to unite yourself with all of existence all the time. For example, in _All About Love_ , feminist theorist bell hooks explains that behaving lovingly begins with self-love—and practicing self-love may sometimes require you to assert yourself against somebody else. When such situations arise, experts say that you can resolve conflicts ethically by being respectful of differences (as opposed to encroaching on others’ freedom), refusing to tolerate violence, and compromising when possible.
