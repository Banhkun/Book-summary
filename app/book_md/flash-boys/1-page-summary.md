## 1-Page Summary

In _Flash Boys_ , Michael Lewis explores the US stock market’s use and acceptance of high-frequency trading (HFT). Lewis—a best-selling author and journalist—argues that HFT exploits regular investors, creates unfairness in the stock market, and is a concern for any investor.

Published in 2014, _Flash Boys_ devotes much of its attention to the experiences of Brad Katsuyama, a Canadian trader who investigated HFT tactics and was a key player in exposing the practice to the financial world. Lewis examines Katsuyama’s investigation in detail, using it as a lens through which to understand the history and effects of HFT on the market and economy.

In this guide, we’ll first discuss how the stock market adapted to technology and the new features of trading that resulted from these changes. Then we’ll explore HFT tactics that create problems for average traders and investors, as well as how Wall Street responded to HFT tactics. Finally, we’ll explain how Katsuyama and his team found solutions to the problems generated by these high-frequency trading tactics and their efforts to create a fairer stock market.

Along the way, we’ll look at how other experts have weighed in on the practice and some differing views on whether or not these changes have been beneficial. We’ll also provide updated information about trading research and regulations that have come into effect since the book’s publication.

### Introduction to High-Frequency Trading

Lewis describes high-frequency trading (HFT) as a type of electronic trading platform that uses automated computer algorithms to very quickly buy and sell large quantities of stocks. High-frequency (HF) traders and firms own these high-powered computers and algorithms. These HFT algorithms gather market data and use this information to buy and sell stocks, completing this process in microseconds, or one-millionth of a second, thus using a different strategy than long-term buy-and-hold investing positions. This speed advantage makes HFT algorithms faster than any human trader, giving them a powerful edge by enabling them to accrue billions of dollars in tiny profits from HFT trades that traditional investors and traders can’t.

(Shortform note: While Lewis doesn’t detail the history of high-frequency trading, who started it, or when it started, this may be because experts don’t agree on how it started. Experts have traced the practice back to the 1830s, 1930s, the 1970s, and 2005. Some researchers attribute HFT’s creation to former finance professor David Whitcomb, while others believe the SEC’s deregulation of the stock markets started the practice.)

#### Katsuyama Investigates High-Frequency Trading

As Lewis explains, a Canadian trader named Brad Katsuyama working for the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) was one of the first people to raise the alarm about HFT. In the late 2000s, Katsuyama noticed changes in the stock market that clued him in to systemic problems caused by HFT, motivating him to build a team to investigate why he was losing money in his trades. While Katsuyama wasn’t the first person to learn about HFT and its tactics, he was one of the first to identify and raise awareness of how HFT was a problem. Lewis learned about HFT through Katsuyama’s findings and focuses much of the book on him.

(Shortform note: In _21 Lessons For The 21st Century_ , Yuval Noah Harari argues that as algorithms like HFT software provide increasingly accurate suggestions, their convenience is almost irresistible—but relying on algorithms to make your decisions denies you the freedom and ability to make your own choices, which may explain why Katsuyama felt he couldn’t trade successfully anymore. In addition to threatening jobs, technology threatens human liberty, as algorithms learn so much about people that they gain an immense power to influence and manipulate.)

Lewis outlines a few ways by which HFT uses its unique characteristics to unfairly disadvantage regular investors:

##### Tactic 1: Using Speed

Speed is a crucial factor in stock trading. Traders who can lower their _latency times_ , or the time between sending and receiving a signal about market data or a stock order, have an advantage over other traders.

Latency times can differ between exchanges and investors depending on how close to an exchange an investor physically is, since the further the electric signal has to travel through wiring, the longer it takes to execute an order. HF traders work so quickly that they can buy or sell orders in microseconds, so if a stock has changed its price on one exchange but there’s a lag of fractions of a second before it changes its price on another exchange, the HF trader can take advantage of that difference and make a risk-free profit.

Because of this almost-instantaneous purchasing power, HF traders can detect and act upon an order placed by a regular investor and profit off the market movements prompted by that order, lowering the profit for that regular investor.

(Shortform note: While Lewis asserts that speed is an important factor in high-frequency trading, critics argue that speed has _always_ been an important factor in any trading. This may be one reason that HFT has still gone unregulated, as regulators haven’t identified where to draw the line when it comes to speed and whether it’s even appropriate to punish certain traders solely because they deployed better technology to decrease the latency times of their trades.)

##### Tactic 2: Using Dark Pools

The rise of electronic trading allowed for the development of _dark pools_ —private stock exchanges set up by large banks where buying and selling orders can be executed separately from the wider market. Since dark pools are private, banks don’t have to immediately report to the public what happens inside their dark pool. Because of this, traders _outside_ the dark pool have access to less information than traders _within_ the dark pool, giving the latter the ability to not only move _faster_ on pricing changes, but also to _anticipate_ them. HF traders profit from this discrepancy in information in ways regular investors can’t.

(Shortform note: Critics of dark pools believe the lack of transparency is a problem and that dark pools aren’t being used for their intended purpose: to reduce market impact when placing large trade orders. Indeed, investors who abuse this secrecy can face serious consequences. Bill Hwang was arrested for fraud and racketeering in connection with his family office, Archegos, after a risky investment strategy cost him $20 billion. Since Archegos was investing inside dark pools, other banks weren’t aware of his trades or the terms of those trades. Had they known this, it may have deterred them from doing business with him or prevented him from building such a large market position. In response to the Archegos scandal, regulators have expressed interest in implementing new disclosure rules to prevent this kind of trading activity.)

##### Tactic 3: Using Rebates

Electronic trading led to changes in the _rebate_ system. Rebates are when stock exchanges charge a small fee to one broker—generally the buyer—of a trading order and pay a small fee (a rebate) to the other broker—usually the seller.

At first, exchanges continued this traditional rebate system in their electronic trades, but HF traders encouraged them to change their rules so that they _paid_ the brokers—generally the buyer—instead of charging them a fee. HF traders used this change to predict the flow of trades—if a broker could be paid for a trade she’d usually be charged for, it’s in her best interest to send it to the exchange where she’d be paid. Thus, HF traders could anticipate and monitor where brokers would send orders and could use that knowledge to get there first.

> **Incentives Don’t Always Work the Way We Expect**
> 
> We can understand rebates—a kind of trading incentive—through the lens of mechanism design, the process of designing rules to accomplish specific outcomes. Mechanism design is a tricky business—since rule adjustments have such a significant impact on the game’s outcome, small unforeseen side effects can have extreme consequences, as in the case of rebates and HFT. In _Freakonomics,_ Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner describe how mechanism design can go wrong.
> 
> The _Freakonomics_ authors categorize incentives into three types: economic, social, and moral. Economic incentives are when you save money by behaving well, social incentives are when you can maintain a good reputation by behaving well, and moral incentives are when you can satisfy your conscience by behaving well. The authors argue that **economic incentives have the potential to backfire by inadvertently removing social and moral incentives**. This principle applies to HFT, which as an algorithm, doesn’t operate using social or moral decisions. So the system of rebates, which was originally intended to reward good trading behavior, ended up incentivizing people to try to game the market.

##### Tactic 4: Using New Regulation

As the stock market changed due to technology, stock market regulations changed with it. In 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) enacted a new rule that would have lasting effects on the market—the Regulation National Market System (or Reg NMS). This rule stated that traders must buy stock at the lowest market price for investors. So if stock for a certain company ranged from $10.00 and $10.08, the trader is legally obligated to buy it at whichever exchange sells it for $10.00. Reg NMS was intended to ease investors’ worries that traders weren’t getting them the best deals.

However, the new regulation ended up benefitting HF traders more than ordinary investors, because it allowed them to more quickly identify price changes at any given time.

(Shortform note: Like Lewis, other experts are concerned about the SEC’s regulations and their impact on markets. Some experts urge the SEC to reevaluate and update Reg NMS, while others recommend a complete overhaul of their rules. While Reg NMS may have positive effects on fair pricing and market competition, critics note that the regulations have led to further market fragmentation, difficulty executing orders quickly, and pricing inefficiency, showing that financial experts can’t agree on the effects of the regulations. Some experts have even proposed scrapping the idea of government oversight altogether, recommending self-regulation as an alternative to SEC regulation.)

##### Tactic 5: Electronic Front-Running

Another consequence of Reg NMS was to allow HF traders to _front run_ trades—to use advance knowledge of an investor’s intentions for profit. Under Reg NMS, traders must buy stock at the lowest price, but sometimes, the exchange with the lowest price won’t have all the shares the investor wants to buy. Thus, a broker might have to go to multiple exchanges to fulfill an investor’s entire order. When she does this, her order tips off HF traders of her intentions to buy or sell a certain stock. The HF traders can then race to other exchanges to buy the stock she wants, only to sell it to her at a higher price.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree with Lewis’s argument that traders have found ways to exploit well-intentioned regulation, such as Reg NMS. Some experts even recommend replacing Reg NMS with entirely new—albeit more relaxed—regulation. One suggestion is to outline several factors—not just price—that a broker must consider when executing customer trade orders, such as the price of the stock or how secure the market is at the time of purchase.)

##### Tactic 6: Using Order Types

Lewis describes order types as sets of instructions determining how traders place stock orders. For instance, a trader can use an order type to stipulate that her order goes through only if she’ll receive a rebate or only if the price doesn’t exceed a certain number. As electronic trading became more popular, the number of order types increased from three to over 150 and became so complex that very few people could understand them—typically, only people whose _job_ it specifically was to understand them.

Lewis argues that most of these order types were actually unnecessary and gave HF traders more opportunities to exploit investors by tapping into their trading strategies and intentions. HF traders could examine order types to know what conditions investors were looking out for and then use that information to get to trades first, increasing their own profit at the expense of other investors. HF traders also used these order types to push their orders ahead of regular investors, so that, for example, if an ordinary investor tried to buy 100 shares of a certain stock, an HF trader's standing order could be activated to scoop up those shares first.

(Shortform note: Another way to think of HFT and order type baiting is through the lens of game theory. In _The Undercover Economist_ , Tim Hartford explains that game theory is a discipline adjacent to economics and mathematics, where a “game” is defined as an activity in which predicting another’s actions affects your own actions. By analyzing and predicting the actions of investors through order type baiting, HF traders—algorithmic, rational decision-makers—use this data to maximize their payoffs.)

### Effects of HFT

These high-frequency trading tactics capitalized on the precedents set by electronic trading. Lewis explains that anyone involved in the stock market—brokers, investors, hedge fund managers, and so on—felt the effects of HFT, which were exacerbated by two factors: Wall Street’s greed and the “flash crash.”

#### Wall Street’s Greed

Lewis argues that the Wall Street firms and banks, whose proper role is to help investors, adopted HFT techniques despite knowing that HFT made trading unfair for average investors. **They did this because they were making so much money**. One firm made over a billion dollars in one year from its HFT department alone.

(Shortform note: Lewis is no stranger to exposing Wall Street’s greed: In _The Big Short_ , he argues that greed and short-sightedness were the prime drivers of the financial crisis. All major stakeholders in the ecosystem were fueled by the desire for profit, which made it easy to overlook systemic problems.)

#### Flash Crash

After years of unregulated high-frequency trading, Wall Street experienced a “flash crash” in 2010. Lewis defines a flash crash as a stock market crash that happens quickly—stock prices drop dramatically before recovering within a few minutes. But during the 2010 flash crash, 20,000 stocks traded at dramatically different stock values.

According to Lewis, no one could pinpoint a reason behind the flash crash. Katsuyama couldn’t access the data that could prove HFT caused the crash, since this information wasn’t public—it belonged to the HFT firms and exchanges—but he knew that the flash crash was a result of HFT.

The flash crash marked a turning point in the investing world. Investors were interested in what was going on in the market—and why it had dropped by 600 points so suddenly. People called Katsuyama and his team to set up informational meetings where he educated investors and executives about HFT.

> **Who Is Responsible for the Flash Crash?**
> 
> While Lewis blames the trillion-dollar flash crash on high-frequency traders, the US courts found another reason: a self-taught stock market trader named Navinder Singh Sarao. He was convicted of “spoofing”—creating a huge number of fake buy or sell orders. High-frequency trading firms program their algorithms to get out of the market when it gets too volatile, and when **Sarao’s spoofing operation created _artificial_ volatility, all the algorithms pulled out at once, resulting in a crash.** He capitalized on the changing prices, earning about $900,000 from the market manipulation.
> 
> While the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) found Sarao responsible for the flash crash, some experts contend that blaming Sarao doesn’t get to the heart of the issue—that both human and algorithmic traders still have the ability to manipulate markets despite existing regulations.

### IEX: A Fair Stock Exchange

After discovering these tactics, Katsuyama and his team decided to fight HFT rather than mimic its tactics to make money, so they quit their jobs at RBC to create their own stock exchange. They called it the Investors Exchange, or IEX. The purpose of IEX was to make investing fair by preventing the predatory behavior of high-frequency traders.

When creating IEX, Katsuyama and his team knew they couldn’t ban HFT on their exchange. But they could take preventative measures against the tactics HF traders used to exploit investors. Lewis discusses the team’s solutions addressing each of the HFT tactics:

(Shortform note: While Lewis praises IEX for fighting HFT, some critics note that in doing so, he perpetuates the idea that stock exchanges will correct themselves without regulation. Critics believe that regulatory bodies like the SEC—not exchanges or traders—should be responsible for keeping up with changes in stock trading, especially for something as influential as HFT, to better protect investors. Experts have suggested a small tax on every trade, called the Tobin Tax, that would have little effect on regular investors but would deter HF traders by further reducing the margins on their already-small profits per trade.)

##### Solution 1: Counteract Speed Advantages

IEX increased the amount of time it would take for any investor—including HF traders—to access the exchange’s market. To do this, they moved their "point of presence,” or a point where traders connect to an exchange, 10 miles away from their matching engine in New Jersey and coiled the cable between the two locations to lengthen the time it took to get a signal from one to the other. In doing so, IEX created a 350-microsecond delay that slowed down HF traders accessing their exchange and therefore allowed IEX to interact with other exchanges at the _same time_ as HF traders, instead of _behind_ them.

(Shortform note: While Lewis claims IEX’s tactics (the point of presence and 350-microsecond delay) make trading fairer for regular investors, some experts object to IEX slowing down traders’ orders. They believe that IEX is effectively using latency arbitrage against HF traders since the exchange is using old prices on _other_ exchanges before traders on those exchanges can update their _own_ prices, thus making trading with IEX unfair for HF traders. They believe these tactics only benefit big investors and portfolio managers. However, this argument seems to acknowledge that using “old” prices to perform latency arbitrage is unfair—it’s just a question of whether humans or technology are on the receiving end of it.)

##### Solution 2: Investors Can Request Banks Send Orders to IEX

Lewis explains that IEX wanted to prevent the banks from allowing customers’ orders to sit unfulfilled in the dark pool. IEX thus encouraged investors to request that their orders be sent to IEX.

(Shortform note: While encouraging investors to ask their bank to send their orders to IEX was a solution, it didn’t completely fix IEX’s problem since it put the responsibility on the investor to make sure their bank cooperated and sent an investor’s order to IEX. To address this problem, in 2016, the SEC approved IEX’s application to become an official exchange, thus requiring brokers to send their orders to IEX when it offers stocks at the best price. This made it no longer up to the investor to make sure their order went to IEX.)

##### Solution 3: Eliminate Rebates

As their next solution, IEX eliminated rebates. Instead, IEX _charged the people involved in both sides of the trade_ $0.009 per share. This approach differed from the previous model, which charged one side of the trade and paid the other a rebate, thus removing HF traders’ ability to use rebates to predict where investors would sell orders and then get there first.

(Shortform note: Following IEX’s decision to remove rebates from its trading process, the SEC reexamined whether or not rebates are an effective quality of the exchange. Although the SEC still allows rebates, it has admitted that rebates may create conflicts of interest when brokers choose where to send their orders. The SEC has considered testing how markets would function without rebates. NYSE and Nasdaq sued to stop this experiment before it went into effect.)

##### Solution 4: Three Order Types

To reduce information baiting, Katsuyama and his team limited the number of order types to three, as opposed to the 150 offered by other exchanges at the time. Lewis argues that fewer order types made trading more straightforward, encouraging investors who actually wanted to buy and sell stocks to trade with IEX. By limiting the number of order types, IEX prevented HF traders from baiting information out of investors: HF traders had fewer ways of determining which stocks an investor wanted or how much an investor was willing to pay.

(Shortform note: The exchange has increased the number of order types it offers since the publication of the book. IEX now has three classes of order types—ones for standard and retail investing, as well as what IEX calls their Signal Series order types, which are supposed to offer “enhanced price protection.”)

##### Solution 5: Publish Trading Rules

To counteract the secrecy of dark pools, IEX published the trading rules they use for their matching engine. They also showed what order types they allowed on IEX, as well as whether or not any other investors were given special access to their exchange. They hoped being transparent would build investor trust and encourage other exchanges to do the same.

(Shortform note: Lewis believes IEX fostered trust with investors through being honest and transparent about what was happening in their trades, which is a strategy other experts recommend. In _Algorithms to Live By_ , Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths note that one simple way to improve the equilibrium of a competitive game, such as stock trading, is to change the rules to make honesty and transparency the optimal strategy. The authors argue that when you design a game in which players are incentivized not to hide their intentions, it eases the burden on everyone. Players no longer have to stress about predicting what others are going to do, or what others think they’re going to do.)
