## Part 4: Effects of High-Frequency Trading

These six HFT tactics capitalized on the precedents set by electronic trading. Lewis explains that anyone involved in the stock market—brokers, investors, hedge fund managers, and so on—felt the effects of HFT. In this section, we’ll discuss how Wall Street responded to HFT, as well as the three strategies Wall Street firms adopted to keep up with their tactics. We’ll also describe the “flash crash” that caused investors to question what was happening with trading.

### How Wall Street Responded

Lewis argues that the Wall Street firms and banks, who were supposed to help investors, adopted HFT techniques despite knowing that HFT made trading unfair for average investors. **They did this because they were making so much money**. One firm made over a billion dollars in one year from its HFT department alone.

(Shortform note: Lewis is no stranger to exposing Wall Street’s greed: In _The Big Short_ , he argues that greed and short-sightedness were the prime drivers of the financial crisis. All major stakeholders in the ecosystem were fueled by the desire for profit, which made it easy to overlook the other systemic problems below, as he similarly argues about HFT.)

Three ways in which investment firms and banks took advantage of HFT practices at the expense of regular investors were trading against customers, manipulating dark pool orders, and selling access to dark pools:

#### Trading Against Customers

Lewis asserts that in response to HFT, Wall Street banks used proprietary trading (or “prop trading”) to trade against their customers in their dark pools, thus committing their own form of dark-pool arbitrage. Like HF traders, the banks’ prop traders—traders who work on behalf of the bank instead of on behalf of customers—used dark pools to see customer orders, buy stocks on other exchanges, and sell that stock at a higher price to the customer in the dark pool. Thus, rather than trying to fix the problems caused by HFT, the banks made the problem worse by participating in the behavior that harmed their own customers.

(Shortform note: When trading against their customers, banks also misled customers about what happened with their trades and failed to disclose that their own affiliates were profiting from their orders. The SEC has taken action against some of these banks for misleading customers, resulting in a collective $154 million settlement from Credit Suisse and Barclays PLC after the banks didn’t regulate their dark pools by giving customers inaccurate information and breaking SEC pricing rules. Another bank paid $37 million to stop a similar investigation into their mistreatment of customers.)

#### Manipulating Dark Pool Orders

Wall Street also took advantage of the dark pool arbitrage made possible by HFTs. When sending an order to a bank and its dark pool, the investor had to trust that the broker (and the bank the broker works for) acted in her best interest. But Lewis believes the banks often _didn’t_ act in her best interest—sometimes, instead of sending her order on to other exchanges where it could be executed, the bank would leave the order in its own dark pool, unfulfilled. So a customer’s order to buy Microsoft stock might sit in a bank’s dark pool, waiting to be paired with a seller's order to sell Microsoft stock. If a seller never enters the dark pool, the buy order would never be completed.

Lewis explains that banks sometimes wouldn’t send on customers’ orders because (1) they made commissions and avoided public exchange fees when they completed orders in their own dark pools, and (2) they wanted to make their dark pool statistics look good because they could then use their good dark pool statistics to advertise to outside investors that they were a good bank to trade with.

(Shortform note: While Lewis argues that the banks’ manipulation of orders poses a problem for investors, there could be a solution: smart routers, which are programs that determine where to send orders based on cost-effectiveness. For instance, a smart router might break up an investor’s large order and send it to a dark pool and an exchange that offers a rebate, thus giving the investor the best deal for their trade. But smart routers do come with disadvantages, such as increased latency and additional complexity required to complete an order. And just as the technology of HFT had consequences, smart router technology may eventually have unintended effects too.)

#### Selling Dark Pool Access

**Banks also made money from selling access to their dark pool to HF traders, despite telling their customers dark pools were safe from HFT**. Lewis explains that HF traders were willing to buy access because they could commit dark pool arbitrage, which generates more than a billion dollars a year. Selling dark pool access benefitted both HF traders and the firm at the expense of the individual investor, who (by nature of a dark pool) had no idea how the private trading worked.

So, when banks boasted that they had a large number of trades executed within their dark pool, the high number of transactions was often due to HF traders exploiting investors.

(Shortform note: In 2018, the SEC attempted to address the issues Lewis outlines by passing new regulations for dark pools, forcing banks to be more transparent about completed trade prices, fees, matching processes, and whether or not other traders have priority in their dark pool system. While this was a good first step in regulation, the SEC has expressed interest in implementing further transparency and disclosure surrounding the nature of dark pool operations, indicating the issues it set out to address in 2018 have persisted.)

### Flash Crash

After years of unregulated high-frequency trading, Wall Street experienced a “flash crash” in 2010. Lewis defines a flash crash as a stock market crash that happens quickly—stock prices drop dramatically before recovering within a few minutes. But during that time, 20,000 stocks traded at dramatically different stock values.

According to Lewis, no one could pinpoint a reason behind the flash crash. Katsuyama couldn’t access the data that could prove HFT caused the crash, since this information wasn’t public—it belonged to the HFT firms and exchanges—but he knew that the flash crash was a result of HFT.

The flash crash marked a turning point in the investing world. Investors were interested about what was going on in the market—and why it had dropped by 600 points so suddenly. People called Katsuyama and his team to set up informational meetings where he educated investors and executives about HFT.

> **Who Was Responsible for the Flash Crash?**
> 
> While Lewis blames the trillion-dollar flash crash on HF traders, the US courts found another reason: a self-taught stock market trader named Navinder Singh Sarao. He was convicted of “spoofing,” or creating a huge number of fake buy or sell orders. HFT firms program their algorithms to get out of the market when it gets too volatile, and **Sarao made the market _appear_ so volatile that all the algorithms pulled out at once, creating a crash.** He capitalized on the changing prices, earning about $900,000 from the flash crash.
> 
> While the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) found Sarao responsible for the flash crash, some experts contend that blaming Sarao doesn’t get to the heart of the issue—which is the fact that both human and algorithmic traders still have the ability to manipulate markets despite existing regulations.
