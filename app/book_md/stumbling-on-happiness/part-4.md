## Part 4: Six Poor Choices About What to Do in the Future

In the last part, we described the second part of Gilbert’s main argument: that your lack of awareness that you fabricate your reality leads you to make poor choices. We’ll now move on to the final part of Gilbert’s main argument: six specific poor choices about the future that leave you unhappy.

### Poor Choice #1: You Think You’ll Feel in the Future as You Do Now

According to Gilbert, **you make choices about the future that are based on feelings you have now.** Because how you’re feeling now may not reflect how you’d feel about the choice in the future, this can lead to poor decisions.

To explain this further, let’s first return to an idea we explored in Part 2.3: that your mind envisions the future using existing references (your current experiences and memories). Gilbert notes that when you’re considering a future choice, your mind pictures what that choice will look like using references from your past and present.**You then have an emotional reaction to this picture in your mind, and this emotional reaction informs your decision** —you’ll opt for the choice if you have a positive emotional reaction to the image of it.

**Problems arise when your brain is already experiencing a strong emotional reaction to something in the present.** In such cases, your brain focuses on your _present_ feeling—ignoring the true future emotional reaction to the scenario you’ve imagined—and transposes it onto your imagined future scenario. You thus think your _present_ feeling applies to the choice you’re considering for your _future_ , even if your present emotion has nothing to do with the choice at hand. This can lead you to, say, reject a choice that would make you happy just because you’re feeling sad in the present.

For instance, imagine you’re considering moving to Miami. On the day you’re making the choice, you feel fairly neutral—you have no strong emotions in the present. When deciding whether or not to make the move, you conjure up an image of Miami as it appears in your memories: warm and sunny. This image makes you feel good—you love warm climates! Therefore, you conclude that you should move to Miami because doing so will likely make you feel good.

Now, imagine that you’re making this choice on a day when you’re incredibly angry due to a recent breakup. When you imagine Miami, your brain transposes your anger onto the mental image—you think that living in Miami would irritate you because it would be hot and uncomfortable all the time (even though really, you love the heat). You therefore decide against the move based not on how you’d actually feel about living in Miami, but based on how you’re feeling _right now_. This is a poor choice that sabotages an attempt at future happiness.

> **Thinking Rationally, Not Emotionally**
> 
> Gilbert’s description of how we accidentally transpose current feelings onto imagined future scenarios suggests that we’re doomed to make bad choices based on misplaced emotions. However, there may be a way to circumvent this issue: by using _logic-driven_ tools to assess your choices, rather than relying on your possibly flawed emotions to make decisions.
> 
> One way to do this is by implementing a rigorous decision-making process in a spreadsheet:
> 
>   * **Step 1:** State the goal of your decision—for instance, to move to a new city where you can live for the next 10 years.
> 
>   * **Step 2:** Brainstorm options for achieving this goal. In this case, you’d write down cities you’re considering.
> 
>   * **Step 3** : Define a set of criteria by which you’ll judge each option. At this point, rather than having an emotional reaction to your memories of both cities and making a decision based on that reaction, you’d instead decide what living criteria matter to you: cost of living, proximity to public transit, and so on.
> 
>   * **Step 4:** Assign a degree of importance to each criterion. You might value the cost of living over proximity to public transit, as you’re on a budget.
> 
>   * **Step 5:** Define questions about how well each option fits the criteria. You might define the question “What is the average cost of a condo in each city?”
> 
>   * **Step 6:** Perform rounds of research to answer the questions and rank the different options based on your findings and the degree of importance of each criterion. (Don’t be afraid to re-rank the options based on new information as you continue your research.)
> 
> 


### Poor Choice #2: You Mispredict How Much Variety You’ll Want Over Time

You also make poor choices about the future because **you mispredict the amount of variety you’ll want across long stretches of time in the future,** writes Gilbert. You do this because, as with the first poor choice, you transpose your feelings about the present onto your vision of the future. You know that variety makes you happy in the short term, so you incorrectly think variety will make you happier over long periods of time.

Let’s break this down further: Most of us recognize that our enjoyment of something—playing ping-pong, for instance—decreases the more we do it. It therefore makes sense to vary what you do each day, by swapping ping-pong for tennis every other night, for example. You don’t enjoy tennis as much, but at least by regularly taking a break from ping-pong, your enjoyment of that sport remains high.

However, according to Gilbert, we mistakenly think we’ll also want variety _across long stretches of time_. In reality, when there are long gaps between occurrences—if you only play ping-pong once a week, for instance—your enjoyment of the activity remains high. But you mistakenly think it won’t, so you begrudgingly swap ping-pong for tennis every other week, even though you don’t really need to. This makes you less happy than sticking with ping-pong each week.

> **Happiness by the Hour and by the Day**
> 
> Gilbert claims we make poor choices about the future because we incorrectly think high variety over a long stretch of time will make us happy. Researchers have drilled down even further into the connection between time, variety, and happiness. They’ve looked at happiness and variety in the specific time frames of days and hours to answer the question: What degree of variety makes you happiest over the span of an hour or a day?
> 
> It turns out that over the course of a full day, variety helps sustain happiness because you feel excited by performing multiple tasks. However, over the shorter period of an hour, variety decreases happiness because your sense of productivity declines: You don’t feel you’ve accomplished much in the hour due to constantly flitting between tasks, and you waste additional time transitioning from one task to another.
> 
> What’s more, the type of activity you’re performing doesn’t matter when it comes to variety decreasing happiness in short timeframes. You’ll have the same negative experience whether you’re introducing too much variety when working for an hour or when enjoying an hour’s free time.

### Poor Choice #3: You Compare Future Choices to Choices in the Present and Past

The third poor choice about the future happens because when considering options for the future, **you draw ineffective comparisons to the present and the past** , writes Gilbert.

(Shortform note: We make poor comparisons in all areas of our lives, not just in thinking about the future, as Gilbert describes. For example, Barry Schwartz writes in _The Paradox of Choice _that we make ourselves unhappy by comparing our choices not to the present or past but to the choices of others. Such comparisons can erode our happiness by making us feel inferior to others.)

Let’s look in detail at two types of ineffective comparison:

#### Bad Comparison #1: Comparing to the Present, Rather Than the Future

The first bad comparison you make is comparing a choice to _other choices that are currently available_ —not to the other choices you’ll have _in the future_. Your circumstances may change in the future, and a choice that looks good now compared to your other present options may not look so good later.

Here’s an example: You’re at a small furniture store, considering which of two couches to buy. Couch 1 is both cheaper and more attractive than Couch 2, so you purchase it. However, later that afternoon, you drive by a larger furniture store and see five other couches in the window, all of which are cheaper and more attractive than your just-purchased Couch 1. You made a poor choice because you compared Couch 1 only to the choices currently available—Couch 2—rather than considering that if you visit another store in the future, you might find better couches.

#### Bad Comparison #2: Comparing to the Past, Rather Than the Future

The second bad comparison you make is comparing the future to the past, writes Gilbert. If a choice is more attractive now than it was, say, two months ago, you might opt for that choice, even if a better choice might arise in the future.

For instance, you might purchase an ottoman for $200 because its price has been marked down from two months ago, making it a better choice now than it was previously. However, later that day, you find another ottoman online priced only at $150. Because you compared the $200 ottoman solely to its past price point, you think you got a good deal. In reality, you could have saved _more_ money by considering that you might come across even cheaper ottomans in the future.

> **Using Delayed Gratification to Leave Room for Future Options**
> 
> One way to leave room for future options in your deliberations, rather than just making a choice based on present options or comparisons to the past, is to practice delaying gratification. It may be tempting or easy to make a choice _now_ based on available information about present options or changes compared to the past. Furthermore, making a choice quickly based on this accessible information may feel satisfying. But if you can delay the gratification of making the choice, thus delaying the choice itself, you may find yourself able to take advantage of new options that come up in the future.
> 
> You can practice delaying gratification by delaying it first by a tiny amount of time—for instance, waiting just an hour before making a choice to see if other options come up—and then slowly increasing the delay time to days or even weeks.

### Poor Choice #4: You Anticipate Regretting the Wrong Choice

According to Gilbert, the fourth type of poor choice about the future happens because **you misjudge how much regret you’ll feel in the future and over what choice.** Specifically, you mistakenly think you’ll regret a bold, risky decision and that you won’t regret a safe decision. Because you want to avoid the pain of regret, you often opt for the safe decision. In reality, you’re more likely to regret a safe decision than a bold one, claims Gilbert.

(Shortform note: Gilbert presents regret as a negative feeling to avoid. But in _The Paradox of Choice, _Barry Schwartz argues that you could see regret as fulfilling several positive functions: The threat of regret causes you to seriously consider decisions, rather than making snap choices. Regret in the wake of a bad decision is also a learning tool, he writes, because it tells you how to behave better moving forward. Finally, when you regret something, you’re more likely to fix the situation or make amends with anyone you’ve harmed.)

This error in reasoning occurs, argues Gilbert, because we think that if a big, risky choice goes wrong, we'll feel terrible due to all that we've staked and lost. But this isn't true: As we discussed in Part 3.2, your brain protects you from adversity following big mistakes by finding meaning in what happened and convincing you it happened for a reason. So, even if the risk goes wrong, you won't feel bad. You're more likely to feel bad _if a safe bet goes wrong_ , as it'll likely lead to only minor inconvenience, and as discussed, your brain can't protect you from that.

Let’s look at an example to illustrate this idea: You’re deciding between starting your own business and staying at your current job that you don’t enjoy. Starting your own business is the riskier decision, and you vividly imagine the regret you’ll feel if you fail. Meanwhile, staying at your current job elicits less fear of regret because the risk is smaller. To avoid regret, you therefore opt to stay at your current job.

This is, from a happiness-maximization perspective, the wrong decision. Even if your risky choice to start your own business fails and leads to adversity, your automatic happiness-protecting response will kick in: You’ll derive meaning and learning from the experience, and you won’t regret it. If you stay in your current job, on the other hand, you’ll never be unhappy enough to trigger that happiness-protecting response. You’ll therefore languish in a state of moderate unhappiness, which you’ll regret.

> **Consciously Protect Your Happiness**
> 
> One way to overcome the harmful attitude toward regret Gilbert describes here and to increase your comfort with making risky choices is to _consciously_ use the happiness-protecting strategy your mind implements subconsciously. When you force yourself to see potentially devastating outcomes of your risky choices as _learning_ experiences, you won’t fear regretting those choices as much and will be emboldened to make them.
> 
> Tony Robbins argues this point in _Awaken the Giant Within_. He writes that many people passively let life carry them along—we can see this as analogous to constantly making safe, regret-minimizing choices that maintain your status quo. To seize control of your life and make the bold choices required to better it, Robbins writes that you should consciously view bad decisions as learning experiences that improve your sense of judgment in the future.

### Poor Choice #5: You Opt for Freedom When Lack of Freedom Makes You Happier

The fifth type of poor choice you make concerns your desire for freedom: According to Gilbert,**you opt for choices that grant you greater freedom in the future, when, in reality, the choices that limit your freedom make you happier**.

You’re happier when you have less freedom thanks again to your automatic happiness-protecting response, writes Gilbert. This response triggers when you have little power and few options so that despite this adversity you can still be happy. However, you’re not _aware_ this response will kick in. Therefore, you always make the choice that keeps your options open to avoid the discomfort you think lack of choice will bring.

In reality, having many options makes you unhappy because you constantly doubt yourself, claims Gilbert: Should you choose A or B? Was A the right choice? Should you switch to B? When you’re not locked into a choice, your mind second-guesses, and this produces unhappiness.

Let’s look at an example: You’re deciding between an eight-year biology research program in a remote rainforest that you can’t leave for the duration of the program and an eight-year local program that you can leave if you don’t like it. Which program will you choose?

Most will opt for the second program because they feel it will make them happier in the future to have the option to quit. But, the first program will probably make you happier. Even if you’re initially miserable in the rainforest, your happiness-protecting response will kick in as a protective mechanism. You’ll thus derive meaning and joy from being in the rainforest—for instance, by believing that you’re growing as a person. Meanwhile, if you choose the other program, you’ll wonder if it was the right choice or if you should use your ability to quit and look for something better.

> **Coping With Many Options**
> 
> Though Gilbert shows that choices that provide you with fewer liberties make you happier, most people won’t take those liberty-reducing options. Instead, they’ll make choices that give them the flexibility to choose something better later.
> 
> Yet soon, those who’ve chosen the flexible option will need to make more choices: to stick with their first choice or to use the flexibility to make a different, better choice. In _The Paradox of Choice, _Barry Schwartz describes several strategies for dealing with such choice abundance:
> 
>   * **Don’t worry about what you’re missing**.**** Instead, consider if you’re content with your existing choice. If you are, stop looking for better options.
> 
>   * **Once you’ve made a decision, stick with it**.**** This is the happiness-maximizing response on a conscious level: recognizing the value of the choice you’ve made and being content that you’ve made it, regardless of what happens.
> 
>   * **Be grateful for the positive facets of your choice**. Even if your choice isn’t perfect, there are undoubtedly some positive aspects to it. You’ll be happier if you’re thankful for those aspects.
> 
> 

> 
> Using these active decision-making strategies can also help you more quickly adjust to a freedom-limiting choice—perhaps even before your automatic happiness-maximizing response kicks in.

### Poor Choice #6: You Prefer Explanations When Mystery Often Makes You Happier

The last poor choice you make, writes Gilbert, is **thinking you’ll be happier with _rational_ explanations for occurrences than with unsolved or mysterious ones**. You think you prefer rational explanations because often, these explanations benefit you. Explaining rationally how or why something occurred allows you to learn and grow from it: For example, if you get into a fender-bender and explain it as being the result of the other driver’s incorrect turn signal, you learn to be wary of turn signals.

Additionally, says Gilbert, you can often rationally explain occurrences in ways that let you feel happier about them. For instance, your explanation of the fender-bender places the fault in the other driver’s hands, not yours, which makes you happy.

However, there’s another angle to consider, claims Gilbert: While humans benefit from creating explanations for incidents, we also benefit from _not_ doing so. This is because unexplained events leave you pondering them for longer than events you explain, which is in itself a pleasurable activity. However, because we’re not conscious of the pleasure of pondering a mystery, says Gilbert, we make choices about the future that provide us with explanations, not uncertainty.

Here’s an example: A literary magazine has accepted your short story, and you receive feedback from the magazine. You’ll likely devour this information, as you feel it will make you happy to hear what you did well. While this may be true, you might derive _more_ happiness from not reading the feedback because the mystery of why you were accepted will cause you to think about it for longer, prolonging your pleasure.

> **The Pleasure of Mystery in Stories**
> 
> Gilbert isn’t the only person to pick up on the happiness-prolonging powers of mystery. Filmmaker JJ Abrams __ has used big, unsolved mysteries as devices in many of his shows and films, most notably the TV series _Lost._ But Abrams goes beyond his own work to describe _all_ stories as containers of mystery: At each moment, the narrative asks a new question and presents a new mystery. Once that mystery is solved, a new one arises. This is, according to Abrams, the basic format of all good stories and the best way to keep an audience entertained and happy.
> 
> Abrams also believes that in life, mystery and unknowns mean possibility, hope, and potential. Mysteries drive imagination, he says—when something is unexplained, you can come up with your own exciting stories to explain it.
> 
> Nonetheless, he concedes, as does Gilbert, that rational explanations are _also_ often necessary to your audience’s—and your—happiness. While stories must create mysteries, stories must also solve the mysteries to satisfy viewers and keep them engaged.
