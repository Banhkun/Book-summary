## Part 1: Why It’s Difficult to Talk About Happiness

Have you ever wondered why you so often regret the decisions you make about what to do in the future? In _Stumbling on Happiness,_ Harvard psychology professor Daniel Gilbert points out that our imaginations (our capacity to envision the future and speculate about what will make us happiest), memories, and perceptions of the present are highly subjective and inaccurate. When we make choices about our futures based on this inaccurate information, those choices end up hindering our future happiness. For this reason, it seems that we more often stumble on happiness than successfully create it.

Gilbert found that during moments of adversity in his life, he was incapable of understanding that his unhappiness would pass and that life would go back to normal—in other words, he was fabricating a dark vision of the future that didn’t reflect what it would truly be like. He embarked on a journey to discover why he was unable to accurately predict the future (and how he’d feel about it), and his research in this area became the basis for this book. _Stumbling on Happiness_ may not show you how to predict the future and overcome the cognitive barriers to making good choices about your future—Gilbert believes this is impossible—but it will show you why you end up making bad choices.

We’ve broken this guide into five parts: Part 1 provides background information on the inherent difficulties of discussing happiness objectively. In this part, we’ll also present two propositions that will allow us to cope with those difficulties as much as possible so we can have a productive conversation about happiness.

In Part 2, we’ll discuss the first section of Gilbert’s argument: that your mind fabricates your reality by manipulating your memories, your perception of the present, and your imagination of the future.

Part 3 will cover the next section of Gilbert’s argument: that you’re not aware your mind fabricates your reality. Therefore, you trust this fabricated reality and use it as the basis for your decision-making about the future. Because you’re using fabricated, not truthful, information, your decisions are poor and unconducive to happiness.

In Part 4, we’ll present six types of poor choices you make due to the process outlined above. Finally, in Part 5, we’ll show why, despite your best efforts, you can’t correct your decision-making about your future based on lessons from past experiences and the experiences of others.

Let’s now cover the five reasons Gilbert believes it’s difficult to discuss happiness objectively:

### Reason #1: Happiness Is Difficult to Even Describe

According to Gilbert, the first reason it’s difficult to talk about happiness is that **you can’t describe it unless you reference something else.** You can only talk about happiness by saying what _makes_ you happy or what happiness is _like._ You can’t concretely say what happiness itself _is_.

For instance, you might explain to a friend that the happiness you felt when your fiancé proposed was _like_ the feeling of awakening to a warm spring morning, or you might show them a picture of your delighted face in an engagement photo. You can’t, however, describe your happiness without these references.

(Shortform note: Gilbert contends that it’s difficult to _describe_ happiness without using external comparisons. However, researchers have been able to discern with more ease what _makes_ you happy: In the seminal Harvard Study of Adult Development, which tracked the health and well-being of 268 Harvard students over the course of 80 years, researchers found that having strong relationships was the greatest predictor of happiness.)

### Reason #2: Sometimes, We’re Only Happy _About_ Something

Another reason why Gilbert believes it’s hard to speak about happiness is that **sometimes, we say we’re happy, but we’re only happy _about_ something**. Being happy is different from being happy “about,” which is commenting on someone else’s happiness or the _potential_ to be happy.

For instance, you probably aren’t happy that your neighbor left their dogs with you while they vacation in Hawaii, but you might say you’re happy _about_ the fact that they’re taking a break. In this case, you’re commenting on your neighbor’s happiness, rather than experiencing happiness directly. Later, you might say you’ll be happy _about_ their return—you’re not happy now, but you’re commenting on your potential _future_ happiness.

(Shortform note: Gilbert proposes that feeling happy _about_ something isn’t the same as being happy. In fact, when you say you’re happy _for_ someone or _about_ something, you might even be feeling the opposite of happiness: anger or envy. For example, if your neighbor leaves their dog with you while they go to Hawaii, you might feel anger over having more responsibility. When this occurs, balance out your negative feelings with positive ones by refraining from comparing yourself to the other person. This reduces unhappiness that arises when you feel others have it better than you.)

### Reason #3: We Confuse Happiness With Virtue

Gilbert writes that we further struggle to talk about happiness because **we often confuse virtuous behavior—which only _leads_ to happiness—for happiness itself**. You might thus think you’re automatically happy when doing virtuous volunteer work at a soup kitchen. But this isn’t true: You can volunteer virtuously for years, but if you don’t enjoy the work, you won’t feel genuine happiness. You’ll only be making _other people_ —the users of the soup kitchen—happy through your behavior.

(Shortform note: Gilbert argues that virtuous behavior isn’t tantamount to happiness. Others go even further to argue that if you act virtuously with the expectation of it making you happy, it reduces the virtue of the act. In _Skin in the Game, _Nassim Nicholas Taleb proposes that the smaller the reward you receive personally for a virtuous act, the more virtuous it is. Indeed, virtuous behavior should make you somewhat uncomfortable, he says, because it should require you to make a sacrifice or take a risk.)

### Reason #4: We Use Different Scales to Describe Happiness

Another reason it’s hard to speak about and compare levels of happiness, writes Gilbert, is that we all have different scales by which we measure happiness, yet none of us know what the other person’s scale is. Therefore, we might unknowingly describe the same amount of happiness in different terms.

Here’s an example to illustrate this: You and your friend go to a doughnut shop and eat the same plain doughnut. You both have the same _experience_ of the doughnut (five units of fun, say), but afterward, you exclaim it was “awesome!” while your friend says it was “okay.”

Gilbert writes that the explanation for this would be that your friend has had better doughnuts in the past that created, say, seven units of happiness, meaning comparatively, this “five units of happiness” doughnut merits only an “okay.” You, on the other hand, have only ever eaten _worse_ doughnuts that created _less_ happiness (say, two units of happiness). You describe this one as “awesome!” because compared to your previous experiences, it _seems_ amazing on your “happiness scale,” even if it only really creates mid-level happiness.

(Shortform note: We might also look to culture and language to explain why different people describe things differently. American English is notoriously hyperbolic, and Americans use explosive words where other cultures use milder ones. An “awesome!” to an American might correspond to a mere “fine” from a British person. To be accurately understood in a different culture, you might need to adopt the level of hyperbole common to that culture. An English person new to a job in the States might need to begin using words like “amazing” and “excellent” when they would have previously just used the word “fine.”)

### Reason #5: We Might Not Register That We’re Happy

The last reason it’s hard to discuss happiness is that sometimes, **you’re not aware you’re happy** , writes Gilbert. This is because the part of your brain that processes _experience_ —the experience of happiness or anger, for instance—is separate from the part of your brain that develops _awareness_ of the experience—the conscious knowledge that you’re happy or angry. You can therefore have a physiological experience of happiness but not _register_ that you’re happy, explains Gilbert.

(Shortform note: Gilbert asserts that you don’t always know when you’re happy. Still, you can take steps to improve your awareness of your emotional state by meditating. Meditation helps you be more present with your thoughts and feelings when they come up. During meditation, you can even pose questions to yourself to become more in tune with your inner experience and promote further happiness. You might ask yourself what you’re trying to accomplish in life now and what obstacles are in your way. This can make you both more aware of your feelings (for instance, frustration about the obstacles) and also of potential solutions to problems that can make you happier.)

### How to Talk About Happiness Despite These Difficulties

Now that we’ve covered the ways in which Gilbert believes the act of talking about happiness is inherently difficult, you might be asking yourself why we should try to do so at all. While Gilbert acknowledges the challenges involved in doing so, he claims we can still have a constructive discourse about happiness and presents two propositions on how to do this:

#### Proposition #1: We Should Rely on Firsthand Accounts of Happiness

Though our attempts to discuss happiness will always be flawed, Gilbert writes that they will be _least_ flawed if **we rely on accounts of happiness by the people experiencing it** —not by observers. Someone eating a cookie is better able to describe the happiness of eating a cookie than the person _watching_ them eat a cookie, for instance.

(Shortform note: There are both advantages, as Gilbert points out, and disadvantages to using self-reported data on happiness—or, indeed, anything. Common disadvantages include people (particularly experiment subjects) giving responses they think are socially acceptable, rather than honest. For instance, when asked if a picture of a smiling baby makes them happy, a subject may answer “yes” because they think that’s the acceptable response, even if it’s not true. Subjects can also interpret questions differently, leading to incomparable data. For example, someone might interpret a question as being about their _general_ level of happiness, while another subject might interpret the same question as referring to their _present_ happiness.)

#### Proposition #2: Large Numbers of Similar Experiences Are Reasonably Accurate

Additionally, Gilbert states that **when large numbers of people report the same experience of happiness, we can take that experience to be reasonably accurate** —this is commonly known as the law of large numbers. In formulating his principles about happiness, Gilbert therefore relies on ideas and definitions of happiness that large sample sizes of people commonly agree upon.

> **The Law of Large Numbers in AI Medicine**
> 
> The law of large numbers has applications beyond understanding human behavior, as Gilbert proposes here. In artificial intelligence, for instance, scientists use it to suggest the best course of treatment for a certain condition. AI first picks out relevant information about treatments and their success rates from a vast array of medical records. It then sorts that information based on patterns it detects: for instance, which treatments were the most successful in certain circumstances. Finally, it proposes the treatment most likely to succeed for a specific patient based on the information it found and categorized.
> 
> It’s only by using the law of large numbers—and the idea that the shared results of large numbers of similar treatment experiences tend to be accurate—that AI can recommend treatments effectively.
