## Part 3: Your Fabricated Reality Leads You to Make Poor Choices

We’ve just outlined the first part of Gilbert’s main argument: that your brain fabricates your perception of the past, present, and future. Now let’s move on to the second part of his main thesis: **how this fabricated reality leads you to make decisions about the future that aren’t conducive to happiness.**

To present this part of the argument, we’ll first show that you lack awareness that your brain fabricates your reality. We’ll then describe how this lack of awareness makes you happier now but eventually forms the foundation for poor decision-making that results in your unhappiness.

### You Aren’t Aware You’re Fabricating Your Reality

Though you always supplement memories with assumed information, interpret events in the present positively, and imagine improbable futures, you don’t _recognize_ you do this, says Gilbert. **You believe you see, remember, and imagine the world exactly as it is** and that your memories, experience of the present, and imaginings of the future are therefore objectively correct.

(Shortform note: According to Gilbert, you fabricate your entire reality but _believe_ _incorrectly_ that you perceive it objectively. However, this view may be too extreme: Sometimes, you _do_ perceive the world objectively. For instance, when you touch a rose, you don’t fabricate your reality of being in pain—you experience the pain objectively. On the other hand, when your friend fails to smile at you and you’re immediately certain they’re mad at you, you’re fabricating your reality to a higher degree.)

### Your Lack of Awareness Makes You Happier Now

Your lack of awareness that you’re constantly fabricating your reality is in some ways good, writes Gilbert, because **it lets you enjoy a “blissfully ignorant” happiness in the _present_**. As we’ve shown, your brain goes to great lengths to ensure you’re as happy as possible now: As we discussed, it uses five techniques to interpret events in the present to reflect well on you, and it creates fabricated visions of the future because doing so is pleasurable and the perceived control over your life makes you happy. Gilbert contends that if you saw through this positive interpretation of the present and recognized that your vision of the future was fundamentally incorrect, you wouldn’t be as happy as often.

> **Being Happier While Also Being Aware**
> 
> Gilbert says your present happiness results from ignorance that you’re fabricating your reality. However, not everyone agrees that happiness in the current moment need merely be the result of ignorance. You can and should actively choose to be happy in the present as often as you can, argues Norman Vincent Peale in _The Power of Positive Thinking. _
> 
> Do this by making a habit of being happy through your thoughts, actions, and lifestyle: Think and behave in ways known to create happiness. For instance, keep your mind free from worry, help others, and live simply.

### Your Lack of Awareness Leads to Poor Choices About What to Do in the Future

Unfortunately, continues Gilbert, your happiness rooted in blissful ignorance isn’t permanent. Your lack of awareness that you’re fabricating your reality means you use fabricated, inaccurate memories and experiences to inform your choices about the future. Because these choices are based on falsehoods and overly optimistic imaginings, **they often lead to unexpected and poor outcomes, which do _not_ make you happy**.

For instance, based on a memory of a short hike you took and _think_ you enjoyed, you fabricate a vague vision of yourself in five years in which you’re climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and enjoying it. This vague and fabricated vision informs your decision to begin training for the climb. However, it turns out this decision makes you miserable because you hate physical exertion. In fact, you hated the physical exertion of your initial short hike, but strategically omitted that negative detail when calling on your memories to create your vision of the Kilimanjaro climb. The choice to climb Kilimanjaro ultimately becomes a poor one because of these delusional imaginings.

> **Why Don’t All Choices Make Us Happy?**
> 
> Over the last few chapters, we’ve seen that our brains are wired to keep us as happy as possible as often as possible. This raises the question: If our minds are hard-wired to make us deludedly happy no matter what, why does Gilbert believe that certain decisions about the future make us _unhappy_? Shouldn’t our positive, fabricated interpretation of the world kick in to allow us to be happy even if we make “wrong,” unhappiness-producing choices about the future, as Gilbert describes above?
> 
> We might explain this by saying that certain choices about the future prevent us from using one or more of our previously described happiness-maintaining techniques. For instance, if you join a group of people training to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, you’re no longer surrounding yourself with friends who bolster your belief that climbing the mountain will be fun and easy. Instead, you’re surrounded by experienced people who tell you that the climb will be incredibly difficult—and this erodes your happiness as a result of your choice.
