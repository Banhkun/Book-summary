## 1-Page Summary

In _Stumbling on Happiness,_ Harvard psychology professor Daniel Gilbert shows how, despite our best efforts, we often fail to make choices that maximize our future happiness. He claims this is because our imaginations (our capacity to envision the future and speculate about what will make us happiest), our memories, and perceptions of the present are highly subjective and inaccurate. When we make choices about our futures based on this inaccurate information, those choices end up being sub-optimal and not conducive to our future happiness. It seems that we more often stumble on happiness than successfully create it.

In this guide, we’ll first describe why it’s hard to talk about happiness and how we can get around those hurdles to have a productive conversation about it. We’ll then outline Gilbert’s argument that we fabricate the past, present, and future, and that this fabricated view of the world leads us to make happiness-reducing choices about our future. We’ll conclude by showing how, despite our best intentions, we can’t ever overcome these errors in our decision-making.

### Why It’s Difficult to Talk About Happiness

According to Gilbert, a major reason why it’s difficult to talk about happiness is that **you can’t describe it unless you reference something else.** You can only talk about happiness by saying what _makes_ you happy or what happiness is _like._ You cannot concretely say what happiness itself _is_.

For instance, you might explain to a friend that the happiness you felt when your fiancé proposed was _like_ the feeling of awakening to a warm spring morning, or you might show them a picture of your delighted face in an engagement photo. You can’t, however, describe your happiness without these references.

(Shortform note: Gilbert contends that it’s difficult to _describe_ happiness without using external comparisons. However, researchers have been able to discern with more ease what _makes_ you happy: In the seminal Harvard Study of Adult Development, which tracked the health and well-being of 268 Harvard students over the course of 80 years, researchers found that having strong relationships was the greatest predictors of happiness.)

#### How to Talk About Happiness Despite This Difficulty

While Gilbert acknowledges the difficulty of discussing happiness, he claims you can still have a constructive discourse about it and presents two propositions for how to do this:

##### Proposition #1: We Should Rely on First-Hand Accounts of Happiness

Though our attempts to discuss happiness will always be flawed, Gilbert writes that they will be _least_ flawed if **we rely on accounts of happiness by the people experiencing it** —not by observers. Someone eating a cookie is better able to describe the happiness of eating a cookie than the person _watching_ them eat a cookie, for instance.

(Shortform note: There are both advantages, as Gilbert points out, and disadvantages to using self-reported data on happiness—or, indeed, anything. Common disadvantages include people (particularly experiment subjects) giving responses they think are socially acceptable, rather than honest. For instance, when asked if a picture of a smiling baby makes them happy, a subject may answer “yes” because they feel that to be the acceptable response, even if it’s not true. Subjects can also interpret questions differently. For instance, one subject might interpret a question as being about their _general_ level of happiness in life, while another subject might interpret the same question as referring to their _present_ happiness.)

##### Proposition #2: Large Numbers of Similar Experiences Are Reasonably Accurate

Additionally, Gilbert states that **when large numbers of people report the same experience of happiness, we can take that experience to be reasonably accurate** —this is commonly known as the law of large numbers. In formulating his principles about happiness, Gilbert therefore relies on ideas and definitions of happiness that large sample sizes of people commonly agree upon.

> **The Law of Large Numbers in AI Medicine**
> 
> The law of large numbers has applications beyond understanding human behavior, as Gilbert proposes here. In artificial intelligence, for instance, scientists use it to suggest the best course of treatment for a certain condition. AI first picks out relevant information about treatments and their success rates from a vast array of medical records. It then sorts that information based on patterns it detects: for instance, which treatments were the most successful in certain circumstances. Finally, it proposes the treatment most likely to succeed for a specific patient based on the information it found and categorized.
> 
> It’s only by using the law of large numbers—and the idea that the shared results of large numbers of similar treatment experiences tend to be accurate—that AI can recommend treatments effectively.

### You Fabricate Your Reality: Fabricated Memories

We’ve just described why it’s hard to talk about happiness and the strategies we can use to reduce that difficulty as much as possible. Now, let’s turn to the first part of the argument Gilbert makes about why it’s so hard to predict what will make us happy: that your mind _fabricates_ your memories, perception of the present, and imaginings of the future and that these are not objective reflections of reality. We’ll start by describing how the mind fabricates your memories.

#### Your Brain Fills in Omissions in Memories With Assumed Information

According to Gilbert, when you summon a memory, **your mind supplements existing pieces of your memory with assumed information**. Your mind must do this because you don’t store memories as complete experiences of an event, which would include a massive amount of sensory detail, feelings, and thoughts. Memories are only stored _snippets_ and _narratives_ of the event, with many details omitted. This means that your memories are made up of both true-to-life information and assumed (potentially false) information that fills the omissions.

For instance, if you spend a day at the zoo, all you might store in your memory from that detail-rich experience is a recollection of it being too hot and perhaps the phrase “pandas asleep.” Your brain wouldn’t store the sensory experience of the heat and the crystal-clear visuals of the sleeping pandas. When you summon that memory, your brain fills in these gaps with assumptions of what belongs there: that the ice cream melted quickly, that the sleeping pandas were cute, and so on.

(Shortform note: To at least partially circumvent this issue, we might try to strengthen our memories so we don’t rely as much on fabricated information. According to Joshua Foer in _Moonwalking With Einstein_ , you can do this by _storing_ memories more intentionally: Visualize the information you want to remember and then mentally place that visual in a location you’re familiar with, like your home. For example, if you want to remember the ostriches at the zoo, visualize them and then place that image in your backyard.)

### You Fabricate Your Reality: Fabricated Perception of the Present

Now that we’ve explored how you fill in inevitable gaps in your memory with assumed information, let’s move on to describe one way in which, according to Gilbert, you fabricate your _present_ reality: by interpreting present events in a way that’s advantageous to you. In particular, you interpret ambiguous events—events that reflect neither positively nor negatively on you—as reflecting on you positively.

Here’s an example: You’re hosting your first art showing, and a patron declares that your work is “interesting.” That word is ambiguous—it’s not definitively positive or negative. You choose to interpret it positively, as that’s more advantageous to you.

(Shortform note: Gilbert describes our tendency to positively interpret the present as universal. However, there may be cultures that are more likely to view events positively than others. For instance, many Latin American countries have high Positive Experience Indices (PEIs) because they focus more on the positive facets of life and have a strong ability to savor and take joy in experiences.)

You interpret the world to your benefit using the following techniques, continues Gilbert:

#### Technique #1: You Look for Information That Supports What You Want to Believe

First, you only look for information that supports what you want to believe, claims Gilbert, and you ignore information that supports the opposite. For instance, if you decide to get a Labrador puppy rather than a St. Bernard puppy, you’ll want to believe that Labs are better than St. Bernards. You’ll therefore only pay attention to the blog posts, advice, and articles expounding the virtues of the Labrador and won’t pay attention to any information on how wonderful St. Bernards are.

(Shortform note: The tendency Gilbert describes here is commonly known as confirmation bias. While confirmation bias makes your life comfortable by allowing you to see the world the way you wish to see it, it also has drawbacks: For instance, it makes it difficult to have productive and balanced conversations around politics, because you only pay attention to information that supports your existing political beliefs, not to information that supports the beliefs of the opposing political party.)

#### Technique #2: You Have an Automatic Happiness-Protecting Response to Adversity

Another technique you use to see the world to your benefit relates specifically to difficult situations, writes Gilbert. **When something bad happens to you, you interpret that event in a way that lets you be as happy as possible about it**.

Your mind does this by deriving meaning and learning from bad events. Feeling that there's sense behind a terrible event and that you’ve learned something from it allows you to feel happy—or at least thankful—that this event happened.

Here’s an example: If your family’s business goes under, you’ll be understandably miserable at first. But soon, your mind will begin to derive meaning from this occurrence: You’ll feel this was a sign to pursue a career you really love, you’ll be grateful that you no longer have to work alongside family members you don’t like, and so on. Eventually, you’ll probably be able to declare yourself happy that the business went under.

That said, continues Gilbert, **your mind is _less_ able to derive meaning and learn from _moderately_ bad events, as opposed to _extremely_ bad events**. This is because moderately bad events don’t threaten your overall well-being as much as traumatic ones. Therefore, moderately bad events—like bad grades, fights with friends, and traffic—are more likely to leave you unhappy for longer than awful ones.

(Shortform note: How can you reduce the unhappiness you feel about moderately bad events, if your brain won’t do so automatically? You could practice deep breathing to reduce stress and irritation or try to find humor in unpleasant situations. You might also adopt a solutions-oriented approach to the bad event, considering what steps you can take to actively make things better.)

> **Your Happiness-Protecting Response and Antifragility**
> 
> Gilbert describes a mechanism that lets you interpret bad events positively. This is similar to Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s concept of antifragility, which he describes in _Antifragile. _Antifragility, according to Taleb, is the ability to not only bounce back from, but actually grow and improve as a result of unfortunate events.
> 
> Beyond automatic antifragility responses—post-traumatic growth, for instance, which is humans’ natural ability to improve as a result of trauma —Taleb also outlines active ways you can build your antifragility: for instance, by testing out many solutions to problems. This allows you to bounce back easily from a series of missteps, whereas investing a lot of time and energy into research toward a _single_ solution doesn’t give you as much flexibility to bounce back if that solution doesn’t work out.

#### Technique #3: You Surround Yourself With People Who Support Your Beliefs

Another technique you use to interpret the world to your benefit, writes Gilbert, is to **surround yourself with people who bolster your existing beliefs**. By agreeing with your beliefs and sharing your worldview, they enable you to see the world the way you want to see it.

(Shortform note: Gilbert seems to suggest that we always want our friends to confirm our beliefs and tell us what we want to hear. However, in situations where you suspect your behavior might be causing problems, you likely want truthful input so you can improve. Solicit this input by being clear on what type of input you’re after, say Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen, authors of _Thanks for the Feedback_. If you want the honest feedback of your friend on something you’ve said or done, _ask_ for honesty. This gives your friend permission to be frank with you.)

### You Fabricate Your Reality: Fabricated Future

We’ve just shown how your mind fabricates your present by interpreting events so they reflect well on you. We’ll now describe how your imagination works and how your mind fabricates your imaginings of the future.

#### The Mechanics of Imagining: You Use Existing Images, Experiences, and Memories

Gilbert says that you imagine things **using images, experiences, and memories already stored in your brain.** For instance,**** when you’re prompted to imagine a werewolf, your brain summons images of werewolves you’ve seen in movies. Your brain _must_ use existing images to imagine things, emphasizes Gilbert: Without an existing reference, your brain can’t imagine something. This is why, if someone asks you to imagine a “sneedle,” you can’t do it because you have no stored images of a sneedle.

(Shortform note: In the same way it’s impossible for us to imagine something we have no prior reference for, as Gilbert argues, it’s often impossible for writers of sci-Fi novels, TV shows, and films to imagine facets of the future for which there are no current references. For example, the 1991 film _Until the End of the World_ predicted that we would be using video-pay phones in 1999. At the time of the movie’s making, the scriptwriter perhaps could not conceive of a _personal_ mobile device that made video calls.)

#### Your Mind Fabricates Your Vision of the Future

Now that we’ve explained the basic mechanics of imagining, let’s turn to some of the ways your brain fabricates your vision of the future:

##### Fabrication #1: You Create an Image of the Future Using Existing References

Gilbert first writes that **you fabricate visions of the future that reflect events and experiences _you’ve already been through,_ rather than new events and experiences yet to come**. This is because, as described above, when you imagine future scenarios, your brain uses existing references—your current experiences and memories. The result, concludes Gilbert, is that your visions of the future don’t reflect what the future will be like.

Let’s see this in action: You discover you’ve won a prize at work, which your supervisor calls “amazing office swag.” You’ll receive this prize at the end of the day. You spend the rest of the day imagining what the prize will be, and you can only use your existing images or memories of “office swag” to do this. Perhaps in the past, you received a new cell phone as office swag, or you remember that your friend once won a car from her company. You therefore imagine that at the end of the day, you’ll receive a new cell phone and a car.

However, when the time comes, you only receive a mouse pad and a t-shirt. In this way, you’ve fabricated a vision of the future based only on existing images and memories—and this fabricated vision of the future ends up being incorrect.

> **The Upside of Using Existing References**
> 
> Here, Gilbert presents using past experiences as references when predicting the future as wholly unhelpful, as this process often leads you to fabricate improbable future scenarios. This begs the question: Can using past experiences as references _ever_ be helpful?
> 
> In _Thinking in Bets, _Annie Duke suggests that this process _can_ be helpful when making decisions in the _present_. She calls the act of thinking about past experiences (and imagining future scenarios) “mental time travel” and argues that this process helps you make more rational decisions. According to Duke, mental time travel forces you to use the deliberative part of your brain, which takes into account all possible information when making a choice. This includes helpful information about the past that you can use as a reference for good present decisions.
> 
> For instance, imagine you’re deciding whether or not to eat a fifth cookie. You use mental time travel to reflect on past scenarios when you ate five cookies in quick succession and remember that doing so made you feel unwell. You use this past experience as a reference for a positive present decision: You decide _not_ to eat the cookie and consequently avoid nausea.

##### Fabrication #2: You Omit Unpleasant Information From Your Vision of the Future

The second way your mind fabricates your view of the future is by omitting available yet unpleasant information from your predictions, writes Gilbert—particularly unpleasant information that questions the version of the future that you _want_ to play out or _believe_ will play out. Your mind does this because, as we saw when discussing interpreting the present, it prefers to consume information that supports your existing beliefs and ignore information that doesn’t.

This inclination to ignore undesirable information means you might create an image of the future that’s unrealistically positive. Here’s an example: You’re deciding between buying a gorgeous Victorian home that needs a lot of work and a newer yet less charming home. You know—perhaps even from previous experience—that the Victorian home will have structural problems due to its age and cost a lot to repair. But because you love the idea of living in a beautiful old home, you omit these shortcomings from your vision of your life in the Victorian home and buy it anyway. Once you’ve bought it, though, you’ll be unhappy with the amount and cost of repairs required.

(Shortform note: Gilbert suggests we omit disadvantageous information from our vision of the future because we don’t like to consider information that challenges our beliefs. But there might be an additional explanation for this tendency to leave out critical details: Our brains can only process a finite amount of information at a time. This means that in situations in which there’s a lot of information to consider—which house to buy, for instance—we simply can’t process it all. Our brains may then prioritize the advantageous information over the disadvantageous information, because, as Gilbert writes, it’s more appealing.)

### Your Fabricated Reality Leads You to Make Poor Choices

We’ve just outlined the first part of Gilbert’s main argument: that your brain fabricates your perception of the past, present, and future. Now let’s move on to the second part of his thesis: **how this fabricated reality leads you to make decisions about the future that aren’t conducive to happiness**.

To present this part of the argument, we’ll first show that you lack awareness that your brain is fabricating your reality. We’ll then describe how this lack of awareness forms the foundation for poor decision-making that results in your unhappiness.

#### You Aren’t Aware You’re Fabricating Your Reality

Though you always supplement memories with assumed information, interpret events in the present positively, and imagine improbable futures, you don’t _recognize_ you do this, says Gilbert. **You believe you see, remember, and imagine the world exactly as it is** and that your memories, experience of the present, and imaginings of the future are therefore objectively correct.

(Shortform note: According to Gilbert, you fabricate your entire reality but believe incorrectly that you perceive it objectively. However, this view may be too extreme: Sometimes, you _do_ perceive the world objectively. For instance, when you touch a rose, you don’t fabricate your reality of being in pain—you experience the pain objectively. On the other hand, when your friend fails to smile at you and you’re immediately certain they’re mad at you, you’re fabricating your reality to a higher degree.)

#### Your Lack of Awareness Leads to Poor Choices About What to Do in the Future

Your lack of awareness that you’re fabricating your reality means you use fabricated and inaccurate memories and experiences to inform your choices about the future, argues Gilbert. Because these choices are based on falsehoods and overly optimistic imaginings, they often lead to unexpected and poor outcomes, which do _not_ make you happy.

For instance, based on a memory of a short hike you took and _think_ you enjoyed, you fabricate a vague vision of yourself in five years in which you’re climbing Mount Kilimanjaro and enjoying it. This vague and fabricated vision informs your decision to begin training for the climb. However, it turns out this decision makes you miserable because you hate physical exertion. In fact, you hated the physical exertion of your initial short hike but strategically omitted that negative detail when calling on your memories to create your vision of the Kilimanjaro climb. The choice to climb the mountain ultimately becomes a poor one because of these delusional imaginings.

> **Why Don’t All Choices Make Us Happy?**
> 
> Earlier in this guide, we showed that our brains are wired to keep us as happy as possible as often as possible, even during adversity. This raises the question: If our minds are hard-wired to make us deludedly happy no matter what, why does Gilbert claim that certain decisions about the future make us _unhappy_? Shouldn’t our positive, fabricated interpretation of the world kick in to allow us to be happy even if we make “wrong,” unhappiness-producing choices about the future?
> 
> We might explain this by saying that certain choices about the future prevent us from using one or more of our previously described happiness-maintaining techniques. For instance, if you choose to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and join a group of people training for the climb, you’re no longer able to surround yourself with friends who bolster your belief that climbing the mountain will be fun and easy. Instead, you’re surrounded by experienced people who tell you that the climb will be incredibly difficult—and this erodes your happiness as a result of your choice.

### Specific Poor Choices About What to Do in the Future

We just described the second part of Gilbert’s main argument: that your lack of awareness that you fabricate your reality leads you to make poor choices. We’ll now move on to the final part of Gilbert’s main argument: the specific poor choices about the future that leave unhappy.

#### Poor Choice #1: You Think You’ll Feel in the Future as You Do Now

According to Gilbert, **you make choices about the future that are based on feelings you have now.** Because how you’re feeling now may not reflect how you’d feel about the choice in the future, this can lead to poor decisions.

To explain this further, let’s first return to an idea we explored earlier: that your mind envisions the future using existing references (your current experiences and memories). Gilbert notes that when you’re considering a future choice, your mind pictures what that choice will look like using references from your past and present.**You then have an emotional reaction to this picture in your mind, and this emotional reaction informs your decision** —you’ll opt for the choice if you have a positive emotional reaction to the image of it.

**Problems arise when your brain is already experiencing a strong emotional reaction to something in the present.** In such cases, your brain focuses on your _present_ feeling—ignoring the true future emotional reaction to the scenario you’ve imagined—and transposes it onto your imagined future scenario. You thus think your _present_ feeling applies to the choice you’re considering for your _future_ , even if your present emotion has nothing to do with the choice at hand. This can lead you to, say, reject a choice that would make you happy just because you’re feeling sad in the present.

> **Thinking Rationally, Not Emotionally**
> 
> Gilbert’s description of how we accidentally transpose current feelings onto imagined future scenarios suggests that we’re doomed to make bad choices based on misplaced emotions. However, there may be a way to circumvent this issue: by using _logic-driven_ tools to assess your choices, rather than relying on your possibly flawed emotions to make decisions.
> 
> One way to do this is by implementing a rigorous decision-making process in a spreadsheet:
> 
>   * **Step 1:** State the goal of your decision—for instance, to move to a new city where you can live for the next 10 years.
> 
>   * **Step 2:** Brainstorm options for achieving this goal. In this case, you’d write down cities you’re considering.
> 
>   * **Step 3** : Define a set of criteria by which you’ll judge each option. At this point, rather than having an emotional reaction to your memories of both cities and making a decision based on that reaction, you’d instead decide what living criteria matter to you: Cost of living, proximity to public transit, and so on.
> 
>   * **Step 4:** Assign a degree of importance to each criterion. You might value the cost of living over proximity to public transit, as you’re on a budget.
> 
>   * **Step 5:** Define questions about how well each option fits the criteria. You might define the question “What is the average cost of a condo in each city?”
> 
>   * **Step 6:** Perform multiple rounds of research to answer the questions and rank the different options based on your findings and the degree of importance of each criterion. (Don’t be afraid to re-rank the options based on new information as you continue your research.)
> 
> 


#### Poor Choice #2: You Anticipate Regretting the Wrong Choice

According to Gilbert, another type of poor choice about the future happens because **you misjudge how much regret you’ll feel in the future and over what choice.** Specifically, you mistakenly think that you’ll regret a bold, risky decision and that you won’t regret a safe decision. Because you want to avoid the pain of regret, you often opt for the safe decision. In reality, you’re more likely to regret a safe decision than a bold one.

(Shortform note: Gilbert presents regret as a negative feeling to avoid. But in _The Paradox of Choice, _Barry Schwartz argues that you could see regret as fulfilling several positive functions: The threat of regret causes you to seriously consider decisions, rather than making snap choices. Regret in the wake of a bad decision is also a learning tool, he writes, because it tells you how to behave better moving forward. Finally, when you regret something, you’re more likely to fix the situation or make amends with anyone you’ve harmed.)

### You Can’t Make Better Choices About Your Future Based on Memories

Let’s conclude this guide by talking about the errors in your memory that, in Gilbert’s view, prevent you from ever correcting your poor choices about the future.

#### Error #1: You Remember Uncommon Experiences More Than Common Ones

First, you believe that extraordinary events in your past are more likely to reoccur than they are, writes Gilbert. This means **you _base decisions_ on the expectation that extraordinary events will happen, when they probably won’t**.

You believe this because your mind recalls memories of extraordinary occurrences more readily than ordinary ones, claims Gilbert. Ordinary events and outcomes—like taking the train and arriving at work without incident—happen all the time, so your mind doesn’t register them as vividly as uncommon events and outcomes—like taking the train and being re-routed to a different city. You therefore overestimate the frequency and dominance of extraordinary events.

This means that when weighing a decision about the future, writes Gilbert, you’ll easily recall unique, extraordinary instances in the past when the option that normally doesn’t make you happy, _did_ make you happy. Based on this selective memory, you’ll choose the option that probably _won’t_ make you happy, thinking it’s more likely to generate happiness than it really is _._

> **Using Uncommon Experiences and Overcomplicated Considerations**
> 
> Gilbert claims that because your mind highlights memories of strange occurrences over commonplace ones, you believe strange events are more likely to occur in the future than they really are. You therefore base your choices about the future on uncommon past events.
> 
> In _Thinking Fast and Slow, _Daniel Kahneman describes a similar way your brain triggers poor decisions: by overcomplicating those decisions. Rather than relying on straightforward information and simple considerations—tantamount to using memories of commonplace occurrences to inform our choices—we give more weight to unimportant factors and favor complicated considerations over simple ones—which is similar to using unusual, extraordinary memories to inform our choices. This is a mistake, claims Kahneman, because often, simple considerations and decision-making formulas lead to the best decisions.

#### Error #2: You Remember How You _Should_ Have Felt, Not How You Really Felt

Another reason your memories can’t help you correct your decision-making is that you reconstruct memories to present how you think you _should_ have felt at the time, rather than how you _did feel_ , says Gilbert. This means **you don’t remember your true emotional reaction to an event and can’t learn from it**.

Here’s an example: You hated going to your sister’s wedding. However, you believe that you _should_ enjoy weddings because _everyone_ does. Therefore, you’ll falsely remember yourself as having been happy at the event=. This will prevent you from correcting your decision-making in the future, and you’ll RSVP “yes” to another wedding that will, in reality, not be fun for you.

(Shortform note: One way to better remember how you truly felt, rather than how you believe you _should_ have felt, is to journal about your feelings. By noting down when you’re having an intense emotional reaction to an event and what, specifically, you’re feeling, you create a reliable historical account of your feelings, to which you can later refer and learn from. Journaling can even help you _make sense of_ your feelings if you’re confused or overwhelmed about an event. This further reduces the chances that you’ll misremember or misinterpret how you felt about that event later.)
