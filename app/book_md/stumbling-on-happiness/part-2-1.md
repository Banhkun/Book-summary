## Part 2.1: You Fabricate Your Reality | Fabricated Memories

We’ve just described why it’s hard to talk about happiness and the strategies we can use to reduce that difficulty so that we can have a constructive conversation about it.

Now, let’s turn to the first part of the argument Gilbert makes about why it’s hard to predict what will make us happy: that your mind _fabricates_ your memories, perception of the present, and imaginings of the future and that these are not objective reflections of reality. We’ll start by describing how the mind fabricates your memories.

### Your Brain Fills in Omissions in Memories With Assumed Information

According to Gilbert, when you summon a memory, **your mind supplements existing pieces of the memory with assumed information**. Your mind must do this because you don’t store memories as complete experiences of an event, which would include a massive amount of sensory detail, feelings, and thoughts. Memories are only stored _snippets_ and _narratives_ of the event, with many details omitted. This means that your memories are made up of both true-to-life and assumed (potentially false) information that fills the omissions.

For instance, if you spend a day at the zoo, all you might store in memory from that detail-rich experience is a recollection of it being too hot and the phrase “pandas asleep.” Your brain wouldn’t store the sensory experience of the heat and the crystal-clear visuals of the sleeping pandas. When you summon that memory, your brain fills in these gaps with assumptions of what belongs there: that the ice cream melted quickly, that the sleeping pandas were cute, and so on.

(Shortform note: To at least partially circumvent this issue, we might try to strengthen our memories so we don’t rely as much on fabricated information. In _Moonwalking With Einstein_ , Joshua Foer says you can do this by _storing_ memories more intentionally. First, visualize the information you want to remember and then mentally place that visual in a location you’re familiar with, like your home. For example, if you want to remember the ostriches at the zoo, visualize them and then place that image in your backyard.)

#### Your Brain Fills in Gaps in Memories Retroactively Using New Information

Not only does your brain fill in gaps in your memories with assumed information, writes Gilbert, **it also incorporates _new_ information into the memory retroactively**. A suggestion in the present that something happened in the past can become a permanent part of your memory, even if it didn’t happen.

Let’s say that after having been to the zoo, someone suggests that the tigers were particularly ferocious that day. Even if you don’t recall what the tigers were like, you’ll likely incorporate their ferociousness into your memory, whether they were ferocious or not.

(Shortform note: Gilbert presents the mind’s tendency to incorporate new information into memory as problematic. Yet this tendency can sometimes be helpful and is often a necessary part of the learning process. When you fit new information into existing knowledge in your memory, you build new neural connections and enhance your initial understanding of a topic, write Henry Roediger and Mark McDaniel in _Make It Stick_. For instance, if you know Jane Austen wrote in the 18th century, and _then_ learn that women were bound to strict gender rules at that time that made it less common for women to be published, you can incorporate the new information into your existing knowledge of Jane Austen and conclude that she was pushing gender boundaries.)
