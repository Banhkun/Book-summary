## Exercise: Reflect on Your Breathing Habits and Practice Breathing Better

Apply McKeown’s ideas by evaluating the way you breathe and practicing one of his breathing exercises.

* * *

Assess your current breathing habits. Describe your relationship to breathing—how conscious are you of your breath from moment to moment? What symptoms, if any, do you have that may be due to excessive breathing? (For example, you may feel out of breath frequently, have a consistently stuffed-up nose, or wake up feeling lethargic.)

Practice McKeown’s basic carbon dioxide training exercise. Place one hand on your stomach and one hand on your chest. Breathe mindfully through your nose for a few minutes, keeping your breaths small and maintaining a slight craving for more air. After you’ve finished, write about how you feel mentally and physically. (Ideally, you’ll feel more relaxed and mentally alert.)

What’s one habit you can start today to improve your breathing? (For example, you could block out 10 minutes in your schedule every morning for breath training, or buy paper tape to keep your mouth closed during sleep.)
