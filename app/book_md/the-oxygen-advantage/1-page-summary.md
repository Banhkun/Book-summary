## 1-Page Summary

Imagine there was a miracle cure that could help you feel less stressed, lose weight, sleep better, run farther without losing your breath, and live longer. According to author Patrick McKeown, not only does this cure exist, but it’s also free to anyone with a set of lungs—it’s practicing _proper breathing_. According to McKeown, **modern living conditions cause the average person to _breathe too much_** , but by training yourself to breathe less, you can greatly improve your physical fitness and overall health.

McKeown suffered from severe asthma until the age of 26. But after discovering the work of respiration expert Konstantin Buteyko, McKeown developed breathing exercises that eliminated his asthma symptoms and radically improved his quality of life. This experience inspired him to continue studying breathing under Buteyko. Eventually, McKeown became a personal breathing coach, helping Olympic athletes improve their performance and helping people of all kinds bolster their health. He wrote _The Oxygen Advantage_ , published in 2016, to further raise awareness of the benefits of proper breathing.

We’ll begin this guide by explaining why McKeown contends excessive breathing is degrading public health. Next, we’ll describe how to train yourself to breathe less, offering both general tips and specific exercises. Finally, we’ll explain how athletes can use McKeown’s breathing techniques to enhance their training and performance.

We’ll supplement McKeown’s advice with other tips that may help you get more out of his Oxygen Advantage program. Additionally, we’ll compare McKeown’s breathing techniques to other popular breathing exercises from experts like Wim Hof and Andrew Huberman.

### The Problem: You Breathe Too Much

McKeown asserts that **breathing too much is a widespread habit degrading the health of almost everyone in modern society.** Specifically, the average person inhales and exhales more frequently than they should and breathes habitually through the mouth, a larger airway than the nose. But why is taking in more air than you need so bad for you?

We’ll begin this section by breaking down what happens in your body when you breathe and how this changes when you breathe too much. Then, we’ll detail the adverse health effects of heavy breathing. Finally, we’ll use this information to explain why modern society causes so many people to breathe too much.

#### How Breathing Too Much Hurts You

##### How Breathing Works

McKeown explains that **breathing serves two main functions: taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide**. First, you inhale oxygen because the muscles and organs in your body need it to function. When you inhale, tiny air sacs inside your lungs called alveoli absorb oxygen and pass it into the bloodstream. Your circulatory system ensures that this oxygen travels to your muscles and organs.

(Shortform note: This biological information is necessary to understand specifically how smoking damages the lungs. As a cigarette burns, the chemicals inside melt together into a toxic tar that sticks to the alveoli in your lungs, killing their cells and destroying their ability to pass oxygen into the bloodstream. Since the lungs contain millions of alveoli, smokers can damage thousands of them before they notice the cumulative effect—but even if they can’t feel it, their lung tissue is being permanently damaged.)

Second, you exhale carbon dioxide because your digestive system produces more of it than your body needs as it breaks down food into energy. Additionally, your body generates a lot of carbon dioxide whenever you physically exert yourself, as a byproduct of intense muscle activity.

(Shortform note: Although we generate carbon dioxide (through digestion and physical exertion) and exhale it into the air, breathing and digestion don’t increase the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. The carbon we exhale is originally taken into the body through the plants and animals we eat, both of which absorb carbon from the atmosphere when growing (plants absorb carbon through photosynthesis, and animals absorb carbon from what they eat). In other words, we create a balanced cycle by eating carbon and exhaling it.)

##### Breathing More Blocks the Flow of Oxygen

Generally, the more oxygen your body sends to your various muscles and organs, the better they can do their jobs, asserts McKeown. However, **breathing too much causes your muscles and organs to absorb _less_ of the oxygen in your bloodstream**, preventing them from working optimally.

When you breathe too much, you exhale large amounts of carbon dioxide, removing it from your blood. This is unhealthy because **blood needs carbon dioxide in it to pass oxygen on to muscles and organs** —a phenomenon called the Bohr effect. The less carbon dioxide there is in your blood, the less your body can access its blood oxygen.

(Shortform note: Ignorance of the Bohr effect and the belief that breathing more oxygen leads to a healthier body have led to the creation of “oxygen bars”—establishments that sell hits of air with higher oxygen content. Although proponents claim that pure oxygen can relieve stress and cure headaches, the Bohr effect implies that inhaling “purer” air with less carbon dioxide in it will actually result in your body utilizing _less_ oxygen. Some experts agree with this idea, arguing that inhaling more oxygen in a setting like this will have no positive effect on your health.)

Many assume that breathing excessively is good for you because it increases the amount of oxygen you inhale into your body. However, McKeown contends that this extra oxygen doesn’t do you any good. **In everyday life, your blood is almost always fully saturated with oxygen** —it can’t hold any more, no matter how much you inhale. Unless your body is truly low on oxygen (for instance, if you’ve been intensely exercising or you have lung damage), breathing heavily vents carbon dioxide from your blood without impacting your blood oxygen level.

(Shortform note: Although inhaling more oxygen usually isn’t beneficial to your health, there are exceptions. In rare cases where people have chronically low blood oxygen levels—typically people with lung damage, as McKeown acknowledges—they can benefit from inhaling more oxygen. Doctors often prescribe these patients supplementary oxygen, delivered through a mask or tube. This oxygen is often particularly necessary during physical exertion, when the body uses up oxygen more quickly, or overnight, as some of the alveoli in the lungs deactivate while you sleep.)

##### The Vicious Cycle of Excessive Breathing

McKeown asserts that **when you breathe too much, your body becomes accustomed to low levels of carbon dioxide, and you develop a hypersensitivity to it** : Your brain sends you desperate signals to breathe harder in response to the slightest buildup of carbon dioxide, including any time you physically exert yourself. If you give into your brain’s signals and gasp for breath while exercising, you’ll exhale carbon dioxide that you need to oxygenate your body, resulting in swift full-body exhaustion.

This creates a vicious cycle, as the frequent impulse to breathe heavily causes you to constantly exhale, ensuring that your body is only accustomed to this low baseline of carbon dioxide.

(Shortform note: In _Breath_ , James Nestor contends that the brain’s ability to change its tolerance to carbon dioxide in the blood served a key function in our evolutionary history. Once our ancestors developed the ability to automatically change their breathing instincts depending on how much carbon dioxide was in the air around them, they could adapt to the atmosphere at any altitude and live comfortably in more places. By this logic, the vicious cycle McKeown describes isn’t a biological glitch, but rather the body working as it’s intended—adapting permanently to new living conditions.)

#### Other Adverse Symptoms of Excessive Breathing

Aside from decreasing your tolerance for carbon dioxide and reducing oxygenation of your muscles and organs, breathing too much degrades your health in other ways. Let’s take a look at a few of these adverse symptoms.

##### Symptom #1: Greater Anxiety and Stress

McKeown argues that **breathing too much makes you feel more anxious and stressed because it triggers your body’s fight-or-flight response.** Our bodies normally breathe heavily in response to danger; so when you breathe excessively, your body assumes that there’s a threat nearby, making you feel perpetually stressed.

(Shortform note: McKeown’s assertion that heavy breathing makes you feel more anxious and stressed aligns with the James-Lange theory of emotion, which states that the physiological sensations in our bodies determine what emotions we feel. Although some research has poked holes in this theory by showing that physiological responses aren’t necessary to generate emotions, other studies indicate that it’s accurate at least to some extent. For instance, one study found that when people forcibly make emotional facial expressions, physiological signs of those emotions appear in their bodies.)

##### Symptom #2: Weight Gain

According to McKeown, **breathing too much causes you to gain weight.** A lower tolerance to carbon dioxide means that it takes less physical exertion for you to lose your breath and become exhausted. This makes it more difficult to exercise, which makes it harder to lose or maintain your weight.

(Shortform note: Some may argue that McKeown’s theory here doesn’t hold up, as some research shows that exercise doesn’t significantly increase weight loss. Although exercising burns calories, that number is only a tiny fraction of your overall calorie expenditure, resulting in a minimal net impact. However, other experts note that a sedentary lifestyle can hamper your well-being in many ways unrelated to body weight, including increasing your risk of heart disease, dementia, and depression. If excessive breathing prevents you from exercising, you may incur these risks.)

On the other hand, McKeown states that when you breathe less and your internal organs get more oxygen, they digest food more efficiently, which naturally reduces your appetite and helps you avoid overeating.

(Shortform note: Although McKeown focuses on the power of breathing to suppress appetite in the long term, some studies have shown that slow breathing exercises can reduce cravings for food within just a few minutes. This likely results from a more immediate effect on the body than the improved digestion McKeown describes—although the specific mechanism at work is currently unknown.)

##### Symptom #3: Increased Mental Fatigue

We’ve discussed how excessive breathing gives less oxygen to your muscles and organs, and McKeown specifically notes that this includes the _brain_. **Because heavy breathing deprives your brain of oxygen, you feel tired and think slower.** Training yourself to breathe less can improve your alertness and mental acuity.

(Shortform note: It’s possible that reduced oxygen to the brain has even more severe adverse effects on the brain than McKeown acknowledges. Researchers have documented a link between decreased neural blood flow (which results in decreased oxygen flow) and chronic diseases that cause cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease.)

##### Symptom #4: Constricted Breathing

**Lower levels of carbon dioxide in the blood cause the airways in your chest and throat to tighten** , which causes shortness of breath in moderate cases and asthma in severe ones. McKeown asserts that low blood CO2 from excessive breathing is the primary cause of asthma.

(Shortform note: People who suffer from constricted breathing often use medication delivered via an inhaler to mitigate shortness of breath. Different medications work either in the short term by relaxing muscles in the throat to immediately widen the airways for a short time, or in the long term by permanently reducing inflammation in the throat when taken regularly. However, according to McKeown’s theory, both of these types of medication are treating the surface-level symptoms rather than the root cause of breathing problems—excessive breathing.)

##### Symptom #5: Constricted Blood Vessels

**Finally, breathing too much causes your blood vessels to narrow** , reducing blood flow and making it more difficult to get oxygen to the different parts of your body. These constricted blood vessels also increase your risk of cardiovascular issues like heart failure.

(Shortform note: McKeown doesn’t specify why breathing too much causes blood vessels to narrow, reducing oxygen flow and endangering your cardiovascular health. Some experts suggest that the constriction of blood vessels is a side effect of one of your body’s survival mechanisms: managing blood flow in response to low-oxygen environments. Excessive carbon dioxide in the blood signals that there’s less oxygen available than usual. To maintain function in the brain and other important parts of the body, certain blood vessels widen to increase blood flow. However, this biological mechanism also works in reverse: When there’s less carbon dioxide in the blood than normal, blood vessels narrow.)

#### Why You Breathe Too Much

According to McKeown, there are a few reasons why modern living conditions influence us to breathe more than our bodies should. First, **we live less active lifestyles than people did in the past**. As a result, our bodies aren’t accustomed to movement, causing us to breathe heavily in response to any exertion. Overall, this means that we breathe much more than our ancestors did.

(Shortform note: Why are we less active than people were in the past? Some experts assert that this is simply due to the development of technology, rather than any other cultural or economic shifts. As machines take over jobs that require physical labor, we have fewer reasons to get moving. Research shows that people 100 years ago got an average of five times more daily exercise than we do today.)

Second,**we eat more processed foods** , which McKeown contends makes our blood more acidic. This causes you to breathe more as your body urges you to get rid of the acidic carbon dioxide in your bloodstream and rebalance your blood’s pH. These breathing habits make your blood less acidic over time, which causes you to crave more acidic processed foods. This creates another unhealthy feedback loop.

(Shortform note: Some experts challenge the notion that processed foods make your blood more acidic, asserting that there’s no evidence that the food you eat influences the pH of your blood. That said, these experts agree with McKeown that processed foods are less healthy than whole foods, as they contain far fewer nutrients and increase the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.)

Third, McKeown explains that **we frequently suffer from chronic stress** , putting us into fight-or-flight mode and encouraging heavy breathing. Since it’s rare that you can quickly resolve modern sources of stress (like a high-pressure sales job), stress becomes a long-term condition rather than a short-term response, causing perpetual heavy breathing (which in turn makes you more stressed, as we discussed).

(Shortform note: Is it possible to live in a modern society and avoid chronic stress? Some experts say “yes”: In _The Upside of Stress, _Kelly McGonigal contends that by improving your mindset and attitude toward stress, you can engage with stress without triggering your fight-or-flight response. A positive attitude toward stress triggers a _challenge response_ where your breathing accelerates in the short term to help you perform. However, you recover from this heightened state more effectively, avoiding the long-term habit of heavy breathing.)

### The Solution: Train Yourself to Breathe Less

Because modern society predisposes you to breathe too much, correcting this unhealthy habit requires you to deliberately train yourself to breathe less. **The primary goal of this training is to build up your body’s tolerance to carbon dioxide,** according to McKeown. As you breathe less, your body learns to live and move with greater levels of carbon dioxide in your blood without urging you to breathe more. This allows more oxygen to get to your muscles and organs both at rest and during exercise, greatly improving your physical fitness and overall health.

(Shortform note: Although the idea of carbon dioxide tolerance has only recently become popular, James Nestor describes in _Breath_ how medical professionals well over a century ago were unknowingly helping patients increase their carbon dioxide tolerance. As early as the 1870s, British doctors were telling their patients to soak in carbon dioxide-rich mineral springs, which yielded long-term health benefits after just a few sessions. Since then, medical professionals using CO2 to treat ailments as wide-ranging as pneumonia, epilepsy, and schizophrenia reported similar all-around health benefits to those McKeown promises—until the practice fell out of fashion around the time that pharmacology became widespread.)

Next, we’ll detail the steps for training yourself to breathe less, beginning with the one habit that makes the biggest difference to your respiratory health and advancing to other exercises that improve your breathing.

#### The Golden Rule: Breathe Through Your Nose

**McKeown’s main recommendation that anyone can use to improve their breathing is to exclusively breathe through the nose, not the mouth** —even when exercising**.**

The primary reason nasal breathing is so healthy is that it naturally limits the air you can breathe—nasal passages are much narrower than your mouth. Thus, breathing through your nose reduces the symptoms of heavy breathing we discussed previously.

(Shortform note: If you’ve been habitually breathing through your mouth for your whole life, it may seem like a tall order to quit entirely and breathe through your nose at all times. However, according to James Nestor in _Breath_ , the habit of breathing through your nose becomes easier to stick with over time because the tissues in your nasal passages strengthen like muscles the more you use them.)

Breathing solely through your nose provides many other health benefits:

##### Benefit #1: Naturally Diaphragmatic Breathing

The diaphragm is the muscle at the bottom of your chest cavity that moves while you breathe. According to McKeown, people who breathe through their nose benefit from naturally diaphragmatic breathing—while breathing, they fully flex the diaphragm. **Diaphragmatic breathing is what experts mean by healthy “deep” breathing** —your breath reaches deep into your lungs.

**Diaphragmatic breathing is beneficial because it activates the parasympathetic nervous system** —the network of nerves that causes you to relax in safe environments—taking you out of fight-or-flight mode, which helps you avoid instinctively breathing too much. By contrast, mouth breathers often breathe using just their upper chest, with minimal movement of the diaphragm—therefore, they don’t experience these benefits.

(Shortform note: If you’re emotionally overwhelmed, you may find it challenging to breathe diaphragmatically through the nose—for instance, people having an anxiety attack often feel like they can’t control their breathing. What can you do to calm down in this case? In _The 5 Second Rule, _Mel Robbins recommends reframing your anxiety as excitement by repeating to yourself how excited you feel about something. This way, your brain will reinterpret the physiological symptoms of stress as a good thing rather than a sign of danger, allowing you to more easily activate the parasympathetic nervous system and escape the cycle of hyperventilation.)

##### Benefit #2: Better Respiratory Hygiene

Nasal breathing is essential to proper hygiene within your respiratory system, asserts McKeown. **Air you inhale through the nose is healthier than air you inhale through the mouth**. Inside the nose, there’s a complex system of twisting bones, passageways, and layers of mucus. This system strips harmful germs out of the air, warms the air up, and adds moisture to it before allowing the air to pass into the lungs.

(Shortform note: Although your nose naturally filters, warms, and moistens the air you breathe, some experts note that your breathing will be even healthier if the air you breathe is already clean, warm, and moist. Frequently open windows in your home and activate exhaust vents to keep air moving and avoid the buildup of airborne particles. Wear a scarf around your face in cold weather to warm air before it reaches your nose. Last, if the air in your house is dry, consider using a humidifier or taking a steamy hot shower. These steps may help you avoid getting sick, as dry air can cause inflammation and infection in your airways. Cold air is unhealthy primarily because it’s dry—it can’t hold as much moisture as warm air.)

Mouth breathing, on the other hand, causes you to lose moisture every time you take a breath, increasing the likelihood of general dehydration and a dry mouth. In particular, having a dry mouth increases the likelihood of mouth infections, including cavities and gum disease, and it often results in bad breath.

(Shortform note: Why is a dehydrated mouth prone to infection? The saliva in your mouth contains many compounds that kill bad bacteria, including hydrogen peroxide, lactoferrin, and lysozymes. If you dry out your mouth with excessive mouth breathing, you allow this bacteria to infect your mouth—and, in some cases, your airways. This can cause respiratory infections.)

##### Benefit #3: Increased Nitric Oxide

McKeown asserts that **nasal breathing makes you healthier by increasing the nitric oxide in your body.** Your nose naturally produces this gas, and you get more of it in your body every time you breathe in through your nose. Nitric oxide helps your blood vessels remain relaxed and open, increasing blood flow and improving cardiovascular health. It also lowers your blood pressure and cholesterol, and it reduces the risk of heart attack or stroke.

(Shortform note: To further boost your body’s production of nitric oxide, thereby improving your cardiovascular health, some experts recommend eating foods that are high in nitrates. These are compounds that the body can convert into nitric oxide. Nitrate-rich foods include vegetables such as celery, lettuce, and spinach. Nitrates are also sometimes added as a preservative to meat products like bacon and cold cuts, but the nitrates in these products aren’t balanced out by antioxidants and other nutrients like they are in vegetables, so they form different compounds. Some research shows that these compounds may cause cancer.)

##### Benefit #4: Improved Sleep

**Nasal breathing helps improve your sleep quality** , according to McKeown—it helps you fall asleep faster, stay asleep more easily, and wake up with more energy to start your day. Additionally, it decreases the likelihood that you’ll suffer from snoring or sleep apnea.

If you wake up with a dry mouth in the morning, it’s a sign that you’re breathing through your mouth while asleep. In this case, put paper tape or commercially available sleep tape over your mouth just before you go to bed until you’ve built the habit of sleeping with your mouth closed.

(Shortform note: Arguably, sleep problems and morning grogginess are so widespread because mouth breathing is more common at night than any other time of day. Lying flat on your back causes more blood to flow up into your nasal passages, which causes swelling and nasal congestion. This understanding reveals an additional solution to nighttime mouth breathing: If you find taping your mouth shut at night to be too uncomfortable, use pillows to elevate your head and upper back at a 30- to 60-degree angle, mitigating blood flow to your nasal passages and clearing up congestion.)

#### How to Breathe Less: Specific Exercises

Next, we’ll describe several exercises that McKeown offers to improve your respiratory health.

##### Exercise #1: Testing Your Carbon Dioxide Tolerance

**McKeown recommends regularly testing your carbon dioxide tolerance to track how healthy your breathing habits currently are.** The breathing exercises that McKeown recommends vary depending on your current CO2 tolerance, so testing it helps you know which exercises to include in your routine. Tackling intense breathing exercises before your body is ready will tire you out quickly with minimal benefits, and trying and failing at these exercises will only discourage you from sticking with the program.

To test your carbon dioxide tolerance, take a normal breath; then, at the end of your exhale, plug your nose and hold your breath. Time how long it takes before you first feel the need to breathe (_not_ how long you can hold out before you _have to_ breathe).

This time represents how tolerant your body is to carbon dioxide, and it’ll increase as your tolerance increases. A typical adult who exercises frequently can go 20 seconds before feeling the need to breathe, but McKeown recommends training your body until you can make it to 40 seconds to achieve peak physical fitness.

For the most accurate assessment, perform this exercise immediately after waking up. Your unconscious breathing while asleep will be the same every night, putting your respiratory system in a neutral state and ensuring that your test will be consistent and objective.

> **Use Carbon Dioxide Tolerance to Gauge Physical Recovery**
> 
> Other than McKeown’s test, the most popular method of testing your tolerance to carbon dioxide is one created by free divers training to hold their breath longer. Andrew Huberman has more recently refined and popularized these divers’ carbon dioxide tolerance test. He uses the test to enhance fitness training in a different way. While McKeown uses CO2 tolerance as a long-term metric that measures which exercises you’re fit enough to benefit from, Huberman uses CO2 tolerance as a short-term metric that measures how well your nervous system has recovered from recent exercise.
> 
> Huberman’s test is also unlike McKeown’s in that it doesn’t measure your body’s desire to offload carbon dioxide (the feeling that you need to breathe). Instead, it measures your ability to _control the diaphragm_ and activate the parasympathetic nervous system in the presence of carbon dioxide. According to Huberman, this is a direct indicator of how well your nervous system has recovered from exercise, which helps you avoid pushing your body past its limits.
> 
> To do this test, inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth, slowly and deeply, four times in a row. Then, take one big diaphragmatic inhale, purse your lips, start a timer, and exhale through your mouth as slowly as you’re able to. As with McKeown’s test, stop the timer when you’ve run out of breath to exhale— _not_ when you feel a need to inhale. Like McKeown, Huberman recommends doing this test first thing in the morning.
> 
> If your exhale lasts 30 to 60 seconds, your nervous system has recovered to a sufficient degree for further exercise. A full 120 seconds generally indicates that your body is performing at the highest possible level. However, if your exhale lasts less than 25 seconds, it indicates that your nervous system is still recovering from recent exertion, and you should give yourself time to rest or enhance recovery in some other way before engaging in more physical training.

##### Exercise #2: Unblocking the Nose

As we’ve established, the first step in improving your breathing habits is breathing through your nose at all times. McKeown notes that unfortunately, nasal congestion is a major obstacle for many habitual mouth breathers who want to make this change. Mouth breathing can cause your nasal capillaries to become inflamed and your nose to produce more mucus, which contributes to nasal congestion.

(Shortform note: The condition of inflamed nasal capillaries resulting in increased mucus production is called _vasomotor rhinitis_. However, if your nasal congestion is accompanied by an itchy nose, itchy or watery eyes, and a sore or irritated throat, it’s likely that you’re simply suffering from allergies rather than excessive breathing—this is called _allergic rhinitis_.)

Luckily, **McKeown prescribes a specific exercise to break out of this cycle and start breathing through your nose.** Exhale, then plug your nose, hold your breath, and walk around until you feel a strong need to breathe. Let go of your nose and take a calm, slow nasal breath in. Recover for a short time, then repeat until your nose is less congested. Eventually, repeating this exercise will allow you to hold your breath for longer, and as your body adapts, your nose will become permanently clearer.

(Shortform note: According to the Buteyko Clinic, the company where McKeown serves as Director of Education and Training, you can perform this exercise while seated and still successfully unblock your nose. Additionally, they note that if this exercise is ineffective, you can try an alternative practice: Dissolve salt and baking soda in warm water, then use a plastic syringe to squirt this water through your blocked nasal passages and into your throat to clear them directly.)

##### Exercise #3: Breath Reset

This next**exercise resets your breath from heavy breathing back to a calm state.** McKeown recommends using it as a post-workout cooldown.

To practice this exercise, walk around, breathing smoothly and slowly. Exhale, then hold your breath for two to five seconds. Release and breathe normally for 10 seconds, and repeat until you’ve reset to your normal at-rest breathing pattern.

> **The Importance of Cooling Down**
> 
> Why is it necessary to cool down post-workout? During exercise, your heart beats faster, pumping blood to your extremities. Your moving muscles help to pump blood from your extremities back into the heart—however, if you abruptly stop moving, this pumping stops, causing blood to pool and stagnate in your extremities. This can cause dizziness or fainting. It arguably makes sense that McKeown would recommend holding your breath to avoid this problem because (as we’ve discussed) restoring carbon dioxide in your blood dilates your blood vessels, increasing blood flow and preventing symptoms like dizziness or fainting.
> 
> However, some other experts recommend cooling down after exercise by intentionally slowing your breathing rather than holding your breath. To ensure that this breathing successfully calms your system, maintain a 1:2 cadence in which your exhales are twice as long as your inhales—for instance, a four-second inhale followed by an eight-second exhale.

##### Exercise #4: Basic Carbon Dioxide Training

**The core exercise you’ll use to increase your carbon dioxide tolerance is a breathing procedure you can do while sitting or lying down** (McKeown calls this the “Breathe Light to Breathe Right” exercise). If your carbon dioxide tolerance time is 15 seconds or more, you’ll typically be able to complete and benefit from this exercise. McKeown recommends practicing this for 10 minutes, three times a day.

Place one hand on your chest and one hand on your belly. Breathe slowly and deliberately with your diaphragm—the hand on your belly should move while the hand on your chest remains relatively still. Press into your body with your hands, physically pushing against the breath as you inhale. The goal here is to reduce the amount of air you breathe in—with every breath, inhale less air until you’re breathing far less air than you typically do. **If you feel like you’re breathing less than your body wants you to, you’re successfully training your carbon dioxide tolerance.**

When performing this exercise, relax your body—none of your muscles should feel tense.**If you ever feel yourself involuntarily tense up or your breathing becomes jerky and unstable, take a break** —the goal is smooth, easy breathing that slightly challenges your desire to breathe. If you struggle to achieve this, you may need to build some carbon dioxide tolerance before adding this exercise to your routine. You can use nasal breathing and the breath reset exercise described above to do so.

(Shortform note: If you struggle to relax your body during this exercise, try using a technique called progressive muscle relaxation. Some experts assert that by tensing one part of your body at a time for four seconds and then releasing this tension, you neutralize your body’s stress response and experience full-body relaxation. This will automatically slow your breathing, theoretically making it a valid way to increase your carbon dioxide tolerance in itself. If McKeown’s training exercise is too challenging at first, this may be a good place to start.)

> **Comparing McKeown’s Exercise to Pranayama**
> 
> McKeown’s diaphragmatic breathing exercise is nearly identical to one prescribed by yoga practitioners. In the ancient yogic tradition, disciplined breathwork is called _pranayama_ , and practitioners use it to control the essential energy of the universe, called prana. Modern practitioners use pranayama for spiritual growth as well as more general health benefits.
> 
> Like McKeown, modern pranayama practitioners recommend sitting or lying down, placing one hand on your chest and another on your belly, and intentionally breathing into your diaphragm. Additionally, some experts recommend placing a light sandbag on your stomach while you practice this exercise, applying a more consistent pressure than the forceful palms McKeown suggests. They specify that this pressure helps strengthen your diaphragm and abdominal muscles, making it easier to breathe in a healthy way.
> 
> Yoga experts also provide an alternative technique for people who struggle with basic diaphragmatic breathing: the crocodile pose. Lie on your belly and rest your head on your crossed arms so your stomach is slightly lifted off of the floor. This pose makes it easier to ensure you’re breathing diaphragmatically—when you feel your stomach touch the floor, you know you’re inhaling into the diaphragm successfully. If your carbon dioxide tolerance is low and you have a hard time understanding what diaphragmatic breathing feels like, consider starting with this exercise.
> 
> Some yoga experts recommend practicing pranayama in sessions that last at least 15 minutes and as frequently as 10 times a day.

##### Exercise #5: Carbon Dioxide Training in Motion

Once you’ve practiced the basic carbon dioxide training at rest and your carbon dioxide tolerance has measurably increased, McKeown recommends working your way up to executing the training during physical exercise—while walking, running, or cycling. This intense practice will further increase your tolerance to carbon dioxide. There’s no need to use your hands when doing this, but continue to keep your body relaxed and stretch your ability to breathe less than you feel like you need to.

Note that McKeown doesn’t recommend advancing to any breath exercise more intense than the basic carbon dioxide training if you suffer from a medical condition that could be exacerbated by physical exertion. In this case, consult your physician before undertaking these more advanced breathing exercises. Similarly, if you start to feel dizzy or sick, stop the exercise immediately.

(Shortform note: Why might these exercises prove dangerous? Some experts note that if your body isn’t accustomed to exercise and you suddenly put it under intense stress, you run the risk of rhabdomyolysis—when muscle cells burst, leaking into the blood and causing kidney failure. Another possibility is that McKeown is warning against the risks of respiratory acidosis—when you fail to exhale enough carbon dioxide from your blood, turning it acidic. Dizziness when holding your breath may be an early sign of respiratory acidosis, as the carbon dioxide overloading your bloodstream forces oxygen out, cutting off oxygen to the brain.)

> **Set the Right Breathing Rhythm to Avoid Injury**
> 
> Some experts say that as you start paying attention to how you breathe during physical exercise, it’s important to get the rhythm of your breath right—the wrong breath timing can cause injury. As you walk or run, you momentarily lose stability in your core every time you exhale, putting greater stress on whichever foot is hitting the ground. If the rhythm of your breath means that your exhale lines up with the same foot hitting the ground every time, you’ll put chronic stress on one side of your body.
> 
> To avoid this, practice breathing at an asymmetrical cadence, where you inhale for three steps and exhale for two steps. This way, the foot you land on every time you exhale will naturally alternate, evening out the stress across your body. You can apply this practice to walking, running, and presumably cycling (although it may not be necessary while cycling, as it’s considerably less stressful on your joints than running).

### The Benefits of Breathing Less for Athletes

McKeown puts particular emphasis on the benefits of breathing less for _athletes_ —let’s take a look at the two main benefits athletes can claim by breathing lighter. After this, we’ll outline two advanced breathing exercises that athletes can use to enhance their performance.

#### Benefit #1: Increased Physical Performance

**Breathing less results in vastly improved athletic performance** , contends McKeown. The improved oxygenation of your muscles and organs caused by greater carbon dioxide tolerance is particularly impactful during exercise. In athletic training, the amount of oxygen your body can utilize in one minute during intense exertion is called VO2 max. Carbon dioxide tolerance has been shown to sharply increase VO2 max, resulting in vastly improved stamina.

(Shortform note: Aside from being a reflection of your physical stamina, VO2 max is a remarkably accurate predictor of how long you’ll live, according to some researchers. A 23-year-long study of 122,000 adults who were 53 years old on average found that every increase in VO2 max correlated with a statistically significant decrease in mortality from all causes. Most strikingly, the top 5% of participants were five times less likely to die than the bottom 25%. This is what we would expect to see if McKeown’s understanding is correct—if high VO2 max means you have more CO2 in your bloodstream at all times, it makes sense that you would reap the health benefits of increased oxygen flow at all times, not just during exercise.)

#### Benefit #2: Reduced Risk of Injury

McKeown contends that **training your body to breathe less reduces your chance of injuring yourself by mitigating the damage done by _free radicals_. **When your body uses up oxygen, it produces these unstable and potentially harmful molecules, which can damage various tissues in your body and greatly increase the risk of injury during exercise. This is called _oxidative stress_. Typically, your body has enough antioxidants from the food you eat to counteract free radicals. However, intense exercise can create more free radicals than your body is prepared for, increasing oxidative stress beyond manageable levels.

McKeown asserts that breathing less prompts your body to produce more antioxidants, which neutralize the free radicals. Additionally, by restricting yourself to nasal breathing, forcibly reducing the amount of oxygen you inhale, you ensure that you don’t exercise more intensely than your body is prepared for. This limits the number of unbalanced free radicals in your system.

(Shortform note: Although exercising more intensely than your body is ready for (and suffering from excessive oxidative stress) should be a concern, it’s arguably much less common than the opposite problem—not exercising enough. The US Department of Health and Human Services recommends a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week, or 75 minutes of intense aerobic exercise per week. However, almost 80% of adults in the US fail to reach this benchmark.)

> **Common Myths About Free Radicals**
> 
> Although there’s research showing the harmful effects of too many free radicals and the power of antioxidants to combat them, the general idea of “antioxidants versus free radicals” has been used to promote theories about health that lack substantial evidence.
> 
> For instance, some people use antioxidants as the defining quality of “superfoods,” food items they claim you _need to eat_ to have a healthy body. In reality, however, no antioxidant-rich food is significantly healthier than other healthy foods, and you don’t _need_ to eat superfoods. Furthermore, you need to eat a wide variety of different kinds of food for optimum nutrition, not just “superfoods.”
> 
> Others claim that oxidative stress from free radicals is the primary cause of aging, and by increasing the antioxidants in your diet, you can stop or even reverse the aging process. Although some studies show that antioxidants may slow the aging process, other evidence indicates that in some situations, they may have the opposite effect. One study found that worms treated with more free radicals lived longer than worms with fewer free radicals.
> 
> McKeown’s take on antioxidants arguably has more scientific evidence backing it up than these claims. Several studies indicate that deep, slow breathing can reduce oxidative stress, including stress induced by vigorous exercise. In one study, a group of cyclists biked for eight hours. Then, half of them did an hour of deep breathing while the other half read magazines. The deep breathing group showed significantly reduced oxidative stress, as well as decreased cortisol and increased melatonin (an antioxidant hormone).

#### Breathing Exercises for Athletes

McKeown offers another set of exercises that athletes can use to take their performance to the next level. He also notes that _anyone_ can practice them to further train their carbon dioxide tolerance and improve their fitness.

##### Exercise #1: Breath-Hold Warm-Up

First, McKeown recommends a pre-exercise warm-up that involves holding your breath to prepare your respiratory system for intense exercise in the near future. By holding your breath, you build up carbon dioxide in your blood rather than exhaling it. **This prevents you from running out of carbon dioxide when the intense exertion makes you exhale more,** meaning you can oxygenate your body more effectively for longer once you get going.

The exercise itself is essentially the same as the nose-unblocking exercise above, except you’ll be holding your breath for slightly longer and recovering for longer. Walk around, then exhale and hold your breath until you feel a strong need to breathe. Release and breathe normally through your nose for about a minute, then repeat. To warm up effectively, McKeown recommends doing this for 10 minutes before you start exercising.

> **Counterpoint: Sometimes, It’s Better to Breathe More Pre-Workout**
> 
> While McKeown asserts that this breath-hold warm-up is ideal before every workout, some experts argue that the pre-workout breath exercise you choose should vary depending on how you’re feeling at the moment.
> 
> For instance, if you’re feeling lethargic and unmotivated to exercise, consider warming up by intentionally engaging your sympathetic nervous system. This fight-or-flight stress response gives you the energy and alertness you need to fight threats, which you can channel into healthy exercise. To engage the sympathetic nervous system, take full breaths quickly: Inhale for one second into your belly, then inhale for one second into your chest, and exhale for one second. Unlike McKeown’s warmup, which lasts for a full 10 minutes, you should only practice this exercise for 60 seconds—at which point you’ll ideally feel ready to move.
> 
> McKeown would likely say that this rapid breathing technique drains your body of carbon dioxide. By this logic, you’ll run out of carbon dioxide even sooner once you get moving, preventing you from oxygenating your body. However, if this breathwork motivates you to exercise, it may be worth it—imperfect exercise is arguably better than no exercise at all. Alternatively, experiment with combining these two exercises by breathing rapidly to perk yourself up, then transitioning to McKeown’s breath-hold exercise to prepare your body for intense exertion.

##### Exercise #2: Breath-Hold Training

McKeown recommends an exercise for achieving peak athletic performance that involves first holding your breath for extended periods while walking. Then, after you’ve increased your tolerance for carbon dioxide significantly, you hold your breath while running (or performing some other form of intense cardio). **Training while holding your breath like this replicates the experience of training at a high altitude, where the air is thinner and you naturally inhale less oxygen.** As Olympic athletes have demonstrated for decades, high-altitude training improves physical performance by causing your body to produce more oxygen-carrying red blood cells in response to a low-oxygen environment.

(Shortform note: Some research suggests that high-altitude training doesn’t work for everyone. One study of Olympic athletes training at high altitudes found that their red blood cell production only significantly increased 56% of the time. Some experts have used this data to conclude that some people can’t adapt to the oxygen level of their environment, calling them “non-responders.” However, others contend that these “non-responders” may have been training wrong, theorizing that they didn’t have enough iron in their system to support red blood cell production, or they were training through mild illness that hampered red blood cell production.)

To try this breath-hold training, start moving. Exhale and hold your breath until you feel a medium need to breathe. Then, release and breathe intentionally small breaths for 15 seconds. Finally, recover by breathing normally for 30 seconds, and repeat this eight to 10 times. Over the course of the exercise, increase the amount of time you hold your breath, waiting until you feel a powerful need to breathe to release. Once you’ve worked up to this exercise, do it once a day, McKeown recommends.

> **McKeown’s Breath-Hold Training vs. Wim Hof Breathing**
> 
> Another popular breathing exercise that involves holding your breath is the Wim Hof method (detailed in the book of the same name). Despite being similar exercises on the surface, the Wim Hof method and McKeown’s breath-hold training have some different effects on the body.
> 
> Wim Hof breathing is the practice of training your body by temporarily reducing oxygen __ in the blood. According to this exercise’s creator and namesake, Wim Hof, this short-term stress strengthens your body’s ability to cope with future stress, like training a muscle. He asserts that this results in less anxiety and stress, faster recovery from exercise, and a stronger immune system.
> 
> Unlike McKeown’s exercise, Wim Hof breathing doesn’t actively improve your carbon dioxide tolerance, as it doesn’t involve increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in your blood over the long term. However, despite the two methods’ differences, McKeown acknowledges on his website that the Wim Hof method intends to accomplish many of the same goals as his exercises, including reducing stress and chronic inflammation. Some practitioners recommend using both methods.
> 
> Unlike McKeown’s breath-hold training during movement, Wim Hof breathing is practiced seated or lying down. To use this method, take 30 to 40 deep breaths, in through the nose and out through the mouth. You’ll exhale a significant amount of the carbon dioxide in your body. Then, inhale as deeply as you can and hold your breath until you feel the need to breathe. You’ll be able to hold your breath for longer than normal because you’ll have less carbon dioxide in your body. Finally, inhale one “recovery breath” and hold it for about 15 seconds. Repeat this process three or four times in a row. Like McKeown, Hof recommends practicing this once a day.
