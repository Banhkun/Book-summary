## Exercise: Provide Better Feedback

Now that we’ve learned about cultural differences in both communication and feedback, let’s apply what we’ve learned to our own lives.

* * *

Describe a situation where you provided feedback to someone from a different culture. How does this person’s culture assess and communicate? How does yours?

Briefly describe the type of feedback and how you delivered it. Did you deliver it in person or by email? Was it negative or positive?

How do you think the other person interpreted your comments?

Was this interpretation the one you intended? If not, describe one strategy you can use in the future to avoid this misunderstanding.
