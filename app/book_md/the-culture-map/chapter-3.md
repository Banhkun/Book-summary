## Chapter 3: Thinking Across Cultures

The ability to persuade others effectively is an essential business skill. It allows you to sell your products effectively and convince your colleagues of your ideas.

But according to Meyer, different kinds of arguments persuade people from different cultures. In other words, what persuades you might not persuade someone from a different culture.

This is because each culture tends towards specific ways of thinking and reasoning about the world, even though most people are capable of all of them.

In this section, we’ll first discuss how Meyer divides Asian and Western thinking into two broad categories of thought. Then we’ll discuss the variations you see in Western methods of reasoning. Finally, we’ll present strategies you can use to effectively persuade people from different cultures.

### Dialectical vs Analytical Thinking: How Asians and Westerners See the World DIfferently

First, Meyer divides how the world reasons into two broad categories: holistic and specific. We’ll refer to these categories as they’re more commonly known: dialectical and analytical.

#### Dialectical Thinking

##### Defining Dialectical Thinking

**In cultures that think dialectically, people tend to focus on the overall situation.** Instead of focusing on individual elements, they emphasize the _relationships between_ individual elements.

Meyer cites several studies by Professors Richard Nisbett and Takahiko Masuda that illustrate this discrepancy. In one study, they asked both Japanese and American people to “take a photo of a person.” Photos taken by Americans tended to be close-ups, while photos taken by Japanese people depicted much more of the background. When asked, the Japanese person thought that the Americans had taken a photo of a face, not a person. In contrast, the Americans thought that the Japanese had taken a photo of a room, not a person. (Shortform note: When we replicated this study informally, we got the same results: The American took a photo of the face, while the Japanese person took a full-body photo. When asked about her photo, the Japanese person said: “If I had to describe a person to an alien, how could I do so with just a close-up of the face? I need the full body.” This was not something the American had considered at all.)

In business, this focus on relationships is evident in longer responses to questions. People might present related information first before getting to their answers. As such, people from other cultures might find that dialectical thinkers are missing or unable to find the point. At worst, they might think dialectical thinkers are doing so deliberately.

According to Meyer, most Asian cultures think dialectically.

> **How Western and Asian Dialectical Thinkers Differ**
> 
> According to Nisbett, dialectical thinkers are more accepting of contradiction as a fact of life, so they often try to find the middle ground. Sounds great, right? But an acceptance of contradiction could be problematic in business. For example, you might have to convince dialectical thinkers that a problem needs solving at all.
> 
> But this acceptance of contradiction may be a feature of East Asian dialectical thinkers instead of Western ones. Although Westerners are also capable of thinking dialectically, studies suggest that Westerners and East Asians do so differently. Westerners think about the contradictions until they’re able to synthesize them, while East Asians aren’t as bothered by and generally more accepting of the contradiction to begin with.)

##### How Dialectical Thinking Develops

According to Meyer, cultures developed different ways of thinking due to the philosophies that dominated their culture.

She argues that **the dialectical thinking of Asian countries derives from the Chinese philosophies that influenced them.** Meyer states that Chinese philosophies tend to value harmony and balance between individual elements. Additionally, Meyer notes that Chinese philosophies don’t separate an act or object from the circumstances surrounding it. Rather, they consider both in concert.

She gives the example of the Chinese concept of yin and yang as support for both these ideas. Yin and yang are related to balance because they represent how dueling concepts like light and dark can actually be complementary. But they’re also related to holistic thinking because they must both exist—one can’t exist without the other.

(Shortform note: Although Meyer notes that yin and yang were developed by Taoists and influenced Confucian philosophies, she doesn’t mention that each philosophy favored a particular element of the yin-yang duality. The Taoists, whose philosophy emphasized seclusion, preferred the feminine yin, while Confucianism, which is primarily focused on the relationships in public life, favored the masculine yang.)

> **An Alternate Explanation for How Dialectical Thinking Develops**
> 
> This paper suggests that Asian countries tend toward dialectical thinking not because of philosophical influence but because of their high-context communication styles. Low-context cultures have explicit rules, and they select which ones to follow in specific situations. So they only have to consider the situational factors relevant to their selected rule.
> 
> The rules of high-context cultures are far less explicit. So these cultures consider many factors at once when determining how to act, which means they’re far more used to encountering contradictions—which results in a greater acceptance of contradictions and a tendency to think dialectically.

#### Analytical Thinking

##### Defining Analytical Thinking

I**n cultures that think analytically, people tend to focus on the individual element or action**. Unlike dialectical cultures, they de-emphasize the surrounding circumstances.

(Shortform note: In business, this might be seen in how they evaluate risk. Researchers argue that analytical thinkers “typically expect states of the world to be stable.” This could be because they focus on the individual element. Furthermore, “when change is occurring, such as a stock growing in value, change is presumed to follow a linear trend”—to the point where Canadians sold falling stocks and bought rising stocks, but Chinese people (perhaps counterintuitively to the Western mind) bought falling stocks and sold rising stocks because they assumed the change wouldn’t continue.)

Meyer states that a common criticism of analytical thinkers is that they ignore the overall context too much. Critics think analytical thinkers can’t see the overarching influences on their thoughts or the potential broader impacts of their actions, so they must be incompetent. Critics might also just think they’re rushing and ignoring those influences.

(Shortform note: As you go through this section, it’s important to remember what analytical thinking means in a cultural context. Many people interpret the phrase analytical thinking as thinking with an emphasis on structure, mathematics, or logic. But the key feature of analytical thinking is the _tendency to consider something individually_ , de-emphasizing its relationship with the environment. It’s not a tendency to view something through a more mathematical lens.)

##### Why Analytical Thinking Develops

**Meyer argues that the analytical thinking of Western countries derives from elements of Western philosophy.**

Specifically, she states that Western philosophies assess objects independently without necessarily considering them in the overall context. As an example, Meyer describes how Aristotle ascribed the principles of levity and gravity to particular items—a falling rock had the property of “gravity,” while a floating log had the “levity” property. Rather than viewing “levity” as an interaction between the log and its environment, he saw it as a property of the log itself.

(Shortform note: Since this example comes from Aristotelian physics, it may not seem to support Meyer’s claim that philosophy influences culture. But Aristotle didn’t differentiate between physics and philosophy—he and his contemporaries studied “natural philosophy,” which encompassed both physics and philosophy. The two disciplines were indistinguishable until the development of natural science in the 19th century.)

Meyer argues that this common Western tendency to consider objects independently—as items with characteristics and not in relation to one another or to external forces​​—is the root of modern-day analytical thinking: Today’s Western businesspeople assess elements independently because their religions and philosophies did so, too.

(Shortform note: Another possible explanation for the difference in cultural cognition patterns is the “social orientation hypothesis.” It suggests that cultures that prize independence tend to think analytically, while cultures that prize interdependence tend to think dialectically. Researchers found that when Mexican farmers became more capitalist and thus more independent, they also thought more analytically.)

### Two Types of Analytical Thinking: Theoretical vs Empirical Thinking

In addition to dividing the world into analytic and dialectic cultures, Meyer also divides non-Asian cultures into two broad patterns of thinking or reasoning.

Specifically, Meyer argues that Western and Latin American cultures tend to use either theoretical or empirical thinking. (Latin Americans and Germanic countries fall in the middle of this spectrum.)

In this section, we’ll describe each type of thinking and how they develop in different cultures.

#### Theoretical Thinking

##### Defining Theoretical Thinking

Meyer presents principles-first thinking, which we’ll call theoretical thinking, as the dominant reasoning method of certain cultures. **Theoretical thinkers trend towards using deductive reasoning when they persuade.**

When you reason deductively, you first formulate a general hypothesis or concept and then deduce a conclusion from this concept. One common example of deductive reasoning is this: All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. As such, Socrates is mortal. You draw the final conclusion (Socrates is mortal) by combining the first two principles.

Meyer posits that **in business, a cultural pattern of theoretical thinking translates to a heavier emphasis on the reasons behind a problem.** If you give a presentation, a theoretical thinker might ask questions about the methodology you used to gather your data. Similarly, emails written by theoretical thinkers trend on the longer side. First, they present their initial principle. After elaborating on this principle, they’ll then present the biggest counterargument before concluding with the takeaway they want their reader to implement.

Criticisms of businesspeople who think theoretically may include that they are insufficiently practical, that they don’t cut to the chase quickly enough, or that they don’t implement recommendations without knowing why they’re given.

According to Meyer, Latin European countries tend to be theoretical thinkers.

> **How First Principles Thinking Drives Innovation**
> 
> A similar type of thinking, which James Clear defines as “first principles thinking,” can drive innovation. In first principles thinking, you boil a problem down to only what is true and proven, aka its “first principle.” You then innovate by improving on one of those fundamentals.
> 
> Clear points to the rolling suitcase as an example. The Romans invented the wheel, but it wasn’t until 1970 that Bernard Sadow thought of combining it with a bag to make transporting suitcases easier. The implementation of other technologies, like zippers and the use of nylon, also improved the bag. But before Sadow, nobody had broken down the bag into “a thing you use to carry stuff from place to place,” and decided to improve on how exactly you moved the contents around. Clear elaborates on the importance of fundamentals in our personal lives in Atomic Habits.

##### How Theoretical Thinking Develops

Just as with analytical and dialectical thinking, Meyer argues that the pattern of reasoning that dominates in a theoretical culture was also influenced by philosophy.

One major philosopher Meyer pinpoints as a major influence on Latin European thought is France’s René Descartes. (Shortform note: Meyer points to Descartes’s views on scientific reasoning as evidence of his way of thinking, but a better way to explain his thought process might be this: Descartes is the originator of the phrase “I think, therefore I am”—perhaps the most classic example of deductive reasoning. The fact that Descartes’s views on theoretical thinking influenced how the French reason today is evident in the fact that France, Descartes’s home country, is one of the countries where theoretical thinking most dominates. It’s important to note that Descartes’s influence wasn’t limited to France: In fact, he’s considered the father of modern philosophy.)

Another philosopher Meyer identifies as important to cultures that think theoretically is Germany’s Friedrich Hegel. (Germany is more central on the spectrum than France, but still trends to the theoretical thinking end of the spectrum.) In the Hegelian method, you develop an argument first through the introduction of the thesis. The persuader then presents an antithesis, before resolving the tension with a synthesis.

(Shortform note: Interestingly, Hegel didn’t develop the terms (thesis, antithesis, synthesis) most associated with him. Philosopher Immanuel Kant created the terms, and philosopher Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus enumerated the three-step method. Hegel’s model used different terms: abstract, negative, and concrete.)

Meyer states that Latin and Germanic educational systems teach children to persuade with the Hegelian method. When these children grow up, they use—and expect—the same techniques in persuasive business communications.

(Shortform note: One Indonesian paper argues that Indonesian business schools need to teach more inductive studies. It states that inductive reasoning, where you look at the data and then draw conclusions, is essential in business—but Indonesian business school graduates don’t use it as well as possible because they were mostly taught deductive studies in school. As an Asian country, Indonesia isn’t on Meyer’s axis, but this paper does support Meyer’s argument that how schools teach reasoning impacts how a culture’s businesspeople think.)

Meyer also points out that countries that use theoretical thinking tend to have civil legal systems, which come from Roman and Napoleonic legal codes. In the modern-day civil legal system, generally, the judge is responsible for finding the facts. The judge then applies whatever law they think is necessary. In this way, a broader theory (the legal precept) is applied to the current situation (the facts of the case). As such, Meyer sees civil legal systems as further evidence that theoretical thinking predominates in a country.

(Shortform note: Meyer specifically notes that European Union (EU) countries use civil law, but that may be changing. EU countries are also bound by EU law, which sometimes replaces their national laws, but EU laws do not follow civil legal systems. As EU countries’ legal codes begin to change, it will be interesting to see whether a change in cultures’ thinking styles follows. If it does, this would further support Meyer’s argument that countries’ legal systems reflect their thinking styles.)

#### Empirical Thinking

##### Defining Empirical Thinking

Meyer presents applications-first thinking, which we’ll call empirical thinking, as the dominant reasoning method of certain cultures.

Empirical thinkers tend to use inductive reasoning when they argue. When you reason inductively, you look at the data first without formulating an initial hypothesis. You look for patterns and draw conclusions from the phenomena you see in front of you. (Shortform note: As such, inductive reasoning is also particularly prone to confirmation bias, the human tendency to find facts that support rather than deny our opinion even when both are available.)

**In business, a cultural pattern of empirical thinking translates to a heavier emphasis on applying practical solutions to problems.** If you give a presentation, an empirical thinker might ask questions about how actionable the strategies you recommend are. Similarly, emails written by empirical thinkers tend to be more concise. They focus on the conclusion they want their reader to draw, and they may not present how they got to that conclusion.

(Shortform note: How concise should emails be? Many business experts recommend emails of just 50-200 words. But this recommendation is based on an analysis of sales emails by an American company, so it may not be as effective if you’re emailing people from other cultures.)

When an empirical thinker presents her arguments to theoretical thinkers, she risks insulting her audience. The theoretical thinker expects to hear an overarching principle in every argument. When it’s not provided, they assume that the empirical thinker must think they’ll believe anything​​—after all, who in their right mind would buy into an argument without knowing the broader concept behind it? In this way, a theoretical thinker views the empirical thinker’s failure to provide a first principle as an insult to their intelligence. (Shortform note: Conversely, the opposite might be true. A theoretical thinker might hesitate to deliver arguments concisely because they think to do so would be offensive. If you’re an empiricist with a theoretical thinker on your team, consider telling them explicitly that being concise isn’t offensive in your culture.)

##### How Empirical Thinking Develops

Meyer argues that empirical thinking predominates in Anglo-Saxon countries because they were heavily influenced by the work of Roger Bacon and Francis Bacon. These philosophers popularized empirical thinking, even though inductive reasoning was invented by Aristotle, who is Greek. (Shortform note: Despite their similar names, Roger and Francis Bacon were total strangers who lived centuries apart. Roger Bacon was a medieval philosopher who pioneered the experimental science we used today. Francis Bacon lived in the 1600s and is known as the “father of the scientific method.”)

Meyer also states that Americans further popularized empirical thinking in their own culture because they disliked theoretical learning. She describes how empirical thinking is taught in American schools (and thus influences American businesspeople) through the example of language learning. American schools tend to make their students speak and use grammatical rules, even though the students don’t fully understand them yet. (Shortform note: So which is better for language teaching, inductive or deductive reasoning? Both have their benefits, such as when it comes to grammar. Inductive approaches may be better for learning grammatical structures that repeat, but inconsistent grammatical patterns benefit from more deductive approaches.)

Meyer also points out that countries that use empirical thinking tend to have common law systems. In common law systems, case law is king. A judge listens to lawyers argue both sides of a case and then comes up with a conclusion based on these facts. Furthermore, this conclusion then further affects how laws are applied in the future. Meyer argues that this is a clear example of inductive reasoning and so sees common law systems as further evidence that empirical thinking predominates in a country.

(Shortform note: Meyer argues that Anglo-Saxon countries tend to think empirically, so it makes sense that common law originated with the English monarchy. Initially, the monarchy issued all “writs'' (legal decrees), but they were often too specific to be used broadly. Consequently, later courts needed to adopt legal principles from a variety of sources, such as Roman law, to administer justice. Other courts used these published decisions to make their own rulings, so these decisions became common law.)

### Strategies for Persuading in Different Cultures

Meyer suggests the following strategies for persuading people in different cultures.

**#1: Alter the length of your email based on where the reader is from.**

Empirical thinkers prefer shorter, concise emails. If you have trouble limiting your email to 125 words, try this test instead: if it can’t fit on your smartphone screen, shorten it. (Shortform note: This is especially important since more than 70% of people read their emails on their phones.)

Conversely, theoretical thinkers want more background information, so explain how you came to your conclusion. Try to include and address the biggest potential issue with your argument in your email. This follows the Hegelian method, which many theoretical thinkers will be familiar with.

**#2: Include practical examples when presenting—but change the number based on your audience.**

Case studies effectively persuade empirical thinkers, who are accustomed to using inductive reasoning to draw their own conclusions. So include several practical examples when your audience consists mostly of empirical thinkers.

While case studies are also effective for theoretical thinkers, some may resist expanding these teachings to their own lives. So spend a little more time on theory than you would with empirical thinkers. Remember that theoretical thinkers will also have theoretical questions. Prepare for them so you can answer them well and not show boredom. (Shortform note: If this involves a different type of thinking than you’re used to, practice. Can you think of theoretical questions to ask? If so, you’ll be better able to answer them.)

**#3: Change the details you provide based on your audience.**

Analytical thinkers are motivated by specific information. They prefer to know details and deadlines of the project they’re involved in. (Shortform note: But don’t bore them with too much information. At worst, they might check out and not listen to what you have to say.)

In contrast, dialectical thinkers care about the broader impact of their projects. Tell them how individual tasks impact other sections of the project or other members of the company. (Shortform note: You could also try appealing to their sense of duty to some broader unit, like their family or country.)

In addition to the above, Meyer states that when different kinds of thinkers work on the same team, they may not function effectively since they’re persuaded by different arguments. She presents some strategies to use in this situation. However, these strategies are not exclusive to how cultures reason and are rather general strategies for working with multicultural teams. As such, we’ve moved them to the end of this summary.
