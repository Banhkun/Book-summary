## Shortform Introduction

As globalization transforms the business landscape, understanding other cultures is more important than ever before. But how do you develop such an understanding—especially if you’re working with several cultures at a time? In _The Culture Map_ , cultural communication expert Erin Meyer addresses this question by providing a comprehensive framework you can use to analyze cultures across eight different dimensions. She also provides explanations for how and why certain cultural norms developed, and she presents strategies businesspeople around the world can use to address and mitigate the harmful impacts of cultural misunderstandings.

### About the Author

Erin Meyer is a professor at INSEAD, one of the world’s top international business schools. _The Culture Map_ was her first book. She is also the co-author of the 2020 _New York Times_ bestseller _No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention._

### The Book’s Publication and Context

Publisher: PublicAffairs

_The Culture Map_ was published in 2014 by PublicAffairs and became a bestseller. It also established Meyer’s international reputation as a cultural expert: Her 2015 _Harvard Business Review_ article on international negotiation, “Getting to Si, Ja, Oui, Hai, and Da,” was the publication’s most-read article of the year.

#### Intellectual Context

Meyer isn’t the first to attempt to use a multidimensional framework to explain cultural differences. Beginning in 1959, American anthropologist Edward T. Hall published several books examining how various cultures viewed specific concepts differently. In 1980, Dutch management researcher Geert Hofstede examined this in a visual manner with Hofstede’s cultural dimensions theory. Finally, the Netherlands's Alfonsus Trompenaars and Britain’s Charles Hampdens-Turner popularized a framework of how these cultural frameworks affect business and management with their 1997 publication of _Riding the Waves of Culture_.

Meyer builds on and adapts all of these frameworks in her book. Her work is also sometimes compared to Richard Lewis’s _When Cultures Collide_ , a 2005 tome by a British cross-cultural expert. Meyer doesn’t provide in-depth analysis of individual countries the way Lewis does. Rather, she provides a framework that readers can use to assess any culture even if she doesn’t cover it. Her visuals also help readers assess the magnitude of cultural differences.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Online reviewers who appreciate the book like that it provides an easily digestible, broad framework for evaluating cultures on their own. They were able to apply actionable strategies to both their personal and professional lives, and they enjoyed the visual format Meyer uses to present her ideas.

Online reviewers who find fault with the book think that Meyer relies too heavily on personal anecdotes from her time at INSEAD and fails to provide concrete evidence for her argument. Some think that identifying cultural norms without sufficient evidence perpetuates harmful cultural stereotypes. Reviewers also mention that Meyer focuses too heavily on some regions and neglects others, specifically Central and South America and Africa.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Meyer's book repackages many of the ideas presented by Hall, Hofstede, Trompenaars, and Hampdens-Turner. Sometimes, she cites their work in the book, and she thanks them in her Acknowledgments at the end of the text. However, she often makes claims based on their ideas without citing their work. This may explain why many reviewers thought that Meyer didn't provide sufficient evidence for her claims.

As noted, throughout the book, Meyer relies heavily on anecdotes from her seminars and lectures, and she doesn’t always provide rigorous research to back up her claims. The narrative elements make her work easily digestible, but her lack of research is problematic: Not only has Meyer failed to publish any peer-reviewed research on her claims, she also admits to changing identifying details of the people involved in her anecdotes in order to protect them. Consequently, Meyer asks for a huge amount of trust from her reader—and not everybody gives it to her.

Finally, it’s true that Meyer mostly focuses on Europe, Asia, and the Anglo-Saxon countries. But as this is a business book published by an American company, it makes sense that Meyer focuses most on the cultures that Americans are most likely to encounter in the business landscape. And it’s not that she ignores other regions completely—her chapter on scheduling, for example, focuses extensively on Nigeria.

#### ​Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Meyer starts the book with an introduction that explains how she developed this framework, why it's necessary, and how to interpret it. She then devotes one chapter to each of eight axes of cultural difference, explaining what the axes are, how they developed, and how to work with people from axes that are opposite to yours. Each chapter also includes several anecdotes that demonstrate real-life applications of Meyer’s teachings. Finally, in her epilogue, she synthesizes her teachings visually and presents several general strategies her reader can use when working across cultures.

#### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve focused on Meyer’s most impactful ideas rather than her anecdotes, explaining each axis, how and why these cultural patterns develop, and actionable strategies you can use when working with cultures that differ from yours.

We’ve also addressed the common complaint that Meyer’s claims lack evidence by providing explicit links between her ideas and the academic sources they’re based on, as well as supplementing these claims with outside research. Furthermore, we’ve presented alternate theories about how cultural differences affect business where Meyer’s aren’t universally accepted.
