## Chapter 5: Decision-Making Across Cultures

According to Meyer, different cultures make decisions in very different ways.

The different styles of decision-making can be a major source of conflict because each culture expects their own decision-making style to be followed, so they don’t know how to react when decisions are made in a different way. **Understanding both your own and others’ decision-making is essential to business success.**

In this section, we’ll discuss how Meyer divides decision-making styles into two extremes: consensual and top-down, which we’ll call consensus and individual. We’ll also note how these decision-making styles interact with a culture’s leadership style. Finally, we’ll discuss strategies to use when decision-making across cultures.

### Two Styles of Decision-Making: Consensus and Individual

#### How Deciding by Consensus Works

**In countries that decide by consensus, the group takes everyone’s opinion into account.** All the relevant parties consider all the information, and they make a decision only when everybody agrees. (Shortform note: Meyer appears to suggest that consensus decisions must be unanimous. But consensus is generally defined as almost unanimous with some dissenting opinions. Acceptable dissent can be a percentage or a specific number of people. Since it varies, we recommend determining the exact definition of consensus in each relevant country.)

Since there is so much information to consider, it takes a long time to reach a decision. However, **once the group reaches the decision, everyone commits to that path.** This allows for rapid implementation.

But this commitment also means that it becomes very hard to change that decision.

(Shortform note: The length of the decision-making process can have real and detrimental monetary effects on one's business. Forrester suggests that by making decisions faster, a company could save $370,000 a year per 25 people.)

People who aren’t used to deciding by consensus often think they'll like this style of decision. But in practice, they tend to find it frustrating. For example, if they don’t have strong opinions about a particular decision, they want someone else to make the decision instead. (Shortform note: Still, many businesses consider implementing consensus decision-making styles because the process “often leads to innovation and creativity, legitimizes minority perspectives, and keeps hierarchy and bureaucracy in check.”)

Other criticisms of deciding by consensus include that it takes too long, that the decisions aren’t flexible or adaptable to new information, and that it prevents individuals from being held accountable.

Generally speaking, countries that decide by consensus fall on the egalitarian end of the leadership spectrum. However, there are some exceptions.

(Shortform note: Interestingly, another criticism of consensus decision-making is that it’s not actually consensual. It’s possible that the junior team members pick up on subtle cues delivered by the leader about what they want and then agree with the leader’s message, even if they wouldn’t otherwise. This probably won’t be an issue in the world’s most egalitarian cultures, but look out for if you’re in a culture near the middle of the egalitarian/hierarchical leadership spectrum.)

#### Exceptions to the Egalitarian/Consensus Trend

Most foreigners correctly expect the leading and decision-making styles of a country to mirror each other. So they find exceptions to these trends incredibly frustrating.

**Meyer specifically describes two countries that are hierarchical but decide by consensus: Germany and Japan.**

Germany’s style of decision-making is evident in how German companies are set up. Decisions in German companies aren’t made by an individual CEO. Rather, the locus of power lies in groups of managers who make the final decisions for their companies. The titles/levels of these groups vary depending on the company’s size.

Japan is another notable exception, and their _ringi_ method of deciding is unique enough that Meyer devotes a sizable portion of her chapter to it. In Japan, a proposal is first created through the _nemawashi_ process, during which the views of the individual stakeholders are uncovered so that they can be included in the proposal. This proposal, known as the _ringisho_ , is then first discussed informally amongst the lowest level of relevant managers. If they all agree, they approve the proposal and pass it up to the next managerial level. In this way, the document moves up the chain. So by the time the decision reaches the highest level, it’s already been approved by every lower-ranking manager.

(Shortform note: In a _Harvard Business Review_ article, Meyer suggests that a country’s decision-making style affects the industries it excels in. Japan and Germany are both major automotive-producing nations. Making cars involves a long process and requires a perfect end result, so it’s exactly the type of industry where deciding by consensus works. Conversely, Meyer argues, individual decision-making is best for industries that prioritize speed. This begs the question: Does a culture’s decision-making style determine the industry it dominates or is the other way around? Meyer doesn’t address this question, but it’s worth further consideration, especially in our age of rapid technological advancement. As people worldwide race to be the first to discover new technologies, it’ll be interesting to see how this race affects cultures’ decision-making styles.)

#### How Deciding Individually Works

**In countries that decide individually, the decision-maker may consider others’ opinions, but ultimately, the individual (usually the boss) makes the decision.**

These cultures tend to make decisions quickly and early in the proces. But even after it’s made, the decision remains flexible and open to change based on new information or new opinions. So implementation tends to take a long time. (Shortform note: This may also be a feature of low-context cultures. Some suggest that low-context cultures are more likely to notice how objects differ, so they’re also more likely to believe that a ‘best choice’ exists. As such, they might be more open to changing their decisions.)

Since the decision can change so easily, critics believe that those who decide individually change their minds too often, or that they haven’t really made a decision at all when they claim they have. (Shortform note: In contrast, one benefit of individual decision-making might be that it increases accountability, which one article suggests would improve your work because you’d be responsible for the consequences should your project fail.)

Consensus deciders also don’t think individual deciders fully listen to or incorporate their feedback. This frustrates consensus deciders, who may not consider individual deciders to be team players.

Generally speaking, countries that decide individually tend to fall on the hierarchical end of the leadership spectrum. However, there are some exceptions—notably, the United States.

> **How the Social Orientation Hypothesis Affects Individual Decision-Making**
> 
> The “social orientation hypothesis,” which we discussed in our section on analytical thinking, may explain why people don’t think of individual deciders as team players. Cultures that prize independence tend to follow their own goals, while cultures that prize interdependence make decisions that benefit everybody. It’s possible that collectivist cultures in particular have trouble with individual deciders.
> 
> The "social orientation hypothesis” may also explain why cultures develop different cognition patterns. It suggests that cultures that prize independence tend to think analytically, while cultures that prize interdependence tend to think dialectically. Researchers found that when Mexican farmers became more capitalist and thus more independent, they also thought more analytically**.**

#### Exceptions to the Hierarchical/Individual Trend

**Unlike other egalitarian countries, the United States employs the individual style of deciding.**

Meyer posits that the American style of deciding comes from its people’s history.

In early America, the most successful people were the ones who were first—whether because they arrived early enough to get the best land, or because they were the first to accomplish something in the New World. It didn’t matter whether you made mistakes along the way because you could fix them later. What mattered was that you got it done quickly.

As such, Meyer argues, Americans grew to value speed and adaptability—and this value permeates the ideals of modern-day American business.

(Shortform note: Americans might also decide individually because they view the concept of choice as sacred. Influenced by _The Wealth of Nations_ , Americans tied personal and religious freedoms to economic freedoms—and they were the only country in the world to do so. So Americans uniquely tie both their individual entities and their identities as Americans to the concept of freedom of choice. This may be why the United States, unlike other egalitarian countries, decides individually in business.)

### Strategies for Working in Cultures With Different Decision-Making Styles

Meyer recommends several strategies for working in cultures with different decision-making styles, which we’ve detailed below.

#### Strategies for Cultures That Decide by Consensus

**Adjust your time expectations**. Cultures that decide by consensus will take much longer to reach a decision than you might be used to. Build time for more meetings and more emails into your schedule. Don’t expect a decision immediately.

**Practice patience.** Remember that deciding by consensus doesn’t mean the majority rules. Getting everybody on the same page when people disagree initially will likely be a frustrating and time-consuming process, but well worth it in the end.

(Shortform note: Hold your meetings someplace conducive to reaching a consensus to help you tolerate longer meetings and reduce frustration. Skip the long tables, provide refreshments, and make sure you can see and hear everybody well.)

**Build relationships.** Staying in the loop is crucial in cultures that decide by consensus, according to Meyer. So make a point of fostering relationships with your business partners. The earlier you’re aware of how the group feels, the more opportunity you have to change their minds if necessary. You never want to be in a situation where you’re surprised by the decision.

(Shortform note: You won’t be able to come to a decision unless all the meeting participants trust each other. So try following Meyer’s trust-building strategies from Chapter 6. If you misunderstand how close you are to someone, you might interpret the information they provide incorrectly.)

**Focus on the process.** Remember that a decision, once made, is the final decision. Make sure you agree with the process you’re using. Are you using the right data? Does the logic make sense? Are there external factors you’re not considering? Answering these questions may be crucial to the decision’s success. (Shortform note: We tend not to be aware of the assumptions that affect our decision-making processes, so we rarely reevaluate them. Malcolm Gladwell’s _Blink_ may help you learn how your unconscious assumptions might be influencing your workplace decisions.)

#### Strategies for Cultures That Decide Individually

**Check your ego.** If you're not the leader, others will not consider your opinion as highly as you’re used to in the decision-making process. They might not ask for it at all. Remember that this is not a sign that your colleagues disrespect you, but merely a cultural difference. Be sure to follow all decisions, even if you disagree with them. As Meyer warns, not doing so will garner you a reputation as being difficult and insubordinate.

(Shortform note: However, In a separate article, Meyer states that if you’re in an individual and egalitarian culture, you need to present your opinion if you have one because it may not be asked for. This underscores the idea that you can’t use all of these strategies independently. In other words, don’t assume that because a culture decides individually, you can use any of the strategies in this section. In order to be an effective businessperson abroad, you need to understand how all of these spectrums interact, and choose the strategies that make the best sense in your particular business context.)

**Move quickly.** If you are the leader, get ready to make decisions without as much time or feedback as you’re used to. Others’ opinions are valuable, and you should listen to them. But wait too long to make a decision and your colleagues might view you as inefficient or weak. (Shortform note: In a separate article, Meyer warns that hierarchical cultures may interpret offhand comments as decisions and act on them. One potential way to avoid this is to explicitly delineate between suggestions and decisions.)

**Remain flexible.** Decisions can almost always be changed. Sometimes, they might be changed without your knowledge. In order to succeed, you must remain flexible and learn how to adapt quickly to new information. (Shortform note: How can you become more flexible? Try following Ray Dalio’s principle of “radical open-mindedness,” where you accept that you’re wrong and relentlessly find ways to increase the chances that you are right _._)

**Vote.** If there is no clear leader, suggest a vote. Majority rules. (Shortform note: Countries that decide by consensus also sometimes follow the majority. But they tend to alter their decisions to appease the minority until there are as few dissenting opinions as possible. Countries that decide individually vote only once. If you lose, you lose.)

#### Strategies for When You Have Both Cultures on a Team

If you have members of both cultures on a team, how do you decide?

Instead of imposing your preferred decision-making process on a team, Meyer suggests coming up with one together.

Some questions to ask include: Who makes the decisions? Are dissenting opinions acceptable? Once a decision is made, is it set in stone?

Meyer also recommends reviewing these processes periodically to make sure they’re still working.

(Shortform note: Selecting a decision-making process is itself a decision, which could invite the cross-cultural clashes discussed in this chapter. But Meyer doesn’t address this contradiction. One potential workaround is to have the team leader select a decision-making process herself after considering the cultures represented on her team. In this case, the periodic check-ins become doubly important. If you go this route, it may be useful to review Meyer’s chapter on giving feedback prior to your first few check-ins.)
