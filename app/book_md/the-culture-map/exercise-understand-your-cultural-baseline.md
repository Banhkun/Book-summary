## Exercise: Understand Your Cultural Baseline

How aware are you of cultural differences? (We’ll revisit this situation at the end of the guide, so you can see how much you've learned.)

* * *

Pinpoint a specific problem you have (or have had in the past) when working with someone from another culture. Describe one situation in detail.

What frustrates you about this situation? (Did the other person behave in a way you didn’t understand? Did they disagree with you or fail to communicate important information?)

Why do you think the other person behaved this way? (If you’re frustrated that your co-worker keeps CC-ing your boss on all your emails, you might write, “I think she’s doing this because she thinks I’m incompetent.”)

Based on this situation, what axis do you think is going to be most applicable to your work life, and why?
