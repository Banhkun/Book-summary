## Exercise: Improve Your Business Relationships

You now know how people trust differently in different cultures. Use this knowledge to improve your own business practices.

* * *

Think about a specific intercultural business relationship that’s important to you. How does this person’s culture build trust? How does your culture build trust?

Describe a strategy you’ve used to build trust with this person.

Reflect on why it might have been effective or ineffective. Was it a cognitive or personal behavior?

Name another strategy you’d like to use to improve your relationship with this person. Why do you think it will work?
