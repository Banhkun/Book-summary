## Chapter 7: Disagreement Across Cultures

Disagreement is a necessary reality in the business world.

**But the rules for appropriate disagreement vary across cultures**. If you get these rules wrong, you risk seriously damaging your relationship with your business partners. As such, understanding how different cultures disagree is essential.

In this chapter, we’ll first discuss how Meyer divides disagreement styles into two extremes: “confrontational,” which we’ll call open disagreement, and “avoids confrontation,” which we’ll call disagreement-avoidant. We’ll then discuss why it can be so hard to determine where a culture falls on the disagreement spectrum. Finally, we’ll present strategies you can use to ensure that disagreements don’t harm your business relationships.

### Two Styles of Disagreement: Open Disagreement vs Disagreement-Avoidant

#### Open Disagreement

##### Defining Open Disagreement

According to Meyer, **cultures that disagree openly view disagreement as good for the group.** A free exchange of ideas allows for greater innovations, and disagreements are a necessary part of that process. `

So in these cultures, people disagree with you frankly and publicly. It’s not unusual for a strong debate to break out in a meeting.

These open disagreements aren’t viewed as personal attacks—indeed, they have little impact on your personal relationship at all. That’s because in these cultures, the person is independent of the idea. Just because you disagree with somebody vehemently doesn’t mean you disapprove of them overall.

Western and Northern European countries tend to disagree openly.

(Shortform note: In her chapter on trust, Meyer discusses how cultures that value cognitive trust do so partly because they have reliable legal systems they can turn to if something goes wrong. This reasoning may have implications on disagreement styles as well. If damaging your personal relationship doesn’t strongly affect your business dealings anyway, more open disagreement would likely be acceptable. In support of this, many cultures that disagree openly also develop trust cognitively. But not all: For example, the French are very confrontational but lie squarely in the middle of the trusting spectrum.)

##### How Cultures That Disagree Openly Develop

Meyer suggests that just as the Hegelian method used in the French educational system influenced how they persuade people in business settings, it also influenced how they disagree. In other words, the French disagree openly in business settings because that’s what they were taught to do in school.

(Shortform note: Meyer doesn’t explicitly cite the Hegelian influence on education as a factor in why countries other than France also disagree openly. However, many other countries that practice theoretical thinking (Germany, Italy, and Spain, for example) also disagree confrontationally. This suggests that these countries also disagree openly due to Hegel’s influence on their educational systems. This point is supported by the fact that the Anglo-Saxon countries which practice empirical thinking all lie in the middle of the disagreement spectrum.)

#### Disagreement-Avoidant Cultures

##### Defining Disagreement-Avoidant Cultures

In some cultures, **openly disagreeing with someone will harm your relationship** —sometimes seriously and potentially to the point of irreparability.

In these cultures, Meyer states, disagreement is considered to be bad for the group.

Furthermore, in these cultures, disagreeing with someone implies that you disapprove of them as a person. In many disagreement-avoidant cultures, your image is extremely important. If that image is disrupted in any way, it’s considered very embarrassing. To disagree publicly with someone in these cultures is to suggest that this person is trying to project a false image of themselves to the world. As such, openly disagreeing with someone amounts to a personal attack.

(Shortform note: People of all cultures value their image, but how an image disruption affects you personally varies based on what culture you’re in, according to Meyer. Meyer neglects to attribute this idea to Stella Ting-Toomey, who developed face-negotiation theory in 1985. Ting-Toomey was the first to propose that all cultures care about their ‘face,’ or image, but use different behaviors to protect or attack it.)

This doesn’t not mean that disagreement never occurs in these cultures. But if people express disagreement, they do so subtly and privately.

Asian countries tend to be disagreement-avoidant.

> **How Increasing Cultural Sensitivity Might Affect Your Disagreement Style**
> 
> **** Of course, Meyer is not the first to discuss how disagreement affects workplaces. You may have heard of the five styles of conflict management: integrating, obliging, dominating, avoiding, and compromising. Each style is characterized by how much concern you have for yourself versus others. For example, avoiding means you have low concern for both yourself and others, while obliging means you’re less concerned with your own needs and more concerned with others’.
> 
> Interestingly, one study “found a positive relationship between intercultural sensitivity and obliging strategy.” The study suggests this is due to an external factor: Interculturally sensitive people are more aware that they’re fallible and might not be right, or that the other person cares more. So they’re more likely to concede an issue with the hope that they’ll be treated with the same sensitivity in the future. Alternatively, they might try obliging only if they think their needs aren’t as important as the relationship.

##### How Disagreement-Avoidant Cultures Develop

Meyer sees Confucius’s ideals about group harmony as a major influence on disagreement-avoidant Asian countries.

In Confucianism, there are five fundamental relationships that form the foundation of societal order. Each relationship comes with guidelines about how you need to behave towards each other, and not behaving the way you’re supposed to leads to the breakdown of society. So to disagree openly with someone is to suggest they’re not being true to their prescribed role—and this carries a far greater taboo in Asian cultures due to the Confucian influence.

> **How Latin American and Middle Eastern Cultures Become Disagreement-Avoidant**
> 
> Meyer spends a lot of time discussing how and why Asian cultures become disagreement-avoidant. But she only says that people from Latin American cultures and Middle Eastern cultures are “sensitive and easily bruised.” Her total lack of explanation for this statement enforces cultural stereotypes, which seemingly runs counter to her expertise as a cultural consultant. This pattern occurs often throughout the book: Meyer focuses on East Asian and Western cultures and neglects Latin American, Middle Eastern, and African cultures.
> 
> So why might Latin American and Middle Eastern cultures be disagreement-avoidant?
> 
> Middle Eastern cultures may have become disagreement-avoidant due to the importance of honor, or _sharaf_ , in the Arab world. Bedouin tribal culture, which preceded much of the modern-day Middle East, valued face and honor so much that they created laws based on these concepts. Arabs also lose face when scolded in public, which may explain their disagreement-avoidant cultures. Interestingly, this loss of face works both ways: The person doing the scolding may also lose face due to his/her disrespectful conduct.
> 
> Similarly, Latin America is also historically an honor-shame culture where questioning a man’s masculinity resulted in shame and often a reprisal of some kind. So it stands to reason that undermining someone publicly in business, which is a traditionally male field, would be traditionally avoided as to prevent both shame and potentially violence.

### Factors That Complicate Determining How a Culture Disagrees: Disagreement vs Emotional Displays

#### Defining the Relationship Between Disagreement and Emotional Displays

You might assume that cultures that disagree openly are equally open with their emotions, and disagreement-avoidant cultures are emotionally reserved. This tends to be the case, according to Meyer, but it’s not a hard-and-fast rule. This is because cultures are governed by what psychologists refer to as “cultural display rules.” These are norms within a culture that dictate how it’s appropriate to express your emotions.

In other words, all of us express emotions in our faces and mannerisms—but how often and how intensely is dictated by culture.

Meyer states that the key to evaluating where a culture lies on the disagreement spectrum is to **ask yourself: How much would openly disagreeing with someone harm your relationship?** Ignore how emotionally open they are.****

Meyer uses a quadrant to visually express the relationships between how cultures disagree and how they display their emotions. However, we found this unnecessarily confusing. So instead, we’ll simply discuss the three main reasons Meyer posits for why a culture’s level of comfort with disagreement is not always related to how comfortable they are with emotional displays.

##### Reason #1: Debates are intellectual, not emotional.

Some cultures, like Germany and the Netherlands, are very reserved but very comfortable with open confrontation.

According to Meyer, this is because **these cultures don’t view disagreement as an emotional expression. Rather, debates and disagreement are purely intellectual exercises.**

People from these cultures view robust disagreement as a necessary tool that allows them to deepen their understanding of the topic at hand. It’s not considered emotional.

(Shortform note: If you get emotional during debates, arguing with someone who is seemingly emotionally unaffected during the debate may be frustrating. Try referring to yourself in the third person. This self-distancing allows you to regulate your emotions so that you can keep your cool.)

##### Reason #2: Some culture’s emotional displays are widely misinterpreted.

**All cultures have different rules governing acceptable emotional displays. So sometimes, these rules clash.**

Meyer specifically notes that many Latin American and Arabic cultures speak at high volumes and make many physical gestures in everyday interactions. So if you come from a culture that prefers lower volumes and is less physically expressive, you may see fighting when there is none and conclude that these cultures disagree openly.

But these cultures are actually disagreement-avoidant. It’s just that they display emotions differently than you do. (Shortform note: In fact, the loud, high voices that connote anger in many Western cultures are a sign of sincerity in Arab cultures. Knowing and imitating the cultural display rules of the culture you’re working in are especially essential when they differ dramatically from yours. Keep in mind that your own actions will be interpreted differently, too. According to Richard Lewis’s _When Cultures Collide_ , cultural display rules affected the first Gulf War: Saddam Hussein didn’t take George H. W. Bush’s threats seriously because he spoke too quietly.)

##### ​​Reason #3: Some cultures express disagreement differently based on the relationship.

According to Meyer, **China and Korea disagree with you differently based on how close you are.**

Meyer uses the terms in-group and out-group, both derived from social psychology, to define these relationships. An in-group is a group you identify as belonging to and whose members accept you. An out-group is a group you don’t belong to.

If you’re in the in-group in these cultures, the Confucian rules for relationships apply, so people avoid disagreeing with you.

But if you’re in the out-group, according to Meyer, there are almost no Confucian rules governing your relationship. As such, open disagreement is not considered a threat to societal order and is justified.

Meyer suggests that the Chinese will have especially open and sometimes hostile confrontations with the outgroup, which she attributes to a competitive environment fostered by the country’s large population. Meyer doesn’t make the link between these explicit, but it’s arguable that where there’s more competition, there’s more pressure to succeed. In this situation, you’re likely far pickier about who you conduct business with, so it makes sense that you’d disagree more with strangers. It might also explain why the Chinese value personal trust highly, if they interact so differently with strangers than they do with people they know.

(Shortform note: The ingroup/outgroup bias may be particularly strong in these cultures due to their racial homogeneity: South Koreans are 99% ethnically Korean, while 91.11% of China is Han Chinese. The “familiar face overgeneralization hypothesis” suggests that we have an “own-race positivity bias” partly because we naturally react better to people we’re familiar with. So it’s possible that these countries’ lack of other races increase their distrust of the outgroup.)

### ​​Strategies for Disagreeing Productively Across Cultures

#### General Strategies for Disagreeing Productively

**Discover and define the meeting’s purpose.**

According to Meyer, different cultures have three different overarching ideas about what the general purpose of meetings is. Understanding these distinctions will help you decide what level of disagreement is appropriate.

**In some cultures, you have a meeting to formalize a decision** that has already been made informally. Many Asian cultures follow this strategy.

In these cultures, disagreeing at the meeting is too late. Express your disagreement privately well before the meeting takes place, during the actual informal decision-making process. You may recognize this strategy—it’s the same one Meyer recommends for working with cultures that decide by consensus.

**In some cultures, you have a meeting in order to make a decision**. Some debate may occur, but you end the meeting with an answer.

**And in some cultures, you have a meeting to learn about what you’re deciding** **on**. You can expect a lively debate at these meetings. In these cultures, following the strategies to use in cultures that disagree openly will likely have the most impact.

If you are leading a global team, Meyer recommends explicitly defining the team members’ expectations of meetings—whether by asking them their opinions or stating what yours are—so that everybody is on the same page as to the appropriate level of disagreement.

> **Do Meetings Really Have Three Purposes?**
> 
> Meyer often makes broad generalizations with limited support, like this idea that there are three overarching meeting purposes amongst cultures. _When Cultures Collide_ also suggests that different cultures tend to have meetings for generally different purposes. But Meyer doesn’t offer any outside evidence. She explains that she developed these purposes based on surveys from people who attended her management courses. But she doesn’t provide any publication records for this survey data, and she only names a few specific cultures’ responses in this chapter. If Meyer had gone one step further with this idea—even by just publishing her survey data—she could have better refuted criticisms that she’s overly general and enforcing cultural stereotypes.

**Explain your actions.** Meyer suggests that explaining why you act how you do could mitigate any unintentional harm you might cause. She also states that there are creative techniques one can use to frame your behavior. For example, Meyer’s French husband uses the phrase “let me play devil’s advocate” in meetings with Americans before expressing his disagreement. This simple phrase apparently makes Americans more receptive to his ideas.

(Shortform note: This phrase likely works because “let me play devil’s advocate” technically means that the person is pretending to disagree in order to help others evaluate their ideas more strictly. Introducing disagreement as a thought experiment probably allows people to take the discussion less personally and speak more rationally.)

(Shortform note: Explaining your actions is a questionable strategy. It’s one thing to explain how you work so that you can explain why you’re struggling and ask for help, as Meyer suggests in her chapter on communication. But if you’re working in another culture ~ and especially if you’re living there—many would argue that it’s your responsibility to adapt since you’re the visitor. Try splitting the difference: Explain how you disagree to help mitigate potential harm, but actively work on expressing disagreement in ways that don’t come naturally to you.)

#### Strategies to Use in Disagreement-Avoidant Countries

Many of the strategies Meyer suggests in this section are extremely similar to ones she recommended previously. As such, we’ll mention these strategies only briefly here before delving more deeply into the new strategies she recommends.

##### Strategies Meyer Mentions Previously

**Consider not attending the meeting if you’re the boss.** In some countries, people are comfortable expressing their ideas openly amongst their peers but not amongst higher-status individuals.

**Tell people what you’re going to ask them in advance** so they can prepare their opinions. Emphasize that you want to hear their original thoughts.

**Use techniques that help separate the idea from its original creator**. Meyer specifically recommends brainstorming: When many people ideate simultaneously in a limited amount of time, it’s hard to remember who thought of what. Submitting each written idea anonymously can also further separate the idea from its creator.

**Adjust your language**. Use weakeners (words that mitigate your message, like “slightly” or “maybe”), and avoid strengtheners (s that emphasize your message, like “absolutely.”)

(Shortform note: You may notice that nearly all of these strategies were suggested for working with hierarchical cultures. Meyer doesn’t explicitly state that leadership styles and disagreement styles are correlated, but a visual comparison of her two scales suggests that they are: Hierarchical countries tend to also be more disagreement-avoidant, while more egalitarian countries tend to disagree more openly. Germany is the only exception. It lies squarely in the middle of the leadership spectrum but is extremely open to disagreement.)

##### New Strategies

If you’re working in China or Korea, you may never join the in-group as a foreigner. But you can get close by building up your relationship. Follow the strategies recommended for building personal trust in Chapter 6.

**If you’re the boss, state your opinion last.** If your subordinate doesn’t know what your opinion is, they don’t know that they’re disagreeing with you, so they might feel more comfortable expressing their opinions honestly. However, keep in mind that your subordinates will be looking for subtle cues to try and guess your opinion. (Shortform note: You can keep your face neutral by following strategies like using a mantra.)

#### Strategies to Use in Countries That Disagree Openly

**Don’t try to disagree more forcefully than you’re used to.** Every culture has subtle rules of etiquette that govern what’s considered appropriate disagreement and what’s not, and you’re likely unaware of them. Emulating a disagreement style you’re not used to can backfire and make you sound overly aggressive or offensive. (Shortform note: You may recognize this strategy: Meyer uses the same reasoning to explain why you shouldn’t provide more direct feedback than you’re used to.)

**Remind yourself that it’s not personal.** Just because something is aggressive in your culture doesn’t mean it’s aggressive everywhere. Reminding yourself of this throughout your disagreement can help temper your reactions, so that you can converse calmly with a colleague instead of reacting angrily to them. (Shortform note: “Don’t take things personally” is easier said than done. Try visualization techniques—and know your triggers so you can prepare yourself emotionally.)
