## Exercise: Understanding Our Own Cultural Biases

You’ve learned a lot about what caused the problems in the situation you described at the beginning of the guide. Return to that situation and see if you view it from a new perspective.

* * *

Review the situation you described in the beginning of the book. What axis did the cultural difference end up lying on? (There may be more than one.) The eight axes are Communication, Feedback, Thinking, Leadership, Decision-Making, Trust, Disagreement, and Time Perception.

Is this the axis you expected the difference to lie on? Why or why not?

What were the cultural expectations that colored your view of the situation? How, specifically, did it differ from the other person’s?

Name three specific techniques you can use to improve your current situation. If you named a past situation, name three specific techniques you can use to avoid similar situations in the future. For example can you be open about your own cultural biases so they understand you’re not intentionally trying to offend?
