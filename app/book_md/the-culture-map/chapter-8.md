## Chapter 8: Time Perception Across Cultures

At first glance, scheduling might not seem like it would invite cross-cultural conflict. After all, we all experience time—whether we want to or not.

But time isn’t a fixed item. Time is a concept, and each culture thinks about it differently.

Understanding how other cultures perceive time is crucial for maintaining beneficial business relationships. Otherwise, you might be furious that you’ve been kept waiting—then become even angrier when your partner arrives and not only doesn’t apologize but is also confused as to why you’re so upset.

Meyer divides the methods of perceiving time into two overarching types: linear-time and flexible-time. But we’ll use the terms coined by Hall, who invented these concepts: monochronic, or M-Time, and polychronic, or P-Time.

In this section, we’ll first discuss these two methods of time perception, which Meyer calls scheduling, and how they develop across cultures. Then, we’ll present strategies you can use when working with people who perceive time differently than you do.

### Two Styles of Time Perception: Monochronic vs Polychronic

#### Monochronic Cultures

##### Defining Monochronic Cultures

In monochronic cultures, time is a method of organizing life. As such, **monochronic cultures value a fixed, linear schedule**. Time is a consumable commodity, which is why expressions such as “wasting time” or “saving time” exist.

**These cultures focus on one thing at a time**. This is true in business as well as in daily life.

Monochronic cultures also value punctuality, so lateness is looked down upon. Of course, lateness is a relative concept. Some cultures think arriving two minutes after the scheduled start time is late. Others think five minutes is unacceptable. But the key point in monochronic cultures is that **there’s a fixed amount of time after which arriving or beginning is unacceptable.**

(Shortform note: In many cultures, including monochronic cultures, _starting_ work on time is much more important than _ending_ work on time. In fact, in some cultures, it's still acceptable for employers to email their employees in the middle of the night (and expect a response). However, this may be changing. In recent years, France and Germany both made international headlines for considering laws that would prohibit employers from sending emails during non-business hours.)

**One of the best ways to evaluate whether a culture is monochronic is to look at how it approaches meetings.** In monochronic cultures, meetings have a fixed start and end time. Meyer states that usually, a detailed agenda is sent out to participants ahead of time. Each topic may be allotted a particular number of minutes on this schedule.

If participants begin to discuss a topic not on the meeting agenda, it’s considered to be going off-track. Someone will point out that this topic is not on the agenda and suggest that it be discussed at a later time—perhaps at another meeting exclusively for this topic.

Furthermore, participants are expected to remain engaged throughout the meeting. Cell phones are silenced. People use the bathroom during designated breaks. Having a side conversation is considered wildly unprofessional.

(Shortform note: These meetings aren’t necessarily effective. In fact, many monochronic American business leaders have made headlines for recommending as few meetings as possible. If you must have meetings, Patrick Lencioni’s _Death by Meeting_ recommends several strategies for making them less tedious. For example, he recommends having four different types of meetings, each with varying lengths and varying methods of setting agendas. This framework improves each meeting’s structure and helps keep everyone more engaged.)

**Monochronic cultures also tend to run on clock time** , a concept first defined by sociologist __ Robert Levine. In these cultures, you have lunch at noon, not when you’re naturally hungry. (Shortform note: Because monochronic cultures focus on only one thing at a time, you might think they're more productive than other cultures. However, as we'll see, organizing your life around "clock time" doesn't necessarily mean you're productive.)

##### How Monochronic Cultures Develop

Meyer suggests **that one factor that contributes to the development of monochronic cultures is industrialization.** During the Industrial Revolution, people were newly required to arrive at an exact time to a specific location. This is because they started working in factories, and the machines were turned on at specific times. If you were late, you cost the company money.

Meyer argues that Germany is a perfect example of the Industrial Revolution’s effects, since Germany was one of the most monochronic cultures in the world and also was one of the first places to become heavily industrialized.

(Shortform note: Meyer associates the Industrial Revolution with Germany, but most people associate it with England, where it began. Hall, who both originated the concept of monochronic time and first linked to industrialization, is no exception. In _Understanding Cultural Differences: Germans, French, and Americans_ , he and co-author Mildred Reed Hall argued that monochronic cultures began in England when the Industrial Revolution required factory workers to arrive at a specific place at a specific time.)

Meyer also notes a correlation between countries with predictable systems and monochronic cultures, although she stops short of arguing that countries with predictable systems are necessarily industrialized. In many countries, holidays are pre-scheduled and built into the calendar. The government runs reliably. Natural disasters are unlikely to drastically inhibit your ability to go about your daily business.

If everything around you runs on time, but you’re always late, you become a financial liability. So, Meyer suggests,**the more predictable a culture is, the more likely it is also monochronic.**

(Shortform note: This predictability can cause problems when unforeseen circumstances do occur. In 2021, many Japanese holidays were rescheduled for the rescheduled 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. However, pre-printed calendars mostly reflected the original 2021 holiday dates, resulting in confusion, loss of profit, and loss of productivity as people took off work when they weren’t supposed to.)

#### Polychronic Cultures

##### Defining Polychronic Cultures

**Polychronic cultures have a flexible approach to time.**

Schedules may exist, but only 48 hours in advance. Even then, these schedules may only be loosely adhered to. (Shortform note: Meyer sometimes makes broad, unsupported generalizations like this one. She offers no evidence for this 48-hour window, and our external research didn’t support her claim.)

**Polychronic cultures work on several things at once,** both in business and in daily life**.** So**one of the best ways to evaluate whether a culture is polychronic is to look at how it approaches meetings.** In polychronic cultures, meetings usually have a start time and a general topic. But according to Meyer, that is the extent of its time structure. Topics are adaptable to the business’s current situation. They are discussed according to priority level even if they weren’t on the original agenda.

Sometimes, tangents crop up that do not require everybody at the meeting to be involved. When this occurs, only the relevant individuals will discuss that tangent. So several conversations may be happening simultaneously.

Participants aren’t expected to focus on the meeting at the expense of all other priorities. If someone receives an urgent phone call, they take it.

> **The Myth of Multitasking: Are Polychronic Cultures Less Productive?**
> 
> Productivity books like Brian Tracy’s _Eat That Frog _argue that multitasking is a myth: Humans can’t focus on two things at once. Rather, so-called “good multitaskers” are great at switching their attention quickly between tasks.
> 
> Tracy argues that this “task shifting” is detrimental to our productivity, stating that it can increase the time it takes to complete a task by five times. Similarly, a UC Irvine study found that it took 23 minutes to refocus on a single task if you get off track.
> 
> So does this imply that polychronic cultures are less productive than monochronic ones? Perhaps at first glance, but the reality is more complicated.
> 
> Firstly, most psychological studies are conducted in American university labs. The United States is a monochronic culture. Since it’s unlikely the researchers are accounting for cultural differences regarding time perception, American findings may not be as relevant to people from polychronic cultures.
> 
> Secondly, all interruptions have the same “disruption cost,” but the UC Irvine study found that “people who are interrupted with something related to the task they’re working on perceive the interruption as beneficial because it helps them think about their current task.” So completing a task may take longer, but that doesn’t always equate to less productivity.

**Polychronic cultures run on what Levine termed event time**.**** Instead of judging time by the clock, events occur when the participants want them to and end when they feel that the time is right. For example, a bus will leave when it’s full.

> **A Third Way of Perceiving Time: Cyclical Time**
> 
> Another cultural method used to measure time is “cyclical time,” as described in _When Cultures Collide._ Lewis explains that many Eastern cultures view time as repetitive, which is why these cultures tend to take more time when making decisions. In these cultures, decisions aren’t viewed as one-time opportunities you need to take advantage of when you have the chance. Rather, these cultures expect that the same opportunities and risks will come again because time is a cycle. Meyer doesn’t mention this in her book nor does she argue that Asian countries share a different framework of time perception. However, most Asian countries lie on the polychronic end of her scale—and at least one resource suggests that polychronic cultures view time as cyclical, although it does not delve into much detail.

##### How Polychronic Cultures Develop

Meyer suggests that **one reason cultures become polychronic is because their countries are unpredictable.**

Meyer notes that many developing countries are unpredictable. But she stops short of arguing that all polychronic cultures are necessarily in developing countries.

In some countries, governments are unreliable. Holidays are determined not by the calendar, but by religious leaders. Annual natural disasters shut down large aspects of your business.

In such an environment, **a company’s financial success has little to do with how efficiently it runs.** Rather, it depends on two factors.

The first is adaptability: **successful companies and managers are able to take environmental changes in stride and adjust how they work.**

The second is the quality of their relationships: Successful companies and managers are able to keep their employees loyal in times of hardship.

Prioritizing time in these environments would be counterintuitive at best and harmful at worst. Strictly adhering to a schedule might hinder a company’s ability to adjust to various situations. Docking a worker’s pay for arriving one minute late (a common practice in many monochronic cultures) could anger the worker and cause them to desert the company far more easily.

**So when relationships and adaptability take priority, schedules become less important and thus more flexible.**

As evidence, Meyer notes that almost all personal trust cultures are also polychronic.

> **How Time Perception Affects Culture: Why Polychronism Might Inhibit Industrialization**
> 
> It’s possible that having a polychronic culture inhibits industrialization. In _Manana, Manana: Trans-Cultural Perceptions of Time and the Role of Polychronism in Latin American Legal System_ , author Audrey Pumariega suggests that polychronism contributes to corruption and inefficiency in Latin American judicial proceedings.
> 
> Polychronism prioritizes personal relationships, so people are more likely to give favors based on these relationships. This prioritization of personal relationships also leads to a distrust of strangers—which expands into a distrust of institutions.
> 
> Pumariega also suggests that polychronism increases inefficiency for numerous reasons, including the following.
> 
> First, lawyers don’t learn new laws by studying them all at once, the way monochronic lawyers do. Instead, they study new laws as they need to use them and while they’re doing other work, which ends up costing their clients more money.
> 
> Secondly, the flexible attitude towards time is also evident during legal proceedings. This delays the long sequential chain of getting to trial. For example, important players might be late to the first meeting, which delays the subsequent steps of the legal process.
> 
> Of course, corruption and inefficiency are problems in monochronic cultures as well. But if true, polychronism might contribute to a delay in industrialization.

### Strategies for Working in Cultures That View Time Differently

In every other chapter of her book, Meyer presents strategies for working with each kind of culture.

However, in her chapter on scheduling, Meyer only suggests generally applicable strategies that you can use when working with any culture that views time differently than you do.

So in this section, we'll first present the general strategies that Meyer recommends. We’ll then recommend more specific strategies we've developed that you can use in monochronic and polychronic cultures.

#### General Strategies to Use in Cultures That View Time Differently

**Adjust to the other culture.**

Instead of trying to impose your own cultural values on time, adapt to the people you’re working with. This is especially true if you are visiting another culture.

As simple as this strategy seems, there are often nuances that can be difficult to get right when adjusting to other cultures' perceptions of time. The only thing you can do is try, fail, and learn from your mistakes the next time.

**Set expectations.**

If you are leading a team, creating a team culture can supersede the cultural patterns of your team members. Setting clear expectations about scheduling, either from you or through discussion with your team, will help you all be more effective and reduce frustration.

(Shortform note: This is an example of creating processes, which we’ll discuss in further detail at the end of this summary.)

**Withhold judgment.**

All cultural differences can be a source of frustration. However, Meyer pinpoints scheduling as one that is particularly vulnerable to cultural superiority. Members of both polychronic and monochronic cultures think the other’s way of doing things is extremely inefficient and stressful.

You may not be able to understand how your foreign business partner works. But as you work, remember that she’s probably equally confused about how you work. When working and scheduling cross-culturally, the only correct way is the one that works for each of you.

> **Why These Strategies Matter When Scheduling**
> 
> These strategies are all applicable more broadly to dealing with other cultures. So why does Meyer pinpoint them here? Perhaps these strategies are particularly effective or necessary when scheduling across cultures.
> 
> For example, adjusting to how another culture works is a major theme of this book. However, Meyer repeatedly notes instances where adjusting fully to another culture is harmful, like when people from high-context cultures try to imitate low-context communication and end up offending their low-context colleagues. Adjusting what time you show up to a team dinner is an easier task.
> 
> Similarly, most of us prefer our own way of doing things, but Meyer takes pains to describe how both monochronic and polychronic people think the other’s way is inefficient and stressful. Maybe withholding judgment in this context is particularly important simply because there is more judgment to be withheld.

#### Shortform Exclusive: Strategies for Working in Monochronic Cultures

**Be punctual.**

People from monochronic cultures pay more attention to the clock than you might be used to. So when you make an appointment with someone from a monochronic culture, arrive at the exact time that you have agreed upon, and inform them if you are going to be late.

Different cultures have different acceptable windows of lateness. But if you're not familiar with a culture, your best bet is to arrive as close to the original start time as possible. And remember that in some cultures, even arriving on time can be considered late.

**Set and keep timelines.**

People from monochronic cultures may feel more comfortable with timelines. They understand that interruptions do happen, but having a general idea is better than having no idea at all.

However, if you do set a time, make sure that you keep it, barring extreme unforeseen circumstances. Breaking a deadline without an acceptable reason may do more harm than good. And remember that whether a reason is acceptable or not will be defined by the monochronic culture, not by you.

#### Shortform Exclusive: Strategies for Working in Polychronic Culture

**Remember that plans are fluid.**

In monochronic cultures, it’s generally rude to break plans without extreme extenuating circumstances. But in polychronic cultures, plans are far more fluid. So if somebody cancels a plan with you in a polychronic culture, remind yourself that it’s normal. Don’t take it as a personal offense.

**Just start.**

_When Cultures Collide_ argues that people from polychronic cultures dislike leaving things unfinished. They might not show up on time, but they also probably won’t leave until you’ve accomplished your goal.

You can use this knowledge to your advantage, like the British man described in _When Cultures Collide_ did. Instead of waiting several hours for his busy Greek business partner to turn up for appointments, the Brit learned the Greek’s schedule on the day of, then intercepted him where he could. Since the Greek didn’t like to leave things unfinished, he would sit with the Brit until their business had finished.
