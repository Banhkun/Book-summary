## Parts 3-4: Increased Scrutiny and Solutions

When Will came into the office, it was clear immediately that he had a magnetic personality. He was gregarious but also seemed kind and curious about the job. Casey knew right away that he would hire him.

Will felt comfortable enough in the interview, especially given that he was overqualified for the position, to ask about Playsoft and the scrutiny that Yip was under. Casey immediately understood that Will’s qualifications and his curiosity would be an asset during a difficult time for the company. So **Casey told Will that he could help out with tasks and strategy that aren’t usually part of an administrative assistant’s job.**

Unfortunately, Will was not entirely forthcoming about his background. As a child, Will had often blurted out inappropriate and rude remarks to people. This made it difficult for his teachers to like him and got him into scuffles with other kids frequently. He was diagnosed in high school as having a mild case of OCD and Tourette’s Syndrome. He started taking medication and seeing a therapist and his symptoms went away quickly.

However, after leaving grad school, Will decided to stop taking his medication. And his old symptoms came back.

### Will and Meetings

Casey decided that he would confide in Will about the full extent of the problems that he was having. Casey believed that J.T. was angling to take his job and told Will. Will decided to do what he could to help Casey keep his job.

Will saw an email from J.T. that laid out the issue—J.T. told Casey that, after attending a meeting, he didn’t feel confident in Casey’s capabilities. Will was shocked at how harsh this news was and how matter of factly it was delivered via email.

However, once Will got the chance to see a meeting in action, he began to understand the problem and the concern from Playsoft. The meeting, scheduled for 10, began at 10:12. No one had reviewed the minutes from last week’s meeting. All of the same problems that had been clear in the previous meeting that J.T. attended were clear in this one as well. They conducted useless arguments, presentations went on for far too long, and by the time they took a quick break with only 30 minutes to go in the 2-hour meeting, it was clear they wouldn’t get to anything of substance from most of the agenda.

After the meeting, as Will headed to lunch with Tim and Casey, Tim asked Will what he thought of the meeting. Will blurted out that it was terrible. He immediately felt bad, but later in the day, Casey told Will he didn’t mind that Will had told the truth. Casey, though, remained convinced that the problems with the meetings that J.T. had referred to in his email were simply a way for J.T. to get in the door, with the ultimate goal of taking Casey’s job. Casey remained fixated on the profits, which he said remained better than those of most of Playsoft’s product lines. Will began to worry that Casey wasn’t understanding the seriousness of the problems with the meetings.

At the next meeting, all of the same problems persisted. But this time, Will couldn’t take it anymore, and he blurted out his concerns to the entire group: **They waste time, they don’t talk about anything important, essential people skip them consistently, and they deplete morale.** Casey decided to clear the room, and he spoke to Will directly. He let Will know that he knew about his condition from his father. Casey was kind to Will, and when everyone came back, they agreed that he would apologize to the team.

However, when the team came back, people began piping up, one by one, that they agreed with Will. The meetings were awful and draining. They aired their grievances—the meetings were too long, or too boring, or too unfocused—and Casey got a bit defensive, arguing that no one liked the meetings because meetings are inherently boring. While the team felt good having aired some of their problems, they didn’t imagine that anything could change. **Each one of them believed that the meetings _as Casey constructed them_ were a necessary evil. **

### Trying Out Solutions

Will was not so certain that there was no answer to their problems. While watching a movie over the weekend, Will thought he had found the problem—the length. Great movies can cover huge lengths of time, sometimes years, in less than two hours, so why did a meeting, which had much less temporal ground to cover, have to be as long as a movie?

When Will went into work on Monday, a colleague informed him that J.T. would be at the meeting that day and that Casey had been at the dentist that morning. The dentist gave him novocaine in his mouth, so he couldn’t speak well.

Will took the lead in the meeting. It went more quickly than usual, and people in the room were pleased with it, but J.T. still went to Casey’s office afterward and let him know that he had called the head of Playsoft, Wade, and explained that he thought the meetings were terrible. Wade would be attending a meeting in five weeks, and Wade informed Casey that he still had confidence in him. It was clear, though, that if the meetings weren’t better in five weeks, that confidence could be gone quickly.

#### Building Drama

Casey had never seriously considered working anywhere other than at Yip. He loved it there and he had no idea what he would do if J.T. pushed him out. Will wanted to help as best as he could, and as he watched some movies to attempt to unwind, **he realized that the problem with the meetings wasn’t the length but the _lack of drama_. **

Will developed this theory and decided to present it to the team at the next meeting. Screenwriters had figured out that for a movie to be successful, it needs conflict, or a problem that needs to be solved or resolved. Will applied a similar logic to meetings. In fact, the decisions made in meetings are actually much more important to the participants’ lives than a movie.

Just like in the movies, meetings have to have a hook—a good beginning that leaves participants willing to digest necessary plot exposition that might be a little slower. Consider discussing a budget: It sounds boring. But if the leader of the discussion sets it up correctly—by explaining the stakes in the line items and the competitors breathing down the company’s neck—people will be more willing to engage.

**After the setup of the conflict, keep looking for differences of opinion.** It’s unlikely that, after the team airs their conflict, they will reach a complete consensus. However, everyone will feel better after airing their grievances and making compelling points on the behalf of their idea, and when a decision is made by a majority or by a leader, people will be more willing to support it, even if it wasn’t their original idea.

Casey and the team then practiced creating drama in meetings with a discussion about a picnic that the company was paying for by taking money out of the budgets of other departments. Though it seemed trivial, the picnic was a longstanding issue for the company. Many executives were angry that the company was taking out even a small amount of money from their budgets to fund the picnic, and the woman in charge of the picnic was frustrated because she didn’t even want to lead the event. When everyone involved aired their grievances, they all felt better. But still, Casey wasn’t perfect at facilitating discussion right away—he sometimes shied away from conflict or didn’t know when to move on from a topic—and Will thought that they could do better.

He went back to thinking about the movies. He started developing theories, and with only two weeks to go now before the meeting with Wade, Will was nervous. He decided he needed to present his new theories to the team. **According to Will, just like the movies and television, all good meetings have two big elements: drama and structure.**

He also believed that even though this team had trouble with the meetings, they needed to have _more_ of them.

  * People often watch nightly news recaps that are five minutes—people are also willing to attend a five-minute daily meeting. 
  * A lot of people have a favorite drama on TV that airs about once a week and is an hour long. The weekly meetings can be an hour as well. 
  * About once a month, many Americans go to the movies and enjoy a two-hour event. The two-hour meetings should also be once a month. 
  * Finally, people will sometimes watch mini-series that are six hours long or more. 



#### Four Successful Meetings

Carefully tailor each of these meetings, just like each of the mediums they are based on. Employees should know what they’re signing up for—whether it be a five-minute news broadcast or a whole miniseries. Let’s break down these meetings:

  1. **The Check-in:** This meeting happens daily. People are constantly asking who’s in the office, or what their schedules look like. These questions could all be answered at the beginning of each day at the check-in meeting. Keep these short—5 minutes or less—so people don’t get burned out by the check-in.
  2. **The Tactical:** This meeting happens weekly and lasts an hour or less. Begin with everyone there giving a summary of their projects in a minute or less. After _that,_ rather than before, the team will figure out the agenda. This way, the team can decide on what to talk about after they know what’s going on. They’ll discuss together what topics are the most important to focus on. After the team chooses the topics, they make sure to limit the conversation to actionables directly relevant to the agreed-upon agenda.
  3. **The Strategic:** This meeting is monthly and lasts between two and four hours. If there are conversation topics that are important but not directly related to the agenda that come up in the tactical meeting, like discussing a competitor, they’ll table them until the strategic meeting. This is so that people aren’t constantly shifting off of the agenda and then trying to come back to it. It helps keep two types of discussions—day-to-day and larger strategic—separate from one another. If a strategic discussion _has_ to happen, still don’t do it in the tactical meeting. Call an ad hoc strategic meeting for that evening. Another important piece of the strategic meeting is that the agenda remains small. There should only be one to two strategic discussions on the agenda. That way, the strategic discussions can be in-depth. These meetings need an agenda, which will usually come from the most salient topics raised at the weekly tactical meetings. This is also the meeting where you’ll be exploring and encouraging _conflict_.
  4. **The Review:** Conduct this meeting every quarter and hold it off-site. Budget a full day, or even a weekend, for these meetings. This, above all else, is a time for review. Some potential questions could be: How is the morale of the team? What up-and-coming companies are challengers? Who are the best and worst performers? What do the customers think of the product? At these meetings, it can be useful to bring in an outside consultant to review and facilitate discussion. 



### Lessons

  * The problems with the meetings included:
    * Starting late
    * Being unfocused
    * Prioritizing the wrong topics
    * Missing key players
  * Meetings get better when participants inject drama into them.
  * If a company has issues with meetings, it’s not necessarily that they have too many. In fact, it’s likely that they have too few.
  * There are four types of meetings that every successful business should employ.
