## 1987: The Case of Peter Cardinal

In September 1987, a 10-year-old Danish boy died at Nairobi Hospital after traveling around Kenya with his parents and sister. The boy, known as Peter Cardinal, had symptoms that included:

  * Skin turning blue with red spots, which eventually turned into large bruises
  * Skin nearly separating from the tissue underneath it, as a result of blood pooling there
  * Mucus in his lungs that made it difficult to breathe
  * Bleeding around his brain



Johnson, who ran the Ebola experiments at the USAMRIID, infected monkey cells with a sample of the boy’s blood. The monkey cells quickly exploded and were destroyed. The same thing happened to guinea pig cells, which meant **the virus was adaptable to different species.**

Through more tests, Johnson confirmed what he suspected: **Cardinal’s blood contained Marburg virus.**

### Johnson Tries Tracking Down Marburg

Johnson had to find out:

  1. Where Cardinal contracted the virus
  2. What kind of host carried the virus



Johnson found out that Cardinal had visited Kitum Cave with his family shortly before getting sick. Johnson considered two ways Cardinal could’ve become infected:

  1. **Cardinal could’ve contracted Marburg through the air.** Johnson had done a previous experiment revealing that Marburg and Ebola could be infectious when airborne. But this didn’t explain why Cardinal’s parents and sister didn’t get sick. 
  2. **Cardinal could’ve scratched his hand on a sharp rock of crystal** , creating an entry point for the virus, which could’ve been on a surface in the cave. 



Johnson led an expedition into Kitum Cave with 35 American and Kenyan doctors and scientists, as well as guinea pigs, baboons, and several types of monkeys. Since there were no virus detection tools, he put animals in cages at different locations to act as canaries in the coal mine—if one got sick, researchers narrowed their search to the location of that animal’s cage and tried to pinpoint how the animal was infected.

However, **all the animals in Johnson’s expedition remained healthy.**

Additionally, the team caught and dissected small animals and thousands of bugs from the cave, hoping to find a sign of Marburg. But they found nothing.

**Johnson’s expedition neither confirmed nor ruled out Kitum Cave as the source of the virus.** The only thing he knew definitively was what he knew before the expedition: that Marburg lived somewhere on or near Mount Elgon.
