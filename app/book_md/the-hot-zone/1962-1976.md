## 1962-1976: The First Outbreaks

The first recorded outbreaks of the filoviruses occurred in a 15-year stretch in the 1960s and ‘70s. Distinct symptoms like victims’ red eyes helped doctors draw connections among the diseases.

### 1960s: First Marburg Outbreak

Between 1962 and 1965, several Ugandan villages around Mount Elgon—not far from Kitum Cave—were hit with outbreaks of an unusual disease that killed not only villagers but also monkeys. The symptoms included a strange skin rash and bleeding.

The village microbreaks went relatively unnoticed, but in 1967 a vaccine factory in the German city of Marburg experienced an outbreak that infected 31 people and killed seven.

The German factory imported African green monkeys in order to harvest their kidney cells to make vaccines. The virus came in with a shipment of several hundred monkeys from a monkey trader in Uganda who exported thousands of monkeys to Europe each year.

The monkey trader’s standard practice was to perform only a visual inspection of the monkeys before they were exported, and to remove any that looked sick or injured. The sick monkeys were then released on a small nearby island in Lake Victoria, making the island a potential hotbed of viruses.

Worse yet, when the trader was short on monkeys for an export, he would get some from the island. **It’s possible that Marburg virus was present on the island, and that the trader included some monkeys from the island in his shipment to Germany, setting off the outbreak there.**

Only two or three of the monkeys may have had the virus, and they likely didn’t show any symptoms when they arrived. But in the monkeys’ close quarters, the virus quickly spread and several monkeys died.

The virus soon made the jump to humans, first infecting a factory employee tasked with feeding the monkeys and cleaning their cages. He died within weeks.

After the Marburg outbreak, global health officials were eager to find the source of the virus so that they could contain it and avoid future outbreaks. Although the virus arrived in Marburg via monkeys,**the virus killed the monkeys too quickly to make them viable hosts—so it had to have been another animal or insect to which the monkeys were exposed.**

The World Health Organization sent a team of investigators to Uganda, where the monkeys had been imported from, but they couldn’t identify the source.

### 1976: First Ebola Sudan Outbreak

The first known case of Ebola was in a man known as Yu. G., in the summer of 1976. Yu. G. lived in a southern Sudan, about 500 miles from Mount Elgon.

Yu. G. never went to the hospital—he died in a cot at home—nor was he well known outside his family and coworkers. Nevertheless, he set off an outbreak of the virus that was later named Ebola Sudan.

No one knows where or how Yu. G. contracted the virus, but it soon spread to a few of his coworkers, from whom it spread to friends, families, and a nearby hospital. **From the hospital, the virus took off through the reuse of dirty needles.**

Ebola Sudan killed hundreds of people in central Africa. The virus’s 50 percent kill rate was comparable to the bubonic plague of the Middle Ages.

And then, suddenly, it stopped. It’s unclear why the outbreak ended, but two possible reasons are:

  1. The hospital became the epicenter of the outbreak, and everyone at the hospital either died or fled the city. The hospital staff’s departure ceased medical procedures and the use of dirty needles, which halted the spread of the virus. 
  2. **The virus may have simply been too deadly, killing its hosts so quickly that they didn’t have time to infect many other people.** Additionally, the virus was only transmitted through blood, which further limited its spread. 



### 1976: First Ebola Zaire Outbreak

**Just two months after the Ebola Sudan outbreak ignited, Ebola Zaire appeared 500 miles away,** in the mostly rural Bumba Zone of northern Zaire. Ebola Zaire was even deadlier, with almost double the kill rate of Ebola Sudan.

The virus appeared at the rural Yambuku Mission Hospital, which was run by Belgian nuns. No one knows who the first human was to contract Ebola Zaire, or from what—whether animal meat, insect blood, a spider bite, or something else. The hospital’s practice of reusing dirty needles made it impossible to know which patient first brought the virus into the hospital.

**Just a drop of infected blood is enough to transmit Ebola, so the virus quickly spread among the hospital’s nurses, injection patients, and their families, hitting 55 surrounding villages at once.**

When one nun at the hospital, known as Sister M. E., became infected, a priest and another nun flew her to Kinshasa, the country’s capital. They reasoned that she would receive better treatment there, at Ngaliema Hospital. Sister M. E. survived the trip and then died at Ngaliema Hospital.

**The doctors at Ngaliema Hospital recognized the nun’s symptoms as similar to Marburg, so they sent samples of her liver and blood to national laboratories in Belgium and England.**

### The CDC Names Ebola

The American Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was eager to get a sample of the nun’s blood as well. Karl Johnson, the head of the CDC’s Special Pathogens Branch—which investigated new and unknown viruses—called a friend at the English lab to ask for a small sample of the blood.

The English researcher agreed and sent a tiny amount of black, tarry blood in glass vials. Through electron-microscope photos, CDC researchers saw that **the virus resembled Marburg, but it tested negative for Marburg and other known viruses.** They were facing something entirely new. Johnson named the virus Ebola, because the outbreak happened around Zaire’s Ebola River.

Johnson and several other CDC doctors flew to Geneva to tell the World Health Organization what they had found. Then the doctors continued on to Zaire and Sudan to try to stop the outbreaks.

When the doctors arrived in Africa, they discovered that **villages had taken their own measures to limit the virus’s spread** , including:

  * Reverse quarantine, which entailed blocking the road leading to the village to prevent anyone from bringing the virus into the village
  * Quarantining victims in isolated huts on the outskirts of the village, and, in some cases, burning the huts after the victims died



Presumably, these measures played a major role in preventing the virus from spreading further and sparking a major epidemic.

### Mayinga Carries the Virus Around Kinshasa

Meanwhile, in Kinshasa, a nurse from Ngaliema Hospital who helped care for Sister M. E. became sick.

Despite her symptoms, the nurse, named Mayinga, spent two days walking through Kinshasa. During those two days, she waited in line at the Zairean foreign ministry, took taxis, visited two hospitals, and sat in crowded waiting rooms.

Most likely, Mayinga knew she’d contracted the virus but was in denial. She visited the foreign ministry in hopes of getting a travel permit before she became visibly sick. Mayinga’s denial also explains why she didn’t initially seek treatment at her hospital, where the staff knew her and would have recognized her symptoms.

Finally, after receiving no helpful treatment or advice from the two hospitals, she returned to Ngaliema Hospital for treatment.

News spread among local residents and officials that **a nurse who was infected with the same virus that had devastated parts of the Bumba Zone had spent two days traveling around a city of two million people.**

Officials at the World Health Organization went into high alert. The Zairean President ordered soldiers to enforce quarantine at Ngaliema Hospital and to isolate Bumba Zone, where the virus originated.

Mayinga died at Ngaliema Hospital. **Some of Mayinga’s blood still sits in vials in scientific laboratories as a sample of Ebola Zaire.**

Officials tracked down Mayinga’s whereabouts during those two days in Kinshasa and identified 37 people who had close contact with her. None of the 37 people contracted the virus—not even the person with whom she’d shared a bottle of soda. This suggested the virus was neither airborne nor easily transmissible.
