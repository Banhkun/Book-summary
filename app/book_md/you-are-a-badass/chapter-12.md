## Chapter 12: Get in Touch With Your Inner Beginner

No matter what stage of life we’re in, if we harness the ability we had in our youth to continuously live our dreams, we can reach our goals and live with more joy.

When we’re young we dive into creative pursuits with reckless abandon, getting spectacular results. But when we’re older and wiser, we live less “present in our purpose,” taking on more grown-up versions of life. It’s like being responsible equals not having fun anymore.

It’s harder to dream and take on big goals as we move through life because we have to overcome judgements and ignore fears we’ve gained from past experiences. But when we reconnect with our inner kid, we can focus on the positives instead of the list of negatives life may have handed us.

### Learn From Your Younger Self

You can learn a lot from how you lived your life in the “old days.” Think of a time in your life when you felt like you were hitting on all cylinders — doing stuff because it was fun without worrying about the outcome — a time when you were “on-purpose.” You couldn’t wait to get up in the morning and go do your thing. What were your attitude and priorities during this time? Channel them to give yourself the clarity and boost you need now.

Sincero talks about one of her most “on-purpose” times of life, as part of a band called Crotch. They didn’t know anything about starting a band or being a band, but they did it anyway. They managed to acquire a following; create a film about the record industry; star in, write and direct a music video; get a record deal and more. This time spent living entirely in the present, untainted by worries and fears, was fun and successful.

### Tips on Learning From Your Younger Self

Think about these strategies to harness the youth mindset of being turned on by life:

**See what you can get away with**. Go after life with a sense of “why not” rather than apprehension. Sincero’s motto is, “I just wanna see what I can get away with.” This takes the pressure off and helps you get back into the adventure. “I just want to see if I can start a new business/get out of debt/lose 100 pounds/meet my soulmate.”

**Find what makes you lose track of time**. Think about those times you’ve completely lost track of time because you were so immersed in something. When you lose track of time like that, you’ve entered the Vortex (Source Energy). Since you want to be in the Vortex as much as possible, figure out what gets you there. How can you be doing more of those things? How can you do less of the things that don’t immerse you?

**Let the Beginner live alongside the Expert**. Continue to hone your skills and take your craft seriously, but don’t lose the fun in the process.

**Love yourself**.
