## Chapter 3: You’re Too Wrapped Up in Your Own Head

Too often we go through life worrying about insignificant things — complaining, playing out dramas in our heads, and justifying our actions. Instead of being in the moment, we worry about daily life. We stress over money, relationships, career success.

If we were living in the present moment, we’d understand that our very lives are a full-blown miracle. In fact, our world is overflowing with miracles that we ignore while dissecting the minutiae of daily life. Animals and small children are great examples of “being present.” A dog will greet you with unadulterated joy even if you’ve been gone only a short time. A child in the midst of playing or drawing has to be dragged away to eat or bathe. They are in the moment and fully immersed in the fun of the present.

**Being present gets you out of your head and connects you to Source Energy, which raises your frequency, which attracts things of like frequency to you**.

### The Life You Want Is Here Right Now

All of the things you want to attract are here already, waiting for you to tap into them. The experience you want to have is here now. The idea you’re seeking already exists. Knowledge, connection, joy and love are here now, trying to get your attention.

You may be wondering, if the life you want is here right now, where is it exactly? Think of it like electricity. It was here all along, but most people weren’t aware of it until the light bulb was invented. Similarly, the things we seek and need also exist already, but we may not be aware of them or understand how to manifest them.

**When you’re connected to Source Energy, you are more available to download ideas and seize opportunities. Clearing the chatter in our heads and being present will help us connect to Source Energy**.

> A Hindu fable illustrates this concept perfectly. There was a woman who desired to meet the god Krishna, so she went into the forest to meditate and pray to have Krishna appear. When Krishna came walking down the forest path and tapped her on the shoulder she told him to scram — she was busy meditating about a very important goal.

**When we’re so wrapped up in our own heads, we miss out on what’s available to us right now in the present. When you’re present in the moment, you are connected to Source Energy.**

Of course, we’re adults who have understand the past and plan for the future. Occasional side trips to the past and future are necessary, but when we obsess over what-ifs and how-comes, we lose the power of the present.
