## Section 2: Leaving Insecurity Behind | Chapter 6: Accept Yourself as You Are

Now that you understand your subconscious beliefs about yourself, we’ll discuss what you need to do to free yourself from insecurity, love yourself, and live your best life.

* * *

When we truly believe in ourselves and love ourselves, we free ourselves to live rich, full, authentic lives.

We are born with the ability to trust our own instincts: breathing, eating when we’re hungry, not worrying about being judged on our dancing or hairdos. We play, create and love without holding back. But as we grow, we absorb the messages from other people around us — their thoughts, beliefs and judgements — replacing our instincts with negative false beliefs, fear, and self-doubt. This leads to physical and emotional pain we numb with alcohol or other crutches. We settle for a mediocre life.

It’s like we’re born with a big bag of money to fund our dreams, but instead we listen to other people and invest in what _they_ believe. You may believe you’re too old to dance, or become ashamed of your sexuality. You accept that you shouldn’t be doing things you want to do. As we buy into other people’s beliefs, our inner fortune dwindles.

**We invest everything we have into believing we’re not good enough**.

The other choice? We can reclaim our power by connecting with who we truly are and **invest everything we’ve got into believing in ourselves**. We reclaim self-love — not narcissism, but a deep connection with our higher selves. It allows us to tune out the outside voices.

### Win Yourself Over Again

How do we reclaim our self-love and rid ourselves of guilt, self-doubt and loathing to be and have everything we desire? There are 10 ways.

**Appreciate how special you are**. Understand that there will never be anyone else exactly like you. Nobody In the world will use their gifts as you can. You are the only you.

**Use affirmations** : Affirmations are a powerful tool to rewire your brain and train it to think differently. Figure out which affirmations you need to hear most and repeat them in your head; put them on Post-It notes all around you, and write them down 10 times every morning and 10 times every night. Some examples include:

  * “I deserve and receive love every day.” 
  * “My heart is open to love.”
  * “I am beautiful and smart.”



If these don’t fit, write your own affirmations. The more emotion you feel, the better.

**Do what you love**. People who make enjoying their lives a priority are the ones truly enjoying their lives. Look at your life and see where you’re letting yourself down. Do you miss live music? Dancing? Hanging with friends? Be proactive about creating a life you love instead of living a life you think you’re stuck with. Start putting your needs on the priority list. You’re not selfish for taking care of yourself, just happier!

**Replace negative thoughts**. When we become aware of our negative thought patterns we can begin to change them. For example, what comes to mind when you look in the mirror? When you make a mistake? When you get dumped? You likely spew negative thoughts at yourself. “You’re hideous, dumb, unworthy.” Consciously replace negative thoughts about yourself with positive ones. “You’re beautiful.” “You made a mistake, now let’s move on.”

**Stop self-deprecating humor**. Laughing at yourself is one thing — we all need to have a sense of humor about ourselves. But constant self-flagellation is another. You’re not only convincing other people you’re a loser, you are convincing _yourself_. What you tell yourself on a daily basis is powerful, so if you’re constantly putting yourself down, you are harming yourself. And it’s not funny.

**Take care of your body**. We need our bodies more than they need us. The better our bodies feel, the happier and more productive we are. Get proper nutrition, exercise and rest.

**Accept compliments**. Instead of deflecting compliments (“This old ratty thing?”) accept them graciously.

**Stop comparing yourself to others**. Comparison takes the fun out of life. Someone else’s uniqueness is no better than your own. What others do is none of your business. Enjoy what you’re creating. You are more than enough.

**Forgive yourself.** Everyone screws up and will screw up again. You are no exception and you are not alone. But dragging around guilt and self-recrimination is pointless, unhealthy and boring. Think of a specific instance you feel badly about. Call it up and feel it in your mind and body. Tell yourself something like, “Holding on to this is hurting me and stopping me from living my life to the fullest. I deserve a happy life and will let this go.” Repeat this until you feel free and light. Repeat this process as long as it takes. (Chapter 15 has more tips on forgiveness and letting go.)

**Love Yourself**.
