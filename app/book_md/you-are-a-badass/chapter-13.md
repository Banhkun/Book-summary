## Chapter 13: Give and Receive

If you want to attract good things and feelings into your life, you must send good things out to everyone around you. Giving is one of our greatest joys as well as being a fearless and powerful action. When we trust that there is plenty out there in The Universe, we can give freely. This raises our frequency, strengthens our faith, and puts us in a position to receive abundant amounts in return.

But when we live in fear and hold onto what we have because we don’t trust that there’s any more out there for us, we stifle our energy and create more lack — the very thing we’re hoping to avoid.

Giving and receiving depend on each other; the more you give, the more you receive.

Receiving shouldn’t be confused with greedily taking — that’s a different, negative energy that is fear-based and needy. Giving, similarly, shouldn’t be confused with smothering, which is also fear-based. Giving and receiving are both full of gratitude and surrendering to the flow.

> Sincero recounts an example of the joy and benefits of getting into the giving-and-receiving flow: A person with MS was advised by her mentor to give away 29 things in 29 days as part of her cure. When she actually did this — starting by “giving” a phone call to a sick friend — she found herself increasingly joyful and excited. By day 14 she was better physically and her business started booming. She created a blog that started a movement of people giving away things daily, leading to a book called “29 Gifts.”

### Tips on Getting Into the Give-and-Take Flow

  * Pick one or two causes meaningful to you. Give to them every month, whatever time or money you have, but do it consistently. Make it a habit, part of who you are.
  * Give something away. Give one of your favorite things in the world away to someone who would love it. If possible, do it without them knowing where it came from. 
  * Leave a dollar more than you normally would every time you tip.
  * If someone is being snarky, respond with love instead of more snarkiness.
  * Smile, compliment, and make people laugh as much as possible.
  * Say yes to offers you’d usually say no to out of fear of inconveniencing the other person. This gives them a chance to give to you.
  * Feel how good it feels when you give and receive; raise your frequency and expect more good to come your way.
  * Love yourself.
