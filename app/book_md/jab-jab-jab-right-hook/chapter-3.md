## Chapter 3: How to Best Use Facebook

We’ve discussed the marketing techniques that apply to any social media platform. Now, we’ll explore platform-specific techniques. Each platform has its own features, and native content looks different on all of them.

In this chapter, we cover how to best use Facebook for marketing purposes. In subsequent chapters, we’ll cover how to use other platforms.

Facebook is a social media site that allows users to share text, photos, and videos with their network. Most marketers use Facebook, even if they’re not on board with social media in general, because it has such a huge audience.

**The audience:** As of December 2012, there were over a billion monthly active Facebook users, and 680 monthly users who accessed Facebook on their mobile devices. Facebook is responsible for 20% of page views in the US.

**Who uses it:** Facebook is used by almost everyone.

**Why they use it:** People go on Facebook because they want to find out what people they know are doing and socialize.

### Notable Features

Facebook has several features that distinguish it from other social media platforms:

**Feature #1: Advanced analytics.** Studying Facebook’s analytics can tell you a lot about how people work, and you can use this data to make your content more effective.

**Feature #2: Huge amount of content.** Part of the reason Facebook is such a good marketing tool is that there are so many people on it. However, all of these people create content yours has to compete with.

**Feature #3: Free targeting functionality.** Facebook offers settings that allow you to make certain posts visible to only a certain demographic, which is ideal for right hook posts. You can see in real-time if people are seeing and engaging with the posts as they like or comment.

  * For example, if you’re posting about a sale on handbags, you can make it visible only to a particular demographic you think is likely to buy a handbag, say, 20-to-30-year-old women. If you only post to people who will probably be interested, you’ll get a higher percentage of engagement (shares and so on). The more engagement you get, the more people will see the targeted post.



**Feature #4: Use of curating algorithms.** Facebook doesn’t want users to see posts they’re not interested in (because if they get bored they’ll leave the site), so Facebook uses algorithms to curate people’s News Feeds.

  * For example, even if someone already likes your brand page, they won’t necessarily see your posts. Only 3-5% of your content shows up on your fans’ News Feeds organically (showing up “organically” happens when no one shares the story or you don’t pay to make it more visible.) As a result, if you want to reach a larger audience, you have to either pay or create content that’s engaging enough to be shared.



### EdgeRank

EdgeRank is a Facebook algorithm. (Shortform note: EdgeRank hasn’t been in use since 2011, but we’ll discuss how it works as an example of how algorithms can affect post visibility. For more recent information on Facebook’s algorithms, read this Hootsuite blog post.)

EdgeRank tracks users’ engagement with content (liking, sharing, commenting, and following posted links). **When there’s a lot of engagement with a particular type of content, EdgeRank shows the users similar content.** (There’s a randomizer so that sometimes, users will see a post from an account they haven’t engaged with recently.)

  * Example #1: If your fans share your brand’s posts, EdgeRank will show fans more posts from your brand.
  * Example #2: If you comment on a lot of your friends’ status updates but not their photos, EdgeRank will show you more status updates and fewer photos. 



Facebook doesn’t know which of liking, commenting, or clicking most strongly indicates a user’s interest in your content. As a result, **EdgeRank weighs jabs and right hooks evenly and doesn’t consider click-throughs, which lead to sales, as indicative of more engagement than liking a post.**

  * For example, if you post a link to a product page and sell 50,000 products in twenty minutes, EdgeRank will notice the activity and curate the post onto your current fans’ News Feeds. However, if no one likes, comments, or shares that post, it’ll never be visible outside of your current community no matter how many people click through.



**To best use Facebook, you have to consistently throw jabs that people want to engage with so that EdgeRank thinks your content is valuable and interesting to a wide variety of people.** Then, when you do throw the right hook, EdgeRank sees that the post came from you, an interesting user, and boosts the post’s visibility, even if that particular right hook is less engaging than the jabs that came before.

Facebook is constantly changing—perhaps in the future, its algorithms will weigh purchases as the strongest version of engagement. Facebook wouldn’t survive if all of its content was right hooks, however, so the author suspects it’ll keep guarding its users’ News Feeds carefully.

### Creating Engaging Content

We’ve established that your content has to be engaging to be visible on Facebook—so how do you create engaging content? The same way you engage with people in real life—you**find out what they’re interested in and then talk to them about it.**

For example, no matter what you’re selling, one of your jabs could be to ask your customers who their favorite recording artists are. Say 70% of your audience loves Adele. When there’s news about Adele, if you post about it, people will interact with that post. You’ll look like a human being and entertain people, and Facebook’s algorithm will note the interest in a post from your brand. Your next post, which can be more product-related, will show up in more people’s News Feeds.

### Paid Advertising on Facebook

In addition to creating engaging content, you can purchase advertising to increase your brand’s visibility. Facebook has two types of ads: the ones that show up on the right side of the screen, and sponsored stories.

#### Type #1: Right-Side Ads

These ads show up on the right side of the screen when viewing the desktop version of Facebook. They used to be a good investment—you pay only when someone likes the ad and likes cost between $0.10 and a few dollars depending on your campaign.

As of 2013, however, **these ads aren’t as useful because they only show up on the desktop version of Facebook, and more and more people are accessing the site on their mobile devices.**

#### Type #2: Sponsored Stories

Sponsored stories appear in the News Feed and look similar to user-generated Facebook posts. There are two kinds of sponsored stories:

  * **Page Posts.** Page Posts display your content to more than the 3-5% of News Feeds that would normally show it.
  * **Stories that highlight engagement.** These stories display engagement with your content (likes, check-ins, and so on) to more than the 3-5% of News Feeds that would normally show it.
    * For example, if a fan checks in to your cafe, you can pay to have that interaction show up in their friends’ News Feeds.



**You can turn a regular post into a sponsored story whenever you like, which allows you to test content before you pay to have its reach extended.** If your content is already getting a lot of engagement, you know it’s good and worth pushing further.

Facebook assesses the fee for a sponsored story based on who you’re competing with, how much they’re willing to pay, and how much you’re willing to pay. If your ad is engaging, Facebook will prioritize yours over your competitors’ and charge you less for each interaction. As people engage, Facebook will show the ad to more of them.

If your sponsored story _isn’t_ engaging, Facebook tells you and axes it. Facebook wants your money, but it also wants its users to have good content because if they get bad content, they’ll stop visiting. This functionality can save you a lot of advertising dollars—no TV network would ever tell you your ad is bad and a waste of your money.

**Once people engage with your content, Facebook algorithms believe people are interested in your brand, so you’ll get better visibility on your next regular (free) post.**

### Tips for Creating Good Facebook Content

To create effective and engaging Facebook content, use the following tips:

**Tip #1: Choose the correct format.** On Facebook, you can create a link-based post, which shows a small photo beside the link, or a photo-based post, which prioritizes the photo. Choose appropriately.

  * Example of bad content: When Air Canada’s first flight attendant died, the company posted a link to an interview with her as a link post. They should have used a photo post because her headshot was striking and deserved to be featured.

  * (Shortform example of good content: Subaru appropriately chose a photo post to share a link to more information about one of their vehicles. The image showed a car facing off against a helicopter.)

**Tip #2: Optimize for mobile.** More people are accessing Facebook sites on mobile devices than ever.

  * Example of bad content: Zara posted a photo with overlaid text that was too small to be legible on a mobile device. 



![jabjab-Zara.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-Zara.png)

  * Example of good content: Victoria Secret posted a photo that had the text overlaid across the center so that it wouldn’t be cropped by the smaller mobile screen. The text was also large, legible, and in a bright color. 



![jabjab-Victoria.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-Victoria.png)

**Tip #3: Regulate the comments section.** Many people try to piggyback on popular fan pages to sell their own products or business, which is content that people aren’t interested in, so you need to remove it. You also need to respond to people’s comments and questions.

  * Example of bad content: The comments section of Lil Wayne’s Facebook page is full of people pitching their own businesses and pages—content his fans aren’t interested in.
  * Example of good content: Amtrak posted a picture of two train seats and asked people who they want to travel with. When one fan wrote that he wanted to go with Justin Bieber, Amtrak responded by asking where Selena Gomez would sit.
