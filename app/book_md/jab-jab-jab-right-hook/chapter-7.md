## Chapter 7: How to Best Use Tumblr

Unlike the other platforms mentioned above, Tumblr wasn’t originally a social media platform, but a blogging platform. In January 2012, Tumblr redesigned its dashboard to become more social.

**The audience:** Tumblr has 132 million monthly users as of June 2013 and every day, 60 million new posts go up. Tumblr’s not as big as some of the other platforms, but your brand should still have a presence on it.

**Who uses it:** Tumblr is mainly used by 18-to-34-year-olds. Slightly more women than men use it, and many artists use it. The tone is urban, ironic, and hipster.

**Why they use it:** Tumblr is more a publishing platform than a consuming one, but people do consume media on it, and quickly.

### Notable Features

Tumblr has several features that distinguish it from other social media platforms:

  * **Customizable homepage.** Unlike Twitter or Facebook, you can choose your art, logo placement, color, format, and font, which allows you to better express your brand’s identity.
  * **Interest-based connections.** Connections are made based on interest, not who you already know. If you post content people are interested in and tag it appropriately, they’ll find it, whether or not they follow you.
  * **GIF support.** GIFs are soundless videos that play on a loop without having to be clicked. They can be either animated or live-action and often captioned. (Shortform note: In 2013, when _Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook_ was published, Tumblr was the only platform that supported GIFs. Today, most of the platforms listed in this summary support them too.)
    * (Shortform example: Find many GIFs here.)
  * **Relatively new.** Fewer businesses are on Tumblr than other platforms, so you have a chance to corner the market before your competitors arrive.



### Tips for Creating Good Tumblr Content

To create effective and engaging Tumblr content, use the following tips:

**Tip #1: Customize your homepage to showcase your brand identity.**

  * (Shortform example of good content: _The New Yorker_ ’s homepage uses its iconic font and cartoons to show off its identity.)

**Tip #2: Use GIFs.** GIFs are popular with Tumblr users, so if you use them too, your content will be more native and interesting.

  * Example of bad content: Smirnoff posted a boring, still product photo of a Smirnoff bottle.

  * Example of good content: NPR’s _Fresh Air_ talk show posted a GIF of a scene from A Room with a View to commemorate the death of the screenplay writer.



**Tip #3: Be cool.** Tumblr’s audience is young, cool, and interested in exclusive content.

  * Example of good content: _Life_ magazine posted a never-before-seen image of Marlon Brando on his birthday.

**Tip #4: Consider black and white images.** Black and white images can be dramatic.

  * (Shortform example of good content: Taylor Swift posted a dramatic black and white photo to promote her new album.)

**Tip #5: Use appropriate tags.** Tags help people find your posts.

  * Example of good content: _GQ_ posted a photo of _Mad Men_ characters at a cocktail hour just before the sixth season premiered. They tagged the post with the name of the show, the names of characters, and “television.”
