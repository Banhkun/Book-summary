## Exercise: Assess Your Instagram Posts

Instagram is one of the fastest-growing social media platforms, so it’s important to know how to use it effectively.

* * *

Navigate to or recall one of your brand’s recent Instagram posts. Is the photo high-quality, indie, and/or artsy? Why or why not? How could you retake or edit the photo to make it more native?

What hashtags did you use in the post, if any? What additional hashtags could you use to make it easier for people to find your content?

How could you edit the post to make it more appealing to the younger generation? (For example, could you link the post to a trend that’s currently popular with young people?)
