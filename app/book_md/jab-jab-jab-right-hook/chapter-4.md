## Chapter 4: How to Best Use Twitter

Like Facebook, Twitter is a popular social media site with a large audience. Twitter is a microblogging platform and posts are called “tweets.”

**The audience:** As of December 2012, there were 500 million Twitter users worldwide. 750 tweets are posted per second.

**Who uses it:** The Twitter demographic is young and urban.

**Why they use it:** Twitter is mainly used to share information and news.

### Notable Features

Twitter has several features that distinguish it from other social media platforms:

**Feature #1: Mobile friendly.** Twitter is one of the most mobile-friendly platforms.

**Feature #2: Very public.** Twitter is almost completely public. Most tweets are public to the entire internet, even to people who don’t have accounts, and anyone who does have an account can usually talk to anyone else with an account, regardless of whether or not they’re following each other. (On Facebook, Instagram, and Tumblr, you can only talk to people once they’ve decided to follow you.)

**Feature #3: Huge potential for community engagement.** Because Twitter’s so public, in addition to responding to customer’s tweets about your brand, _you_ can initiate conversations with potential new customers. Twitter’s search engine is powerful and you can use it not only to find people directly talking about your brand but people talking about things only distantly related to you.

  * For example, one day a man named Levi Lentz tweeted to say that Michael Franti’s “Say Hey” was one of his favorite songs. Green Mountain Coffee responded to the tweet to say that they loved it too. There was a connection between Green Mountain Coffee and Franti—they were working on a fair trade campaign—but it wasn’t public yet, so it looked to Lentz like the coffee company just wanted to have a conversation. (In Twitter culture, it’s not unusual to spontaneously talk to people you’ve never met.) Eventually, Lentz brought up coffee. Green Mountain gave him coffee recommendations and mailed him a Michael Franti CD. Lentz wrote about the encounter in his blog and the company sent him a thank-you note, coffee sample, and mug. All of this engagement stemmed from a tweet Lentz never expected to start a conversation with a brand.



**Feature #5: Retweeting features.** On Twitter, you can retweet (reshare) other people’s tweets. This allows you to rework other people’s content instead of having to come up with your own.

**Feature #6: The importance of context over content.** Like Facebook, there’s an overwhelming amount of content on Twitter, and if you’re only tweeting about your products, you’re not going to stand out. You _can_ stand out by putting your own spin on the news and augmenting existing content with commentary, humor, or voice. People want escapism and entertainment—information that’s also entertaining.

  * For example, say you run a bookstore. When a newspaper releases a review of a book you sell, you might tweet a sentence along the lines of, “Check out this review of _The Italian Pig_ from _The New York Times_ ” and include the link to the review. Or, you could write something like, “ _The New York Times_ loves it. We hate it. Find out why.” This tweet would be linked to your blog, which would have the full text of the review and your thoughts on it. (The author writes that criticizing something he sold never hurt his sales when he was in the wine business; in fact, it made people trust him.)



**Feature #7: Trend-tracking features.** Trends are words, topics, and hashtags that are popular at any given moment. You can use settings to track trends (at levels ranging from regional to worldwide) and then use that knowledge to post timely content with appropriate context.

  * For example, the day after the finale of the TV show _30 Rock_ , the show’s name was trending. A brand could have told their story within that context by looking for a connection between themselves and the show. The show aired for seven years, so any company with the number “seven” in their name, for example, 7 For All Mankind, might have used that connection to show that they were aware of the things their fans were interested in. 7 For All Mankind missed the opportunity, though—their Twitter page that day was full of brags, right hooks, and some customer engagement.



### Common Mistakes

In addition to missing opportunities, there are two common mistakes people make with Twitter. These are the overuse of:

  * **Pushing content.** Most marketers tweet links to content that’s somewhere else, such as their blog. This doesn’t make use of Twitter’s unique features or give users the type of content they want.
  * **“Birdiebragging.”** Birdiebragging is a term the author came up with to describe bragging by retweeting nice things your customers have said about you. Few people find bragging to be engaging content.



### Paid Advertising on Twitter

Like Facebook, Twitter provides paid advertising that you can use to boost the visibility of your brand, in the form of promoted tweets. Promoted tweets are clearly labeled “Promoted” and are given more visibility than other tweets, for example, by appearing at the top of relevant search pages. Like any tweet, a good way to use a promoted tweet is to find a link between a trending hashtag and your brand. For example, on National Wear Red Day, #GoRed was trending, and Tide bought a promoted tweet that referenced the color-saving features of its detergent.

### Tips for Creating Great Twitter Content

To create effective and engaging Twitter content, use the following tips:

**Tip #1: Use memorable and idiosyncratic hashtags.** Hashtags only work if they’re well-chosen—they need to fit the voice of your brand and be native to Twitter. For example, while many users on Twitter appreciate and make use of irony, if irony doesn’t suit your brand and you try to use it anyway in your hashtags, you’re going to confuse your audience or look out of touch.

  * Example of bad content: The Holiday Inn tweeted a birdiebrag and didn’t include any hashtags at all.

  * Example of good content: Chubbies, a shorts company, came up with #CargoEmbargo and #SOTO (stands for Skies Out Thighs Out), two concepts that are specific to shorts.

**Tip #2: Pay attention to voice**. Your voice should sound like your brand and be appropriate to the Twitter audience (which, as noted in Tip #1, tends to enjoy irony).

  * Example of bad content: Dunkin Donuts posted a tweet that was signed “JG.” Your voice needs to be unified, so only post from the point of view of your brand, not a specific employee. (If JG leaves the company, the tweets can no longer be signed with the initials.)

  * Example of good content: Adidas wrote a tweet in which their call to action was in the same voice as the rest of their copy. Often, companies get too formal when they throw the right hook.

**Tip #3: Break the news first.** If you can release news people are interested in before anyone else does, it’ll be your tweet that’s reshared as the news goes around.

  * Example of good content: EA Sports FIFA, a video game brand, announced the soccer teams who would play in the semifinals of the UEFA Champions League. Many people learned the news from this tweet first, and many people retweeted the post. 



![jabjab-EA.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-EA.png)

**Tip #4: Trendjack.** Trendjacking refers to using hashtags that are trending to boost the visibility of your tweet. Twitter users regularly look through the list of posts that use the trending hashtags, and if you use a trend, your tweets are more likely to be seen by people outside your existing network.

  * Example of bad content: Hollister tried to create their own hashtag, #guarding. #guarding was already being used by teenage basketball players and security guards, so it wasn’t distinct enough to be associated with their brand. Additionally, **it’s very hard to come up with a hashtag that will go on to trend and attract people to you. It’s much easier to look at what’s already trending and then use that to interact with others.**



![jabjab-hollister.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/jabjab-hollister.png)

  * Example of good content: When the hashtag #ThoughtsInBed was trending, Taco Bell tweeted that a possible thought in bed was the need for Taco Bell, which a lot of people found funny enough to interact with.
