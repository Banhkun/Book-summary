## Chapter 5: How to Best Use Pinterest

Unlike Twitter and Facebook, Pinterest is a very visual platform. Pinterest is a social bookmarking site that allows people to save images they like, and ideas associated with the images, into collections. Posts are called “pins” and collections are “boards.” Every brand should get on Pinterest, even if your product isn’t particularly image-worthy.

**The audience:** By 2013, Pinterest had 48.7 million users. While it’s only slightly less popular than Twitter, marketers have been reluctant to get on it for two reasons:

  * They’re already busy with other social media sites.
  * It encourages you to share images you don’t own, which people initially thought might create copyright infringement. Pinterest has since revised its terms and put in business features to make it more attractive, and no one has ever been sued.



**Who uses it:** The majority of Pinterest users are women. Many parents use Pinterest—half of Pinterest users have children.

**Why they use it:** Pinterest was initially used to share fashion, food, and home decor ideas, but now people use it to share all sorts of hobbies. People like Pinterest because it’s aspirational—people pin images of what they’d like their lives to look like, not actually what they are.

### Notable Features

Pinterest has several features that distinguish it from other social media platforms:

**Feature #1: Purchase-friendly.** A Steelhouse study found that users are almost 80% more likely to buy something they see on Pinterest than Facebook. Twitter produces only a quarter of the revenue-per-click of Pinterest.

**Feature #2: Distinction between boards and brand pages.** People can follow your collections separately from your brand, so you have more freedom to explore your brand’s identity.

For example, if you’re a coffee company, you could create boards directly related to your product (for example, boards for Dark Roast, Decaf, and so on), tangentially related (for example, a board for coffee date outfits), or not at all related (for example, movies and books).

**Feature #3: Support for comments.** Comments are a new Pinterest feature that not many people are taking advantage of yet (as of 2013), so if you start using them, you’ll stand out. Like you would on Twitter, talk to people about their interests. Whenever you engage, you encourage people to look at your brand page to learn about you.

**Feature #4: Support for captions.** You can accompany all your images with custom captions or descriptions.

  * For example, if you sell coffee and you caption a photo “Morning-after coffee saves the day again,” the caption might encourage people to comment on what they got up to on Friday night. This will encourage people to repin your posts onto their own boards, where more people will see them. 



**Feature #5: Repinning functionality**. Like Twitter, you can reuse and upcycle other people’s content. This might not help you make sales, but it’s good for building relationships and establishing trust.

  * For example, a coffee company might create a board called “Coffee Accessories” and repin a photo of a coffee pot with a short review of it. 



**Feature #6: Rabbitholing opportunities.** Most people on Pinterest don’t go directly to a brand’s page; they arrive there by clicking on images they’re interested in that eventually lead to the page. People have the potential to end up on your brand page no matter what board they initially started at.

### Tips for Creating Good Pinterest Content

To create effective and engaging Pinterest content, use the following tips:

**Tip #1: Post aspirational images.** People use Pinterest because they want to imagine what their lives could look like, so use aspirational images to create native content.

  * Example of good content: Whole Foods pinned a photo of a pantry in a mansion, which suggested that all their customers deserved to be the kind of people who had access to fancy pantries.

**Tip #2: Give your boards and photos good titles and descriptions.** Good titles and descriptions will help people find images and understand what they’re looking at and how they might relate to it.

  * Example of bad content: UNICEF posted this photo of a child who has AIDS to two boards, “Can You See Me?” and “Nonprofit Media.” Neither of these board titles explain what content the boards contain, and neither title sheds any light on the content of this particular image. UNICEF should have instead posted this image to a board with a title related to helping orphans or people with AIDS.

  * Example of good content: Jordan Winery pinned a photo of wine to a board called “Wine 101,” which shows that the company caters to people with all levels of wine experience.

**Tip #3: Use high-quality images.** Good imagery is important on all social media sites but particularly Pinterest because it’s so image-based. Ask yourself if the image in the pin is high-quality enough to be printed in a magazine. If it isn’t, don’t post it.

  * Example of bad content: Arby’s pinned a badly cropped photo of an apple turnover that makes it look unappetizing.

  * Example of good content: Chobani pinned a high-quality photo of pancakes that’s meant to appeal to parents.

**Tip #4: Categorize images so people don’t have to debate where to repin.** The easier you make engagement, the more likely people are to do it.

  * (Shortform example of good content: Target pinned this image to a board called “Target Baby,” which clearly tells people that the image is related to baby products available at Target.)

**Tip #5: Include a price.** While including a price is advantageous on most platforms, it’s particularly powerful on Pinterest—including a price will increase your likes by 36%.

  * (Shortform example of good content: Loael posted a photo of a dress with the price in the copy.)****

**Tip #6: Use infographics.** Infographics are popular and create engagement.

  * (Shortform example of good content: _Business Insider_ posted an infographic about how to talk about wine.)
