## Exercise: Brainstorm Pins

Pinterest is a quickly growing social media platform, so you should consider setting up an account if you haven’t already.

* * *

People use Pinterest because they want to imagine what their lives could look like. If you were to take a photo of your product to use in a pin, how would you make the image aspirational? (For example, could you make the photo convey luxury or high status?)

What would you write as a description for this photo? What board would you pin it to, and why?

Infographics—for example, charts or diagrams—are popular on Pinterest and create engagement. How could you create a brand- or product-related infographic?
