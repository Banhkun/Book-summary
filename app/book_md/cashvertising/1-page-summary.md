## 1-Page Summary

In _Ca$hvertising,_ advertising coach Drew Whitman offers insider tips and tricks on how to craft the most compelling, money-generating ads for your business. He argues that most advertisers don’t recognize that their ads must address eight core human needs (like the need to stay alive, find nourishment, and have a community) to gain the attention of consumers. They thus produce poor advertising that consumers easily look past.

However, if you can create ads that address those core human needs using any of the 13 advertising techniques Whitman presents, your ad is virtually guaranteed to garner attention and bring in sales. We’ve consolidated Whitman’s original list of 50+ techniques into this smaller list, which still covers his most critical and actionable advice.

Drew Whitman is an advertising expert who leads seminars on effective advertising, consults for businesses, and offers creative services. He’s created ads for several large organizations and is also the author of _BrainScripts for Sales Success. _

In this guide, we’ll first present Whitman’s argument that every ad must cater to the eight core human needs to be successful. Then, we’ll move on to the 13 actionable techniques he recommends to ensure your ads are effective. We’ll supplement Whitman’s guidance with that of other marketing professionals and tie his ideas to the field of psychology to explain why they’re effective.

### Tailor Your Ads to Address the Eight Core Human Needs

Before you create any form of advertisement, you must understand the fundamental rule of advertising: **Your ads must address the eight core needs that motivate all humans** (what Whitman calls the _Life-Force 8_). These desires are biologically programmed into us, and all humans have them until they die. Therefore, if your advertising addresses these needs, it will always draw the attention of audiences. These needs are:

  * Stay alive, live longer, and live a happier life
  * Eat and drink well
  * Avoid fear and threats to your life
  * Find a sexual partner
  * Live safely and comfortably
  * Match or exceed your peers in status
  * Take care of your near and dear
  * Be accepted by society



> **Why Addressing the Eight Core Human Needs in Advertising Is so Important**
> 
> Others agree with Whitman on the importance of advertising addressing the eight core human needs and add additional context on why ads must do this. In _Building a Storybrand, _Donald Miller asserts that the human brain, by design, overlooks any information that doesn’t help it either survive or thrive. This means that any marketing that doesn’t directly address one or several of the eight core human needs is doomed to be seen as useless and ignored by readers.
> 
> In his book, Miller also lists the several survival needs that all ads must address but presents these differently. Miller hews more closely to Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, upon which both his and Whitman’s lists of human needs are based: He writes that we need nourishment, security, relationships, and spiritual meaning. Whitman, on the other hand, has broken those needs into smaller needs that are more actionable in advertising—for instance, it’s easier to show how your soda helps the reader “eat and drink well” than it is to show the reader how your soda “provides them with nourishment.” Still, both lists are essentially the same, just presented differently.

By tailoring your ads to address the eight core human needs, you also reduce the amount of work you need to do to convince your audience to buy: The reason to buy will be obvious and compelling to any consumer.

(Shortform note: Throughout the book, Whitman doesn’t explicitly connect his techniques to these eight core human needs. Indeed, it can be difficult to see how some techniques—like the technique we’ll cover later of posing rhetorical questions, for instance—address any of the eight core human needs. We might consider that, while the connection to the eight core human needs may not be surface-level, the connection is _implied_ in the technique. So, for example, when using rhetorical questions, you might pose rhetorical questions that get the reader thinking about the eight core human needs.)

### The 13 Most Effective Advertising Techniques

Now that you know your ads must address the eight core human needs to be successful, let’s look at Whitman’s list of 13 advertising techniques that will increase the effectiveness of your ads. You won’t use all of these techniques in every ad, so think about what you’re selling and to whom, and use the techniques that support that product and audience.

He mainly writes in the context of print ads, but much of his advice can also be applied to the more current online advertising.

#### Instill Fear in Your Audience and Show Your Product Eradicates that Fear

One of the best ways to sell a product is to **provoke a fear in your audience that your product can eradicate** , writes Whitman. People are strongly motivated to avoid things they fear, and if your product can help them do that, they’ll want to buy it. Fears include fear of loss, fear for your health, fear of damage to your ego and self-esteem, and so on.

To use fear in advertising, ensure it meets all of the following criteria:

  * The fear is real, common, and palpable to the audience
  * The ad proposes a way to overcome the threat that creates the fear
  * The audience feels the proposed way to overcome the threat is effective
  * The audience believes it can take the action to overcome the threat



> **How Much Is the Right Amount of Fear?**
> 
> Other marketing experts feel you must use fear only in moderation. In _Building a Storybrand, _Donald Miller contends that evoking fear too often or too strongly paralyzes customers or turns them off from your brand. Whitman brings up this point in his book, as well, but generally seems to feel that as long as you’re not distasteful or evoke gruesome fears, you can use this tactic frequently.
> 
> Miller’s approach to building fear in an ad is also slightly different from Whitman’s: While Whitman proposes four criteria the ad must meet to effectively use fear, Miller proposes a four-step process to build fear gently. It seems that for Whitman, _how_ you build fear is less important than the fear being perceived as real and the customer perceiving your solution as viable.
> 
> For Miller, on the other hand, it’s critical that you guide the reader through a _story_ about the threat: This, for him, is the most convincing way to sell a product.

For instance, an ad for child car seats could raise the possibility of a child being injured in an accident (a real and palpable parental fear). The ad would then propose a new, ultra-safe car seat (a way to overcome the threat of injury) and explain exactly _how_ it’s superior to other car seats (showing how it’s an effective way to avoid injury). Finally, the ad would explain how the customer can easily purchase this car seat and install it (showing how to take action).

#### Align Your Product With Your Customer’s Current or Aspirational Image of Themselves

Another selling technique is to **align your product with the current positive image your audience has of themselves or the aspirational image they’d like to have of themselves**. This is effective and easy because we have built-in perceptions of ourselves—for instance as serious, sexy, or rugged. When you identify those images and associate your product with them, consumers will feel your product helps reinforce their desired self-image and will buy it, claims Whitman.

For instance, if you identify an audience that sees itself as effortlessly cool and unmaterialistic, you should advertise your leather wallets as minimalistic and unshowy.

The most successful image-creating ads focus on commonly desired traits, like intelligence, attractiveness, wealth, and sexual appeal. These are traits that most people consider to be part of their self-image (or desired self-image).

> **Show how Your Customer Hasn’t Yet Attained Their Aspirational Identity**
> 
> The commonly desired traits that Whitman mentions are likely based on the eight core human needs: the need to find a sexual partner, to live safely and comfortably, to be seen as equal to or better than your peers, and so on. This would be why any of those eight needs as part of an image will probably lead to a successful ad.
> 
> In _Breakthrough Advertising, _Eugene Schwartz adds an additional step that must take place before your customer will align your product with their self-image: showing the customer how they’re not yet aligned with that image.
> 
> This is only possible when you’re associating your product with the customer’s aspirational identity—the customer presumably is already secure in their current identity. Schwartz believes this step works because when customers feel there’s a gap between what they are now and what they want to be, they’re compelled to fill that gap. If you don’t explicitly point this gap out to them, you risk not motivating them sufficiently to fill it by purchasing your product.

#### Convince Your Audience Your Product Makes Them a Part of a Group

**Show the audience how your product makes them a part of a group** , writes Whitman. Humans have an innate drive to be a part of groups for survival, and if your ad shows them how your product or service includes them in a group they want to be a part of, they’ll be more likely to buy. These groups can be demarcated by age, education, location, politics, and more.

Once you’ve decided what type of group you want to feature, tailor your advertising to that group. For instance, if you believe customers of your learning platform want to belong to a group of highly educated people, show how taking your courses makes people smarter and more worldly.

(Shortform note: While the need to belong to a group is innate and helps humans survive, when it becomes too strong, it can lead to groupthink. This is a phenomenon in which people stop thinking independently in service of establishing uniformity within the group. It’s possible groupthink plays into consumer buying choices: Someone might buy the latest Apple product simply because as an existing Apple user, they feel they should _remain_ an Apple user, not because the product is truly superior to competitors’. Advertisers might take advantage of this by creating ads that pressure consumers to buy just because everyone else is buying, but the ethics of such advertising would be questionable.)

#### Use Outside Sources to Verify Your Credibility

Another way to craft strong advertising is to **use outside sources like customer testimonials, celebrity endorsements, medical endorsements, and so on to confirm the effectiveness of your product** , claims Whitman. The reason this works is that humans naturally try to do as little mental work as possible and prefer to rely on cues that _signal_ credibility—like testimonials and logos of organizations—than to do in-depth research to _verify_ credibility.

(Shortform note: In _Influence, _Robert Cialdini calls the phenomenon of believing in a product or idea because others do the _Social Proof Principle_ : We subconsciously feel that because others approve of and use a product, it must be good. The Social Proof Principle is a specific type of reliance on a cue—widespread social approval—that signals credibility and lets us avoid verifying that credibility ourselves.)

It doesn’t matter if consumers have heard of the organization or person offering the endorsement. Simply seeing that an official-seeming group believes in your product is often enough to get consumers to buy it. Similarly, merely seeing the image of a doctor in your ad—even if no doctor endorsed your product—makes consumers believe more in your product.

(Shortform note: It may pose no ethical concern if a consumer hasn’t heard of an industry organization that’s endorsed your product, but it may be ethically dubious to use an image of a doctor or other professional in your ad—or, many argue, to advertise medicines at all. Advertising budgets for medicines have risen steeply since 2011, and many ads are now for expensive, niche medical treatments that might spur consumers to demand treatments they don’t need or that are unnecessarily expensive. Some suggest that any product that could benefit from the endorsement of a medical or other professional shouldn’t be advertised __ in the first place and should exist outside of the marketplace (medicines, legal services, and so on).)

To obtain testimonials from customers, simply ask them for their opinion and offer something in return—for instance, copies of the ad in which they appear.

(Shortform note: Jeffrey Gitomer adds a recommendation for obtaining strong testimonials: Ask the customer to make their testimonial specific, showing how exactly your product helped them.)

#### Use Cognitive Shortcuts to Encourage Buying

Whitman builds on the idea that people use endorsements and testimonials as cognitive shortcuts. Here are a few more ways you can take advantage of common cognitive shortcuts in your ads:

**We buy from brands and people we like.** So feature well-liked celebrities in your ad or write warm ad copy. (Shortform note: Cancel culture, which arose over a decade after this book was written, might make the inclusion of celebrities in your ads risky: It’s easier than ever before for people to call out and “cancel” a celebrity on social media if that celebrity has behaved badly.)

**We buy from brands and people we find attractive.** We consider attractive people to be more likable and trustworthy than others, so use attractive models in your ads. (Shortform note: For many years, “attractive” in advertising was defined as being tall, thin, white, and often blond. Now, advertisers are starting to redefine what an appealing face and body are to include people of all ethnic backgrounds and body shapes.)

**We buy from companies that have given us something.** When we receive something from a company, we feel compelled to give them something in return: our business. So offer the customer something valuable—a free trial, a free sample, and so on—and they’ll feel obliged to buy from you. (Shortform note: What Robert Cialdini refers to as the _Reciprocity Principle_ is a product of evolution: When our ancestors reciprocated favors, they worked together and survived more easily. We’ve thus inherited an impulse to reciprocate any favor made to us.)

**We buy when we feel there’s limited availability.** Because humans always want what they don’t have, if you show in your ad that your product is only available for a limited time or in limited supply, customers will instantly want it. (Shortform note: You could also create a sense of limited access to a product by restricting access even to information about it. You might thus have a bare-bones website with only a field for the customer to enter their email address, where they’ll receive further information. This makes your product seem exclusive and thus appealing.)

#### Show What the Product’s Ultimate, Most Important Benefit Is to Your Customer

The next technique is to **show the product’s ultimate and most important benefit to the consumer** , asserts Whitman. A product’s benefits are the reason customers buy it, so clearly show these in your ad.

Importantly, the _benefit_ of a product is different from its _functions_. Functions are the practical things a product does: clean your windows, for instance, if you sell window cleaner. A _benefit_ is the feeling of happiness, efficiency, or peace the customer hopes to get from the product: the joy of having sparkling windows and knowing these will impress passers-by, for example.

Therefore, in ads, explain to readers how they’ll _benefit_ from your product—how the product will make their lives easier, more efficient, or more enjoyable. Always highlight the greatest benefit to readers first, both in an image and the ad’s headline.

> **How to Uncover Your Product’s Benefits: Customer Interviews**
> 
> Whitman recommends showing what your product’s benefit to the customer is, but how do you know what that benefit is? Arguably, a product’s benefit is in the eye of the beholder, and as a product creator or seller you might not know exactly how consumers derive joy or utility from it.
> 
> One way to determine a product’s benefit is to do customer research. This can be done through customer interviews, email surveys, or focus groups. Interviews are likely most effective in teasing out how a product benefits your customer because the conversational format will likely make consumers more willing to describe their experience using your product in detail. An interview also lets you control the conversation, ensuring the customer doesn’t confuse benefits and functions and simply describe the product’s functions.
> 
> Finally, a customer interview might also help you pinpoint how best to present your product in your ad’s headline and image. For instance, if your customer says the greatest benefit of your window cleaner is the satisfying squeak of a clean window, you might allude to this in the headline or image.

#### Use Ads to Move Customers Through the Five Stages of a Buying Decision

Whitman’s next technique is to **use your ads to move customers through the five stages of getting to know and developing loyalty for a product**. Customers usually increase their engagement with a brand slowly over time, rather than deciding to buy immediately based on a single ad. This process of familiarization can be broken into five steps, and you can tailor your ads to shepherd prospects through these five steps:

  1. Having no familiarity or understanding of the product
  2. Considering buying the product
  3. Wanting more information about your product before buying it 
  4. Buying the product
  5. Becoming loyal to the product



You can use this technique either by building ads that target customers at _all_ stages of the familiarization process or by building a sequence of ads, each of which targets people at a different stage of the process.

> **Other Ways to Envision the Five Steps of Familiarization**
> 
> It’s commonly understood in marketing and advertising that you must move a prospect from unfamiliarity with a product to the desire to buy it. Others have broken down those transitional steps differently from Whitman, however. For instance, in _1-Page Marketing, _Allan Dib says a customer goes through only three steps: awareness, familiarity, and enthusiasm. Creating advertising for only three stages could be more feasible than Whitman’s recommendation to create ads that target five stages.
> 
> Dib further offers advice on _how_ to guide your customer through those steps, which might also be helpful in crafting effective advertising. For instance, to generate awareness of your product, Dib says you must first identify your target market, create a compelling message for that market, and finally decide what the best advertising medium is.
> 
> So for the first ad in your sequence, you’d determine who’s buying your product (perhaps cycling enthusiasts), what message will most resonate with them (how your gear increases their performance), and then decide where to present that message (maybe via an email campaign).

#### Compare Your Product Favorably Against Your Competitor’s

Whitman recommends **using competitors’ inferior products to strengthen the position of yours**. When comparing your product to a competitor’s, be specific about how yours is better: Specificity helps convince the reader you’re right. You can draw a comparison in three steps:

  1. Warn the consumer of the inferior products other brands are trying to sell them. For instance, you might say: “My competitor will try to get you to believe their cheap light bulbs are just as good as ours.”
  2. Offer an unconvincing argument in favor of your competitor’s inferior products. This weak argument encourages prospects to perceive the competitor’s product as unacceptable. You might thus say: “Those cheap light bulbs may be fine if you don’t mind irrevocably damaging your eyes.”
  3. Advocate for your own position and product. This builds on the customer’s existing distaste for the competitor’s product. “But that’s not how we do things at our company. We believe every room should be brightly lit…”



> **What If Your Competition Is Too Good to Compare Against?**
> 
> Whitman advises comparing your product against your competitor’s so that your product appears superior. But what if your competitor is already using these three steps to compare _their_ product to _yours_? Or what if your competitors have a top-notch marketing campaign in place that’s difficult to attack? In _All Marketers Are Liars, _Seth Godin provides some ways to circumnavigate a competitor’s marketing efforts so that you can still compare yourself favorably against them.
> 
> For example, if the most powerful brand on a market has an unshakeable marketing plan, Godin recommends finding a smaller niche within your market and then comparing yourself favorably against the less prominent brands in that niche. Then, you can use the three steps Whitman recommends.

#### Rely More on Either Facts and Figures or Emotion and Positive Association

**Lean on either logic and facts or emotion and positive association, depending on the product** , advises Whitman. People make buying decisions differently, depending on what they’re buying: When purchasing something critical to their livelihoods—a car, a house, and so on—they think logically and based on facts. When contemplating the purchase of something less important—apps, snacks, and so on—they’re guided by emotion.

Therefore, if you sell something important, incorporate statistics, testimonials, scientific evidence, and the like into your ad. If you sell something less important, use colors, imagery, humor, and celebrity endorsements.

However, people rarely make buying decisions based _exclusively_ on either logic or emotion. Even if purchasing something insignificant, humans apply logic to ensure they’re getting their money’s worth. By the same token, humans also make important decisions based on emotion. This means that in every ad, include both logical and emotional arguments to some degree, and simply vary the weight you give them.

> **Quantifying How Much Humans Use Logic and How Much They Use Emotion**
> 
> Whitman argues that consumers _favor_ either logic or emotion in buying decisions, depending on what they’re buying, but that all consumers use _both_ logic and emotion no matter what. In _Way of the Wolf, _Jordan Belfort even goes so far as to quantify how much people use logic and emotion.
> 
> Belfort says that people only use 5 to 10% of their brainpower to form conscious, logical decisions and the other 90+% of their brains to form impressions that lead to emotional decision-making. This stands somewhat in contrast to Whitman’s assertion that people use logic more than emotion when making big decisions. Belfort believes instead that people mostly use emotion to come to a decision but _rationalize_ that decision using logic. It might thus be the case that a homebuyer falls in love with a charming cottage and then rationalizes that love by telling themselves the market is good now, the price is right, and so on.
> 
> To that end, Belfort encourages salespeople—his target audience—to influence a prospect logically using words and emotionally using tonality and body language. You might apply this principle to your advertising by using _copy_ to rationally persuade a customer to buy your product and _images_ to emotionally persuade them to buy.

#### Make Your Message Clear, Specific, and Visual

Whitman insists that you make **your ad copy clear and comprehensible, specific, and image-based**. Let’s look at each of these qualities.

First, your message must be clear: Your audience must understand what your product does and how it will improve their lives, otherwise your ad will have failed at the most basic level to inform your customer about your product. Use simple, concise language, and always use the casual expression of an idea rather than one that sounds more intellectual. For instance, say: “This smart watch will track your health,” rather than: “This wearable tech device will record your physical fitness data.”

(Shortform note: While Whitman’s recommendation to be clear and comprehensible is likely the best approach for most ads, some products may benefit from intentional ambiguity in advertising. Ambiguity creates curiosity and arouses the viewer’s need for answers, making them more likely to seek out further information about the product. Such advertising works especially well in the social media age, where internet users can fuel viral curiosity about a product by talking about it on social platforms.)

Second, specific words and figures are more compelling than vague expressions, so always opt for specificity when possible. You might thus write: “Sell last year’s clothes you’re bored of for up to $100 per item,” rather than, “Sell clothes online.”

(Shortform note: Being specific in your ads may have the additional ethical benefit of forcing you to be completely honest about your product. If you’re specific, you can’t mislead readers with appealing yet vague promises that end up only being half-true. And transparency in ads builds trust in your brand, which benefits your bottom line.)

Finally, you should create vivid images through your writing because when humans are prompted to have an internal experience of something, that experience occupies their thoughts more and thus influences their buying decisions more. You can do this by using strong adjectives and speaking to all five senses, not just sight. Don’t be afraid to be extremely vivid and even dramatic—this will make you stand out from the competition.

(Shortform note: If you’re struggling to craft vivid imagery in your copy, it might be worth considering what _modality_ readers will consume your copy through. A modality, according to Tony Robbins in _Awaken the Giant Within, _is a sense that gives you the most vivid experience, and different people have different modalities, or senses that they favor. Think about what your product does and what modality users of that product might favor—for example, if you’re advertising a candle store, your customers will likely favor smell over movement. Then, write to that modality by using language that’s specific to it: “Our smartwatch will get you sweating,” or “Our candles will bathe you in aromatic bliss.”)

#### Maximize Your Visibility Through Size, Frequency, and Length of Copy

Whitman believes you must **get your ads in front of as many readers as possible by making ads big, frequent, and long**. Whitman first notes that bigger ads garner more attention than small ads, so make your ad as big as you can afford.

Additionally, running ads frequently helps customers get used to your brand, accept it, and feel aligned with it, writes Whitman. Still, don’t overrun the same ad because excessive exposure can make audiences start to feel negatively about your brand and product. Instead, run similar yet slightly different ads that give the audience variety and slightly different arguments in favor of your product.

Finally, write long ad copy because humans associate length and detail of a text with credibility. When an ad has lots of copy and contains many facts, testimonials, or stats, readers believe the ad is credible and the product therefore good.

> **Do the Rules of Size, Frequency, and Length Apply to Digital Advertising?**
> 
> Whitman’s recommendations to make ads big, long, and appear frequently may well work for print advertising, but do these suggestions apply to digital advertising?
> 
> The answer is likely that it depends on the _type_ of digital advertising. There are six types: display ads, social media ads, native ads, search engine ads, video ads, and email marketing. Many consider search engine marketing to be the most effective of these; this is when a search engine result appears on, for instance, the top of a Google search page (with a note that it’s an ad). But in such ads, you’re severely limited in size and scope of what you can write.
> 
> You might make your ad relatively longer than other search engine ads, but you’re still limited to only a few lines of copy. So your ad can’t be particularly large or copy-heavy. However, you can and should run ads frequently. It’s particularly useful to run slightly different ads in digital marketing, not just so you don’t bore customers, but also so you can compare the effectiveness of the ads against each other.

#### Pose Questions in Your Copy to Get Readers Thinking

**Use questions, including rhetorical questions, to prompt audiences to think about your product more than they might otherwise** , counsels Whitman. Rhetorical questions aren’t always effective as selling tools, and some feel they never reliably work. However, Whitman contends that rhetorical questions can encourage audiences to simply spend an additional moment thinking about your product, thus cementing its place in their minds. Literal questions can also make readers want to know the answer to the question and continue reading to find it.

For instance, if you ask the rhetorical question, “Wouldn’t life be better with a bag of Mandy’s BBQ chips?” you prompt your audience to reflect on this question, making them think about your brand for a moment longer, and hopefully helping them recall it when they’re in a buying situation. If you conversely ask a literal question, like: “Do you know what peoples’ favorite chip flavor is?” the reader will want to know the answer and keep reading.

> **Other Types of Questions to Include in Your Copy**
> 
> Whitman mentions two types of questions, rhetorical and literal, but there are other types of questions you can pose to hook your reader. There can be overlap between some of these question types, so you may also consider combining several types into one question. The other question types are:
> 
> **Open-ended questions:** These are questions that demand the customer consider a hypothetical situation or reflect on their feelings about something. An open-ended question might begin with: “Imagine you’re…” You should only use these sparingly because you risk losing the reader’s attention.
> 
> **Yes or No questions:** These are questions that seek to affirm that a reader is following you and adds emphasis to your point. Often, yes or no questions are also rhetorical (“You want to look youthful and vibrant, right?”).
> 
> A good way to ensure that rhetorical questions are as effective as possible is to keep them simple and be conscious of what stage of buying your customers are in (discussed in an earlier section). For example, if you’re writing an ad that seeks to simply get customers to consider buying your skincare product, pose the question: “Wouldn’t it be nice to look ten years younger?” not: “Want to target stubborn crows feet?” The latter question is geared toward people who are already avid skincare users.

#### Use Visuals to Your Advantage

Whitman’s final suggestion to create a good ad is to use visuals effectively. Specifically, this means **having a professional designer do your layout, favoring what’s known as an Ogilvy layout, and using many photos of people.**

Whitman warns that attempting to create an ad layout by yourself can lead to an unappealing ad that loses sales. It’s always better to ask a professional who knows design strategies and best practices to do this for you. However, you should consider asking the designer to use an Ogilvy layout (made famous by David Ogilvy, the “father of advertising”): an ad with a photo in the top two-thirds of the page, a headline beneath this, and finally the ad copy, which starts with a drop cap (an especially large first letter). The photo should be of people because humans are naturally drawn to images of other humans.

(Shortform note: In _Ogilvy on Advertising, _David Ogilvy himself elaborates on guidelines for his proposed layout. First, he says that the photo you choose should suggest a story that piques the reader’s curiosity. Ideally, your photo should only feature a single person because readers prefer images of individuals over images of groups. Second, the reason you should separate image and text is that text laid over images can be difficult to read. And third, a drop-cap can increase readership by 13%, he claims. Considering the specificity of these recommendations, it’s no wonder Whitman recommends hiring a professional to execute them.)
