## Exercise: Chose a Control Mode

The appropriate behavioral control method depends on your circumstances.

* * *

Choose an employee you manage and reflect on one of her tasks. Is she motivated to complete this task by self-interest or group interest? How do you know?

Describe the circumstances she does this task in. What is the complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity (CUA) of her work situation?

Keeping your above answers in mind, should you use free-market forces, contracts, or culture to control the behavior of this employee? Why?
