## 1-Page Summary

In _High Output Management_ , Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel, shares what he’s learned about management over his decades-long career. One of his main insights is that **manufacturing principles, which focus on output and productivity, are very applicable to yet rarely used in management.**

In this summary, you’ll learn:

  * How to increase your managerial output
  * How to increase your managerial productivity
  * How to manage on a larger scale



### Managerial Output

The output of some processes, such as manufacturing, is very obvious—at a factory that makes breakfasts, the output is breakfast. Your own output as a manager, however, is less concrete. **It’s _not_ the output of your own individual work; it’s the output of all the teams you influence.** _Their_ output is determined by the activities you do and how much of an effect—or leverage—these activities have.

Written mathematically:

Your managerial output = team outputs = output of your team + output of teams you influence = (managerial activity #1 × leverage of activity #1) + (managerial activity #2 × leverage of activity #2) + …

Therefore, **you can increase your managerial output by increasing the output of your team or the teams you influence, and/or increasing the value of _your_ activities or _your_ leverage.**

#### Increasing the Output of Teams

To improve the output of your team, you need to choose the management style that will best foster each member’s high performance. The deciding factor regarding which style to use is **task-relevant maturity (TRM)—how educated, experienced, and mentally ready an employee is to do a _particular_ task in particular circumstances.**

  * For example, one Intel sales manager was very successful in the field environment—he had high TRM—and Intel promoted him to a plant environment. However, his TRM in this new environment was low—he didn’t know how to do any of the plant-related tasks.



Here’s how you should manage employees with the following TRM levels:

**Low:** Provide structure and strong guidance on operational values. Give your team detailed directions about exactly how, when, and what needs to be done.

**Medium:** Provide some structure and guidance but expect the team to provide some of it themselves. Instead of managing prescriptively, exchange ideas and communicate.

**High:** Provide minimal structure—the team will provide the bulk of it themselves. Don’t involve yourself with the team’s work; just make sure objectives are clear. This style is advantageous because it allows the manager to delegate to their team members and be confident they will successfully complete the task.

**Always monitor your team, no matter what the TRM level is.** If the TRM changes, adjust your management style, up _or_ down.

#### Managerial Activities

You can also increase your output by choosing to do valuable and/or high-leverage managerial activities:

**1\. Information-gathering** involves collecting data about both the interior and exterior workings of your company (for instance, about customer complaints or team priorities). Do this by having conversations with people both inside and outside the company (competitors, customers, and so on), and by reading written information such as memos. Use both sources and check them against each other—verbal information is quicker to access but often incomplete, and written information is more thorough but slower to reach you.

**2\. Information dissemination** involves supplying your organization and the people you influence with hard facts and also communicating goals, priorities, and preferred methods of doing things. Being informed allows people to do their jobs more efficiently.

**3\. Decision-making** involves either making a decision yourself or helping others make decisions by sharing your opinion, fostering debate, and approving or vetoing ideas. Keep in mind that whoever’s highest in the organizational chart isn’t necessarily the person who has the most hands-on knowledge about a given issue, so ideally choose the decision-maker from the lowest competent level.

**4\. Nudging** is a softer version of decision-making (and a stronger version of information dissemination) in which you influence people but don’t command them.

  * For example, instead of telling someone what decision to make, you might offer an opinion in a meeting about it. 



**5\. Role modeling** is when you share your values and the kind of behavior you want to see in your subordinates by demonstrating them.

**6\. Training** involves personally teaching your employees how to do the tasks they need to be able to perform. You should do this yourself rather than hiring external trainers because it’s an inherently high-leverage activity (you can affect many people at once), and because training works best when it’s tailored to company practices and the instructor is an authoritative role model.

**7\. Motivating** involves creating an environment in which people’s need for status, or more ideally, self-actualization, is unmet (attempting to meet these kinds of needs provides longer-term motivation than meeting other kinds of needs, such as survival needs). If an employee is well-trained and capable of doing her job, the only reason she’s not performing is that she lacks motivation.

  * For example, make work mimic competitive sports because competition is highly motivating. Make up a game, rules, and a way to keep score. For instance, when Intel started keeping track of how many square feet each janitorial team cleaned, everyone’s performance rose because they started competing with each other to win (winning provided a status boost).



**8\. Giving performance reviews** involves improving the performance of your subordinates (not just assessing it). To do this:

  * Determine your expectations.
  * Assess employees’ work to determine if they met expectations.
  * Distill your assessment into broad themes and suggestions for improvement.
  * Honestly deliver the feedback verbally and in a report.



**9\. Hiring** consists of interviewing a candidate and trying to determine from her self-assessment if she’ll be a good fit, as well as talking to references.

**10\. Retaining** involves talking valued employees out of quitting. When a valuable employee decides to quit because she feels unappreciated, as a manager, you have failed. In this situation, immediately speak with the employee to show her she _is_ appreciated. Then, brainstorm ways to keep her at the company, even if it involves transferring her to a different department and no longer working with her yourself.

**11\. Planning** is coming up with actions that need to be done now to affect something in the future. To plan, evaluate your current status (what tasks you have in progress and what capabilities you have left over) and predict if maintaining this status will enable you to meet future demands on you and your time. If your status _won’t_ meet the demand, adjust your planned workflow to make them match up.

#### Leverage

Because an activity’s value is _multiplied_ by leverage, if you increase the leverage of an activity, you can increase your output by a large factor.

  * For example, imagine that in the earlier equation, activity #1 had a value of 10, activity #2 had a value of 20, and the leverage of both was 1, so your output was 30 ((10 × 1) + (20 × 1)). If you can increase the leverage of activity #1 to 5, your output becomes 70 ((10 × 5) + (20 × 1)).



There are three techniques to increase leverage:

**1\. Increase the leverage of existing activities.** You can do this by affecting more people and their work, affecting people for a longer period, facilitating automation, or simplifying work (for example, removing unnecessary steps from workflows).

**2\. Stop doing activities with negative leverage.** Don’t micromanage, waffle, or hold a bad attitude. All of these things will make it more difficult for your reports to get their work done and will decrease their output.

**3\. Adjust the number of reports you have.** For maximum leverage as a manager, you should have 6-8 subordinates (or be part of 6-8 coordinating or planning groups) so you can give them each half a day of your time per week. (Half a day is ideal because it gives you enough time to effectively monitor but not enough time to micromanage.)

### Managerial Productivity

Like output, there’s a formula to describe managerial productivity (how efficient a manager is):

Managerial productivity = managerial output ÷ time = activity ÷ time required for the activity You can improve your productivity using the strategies to improve output (because activity and leverage are part of the equations) and **one additional strategy: Speed up how long it takes you to do your activities.**

To learn how to speed up, we’ll take inspiration from production manufacturing because it uses excellent time management techniques.

First, we’ll look at strategies directly inspired by the three steps of manufacturing. Then, we’ll look at some more general strategies used in manufacturing.

#### Three Steps to Production

There are three steps to production in a factory:

**1\. Process,** which is transforming raw materials into product parts. To determine the fastest, most cost-effective way to produce products in a factory, manufacturers first determine throughput times (how long it takes to prepare individual product parts) and then offset them (start them at staggered times so they’ll all be completed at the same time and ready for assembly). The schedule is arranged around the product part that takes the longest or is the most complicated to make.

Similarly, as a manager, arrange and offset your work schedule (and the schedule of your team) to ensure that all tasks involved in a particular project complete at the same time (in other words, the project deadline).

  * Example #1: If you’re working as a cook at a restaurant that makes breakfast consisting of toast, boiled eggs, and coffee, the limiting step is boiling the egg, which takes the longest at three minutes. You’ll arrange the preparation of all the other parts around the egg.
  * (Shortform example #2: If you’re putting together a poetry anthology, the limiting step is acquiring permission to reproduce the most famous poet’s poems. You should apply for this permission early and then apply for the other permissions as you wait for it to come through.)



**2\. Assembly,** which is attaching the product parts together (or, in a business context, bringing each part of a project together).

**3\. Testing,** which examines the raw materials, parts, or the final product (or, in a business context, project) for flaws. Material gains value as it passes through each production stage (for example a whole breakfast is more valuable than a raw egg). Therefore, you should always try to catch problems at the lowest value stage to save yourself money (scrapping a faulty part is less expensive than scrapping a faulty product). To do this, test at three different points during production:

  1. Upon receipt of raw materials
  2. During the production process
  3. After assembly



In general, **the best way to test is “monitoring,” which involves taking samples and testing them while the rest of the material moves on to the next stage.** If the sample testing turns up a problem, you can stop the rest of the process.

#### Manufacturing Strategies for Efficiency

There are six manufacturing strategies that you can apply to management to improve your efficiency:

**1\. Use indicators** , which are measurements that tell manufacturers (or managers) about what’s going on in the production process (or administrative process) and predict or provide information about output. To choose which indicators to pay attention to, ask yourself what information you want to know first-thing every day to head off potential problems.

  * For example, you might want to know how many people you have in the office. If you’re short-staffed today, to meet your goals, you might need to call in extra help or take people off the less important jobs to cover the most important ones.



**2\. Forecast output.** Most manufacturers predict how many orders they’re going to get and build enough inventory to satisfy their predictions (as opposed to building only after receiving an order, which results in long wait times for a customer). As a manager, you can forecast too—predict demands on your time and plan accordingly.

**3\. Use proven workflows.** Manufacturers don’t waste time coming up with a new way to do something if there’s already a good existing way. Don’t reinvent the wheel as a manager either.

**4\. Batch.** All processes include set-up time, and if you can do all the activities that require the same set-up together, you only have to spend the set-up time once.

  * For example, it requires some time to get into the right mindset to read reports. Therefore, once you’re in the mindset, read all the reports at once.



**5\. Don’t overload capacity.** Overloads might cause bottlenecks and materials might have to be aborted at a higher-value stage. To avoid overloads as a manager, refuse projects you don’t have time for.

**6\. Distribute workload.** Factories try to evenly distribute their workload over time, which managers can benefit from too. The main threat to an even managerial workload is interruptions because they unexpectedly increase workload. To manage interruptions:

  * Prepare standard responses to common questions. 
  * Keep the data you learn from indicators handy so you can use it to quickly answer questions.
  * Schedule time for questions.



#### Meetings as a Time-Management Tool

Meetings, like manufacturing strategies, can be an effective time-management tool. Meetings are a medium in which you can do managerial activities, many of which need to be carried out in person.

There are two types of meetings, and if you use your meeting time _perfectly_ , you’ll only ever need to hold the first kind:

**1\. Process-oriented.** The goal is to**** exchange expertise and information. These meetings take place according to a regular schedule. There are three subcategories:

  * **One-on-ones.** The goal is to exchange information and maintain relationships. The attendees are you and a single subordinate.
  * **Staff meetings.** The goal is to facilitate peer interaction, learn the dynamics of your subordinates, and exchange information in both directions. The attendees are you and all of your subordinates. 
  * **Operation reviews.** The goal is to facilitate learning and connect people who wouldn’t normally interact, such as people who are too far apart in the organization to attend the same staff meetings. The attendees are managers, presenters, and an audience.



These meetings save time because they allow you to pre-empt problems. If an attendee sees a potential problem and alerts you right away, you have time to address it before it becomes a larger issue.

  * (Shortform example: If one of your subordinates is having trouble with her computer and tells you right away, you have time to order and receive a new one _before_ the old one breaks.)



**2\. Mission-oriented.** The goal of these meetings is to solve a problem by making a decision. In theory, these meetings should never be called because all problems are preempted in the process-oriented meetings. In practice, however, even if things operate well, about 80% of problems will be handled in process-oriented meetings and the remaining in mission-oriented meetings.

### Running a Company

Managing a whole organization, as opposed to a team, involves two elements:

#### Element #1: Organizational Structures

Organizational structures are arrangements of the organizational chart: for instance, they show which unit in the business does what, and how these units work together (if they do at all).

There are three organizational structures:

**1\. Functional.** In this centralized structure, individual business units are only responsible for their unit-specific tasks. Any function that they share with another unit (for example, human resources), is handled by a functional group that handles the shared function for all units. The advantages of this structure are economies of scale, the opportunity to share expertise (experts can share their knowledge across the whole company, not just their unit), and units having the ability to focus on their work, not administration. The disadvantages are increased bureaucracy when trying to get help from functional groups, and resource competition between the distinct units.

**2\. Mission-oriented.** In this decentralized structure, every business unit is responsible for both its unit-specific tasks and all the other tasks that come with running a business, such as hiring, purchasing, offices, and so on. Each unit reports to a regional office or the corporate executive office. The only advantage of this structure is speed of responsiveness; units don’t have to wait on other departments to do anything. The disadvantages are the inability to collaborate with other units and redundancy (for example, each unit has an HR department when really, the company only needs one).

**3\. Hybrid.** This structure is a combination of functional and mission-oriented. Individuals can report to multiple supervisors and be part of multiple organizational charts, which allows them to fulfill _both_ functional and mission-oriented responsibilities.

  * For example, Intel has four functional units (sales, technology development, administration, and manufacturing) and three business units (component, microcomputer, and system). All of the units report to the executive office. 



Ideally, the hybrid structure harnesses all the advantages of each system and dispenses with the disadvantages. According to Grove’s law, as businesses grow, they’ll eventually need to transition to this structure because as they get bigger, they have more things to keep track of and need the advantages of a functional structure as well as those of the mission-oriented approach.

#### Element #2: Control Methods

**There’s no universally optimal way to control people’s behavior** —the most effective approach always depends on the circumstances.

There are three different control modes applicable to the workplace:

**1\. Free-market forces.** In this mode, people’s behavior is controlled by price (whoever is buying wants to pay the lowest price, and whoever is selling wants to sell at the highest price possible) and self-interest. No management is needed because everyone openly does whatever is in their best interest.

  * (Shortform example: Buying a car is managed by free-market forces—the salesperson wants to make as much money as possible, and the buyer wants to spend as little as possible.)



**2\. Contracts.** In this mode, people’s behavior is controlled by mutually agreed-upon guidelines that outline what each party will do to what standards and who has the right to monitor work.**** Contracts are useful when exchanging goods or services that don’t have a defined value, like the contribution of an individual engineer. Management _is_ needed in this method—management helps set and enforce the contract guidelines.

**3\. Culture.** In this last mode, people’s behavior is controlled by culture—people believe and trust that the whole group shares ways of doing things, values, and goals. Culture is a useful control method when it would be impossible to define dollar values of or contracts surrounding behavior. Management’s role is to develop and establish culture by explaining ways of doing things, values, and goals and also visibly demonstrating them.
