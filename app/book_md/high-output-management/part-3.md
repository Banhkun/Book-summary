## Part 3: Running a Company | Chapter 9: How to Organize a Company

In the previous two parts, you learned how to improve your managerial output and productivity by adjusting your activities, leverage, and time management to improve the performance of your team. Now, we’ll look at how to improve the performance and output of an entire organization by effectively structuring and wielding control.

As organizations grow, they have more to keep track of and they often benefit from restructuring. There are three organizational structures that you can use to structure your company:

### Structure #1: Functional

In this centralized structure, **individual business units are only responsible for their unit-specific tasks.** Any function that they share with another unit (for example, human resources), is handled by a group that handles the shared function for all units.

There are advantages to this structure:

  * **Economies of scale.** It’s cheaper to share resources or buy in bulk. For example, Intel requires expensive computer equipment. It’s more economical to buy one machine that all the business units share rather than each unit buying their own equipment and only using it occasionally.
  * **Shared expertise.** Knowledge managers can share their expertise across the whole company, not just their unit, which gives them much more leverage.
  * **Focus.** Business units can focus on their work rather than what they need to do their work (personnel, equipment, and so on) since dedicated departments will deal with acquiring resources.



There are also disadvantages:

  * **Large workloads.** Functional groups have to meet the needs of many units.
  * **Bureaucracy.** There are additional administrative layers that take time to work through.
  * **Resource competition.** Since business units don’t have free and unlimited access to their own resources, there’s sometimes conflict over the shared resources if two units need something at the same time.
  * **Distance.** Because units focus only on their work, departments such as engineering and manufacturing tend to be cut off from the marketplace because their work never requires dealing directly with customers. As a result, they lose touch with what customers want.



### Structure #2: Mission-Oriented

In this decentralized structure, **every individual business unit is responsible for both its unit-specific tasks and all other tasks** that come with running a business, such as hiring, purchasing, offices, and so on**.** Each unit is responsible for its own hiring, purchasing, offices, and so on, and each unit reports to a regional office or the corporate executive office.

**There’s only one advantage to this structure, and that’s speed of responsiveness** —each unit can quickly respond to local conditions, such as bad weather that slows down delivery at one franchise location. Speed is very important—the point of businesses is to respond to their environment.

The disadvantages of this structure are:

  * **Inefficiency.** There’s redundancy between business units—for example, each one has to set up its own HR department.
  * **Weak company-wide performance.** Since every unit acts almost as its own company, the units are disconnected and can’t easily work together.



### Structure #3: Hybrid

**This structure is a combination of mission-oriented and functional.** Ideally, it harnesses all the advantages of each system and dispenses with the disadvantages. Companies can and should shift closer to and farther from each pole as they acquire new resources and adapt.

  * For example, if a company buys a new piece of equipment, it might shift towards centralization because all the business units would benefit from it. 



Grove’s Law states that **any large organization that has a common business purpose will ultimately move to a hybrid structure.** This is because as businesses get bigger, they have more things to keep track of and need the advantages of a functional structure as well as those of the mission-oriented approach.

  * Example #1: Intel has four functional units (sales, technology development, administration, and manufacturing) and three business units (component, microcomputer, and system). All of the units report to the executive office.
  * Example #2: Conglomerates don’t have a common business purpose, so they tend to be mission-oriented, though the companies that make up the conglomerates tend to be hybrid.



The major challenges of the hybrid structure are how to allocate resources between business units and how to handle resource-related conflicts. Middle managers are perfectly poised to solve these issues—there are enough of them to manage the workload of allocation (corporate managers aren’t numerous enough) and they’re close to those who need the resources to know how much each unit needs (central allocators are too far away to accurately predict demand).

### Reporting to Multiple Supervisors

Another way to ensure the smooth running of large organizations is to have people report to two managers, or for people to be part of more than one organizational chart. We’ll look at both cases below:

#### Case #1: Dual Reporting

Dual reporting is when someone reports to more than one manager, who can be an individual or a group. Typically, **one of the managers supervises the technical aspects of the job** (for example, how to manufacture a computer) and **the other supervises the general aspects** (for example, showing up on time).

  * (Shortform example: A publicist who excels at her job is promoted to marketing manager. In this role, she supervises other publicists. As she gets promoted again and again, she acquires subordinates who aren’t publicists, and they likely know more about their jobs than she does. Therefore, she can’t help with the technical side of things so these subordinates need someone else to turn to.)



Dual reporting is advantageous because:

  * It allows for the hybrid structure. If all supervisors had to have technical knowledge in the same field as their subordinates, there would be no way to have general managers of departments. 
  * The technical supervisor can be a peer group rather than a single person. (For example, a group of engineers who are all supervised by a general manager might get together to help each other with the particular challenges of engineering work.) There are two criteria for peer group supervision:
    * People in peer groups must let the group make decisions they’d normally make individually.
    * The organization needs a robust culture so everyone is on the same page about how things are done.



The disadvantage of dual reporting is that organizational charts become more ambiguous, and most people don’t like ambiguity. However, it’s a necessary evil. When an organization gets big and complicated enough, dual reporting is the only way for an organization to function effectively.

**Dual reporting shouldn’t create bureaucracy or busywork**(work that takes up time but doesn’t produce anything of much value). Keep applying the factory principles: work simplification and regular evaluations of processes to make sure they make common sense.

#### Case #2: Multi-Plane

In a multi-plane organization, a given employee is part of multiple unrelated organizational charts. People don’t have to keep the same role in all planes—they can be a supervisor in one plane and a subordinate in the other. There’s no confusion between roles and they don’t conflict with each other.

This is advantageous because:

1\. People can join transitory teams to quickly solve problems.

2\. People can participate in more planes.

  * For example, on one plane, Grove is at the top of the chart as the president of Intel. On another chart, he reports to the chairman of a strategic planning group as a member. This allows him, as a leader, to have time to participate in things without having to be in charge of them (being in charge is a huge time commitment).



Often, many of the planar structures are transitory teams—task forces or informal groups that only exist for as long as the problem they’re created to solve.
