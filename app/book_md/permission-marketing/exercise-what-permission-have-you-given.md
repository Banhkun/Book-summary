## Exercise: What Permission Have You Given?

Reflect on the permission marketing campaigns you encounter to gain a deeper understanding of how the strategy works. Then, use this reflection as inspiration to design your own permission marketing campaign.

* * *

List a few permission marketing channels you subscribe to as a consumer. (For example, you may regularly receive emails from your local movie theater advertising upcoming events, follow an Instagram account that posts photos from an online travel magazine, and get push notifications from the app for your favorite fast food restaurant alerting you to limited-time offers.)

Think back to the time you initially signed up to receive each of these permission marketing messages. What freebies or other incentives did the brands give you in exchange? (For example, the fast food app may have given you a free meal for downloading it.)

What incentives did the brands give you to keep receiving messages? How did this repeated marketing influence or change your behavior? (For example, the fast food app may allow you to earn points redeemable for free food every time you watch an advertisement or make a purchase. Perhaps this influenced you to habitually eat there once a week after going to the gym.)

Using these examples as inspiration, design a hypothetical permission marketing campaign of your own. Pick a business, plan incentives, and identify how you want to influence consumersâ€™ behavior. (For example, if you want to sell custom jewelry, you may offer an exclusive one-time discount to people who sign up for your email list and send them photos of your most interesting custom work to get them to continue reading your emails. You hope this will get them to purchase a full-price piece from you the next time they need to give a gift.)
