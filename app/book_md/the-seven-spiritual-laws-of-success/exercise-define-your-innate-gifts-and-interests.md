## Exercise: Define Your Innate Gifts and Interests

According to Chopra, goals that align with your innate gifts and interests are vital to experiencing satisfaction and success in your life.

* * *

Write down two things that you’re naturally good at and enjoy doing. Consider times when you feel engaged in what you’re doing and don’t feel like you have to make an effort. (This could be anything from cooking a meal to creating a spreadsheet.)

Describe what you specifically enjoy about each of these activities. What parts feel the most satisfying? (For example, if you’re good at cooking, you might enjoy creating recipes more than preparing a meal.)

List several ways that you can create more opportunities to focus on these activities. (For example, if you enjoy cooking, you might organize your time so that you can cook every evening or make plans to invite friends over for a home-cooked meal every weekend.)

Write down two ways you can use your natural gifts and interests to benefit others. (For example, you could make homemade meals for a family with a newborn baby, contribute your culinary skills to homeless shelters, or create a blog to share your recipes.)
