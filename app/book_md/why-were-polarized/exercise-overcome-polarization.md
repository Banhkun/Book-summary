## Exercise: Overcome Polarization

Klein writes that to overcome polarization, you first have to recognize how politicians are crafting their appeals to activate some part of your identity and get you outraged at some perceived group of “others.”

* * *

Have you ever been confronted by a political message that you felt was targeted toward you because you belonged to some particular identity group? Describe the emotions it evoked.

Do you feel your political beliefs are based more on a set of ideological or policy preferences, or do you feel your primary political motivation is to defend your community against some group of outsiders? Explain your thinking.

Do you find it difficult to maintain friendships or personal relationships with people who hold different political beliefs from you? If so, describe why this is the case. If not, describe how you’re able to overcome political disagreement to forge these connections.
