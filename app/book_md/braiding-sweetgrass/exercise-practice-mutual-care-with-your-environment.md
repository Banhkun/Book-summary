## Exercise: Practice Mutual Care With Your Environment

Kimmererâ€™s stories remind us that the well-being of humans and the well-being of our surrounding ecosystem are closely linked.

What are some interactions with the natural world that bring you joy or nourishment? This could include things like hiking, gardening, bird-watching, picnicking at a local park, or picking wild berries.

Write down one specific way that you can give a gift back to a part of the natural world listed in the previous question. Make it something you can do this week and something you can do regularly. Remember that gifts to the environment can range from advocacy, to expressing gratitude, to directly tending the land.
