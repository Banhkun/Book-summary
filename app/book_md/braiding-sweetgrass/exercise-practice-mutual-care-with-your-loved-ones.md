## Exercise: Practice Mutual Care With Your Loved Ones

Mutual care is a way to tend to your own needs as well as the needs of others.

* * *

Write down a few ways that you _enjoy_ caring for others. For example, do you like sharing food with people, helping with projects around the house, organizing social events, or volunteering in your community?

Write one specific action you can realistically do every week to help a loved one (or group) in a way that is mutually beneficial.

How might practicing regular mutual care improve your relationships with others?
