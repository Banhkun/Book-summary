## Exercise: Define a System

Pick a system that you want to understand better. If you canâ€™t think of one, here are suggestions: your employer; your favorite store; your political party; an organism.

* * *

What are the major elements of the system?

What are the key interconnections between these elements? Think about physical interconnections, as well as intangible ones based on transferring information.

What are the major purposes of the system? Remember, look at what the system actually does, not what its stated purpose is.
