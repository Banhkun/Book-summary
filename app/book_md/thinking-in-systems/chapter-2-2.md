## Chapter 2-2: Two-Stock Systems

So far we’ve just focused on one-stock systems. In the models, we haven’t worried too much about where the inputs came from and how much there were—the population model assumes infinite food, the thermostat model assumes infinite gas to the furnace.

But in the real world, the inputs have to come from somewhere. In a system model, the inflow into a stock comes from another stock, which is finite. This finite stock causes a constraint on growth—the population can’t grow forever, and the economy can’t grow forever.

We’ll explore this here with two system models, one with a non-renewable stock (oil mining) and one with a renewable stock (commercial fishing). Changing whether the stock is renewable changes the implications of how growth ends.

### Renewable Stock and a Non-Renewable Stock

Consider a reservoir of oil underground. The stock of oil is finite. There is an outflow as the oil is mined. (Shortform note: There is also a very slow inflow of generation of fossil fuels through geological processes, but this occurs over millions of years and is so slow that it’s irrelevant in this situation.)

The company that decides to mine this oil reservoir is a system. The system looks a lot like the system of the economy we just discussed: there is a capital stock (for example, building a mining rig), an inflow of investment in a reinforcing loop, and an outflow of depreciation in a balancing loop.

These two systems are connected by one element—the profit from the oil that is mined. Simplistically, the more oil that is mined, the higher the total profit, which is reinvested into the capital stock; this higher capital stock then mines the resource at a faster rate. In this simplistic system, the capital stock would just grow exponentially, mining faster and faster until the stock is depleted.

But we’ll add one complication to this system—**the oil gets harder to extract as the stock goes down**. In the real world, this is true—the oil gets deeper and needs more drilling to access, or it becomes more dilute and more costly to purify.

This builds a more complicated feedback loop that ties together the two systems:

  * The more oil that is extracted, the more the profit, and the more reinvestment into capital.
  * The more capital, the faster oil is extracted, and the lower the stock.
  * The lower the stock, the more costly it becomes to extract oil, and the lower the profit.
  * The lower the profit, the lower the capital investment rate.



This feedback loop leads to a predictable behavior of the system:

  * While the oil is easy to extract, profit grows and is reinvested in capital. 
  * At a certain point when the stock gets low enough, the marginal barrel of oil becomes unprofitable to extract. 
  * Since profits have dwindled, it no longer makes sense to reinvest in capital stock. The stock depreciates over time, which causes the extraction rate to fall.
  * The stock is not depleted to zero—a certain amount of oil remains in the ground, too costly to mine.



Oil companies clearly know this behavior, so before an oil field runs out, they’ve already invested in discovering new oil sources elsewhere.

#### Implications of the System

Now that you understand the behavior of the system, nudges to different points in the system can influence its behavior:

  * New technology can increase the efficiency of extracting oil, thus decreasing the cost. This can allow a reservoir that was unprofitable 40 years ago to become profitable again. (Shortform note: This is what hydraulic fracturing technology, or “fracking,” enabled—a way to extract natural gases that were previously unprofitable to capture.)
  * So far, we have been fixing the price per oil barrel. In reality, price fluctuates. 
    * If the price of oil suddenly skyrockets, oil mines that were unprofitable at a certain cost of mining can become profitable again. 
    * In contrast, if the price of oil plummets, many oil fields shut down, since the cost of operating exceeds the price of oil they extract. (Shortform note: When oil prices plummet, say due to price wars between foreign oil producers, it might sound good for the average consumer. But it’s bad for the domestic energy industry (oil rigs need to shut down and workers are laid off), and it’s also bad for investment in alternative energy development (there is less incentive to develop alternatives when fossil fuels are cheap).)



The book explores a final consequence of this system—**increasing the size of the stock does not proportionately increase the time that the resource lasts. If the size of the oil reservoir doubled, the reservoir would not last for double the amount of time.** This is because the **capital stock grows exponentially** —even if the global oil reservoir were instantaneously doubled, at a capital growth rate of 5% per year, the peak extraction time would only be extended by 14 years (recall the rule of 72 from earlier). And the higher capital stock grows, the steeper the plummet when the stock becomes depleted (in real terms, these are jobs that disappear and communities that are battered).

(Shortform note: While the book steers away from explicit political statements, the implication is that the more we reinvest in harvesting a nonrenewable resource like fossil fuels and avoid developing alternatives, the higher the capital stock and extraction rate will grow, and the steeper the fall will be when the resource depletes.)

### Two Renewable Stocks

We also depend on stocks that are renewable, that replenish themselves after we harvest from them. Examples include lumber from trees we can replant, and farming animals and plants that we can replenish.

Let’s consider the example of fishing from the ocean. The extraction system of capital stock is the same as with oil mining, except instead of oil rigs, the capital stock represents fishing vessels. The capital stock has an inflow of reinvestment, and an outflow of depreciation. The capital stock determines the harvest rate of the fish.

However, the stock it is harvesting from is now renewable—the fish population has a runaway loop that creates an inflow of more fish.

![thinking-in-systems-renewable-resource.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/thinking-in-systems-renewable-resource.png)

There are a few nuances to the situation:

  * Like oil, the lower the fish population, the more expensive it becomes to catch them, and the less profitable fishing is.
  * Below a certain stock level, the regeneration of fish may stop—when there are too few fish, they find it harder to find each other and mate. This can cause extinction of a species.



Depending on how the fishing industry behaves, we can arrive at very different system outcomes.

#### Outcome 1: Dynamic Equilibrium

The fishing industry can balance its harvest rate so that it matches the inflow rate of fish. The fish population is held at a constant stock level.

This also requires that the industry constrain its level of capital stock to be steady. It reinvests in capital stock only to balance the rate of depreciation, thus keeping the harvest rate steady. If it invested any more, the capital stock would rise, and the harvest rate would increase beyond the replenishment rate of the population. This leads to the next system outcome.

#### Outcome 2: Overfishing, with Oscillations

Here, the industry’s harvesting rate exceeds the replenishment rate of the population. Oscillations appear because there is a natural feedback loop at work:

  * For some time, the harvest rate increases and reinvestment increases, thus decreasing the fish stock.
  * As the fish stock decreases, it becomes more costly to farm fish. The inflow of reinvestment into capital stock decreases, and the capital stock level decreases due to depreciation.
  * As the stock decreases, the harvest rate decreases, allowing the fish to replenish itself.
  * As the fish stock rises, fishing gradually becomes more profitable again, thus encouraging more reinvestment, and restarting the oscillation cycle.



As with the car manager on her car lot, oscillations appear in the system due to delays. It takes time for the fishing industry to respond to a declining fish population by reducing investment, and it takes time to reinvest once fishing is good again.

This might not be a deliberate malicious action by the industry—a new fishing technology like deep-sea fishing nets may increase fishing efficiency and reduce costs. However, the oscillations have real human impacts—due to the long times it takes to replenish a fish population, this might introduce cycles extending over decades, which in turn affect jobs and communities.

#### Outcome 3: Overfishing to Extinction

Here, the industry harvests the fish population beyond the point of replenishment. When there are too few fish in the sea, they don’t find each other and they can’t reproduce enough to overcome the fishing rate.

What happens is a wipeout of the fish population, which in turn destroys the fishing industry. Without careful management, the industry may, without knowing it, drive itself out of business.

A few factors make extinction more likely:

  * External factors like pollution may harm the population’s reproduction rate. This raises the critical point below which replenishment is no longer possible.
  * If there are long delays in recognizing a dwindling resource stock, and in slowing capital growth in response, the capital stock can grow too quickly and overwhelm the resource.



### Questions to Understand a System

We’ve seen a series of system models and connected them to real-life situations. You might now see the benefit of systems-level thinking—it can clarify a situation and how it is likely to unfold in the future.

As you try to view the world with a systems lens, these three lines of questioning will help you more accurately understand the system:

**1\. What are the driving factors of the system? Would the driving factors affect the system as described?**

  * Is the model good? Does it reflect the actual dynamics of the system?



**2\. What is causing the driving factors?**

  * Are there feedback loops at work? Surely the cause influences the effect, but does the effect influence the cause?
  * What other factors external to the system affect the driving factors? 
    * For a population’s birth rate and death rate, might economics, social trends, and medical technology be involved?



**3\. How likely are the driving factors to unfold as predicted?**

  * This is guessing the future, which is inherently inaccurate. But you can weigh the likelihood of different possibilities, and simulate the future in those different scenarios.
