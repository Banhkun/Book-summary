## Introduction: Seeing Things as Systems

What is a system? **A system is 1) a group of things that 2) interact to 3) produce a pattern of behavior.**

Many things in the world operate as systems.

  * The human liver is a group of cells that interact to detoxify the blood, among other functions. The liver is, in turn, part of the larger system of the human body.
  * A football team consists of a group of players on the field, each with a specific role that interacts with the others. The team also consists of coaches, support staff, and fans.
  * Within the system of a corporation, people, machines, and information work together to achieve the corporation’s goals. This corporation then takes place within the larger system of the economy.



Systems may look different on the surface, but if they have the same underlying structure, they tend to behave similarly.

  * For example, consider the simple system of a bathtub. There is a spout that adds water to the system, and a drain that removes water from the system. If the spout adds water faster than it drains, the bathtub will fill and the water level will rise. Conversely, if the drain removes water faster than the spout adds water, the bathtub will empty.
  * Now consider the system of the world population. From a system point of view, it looks similar to the bathtub. The birth rate adds people to the population; death removes people from the population. If the birth rate exceeds the mortality rate, the population will rise. If people die faster than they are born, the population will fall.



In reality, if you look deeper, the world population is a much more complex system—it’s subject to the economy, health science, and politics, each of which is its own complicated system. But from a certain simplified vantage point, the bathtub and the world population behave similarly.

Understanding the underlying system and how it behaves may be the best way to change the system.

### Cause and Effect Isn’t Enough

When we try to explain events in the world, we tend to look for simple cause and effect relationships.

  * An oil company is blamed for greedily driving up the price of oil.
  * When you get sick, you blame the cold virus for attacking your body.
  * Drug addiction is blamed on the weak fortitude of the people addicted to drugs.



This simplicity is reassuring in some ways. Turn this knob, and you solve the problem—easy. In turn, it becomes easy to blame people who do not turn the knob the way you want it to be turned.

However, **reality tends to be more complex than simple cause and effect relationships, because they are a product of complicated systems**. Systems consist of a large set of components and relationships; a system’s behavior is not the result of a single outside force, but rather the result of how the system is set up.

  * The oil company’s actions could not cause global oil prices to rise, if the system didn’t _allow_ it to exert this control. This relates to how readily people consume oil, the lack of viable energy alternatives to oil, and national pricing policies. All these system properties make economies vulnerable to oil suppliers.
  * A flu virus could not make you sick if your body did not create the conditions that allowed it to thrive. The virus is not attacking you—it is interacting with the system of your body.
  * Drug addicts participate in a system that includes drug sellers who want to make money; governments that make drugs illegal and enforce laws with police; nonaddicts who influence how society balances punishing criminals versus rehabilitating them.



When viewed from this system lens, **causing change is much more difficult than applying a single cause and expecting an effect**. It requires an upheaval of the system itself, with all its components and connections.

  * You cannot neutralize an oil company’s power over an economy without also changing how people and companies consume oil and the availability of viable alternatives to oil.
  * You cannot eradicate drug addiction without also changing the laws around drugs, the economic incentives for drug distribution, and the mindset of the voting public.



**Without understanding the system that produces a problem, you cannot design effective solutions that solve the problem.** Indeed, many “solutions” have worsened the problem because they ignored how the system was set up.

**This book will teach you to be a systems thinker.**

  * First, you’ll learn the definition of a system and how a system is set up.
  * Then, you’ll see the “systems zoo”—a variety of examples of systems and how they behave.
  * Finally, you’ll learn why systems often behave unexpectedly and common problems in changing systems.



As a systems thinker, you’ll begin to see systems everywhere, and you’ll look at the world in a new way. In so doing, you’ll be more effective at restructuring systems to achieve the outcome you want.
