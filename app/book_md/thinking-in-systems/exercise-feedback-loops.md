## Exercise: Feedback Loops

Think about everyday systems and how feedback loops affect them.

* * *

Can you think of any decision you make where a feedback loop is _not_ involved? What is it?

Think harder—in what way does what you’re deciding about influence what you decide?

Think of a recent time where you blamed a problem on something. Phrase it as “A caused B.” (Try not to think about a single person making a mistake, but rather about a system-level problem, such as a political or societal issue.)

Now invert the situation. Is it possible that B caused A? How could this be true?
