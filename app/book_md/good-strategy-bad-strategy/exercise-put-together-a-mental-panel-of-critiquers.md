## Exercise: Put Together a Mental Panel of Critiquers

To avoid becoming committed to a decision that may not be the best choice, test it out by “vetting” it through a mental panel of critiquers made up of people you know well and whose opinions you value.

* * *

Make a list of three to five people whose opinions you trust and who have distinctive personalities and views on the world. (Think of people whose reactions you’d be able to predict if you asked for their opinions on world events or business decisions.)

Think of a problem you or your organization faces and write down the solution you are considering to address this problem.

Now, “vet” your solution through your mental panel of judges. How might each of your virtual critiquers respond to your idea? (For instance, what shortcomings might they point out? What opportunities might they see possible?)

Did your mental conversations change your perspective on your solution? Did it open up new insights? How or how not?
