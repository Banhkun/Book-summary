## Introduction

**Good strategy is the effective application of strength against weakness;** strength applied either to your own organization’s weakness, to fix it, or to your rival’s weakness, to give you a competitive edge. Good strategy recognizes the true nature of challenges and finds ways to overcome them. _Bad_ strategy leaves you blind to your organization’s challenges and chases unattainable goals without a workable plan. Unfortunately, many people misunderstand what makes good strategy and end up publishing vague statements of lofty but directionless goals instead of actionable, focused plans that will propel their organization to success.

Richard Rumelt is one of the world’s foremost thinkers on strategy, having guided organizations ranging from small, entrepreneurial start-ups to large, multinational conglomerates, as well as several governments and the U.S. Department of Defense. In _Good Strategy Bad Strategy_ , he lays out the essential components of good strategy and the faulty thinking behind bad strategy. He also describes specific and measurable techniques for designing a strong, focused strategy that gives your organization the best chance of success.
