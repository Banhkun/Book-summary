## Exercise: Use the Success Over Time Tools

Reflect on how you might implement the Success Over Time Philosophy tools.

* * *

Recall the five tools for achieving success over time (building momentum, cultivating good habits, eliminating incomplete tasks, celebrating your wins, and reflecting on your past experiences). Write down the two tools you currently use the least.

Consider the first tool you’ve selected. What challenges do you encounter, either emotional or practical, due to not using this tool? How would using it improve your life?

What’s one step you can take to put this tool into action today? (For example, if you struggle with completing things, you might make a to-do list of all of your incomplete tasks so that you can start to address them.)

Now turn your attention to the second tool you’ve selected. What challenges do you encounter, either emotional or practical, due to not using this tool? How would using it improve your life?

What’s one step you can take to put this tool into action today?
