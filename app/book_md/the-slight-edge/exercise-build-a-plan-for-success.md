## Exercise: Build a Plan for Success

Reflect on the two steps for actualizing your goals using the Success Over Time philosophy.

* * *

Write down a goal that youâ€™ve been meaning to achieve for a while (for example, the goal to lose weight).

If you were to make a vision board for your goal, what would it look like? (For example, what images or words would you include to represent your goal and your ideal vision of success?)

What is a basic plan you can follow to achieve your goal? Write down the first three steps you can take to get started.

How can you keep yourself accountable to your plan? (For example, is there a friend you can regularly check in with and inform of your progress?)
