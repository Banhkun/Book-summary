## Habit #4: Increase Your Efficiency

Many people claim there aren’t enough hours in the day to get their work done _and_ focus on their personal life. However, for most people, their problem isn’t time. It’s _inefficiency_. **Increased efficiency helps you focus on the important things in your life and maintain your work-life balance.** This increases your performance by helping you achieve the goals you care about, lowering your stress levels, and giving you time to relax. There are three factors that impact your efficiency:

  * **Goals:** Set clear and challenging goals that give you the motivation to work effectively.
  * **Energy:** Ensure you have the energy to get through your day happily and healthily.
  * **Focus:** Focus on the tasks that are important to you.



### The Benefits of Efficiency, and the Risks of Its Absence

| **With Efficiency** | **Without Efficiency**  
---|---|---  
**Work-Life Balance** | **Efficient people have a strong work-life balance.** They use their work time wisely and spend their personal time focusing on things they want to.  | **Inefficient people have a poor work-life balance.** They don’t use their work time wisely and often spend their personal time worrying about work.   
**Stress Levels** | **Efficient people have lower levels of stress.** They know what tasks are important and organize their time to ensure those tasks are completed in a timely manner.  | **Inefficient people have higher levels of stress.** They don’t know what tasks are important and, therefore, can’t organize their time accordingly.   
**Achievement** | **Efficient people feel that their work is helping them achieve their goals.** Every task has a purpose. With almost every completed task, they feel determined and focused on their long-term objectives.  | **Inefficient people don’t feel that their work is helping them achieve their goals.** In fact, they often feel like their work is getting them nowhere. Buried in “busy work,” they get overwhelmed and frustrated by their daily routine.   
  
### How to Increase Your Efficiency

Efficiency requires planning, reflection, and focus. To find important tasks and avoid distractions, you need to master your workflow and stay calm and collected. To do so, **chart your work-life balance, take a break, then develop some advanced practices.**

#### Chart Your Work-Life Balance

**People often claim their life is “out of balance” without knowing what balance looks like.** Charting your work-life balance gives you a clearer picture of what your life looks like when you feel “in balance” and “out of balance.” This exercise _doesn’t_ focus on _hours._ Instead, it focuses on the amount of happiness and satisfaction you’re feeling in the various areas of your life.

**To chart your work-life balance:**

  * Divide your life into 10 categories: family, friends, well-being, work, significant other, hobbies, exploration, religion/spirituality, emotions, and money.
  * Pick a day of the week (preferably a weekend if you work a typical work week).
  * On that day, rate your happiness on a scale from 1-10 in each of the 10 areas.
  * Once you’ve finished your ratings, write down your goals in each of the 10 areas.
  * Repeat this process every week.



**Think about which areas of your life are bringing you satisfaction, and which areas need more focus and attention.** Focusing on how you feel about each area instead of the amount of time you’re investing in it shows you that time doesn’t necessarily correlate with happiness or contentment. For example, you could spend only four hours a day at work and still feel overwhelmed or frustrated. Conversely, you could spend only four hours a day with your family and feel happy and content.

#### Take a Break

Working straight through your day isn’t the best way to be efficient. Though it sounds counterintuitive, **taking 5-10 minute breaks every hour increases your productivity by refreshing your mind and body.** This allows you to return to work with more focus and a clearer head.

To effectively take breaks:

  * **Set a timer for 45-60 minutes.** Every time it goes off, step away from your computer. You could take a lap around the office, step outside for a moment, or talk to a colleague. 
  * **Take your lunch break.** When you can avoid it, don’t eat lunch at your desk. Take that time to get away from your work for a few minutes and refresh.
  * **Stand up and move.** Don’t just sit at your desk to take your breaks. Moving around lets your body release any tension you may have built up from sitting at your computer.
  * **Stay away from social media and messages.** Especially if you’re on a computer all day, use your break to get away from screens. This is time for you to focus on yourself, not other people.



#### Advanced Practices

Once you’ve completed the first two steps, you can move on to the more advanced methods of increasing efficiency: **Prioritize your time, plan your “five moves,” and master “essential” skills.**

##### Prioritize Your Time

Your time and energy are finite. **To effectively use the time you have, you have to focus on the tasks that are most important to your goals.** Anything that doesn’t contribute to your goals is secondary and shouldn’t be given significant amounts of focus. Things such as deleting junk e-mail, attending unnecessary meetings, and attending to _false_ emergencies can distract you from your important tasks. For example, if you’re a business owner with the priority of selling more products, you shouldn’t spend a significant amount of time creating complex internal memos. Write succinct, to-the-point emails, then use your time to analyze market research, find potential buyers, improve your product, and develop a strong marketing plan.

##### Plan Your “Five Moves”

**High performance requires strategic action towards an objective.** If you don’t plan for your long-term goals, you likely won’t achieve them because you won’t know what’s important. While you may be working hard, you may be giving too much energy to nonessential projects or “busy work.”

When you create a road map, you focus your energy and attention into the tasks that are most important to your success. To create a long-term plan, find your _“five moves:”_

  * **Solidify your goal.** Make sure it’s clear and specific.
  * **Write down the five _major_ moves you’d need to make to achieve that goal.** These are big steps that require many smaller tasks to achieve. For example, if your goal is to become a published author, one of your major steps may be to “get a literary agent” or “find a way to self-publish.”
  * **Under each of your five major moves, write down a list of tasks that you need to do to accomplish that step.** For example, under “get a literary agent,” your tasks would include researching agencies, crafting writing samples, fixing up your resume, and practicing your interviewing skills.
  * **Once you have a list of tasks, put them into your calendar and hold yourself to hard deadlines.** Giving yourself a specific schedule will motivate you to complete tasks in a timely manner.



##### Master Important Skills

People often make the excuse that they’re “just not equipped” to learn a new skill. However, you can learn to do almost anything with time and effort.

**To start your journey towards mastery, define the five most important skills in your field.** Constantly be on the lookout for new educational opportunities and improved ways of working. The more you know about the essential elements of your field, the more effectively you’ll be able to work. For example, if you’re a salesperson, important skills include communication, problem-solving, customer service, negotiation, and market awareness.

Note: As you find the skills you need to develop, _don’t_ rely on mindless repetition. While mindless repetition can produce some results, it’s not the best way to improve. For example, a runner looking to improve their time can run the same route every day, but, if they’re not pushing themselves to beat personal records, they won’t see significant improvement.

**Instead of simple repetition, practice _progressive mastery_ to improve your skills. **Progressive mastery relies on setting increasingly challenging goals, attaching meaning to your process, and using teaching as a method to learn. Here are the steps of progressive mastery:

  * Define the skill you want to work on. 
  * Make long-term stretch goals that will challenge you.
  * Attach meaning to your work by reminding yourself why it's important.
  * Visualize success _and_ failure.
  * Schedule time to practice challenges and exercises created by experts.
  * Chart your progress and invite external feedback. 
  * Share your learning experience by competing or practicing with others. 
  * If you reach a goal, set another goal that challenges you even further.
  * Take time to teach others what you’re learning.
