## Exercise: Challenge People to Raise the Bar

As a leader, challenging the people around you motivates them to meet and exceed expectations. If youâ€™re practicing what you preach, raising the bar for other people also forces you to raise the bar for yourself.

* * *

Think of a specific employee you want to challenge. List 2-3 ways you could challenge their character. Think about holding them to values such as trustworthiness, self-control, and honesty.

List 2-3 ways you could challenge their connections. Think about the people they surround themselves with and their willingness to serve.

List 2-3 ways you could challenge their contributions. Think about what this person is currently contributing to their goals and what more they could do to go above-and-beyond.
