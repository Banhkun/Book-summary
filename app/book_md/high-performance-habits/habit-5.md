## Habit #5: Generate Influence

**To become a high performer, you need a group of people around you who are willing to support and invest in you.** The best way to achieve this is by generating _influence_. Influence is your ability to mold other people’s perspectives and behaviors. This habit mostly applies to leaders and work-related relationships but can also be applied in personal situations.

Trust and respect are key components of influence. They allow you to form strong relationships that you can use to further your goals, build a network of support, and defuse tense situations. Here are a few ways you can use influence:

  * Convince your boss to assign you to the projects you’re interested in.
  * Break up a fight between two of your colleagues or employees. 
  * Gain more sales through particular clients.



People often make the excuse that they can’t gain influence because they’re not “a people person.” **However, influence is not tied to personality traits such as introversion or extroversion.** Anyone can become influential if they put energy into developing their relationships. Influence is also not explicitly tied to effort in the workplace. You can give your all in your work, but, if you don’t know how to garner support from others, you won’t gain influence.

### The Benefits of Influence, and the Risks of Its Absence

| **Strong Influence** | **Weak Influence**  
---|---|---  
**Favors** | **Influential people have an easier time getting people to do favors for them.** They can persuade people to carry out tasks without having to beg.  | **Uninfluential people have a hard time getting people to do favors for them.** They often have to resort to begging to get people to carry out tasks. Even then, the tasks often go incompleted.   
**Trust** | **Influential people can gain people’s trust.** This allows them to take risks and guide people in their growth because the people around them trust them to lead.  | **Uninfluential people struggle to gain people’s trust.** They can’t take risks or guide people along because the people around them don’t trust them to lead.   
**Support** | **Influential people have a strong support system around them.** They’re able to fail without fear and ask people for help when they need it.  | **Uninfluential people don’t have a support system around them.** They constantly fear failure because they don’t have people around them who will be willing to help should they fall.   
  
### How to Generate Influence

To generate influence, you need to focus on your relationships. If you can create strong bonds with your friends, family, and colleagues, you will begin to gain the influence necessary to bolster your performance as well as the performance of those around you. **To foster these relationships, ask for what you want, be generous, and elevate your people.**

#### Ask for What You Want

**One of the best ways to gain influence is to ask for what you want.** While most people fear revealing their wants and needs, the action of asking for a favor helps develop and build relationships. You’ll find that more people are willing to help you than you may think.

When someone has the opportunity to give you what you want, it makes them feel good about themselves. This, in turn, makes them feel more connected to you.**When you build a network of connections, you’re generating influence by building up your network of trusted colleagues and friends.**

#### Be Generous

**In addition to asking for more favors, be willing to provide more favors.** Look for opportunities to offer your support and build up the people around you. The more willing you are to give, the more your friends, family, and colleagues will trust and respect you.

Often, people avoid being generous by making the excuse, “I’m simply too busy.” If you feel you’re too busy to be helpful or generous, chances are you have a time-management problem or are just unwilling to be generous.

#### Elevate Your People

**Words of encouragement and appreciation go a long way in generating influence.** Take the time to show gratitude to your colleagues, family, and friends. This will boost their self-esteem and improve your relationship with them.

**If you’re in a leadership position, show that you trust the people around you by giving them a level of autonomy.** Let them work towards goals in ways that best suit them and praise them when they do good work. If you offer your trust and support, the people around you will likely offer the same to you.

#### Influence and Leadership

As a leader, gaining influence allows you to boost the performance of your team as a whole. Consider the following three principles: **Show others how to think, challenge people to raise the bar, and practice what you preach.**

##### Show Others How to Think

**High-performing leaders show others how they want them to think.** Most people already do this through a method called “framing.” Framing is the act of leading a person to an answer by offering guiding questions or statements. Use framing strategically to guide people through a specific way of thinking. Framing statements and questions can include:

  * “Think about it like this…”
  * “What are your thoughts on…”
  * “How would you approach…”
  * “What do you think we should…”



**If you lead people into more efficient models of thinking, you’ll start to earn their trust.** As you do, you’ll be able to shape the way that they think about their role and their impact on the world around them. To effectively guide your people, ask yourself the following questions:

  * How do I want my people to think about themselves?
  * How do I want my people to think about others?
  * How do I want my people to think about the bigger pictures?



**Once you know the answers to these questions, share them.** Tell your employees the answers to these questions frequently. It will shape how they think about their role in your organization, the way they behave around others, and the impact that they’re making in the world around them.

##### Challenge People to Raise the Bar

**High-performing leaders know how to challenge the people around them without insulting or degrading them.** They set standards for the people around them and hold them accountable. Though they have to endure the occasional awkward conversation, high performers know how important it is to push people to meet and exceed expectations.

To challenge the people around you, create standards in three areas of behavior:

  * **Character:** Challenge others based on values such as trustworthiness, self-control, responsibility, and perseverance. Praise people when they show strong character, then push them to do even more. On the other hand, call people out when they veer from their values. For example, if someone gave up halfway through a project, say, “What led you to give up? You let us down on this project.”
  * **Connection:** Challenge others to treat people well, listen to them, and build them up. Praise teams that exhibit great communication and connection. On the other hand, call people out when they treat others poorly or refuse to listen to someone. For example, if an employee blows up at an intern, ask them, “How do you think it comes across when you lose your temper like that? That’s not the way to lead.”
  * **Contribution:** Challenge others to contribute more value to the group. Praise people when they go above and beyond. On the other hand, call people out when they’re slacking or not delivering. For example, if someone misses an important deadline, tell them, “You’re not contributing what’s expected of you. I know you can do better.”



##### Practice What You Preach

**Once they’ve set high standards and shown people how to think, high-performing leaders adhere to the expectations they set.** The best way to maintain influence is to be a role model and practice what you preach. If you don’t, people will view you as hypocritical and ignore your guidance.

Being a role model doesn’t mean that you’re trying to be a generically “good person.” While being kind and generous is important, **being a role requires that you _show_ others how to think and act. **This allows others to look to you as an example of how they can meet and exceed your expectations.
