## Habit #1: Search for Clarity

**As you’ll see, to become a high performer, you need clarity about who you are and what you want.** Clarity isn’t something that emerges on its own. It requires reflection and experimentation as you search for the values that matter to you and the goals that will define your journey.

There are two levels of clarity—identity and future:

  1. **Identity:** Clarifying _who you are_ helps you define your core values and the things that bring you fulfillment. Discovering _who you are_ is the first step on the road to clarity.
  2. **Future:** Clarifying _what you want_ helps you create clear, actionable goals towards an overarching objective. You can't clarify your future until you’ve found your identity. If you don’t know the values that drive you, you won’t know what you want to achieve.



### The Benefits of Clarity, and the Risks of Its Absence

| **With Clarity** | **Without Clarity**  
---|---|---  
**Self-Esteem** | **People with high levels of clarity tend to have high self-esteem** because they understand their values and know what brings them fulfillment. This allows them to feel good about the choices they make and the life they’re living.  | **People with low levels of clarity tend to have low self-esteem** because they don’t understand their values and can’t identify the things that bring them fulfillment. This leads to confusion about their choices and makes them question the life they’re living.   
**Motivation** | **People with high levels of clarity tend to be more motivated** because they have a clear goal they’re working towards, and they’re passionate about their objectives. This gives purpose to their work and inspires them to go above and beyond.  | **People with low levels of clarity tend to be less motivated** because they either don’t have a clear goal they’re working towards, or they’re not passionate about their objectives. Without any purpose to their work, there’s no reason to strive for excellence.   
**Confidence** | **People with high levels of clarity tend to be more confident** because they know the values that drive them and have a clear, actionable goal. This makes decision-making simpler as every choice feeds into an objective.  | **People with low levels of clarity tend to be less confident** because they don’t know the values that drive them and don’t have a clear, actionable goal. This makes decision-making harder because they don’t have a guiding purpose upon which to base their choices.   
**Productivity** | **People with high levels of clarity tend to be more productive** because they tend to do work that aligns with their values and goals. This makes the work more enjoyable and helps them stay on-task.  | **People with low levels of clarity tend to be less productive** because they don’t know what kinds of work align with their values and goals. This makes the work annoying or boring and makes them susceptible to distraction.   
  
### How to Search for Clarity

High performers possess all of the above traits thanks to clarity. To find clarity in your life: **Think about the “Future Four,” identify the feelings you’re seeking, and determine what’s significant.**

#### Think About the “Future Four”

There are four areas of goal-setting that you can use to develop clarity: **Self, Social, Skills, and Service.**

**Self: High performers are able to create a future image of themselves.** To do this, you need to be clear about the values you hold dear and the goals that you’re striving towards. Once you know these things, imagine the perfect future version of yourself and begin to implement characteristics from that image into your daily life. Hold yourself accountable by reminding yourself of the future that you want. For example, if the perfect future version of yourself is someone who is personable and curious, begin to find daily opportunities to relate to other people and expand your horizons. Ask yourself: “Did I relate to someone today, and did I learn something new?”

**Social: High performers know how they want to interact with others.** To do this, you need to be clear about the relationships you want to foster, and how you want to come across to your friends, family, and colleagues. Think about your daily interactions. Are you present and in-the-moment, or are you on autopilot? Are you concerned about how you’re treating the other person, or are you too caught up in your own ideas?

Give your full attention to the people around you and take their feelings and emotions into consideration when you approach them. Visualize the direction you want your relationships to develop, then begin to implement aspects of that imagined relationship into your daily interactions. For example, if you want to have a candid and respectful relationship with your colleague in the future, make an active effort to ask them for their input and take an interest in their goals and dreams.

**Skills: High performers know the skills they need to develop to succeed.** To do this, be clear about the skills you need to advance in your field. Be specific and schedule time to develop these skills. If you’re too vague about the areas you need to improve on, you won’t be able to focus on the most essential areas of improvement.

Note: These don’t need to be skills that focus on your “talents.” In fact, it’s often beneficial to find skills just outside of your field that could help bolster your area of expertise. For example, if your field is financial consulting, and you’re starting your own company, you may need to develop your marketing skills to sell your services to local businesses. Even though your expertise is in finance, gaining marketing skills gives you the opportunity to put your financial prowess to use down the line.

**Service: High performers know the difference they want to make in the world around them.**

  * Relevance: Know what matters to your client and what doesn’t. Prioritize your work based on the needs of your client. 
  * Differentiation: Know what makes your services unique and focus on the value you bring to the table. 
  * Excellence: Go above and beyond and provide a service that exceeds expectations. 



For example, if you’re a website developer with a boutique clothing company as a client, you’d need to think about the following: the most relevant aspects of building a clothing storefront, the things that differentiate this boutique from others, and the ways you can approach the work that will complement the vibe and values of the company.

#### Identify the Feelings You’re Seeking

**Emotions and feelings are different.** Emotions are an instinctive response to a trigger, where feelings are your _interpretation_ of any emotion. For example, if an employee is late for the fourth time in a row, your immediate emotion may be anger. However, if you take a moment to make yourself feel calm, you’ll come into the situation more level-headed.

**In any situation, take a moment to think, “What _feeling_ am I bringing into this situation, and what _feeling_ do I want to receive?” **Dictating your feelings helps you handle your emotional responses. When negative emotions come to the surface, try to channel that energy into a positive feeling, using your body’s natural responses to deal with a high-intensity situation.

For example, an athlete may experience anxiety right before an important match. However, they can take that emotion and channel it into the feeling of excitement. They then go into the match grounded and prepared, knowing that they want to leave with the feeling of accomplishment.

#### Determine What’s Purposeful

**High performers spend their time investing in purposeful things and avoid the trials that don’t hold any meaning for them.** For example, if you’re passionate about fitness, training for a marathon would be worth your time. While other challenges such as learning to cook or building a computer may be interesting, they aren’t meaningful in your life and, therefore, shouldn’t be focused on.

**There are four elements of purpose—enthusiasm, connection, satisfaction, and coherence.**

  * **Enthusiasm: High performers tackle challenges that they’re excited about.** When you’re enthusiastic about the work that you’re doing, challenges feel more fulfilling. 
  * **Connection: High performers want to be challenged by those around them.** Social isolation often leads to a lack of purpose. Surround yourself with people who will challenge you and push you to grow.****
  * **Satisfaction: High performers get satisfaction out of their trials.** Satisfaction is made up of three factors: passion, growth, and contribution. If a challenge consists of all three of these factors, you’ll likely get satisfaction from working on it.
  * **Coherence: High performers make sure their actions align with their goals.** When thinking about starting a challenge, think about how it aligns with your long-term goals. For example, if your long-term goal is to have your own art gallery, investing in courses in art history, color theory, and medium technique would be sensible challenges to invest your time in.
