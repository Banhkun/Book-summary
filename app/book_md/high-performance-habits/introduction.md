## Introduction

**High performers are people who maintain their success and well-being over a long period of time.** They usually:

  * Are satisfied with their lives
  * Are able to accomplish things outside of their “strengths”
  * Are highly productive
  * Work hard regardless of external motivators or rewards
  * Achieve more success than their colleagues but experience less stress
  * Are healthier than most of their colleagues
  * Are acclaimed by their colleagues
  * Adapt to their surroundings and impact other people



Many people believe that if they work hard, practice consistently, and focus on the things they’re good at, they’ll become one of these high performers. However, while these are wonderful practices, they don’t lead to high performance. If these aren’t the keys to excellence, what gives successful people to their competitive edge? **Developing high-performance habits.**

### What Is “High Performance?”

Before adopting the high-performance habits, you must first understand the definition of “high performance.” **High performance is _consistent_ and _continued_ success and growth at a high level.** The following are aspects of “high performance”:

  * **High performance requires that you focus on the _right_ habits. **Some habits are more effective than others. High performers recognize that they only have so much time and focus on the most effective habits. For example, getting in the habit of keeping a journal may help people process their emotions, but it won’t necessarily help them perform better. 
  * **High performance requires the ability to adapt.** The world is changing all the time, and high performers recognize that they have to adapt to the world around them. They’re always seeking better ways to improve their performance and don’t get stuck in their routines. For example, a high-performing athlete is constantly looking for more effective ways to work out and improve their performance.
  * **High performance requires aligned priorities.** High performers know what’s important for their success and what’s not. Instead of agreeing to everything they come across, they only invest time in projects that will improve their lives and contribute to their success. For example, a high-performing executive will only invest in projects that they believe will contribute to their company’s success. They won’t take the time to delve into projects they don’t believe in. 



**Be wary of myths surrounding high performance.** They’ll lead you astray or give you excuses not to strive towards excellence. The following are myths to watch out for:

  * **Myth #1: “Your ability to be a high performer is impacted by your gender, race, income, or background.”** People sometimes attribute their lack of success to their identity or background. While certain demographics face more obstacles than others, anyone can become a high performer by putting work into developing the proper habits. 
  * **Myth #2: “High performers strive for a singular goal such as getting an executive position or landing a lucrative contract.”** While having goals is important to maintaining motivation, achieving a singular goal doesn’t make you a high-achiever. High performers consistently achieve goals and don’t allow themselves to plateau after an accomplishment.
  * **Myth #3: “You only have to excel at one thing to be a high performer.”** High performers excel in various skill sets that impact the work that they do. They don’t limit themselves to a singular task or action. For example, an elite basketball player can’t just be good at shooting the ball. On the court, they also have to excel at court awareness, ball-handling, leadership, and communication. Off the court, they have to excel at health management, brand development, and contract negotiations.
  * **Myth #4: “Technology is a shortcut to being a high performer.”** While technology can be a wonderful tool, high performers don’t rely on it to do their jobs for them. You can track every step you take, every button you press, and every goal you achieve, but if you don’t use that information to improve, the information is useless.
  * **Myth #5: “You can rely on your natural strengths and talents to be a high performer.”** While talent is important to excellence, you can’t rely on raw strength or talent to elevate your performance. You could be the most talented person in the world, but if you don’t have good habits, you won’t have the energy, drive, or discipline to succeed.



### The HP6

**There are six high-performance habits (also known as the HP6) that will help achieve your goals in a healthy and sustainable way.** They’re _deliberate habits_ , or habits that you actively choose to do and constantly revisit to improve your performance. They aren’t things you do mindlessly or automatically. Instead, they’re often challenging and require your full attention.

In the next six chapters, you’ll learn why each of these habits is important, the dangers of not developing them, and ways to implement them in your daily life. The six high-performance habits are:

  * **Search for Clarity**
  * **Improve Your Health**
  * **Find Your Drive**
  * **Increase Your Efficiency**
  * **Generate Influence**
  * **Be Courageous**
