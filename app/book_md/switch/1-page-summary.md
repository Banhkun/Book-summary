## 1-Page Summary

The premise of change is simple: Nothing changes unless...something changes. However, the outcome is less simple. Despite your best efforts, some changes fail while others succeed—and it’s usually unclear why this happens.

**As it turns out, successful change depends on _three_ essential elements: 1) your rational side, 2) your emotional side, and 3) the environment you shape. **We’ll discuss the role of each of these elements and how to harness their power for change—first, by giving your rational side clear direction; second, by harnessing the energy of your emotional side; and third, by shaping a change-supporting environment.

### Part 1: Give Your Rational Side Clear Direction

Your rational side makes goals, plans for the future, and analyzes problems before taking action. This is the ideal “you.” **However, your rational side can actually hold you back from making changes** by overanalyzing problems and solutions and getting stuck in details and options. If you don’t give your rational side _clear_ direction, it becomes paralyzed. There are three ways to push your rational side out of analysis into productive action.

#### 1) Find and Replicate Success Stories

Often, when we want to make changes, we look at the problems and possible solutions. **Instead, we should be seeking out success stories that we can emulate—essentially, look for what’s _already working_ , and do more of it. **This exercise guards us against three major issues that often block change:

  1. It interrupts your rational side’s overanalysis and reflection, which can hinder change because you’re stuck in the details. A success story to emulate gives your rational side an obvious direction to move in.
  2. When we look at problems first, our rational tendency is to seek solutions on a similar scale to the problem. Looking for successful solutions first often reveals that the solutions are much smaller than the problems.
  3. We naturally feel defensive against “outsider” solutions, because we believe that what worked _there_ would never work within the context of _here_. In contrast, when we see an “insider” success story, we receive the message, “That _does_ work here.”



Imagine you’re having trouble getting your employees to use a new feedback system. Instead of spending time and energy “fixing” those who are struggling, look for an employee who has successfully incorporated the new system into her workflow. Have your struggling employees spend an afternoon with her—they’ll learn _practical_ ways to make the change within the context of their work, and they will naturally trust the solution more because it’s coming from a peer.

#### 2) Minimize Ambiguity and Options

When presented with too many options or ambiguity, humans naturally default to the most familiar option. Making familiar choices lets you function on autopilot, which doesn’t require you to expend any energy on decision-making. **On the other hand, change creates unfamiliarity that disrupts your autopilot.** You’re forced to weigh options, make deliberate decisions, and supervise your behaviors—especially when the change you’re trying to create is ambiguous.

  * For example, you decide to _eat healthier breakfasts._ The ambiguity of this goal prompts deliberation: What is the benchmark for “healthy”? Are smoothies too sugary? Would fruit or oatmeal be a healthier choice? 



This quickly depletes your rational thinking power, allowing your emotional side to take over control. And of course, your emotional side will always choose the instant gratification of the status quo instead of the difficult work of change.

##### Avoid Decision Paralysis

To avoid defaulting to your status quo, reduce options and ambiguity as much as possible. **Lay out _precisely_ the actions that are most critical to making the change stick. **This helps you know what to do, without deliberation. You can’t put guidelines in place for every imaginable scenario—focus on several specific behaviors that cover numerous situations.

For example, if you’re trying to eat healthier breakfasts, you can’t predict what foods will be available to you every morning. Instead, you might put together four critical guidelines:

  1. Never eat anything that’s covered in whipped cream. 
  2. Don’t drink Diet Coke before noon. 
  3. Every breakfast must contain at least one vegetable or fruit.
  4. Eat only _one_ carb-heavy breakfast, such as pancakes, per week.



**Over time, these guidelines become less unfamiliar and more instinctive—the status quo that your autopilot defaults to.** This creates sustainable change because the desired behaviors will no longer require your rational side’s concentrated effort or self-supervision.

#### 3) Paint a Picture of Your Destination

**Change is most successful when you can paint a _clear_ picture of a not-too-far-off destination you want to head toward. **For example, making changes to lose weight might have the destination of “fitting in my favorite jeans again.”

Often, when faced with an ambitious goal, your rational side will get stuck deciding if there’s even a problem that needs to be solved and wondering what the best possible solution might be. **Reframing your goal as a clear destination points your rational energy in a productive direction in two ways:**

  1. It articulates that there _is_ a problem and why the change is worth it. “I _have_ gained enough weight to not fit in my jeans anymore, and I really want to wear them again.”
  2. It shifts you away from the _thinking and analyzing_ stage of change and into the _doing_ stage. A vague weight loss goal leaves you wondering, “How much weight should I lose?” A favorite jeans _destination_ directs you: “I need to lose enough to fit in my jeans. I last fit in them when I was walking to work every day, so I should start walking again.”



##### Blend Guidelines and Destination to Block Rationalization

Your emotional desire for instant gratification may occasionally control your behaviors. These bumps are normal, but be very careful not to _rationalize anti-change behaviors._

  * For example, after a few weeks of a new exercise routine, you choose to skip your morning walk. You rationalize the choice, saying, “I deserve a day off. And I shouldn’t do _too_ much exercise or I might injure myself.” 



**Rationalizing anti-change behaviors moves you in the _opposite direction_ of change. **You believe your rational side is still in full control, simply _allowing_ a small sidestep from the path. However, these small, controlled sidesteps are anything but—they’re your emotional side’s sly way to drag you back to square one before you realize what’s happening.

When you combine a strong sense of where you’re going with clear guidelines with no wiggle room for rationalization, you’re aware of how far you’re going off track and avoid the subtle trap of rationalization.

### Part 2: Harness the Energy of Your Emotional Side

Your emotional side acts instinctively and is driven by instant gratification. When changes fail, it’s usually your emotional side’s fault—change hinges on the ability to delay gratification and make short-term sacrifices in exchange for a long-term payoff.**However, because your emotional side is _much stronger_ than your rational side, it will do most of the legwork in getting you to your goal, if you can harness its energy. **

There are three ways to get emotional energy moving in the right direction.

#### 1) Appeal to the Right Feelings

Most people think that all change follows the process: analysis→ thought→ change. You receive information, carefully analyze it, think of a solution, and execute the change. However, this process only works for small, defined changes, such as deciding to stop buying paper towels.

**Using this process to try to get people on board with large, ambiguous changes is a waste of energy.** It misdirects your efforts—you’ll assume that your audience isn’t changing because they don’t understand the information well enough to see the problem.

  * For example, you might think, “People won’t stop buying bottled water because they don’t understand the impact plastic bottles have on the environment.”****



However, your audience usually understands the information—hearing it again won’t make them care, or see the need for change. Most people naturally feel that they’re better than others, which helps them rationalize away information.

  * “ _I’m_ not the problem. I don’t drink nearly as much bottled water as some people, and I almost always recycle.” 



**When large change is at stake, the process looks more like: experience→ feel→ change.** That is, you have to create an experience that sparks a strong emotion—such as outrage, joy, or disgust—that will drive people to change. Emotions are hard to rationalize away.

  * Imagine you want your husband to stop using vulgar language around your child. He rationalizes the information: “He’s a baby. He doesn’t understand any of those words. Besides, I don’t swear around him _that_ much.” You engineer an experience: You hype your child up on sugar—which always brings out his potty mouth—and send him to the store with your husband. Your child uses some _choice_ language when speaking to the cashier. Your husband feels deep shame and embarrassment—he cleans up his language to avoid further public shame.



##### Which Emotions Are Most Effective?

Context has a large part in determining which emotions you should appeal to.

  * **Personal changes:** Negative emotions like shock or disgust usually prompt specific actions, so they’re best for specific, personal changes. For example, a heartbreaking intervention may prompt an addict to stop buying drugs.
  * **Organizational changes:** Positive emotions like surprise or empowerment are better suited to the ambiguous, evolving, and long-term goals of organizations. Instead of motivating employees with a layoff threat, inspire them with an ambitious, exciting goal. 



#### 2) Minimize the Effort

One of the most distracting factors along the path to change is _the possibility of instant gratification_. The gratification that far-off goals offer is too distant—your emotional side naturally starts looking for more immediate ways to feel satisfied. Keep your emotional side on track by building frequent opportunities for gratification into the journey. You can do this in two ways.

##### Method #1: Shorten the Distance to Your Goal

**People are naturally more motivated to work toward a goal when they feel that they’re already partway there.** When progress isn’t immediately apparent, your emotional side becomes demoralized and distracted. However, a “head start” on your goals feels like immediate progress—giving your emotional side a boost of satisfaction and confidence that carries you to the next benchmark of progress. Motivate change by demonstrating the progress that’s already been made.

  * For example, you want your team to start meeting with their direct reports at least once a month. You remind them, “Last year, you only did _two_ meetings per year. You’re already on track for seven __ meetings this year—one per month is achievable.”



##### Method #2: Build In Opportunities for Celebration

**Keep in mind that any achieved goal is just a collection of small, doable actions.** Shifting your focus toward these small actions, instead of the result, can prevent discouragement.

You can do this in two ways:

**1) Start small.** Instead of considering the overwhelming work to be done, think: What is the smallest task I could complete that would be a step in the right direction?__ Completing this small first task gives you a quick fix of instant gratification, motivating you to complete the next task.

  * For example, if the idea of cleaning your _whole_ house is too daunting, commit instead to doing the smallest task possible, such as washing the dishes piling up in the sink. 



**2) Create milestones.** Building small, frequent milestones into the journey and celebrating them ensures a regular supply of instant gratification opportunities. For example, if you’re learning French, you might set the following milestones: 1) Read and understand one article from _Le Monde,_ 2) Watch a season of your favorite show with French subtitles, 3) Listen to and understand one French podcast episode, 4) Write an entire essay without using a dictionary.

  * Building these types of small wins into a long journey not only reassures you of your abilities, but it also diminishes the pressure and difficulty of achieving the goal. Instead of thinking, “I’ll _never_ be fluent,” you’ll think “I can already understand a whole podcast episode. Learning French isn’t as hard as I thought.”



#### 3) Cultivate Identity

When trying to get people on board with ambiguous ideas or big changes, it’s most effective to appeal to identity—the essential part of your sense of self and the way you make decisions. Identities can be relatively flexible in that you naturally adopt different identities throughout your life, such as _parent_ , _world-traveler_ , or _musician._ **However, identities can be rigid in that _if you propose a change that contradicts someone’s identity, they’ll naturally resist._** Therefore, you need to either align your proposed change with someone’s identity _or_ align their identity with your proposed change. Start by asking yourself if the people you’re appealing to would say: “I want to be the kind of person who makes this change.”

  * Yes: You don’t have to convince them—they’ll make the change because it nudges them closer to the identity they want. 
  * No: You’ll have to convince them to adopt the identity of someone who changes.



Start small—ask your audience to perform a minor change-supporting behavior. The behavior makes them think that they _do_ align with the identity you suggested. Subsequently, they start performing more behaviors that align with the change—reinforcing the identity.

  * For example, if someone tells you they don’t care about your town’s environmental awareness board, have her sign a simple “Keep Our Community Clean” pledge. This prompts her to think about herself as a responsible citizen. She starts picking up trash in town and participating in clean-up initiatives. Six months later, she’s on the board.



### Part 3: Shape Your Path Forward

Creating a successful path toward change means keeping your rational and emotional sides moving forward together by eliminating instant-gratification distractions and removing any obstacles that might spark overanalysis. **Interestingly, your environment can either work _independently of_ or _in tandem with_ your rational and emotional elements. **

  * It can be an independent “quick track” to change. However, this only works if the environment is entirely foolproof and distraction-free. Not only is this difficult to achieve, but your rational and emotional sides aren’t under control—meaning any small distraction can irreversibly derail your progress toward change.
  * Environment is better as an _aid_ to in-sync rational and emotional sides. This allows for distractions or unexpected obstacles—when your rational and emotional sides are a balanced team, you can shake off problems and continue moving forward.



There are three ways to build support into your path toward change.

#### 1) Build a Change-Supporting Environment

The first way to smooth your path is to create _a change-supporting environment_ —that is, an environment that makes good behaviors _easier_ to perform, and bad behaviors _harder_ to perform. Create a change-supporting environment by modifying your routines or your space.

**Change-supporting routines:** Change up your routine to surround yourself with tools that make good behaviors easy and roadblocks that make bad behaviors difficult. Imagine you’re trying to start running every morning and want to spend less on unhealthy food. Make good behaviors easier by setting your coffee to auto-brew at 7 a.m. so you’ll be more motivated to get up, and packing your lunch the night before so you don’t order takeout at work again.

Make bad behaviors more difficult by finding a running buddy you’ll have to contact if you want to skip your run, and only ordering takeout with _one_ specific credit card that you keep in an inconvenient place like your garden shed.

**Change-supporting spaces:** Physically rearranging your space can guide you toward performing more change-supporting behaviors.****

  * This might look like moving The Chair that sits by your back door and seems to gather clutter no matter what you do. If you remove this natural drop-zone, you’ll likely find that your clutter gets put away where it belongs.



#### 2) Create Change-Supporting Habits

It’s not always possible to change your environment—in these cases, work on building habits that trigger _good_ behaviors. **When desired behaviors become _habitual, autopilot behaviors_ , you’ll naturally and effortlessly fall back on them to conserve rational energy.**

At the base of good habit-building are “action triggers.” These are the _triggers_ we set up to prompt a certain _action._ For example, “When I leave work (trigger), I’ll go to the gym (action).”

**Powerful habits come from combining action triggers with _preloaded responses—_** practiced and memorized reactions. Your preloaded response happens _reflexively_ in a situation that calls for it. Pairing action triggers with preloaded responses prevents you from getting lost in possible solutions or pulled off track by your emotional wants.

##### How to Create a Preloaded Response

While creating preloaded responses, reframe your thoughts from “ _What_ is the right thing to do?” to “What is my action trigger, and _how_ can I get the right thing done?”

**Your action triggers need to be specific and visible—otherwise, they won’t be strong enough to trigger your preloaded response _._** For example, you’re trying to cut down on drinking.**** You identify _specific_ situations where you’ll be tempted to drink and create preloaded responses that make you do the right thing: not drink.

  * “When the waiter asks me what I would like to drink, I’ll say seltzer.”
  * “When I’m walking home after work, I’ll take the long way to avoid passing the bar.”



These triggers—“when the waiter asks me what I would like to drink” and “when I’m walking home”—are specific enough to prompt your response. On the other hand, a vague action trigger such as, “When I go out, I’ll drink seltzer instead of wine,” leaves room for deliberation: “We’re at dinner, which isn’t really _going out_. Just one glass of wine will be fine.”

#### 3) Leverage the Influence of Others

You can also use _the people around you_ to support change. Humans, as social creatures, figure out how to behave by watching others—when you’re not sure how to react to a situation, you’ll look for cues in the behavior of those around you. **This means that behavior is _contagious_ between people**. There are three ways you can ensure that your environment sends contagious, change-supporting social signals.

##### Method #1: Broadcast Good (and Bad) Behavior

Get people on board with changes by broadcasting _just how many_ people are performing change-supporting behaviors. People take this information as a social signal that indicates what they _should_ be doing—and they feel ashamed when their actions fall short of this standard.

  * For example, an editor who wants a faster article turnaround creates a spreadsheet that’s shared with all writers, so everyone can see others’ progress. A lagging writer will see that her late work is the odd one out and will quickly speed up. 



##### Method #2: Give Shape to Ideas People Already Agree With

At times, your proposed change will be an idea that everyone already agrees with—you just have to attach social signals to it in order to make it a widespread practice. When the idea has a concrete shape, it can be publicized and incorporated into common knowledge and opinion.

  * For example, in the 1980s the concept of “designated drivers” was virtually unheard of in the United States, though most people agreed there was a need for a safe way to get home after drinking. A public health professor asked TV writers to include designated drivers in their scripts—attaching social signals to the idea. Within three years, _90%_ of the American public knew, and used, designated drivers. 



##### Method #3: Get Change-Supporters Together

Cultural changes can be difficult because they disrupt the “way things are,” which is often closely intertwined with people’s _identities._ Put your efforts toward helping change-supporters find one another and cultivate a _new_ identity and culture. In doing so, they’ll feel more emboldened to speak up for change—thus sending out social signals to a larger audience.

  * Imagine you’re tasked with getting your corporate office on board with a four-day workweek. A change-supporting employee comes into conflict with an anti-change employee who makes snide comments about her work ethic. You say, “Maria, you should work with Sean (a change-supporter) on this project. I think you’ll be better aligned in your values.” Maria and Sean regularly discuss the perks of the shorter week, giving them the confidence to praise the system to colleagues, even those who are anti-change. Eventually, their ideas spread through the office, and everyone agrees to a four-day week.



### Conclusion: Make Changes Stick

Getting your change in motion is half the battle—now, turn your sights to making that change stick for the long term. There are three ways to accomplish this.

**1) Reinforce change:** Change doesn’t happen in an instant—it’s a long process of repeated behaviors that slowly get closer to your goal. You can motivate continued attempts at change by celebrating behaviors, _no matter how small_ , that represent progress toward the goal.

  * For personal goals, this might look like praising your daughter for letting her little sister _watch_ her play—although your end goal is getting her to share toys willingly. 
  * In an organization, this might look like publicly thanking an employee for handing in her report using _all_ of your new guidelines—even though there are several mistakes. 



**2) Give the change time to settle in:** The beginning stages of change are the hardest simply because you’re not used to them—but you’ll find that changes become acceptable and start to snowball as you give them time to settle in. This happens for two reasons:

  * The _mere exposure effect_ —that is, the more you’re exposed to something, the more you like it. For example, you may initially hate vegetables, but over time you come to appreciate their interesting flavors and textures.
  * When you repeat behaviors enough, you eventually attach your identity to those behaviors. This makes them easier to continue because you’re acting in line with _who you believe you are_. For example, if you start running every day, you’ll start to think of yourself as a runner—which further motivates you to stick with running. 



**3) Remember that change is a pattern:** When change works, it’s because you got your rational side, emotional side, and your path all on track—change follows this pattern in all contexts. This knowledge helps you with change in two ways:

  * You've likely already made successful changes in your life. This means you’ve used the change pattern before and _already know you can do it_. Keep this in mind to maintain your confidence when taking on new changes. 
  * Going forward, your changes will have a higher success rate because you understand the three essential elements and know how to use their power to support change.
