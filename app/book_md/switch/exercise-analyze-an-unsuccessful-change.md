## Exercise: Analyze an Unsuccessful Change

Reflecting on failed changes and the misalignment of your three elements of change (rational, emotional, environmental) can help you understand the importance of getting them in sync for your next attempt.

* * *

Describe a change you recently tried to make but didn’t succeed with (for example, spending less time on social media).

What did you want to happen, rationally?

How did your emotional side throw you off course?

Though the change ultimately wasn’t successful, were there any aspects of your environment that were _helpful_ to your attempt (for example, your partner reminding you to put down your phone)?

What _unhelpful_ aspects of your environment significantly contributed to going off course (for example, your phone pinging you with incoming messages)?
