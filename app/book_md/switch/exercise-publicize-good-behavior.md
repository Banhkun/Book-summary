## Exercise: Publicize Good Behavior

Showing others that they’re the odd ones out with bad behavior can motivate them to fit in with the herd.

* * *

What’s an organizational change that some people are on board with and others not? (For example, you want your employees to send short status updates every Friday morning.)

How are people acting in line with the behaviors you want to see more of? (For example, some employees get their updates in on time, but most others are late or don’t send them at all.)

How can you publicize this good behavior in a way that makes bad behavior obvious? (Every Friday at 11 am, you send out an email: “Thank you to A, B, C, and D for getting their updates in on time this week! Still waiting to hear from X, Y, and Z.”)
