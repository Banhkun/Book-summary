## Part 3: Shaping the Path | Chapter 8: Build a Change-Supporting Environment

In the next three chapters, we’ll discuss how to build an environment and path forward that make your change as easy as possible, minimizing your temptation to go off-track.

**The first way to smooth your path is to create _a change-supporting environment_ —that is, an environment that makes good behaviors _easier_ to perform, and bad behaviors _harder_ to perform. **

For example, one college experimented to see if _being a good person_ or _having clear instructions_ would make people donate more to a food drive. They polled students, having them identify which of their peers were most likely to donate and least likely to donate. They then created two groups with an even mix of “giving” and “selfish” students:

  * **Group A** received a general flyer about the food drive. At the end of the drive, _8%_ of the “giving” students had donated, but _none_ of the “selfish” students had. 
  * **Group B** received a map indicating the donation point, a specific request for beans, and a suggestion that students think about when they’d be near the donation point so they could be sure to bring their donation with them. At the end of the drive, _42%_ of the “giving” students and _25%_ of the “selfish” students had donated. 



The students’ donations didn’t depend on who they were as people—they depended on _how easy_ the good behavior of donating was. **It’s easier to change circumstances than it is to change character—if you want to make a change, the best way to support it is to ensure that the environment surrounding the change process continually urges good behaviors.**

### Create Your Change-Supporting Environment

There are two ways you can create a change-supporting environment: modifying your routines and modifying your space.

#### Change-Supporting Routines

Think of ways you might change up your routine to surround yourself with tools that make good behaviors easy and roadblocks that make bad behaviors difficult. For example, imagine you’re trying to start running every morning and want to spend less money on unhealthy food and snacks.

Make good behaviors easier by:

  * Setting your coffee to auto-brew at 7 a.m. so you’ll be more motivated to get up instead of sleeping in
  * Packing your lunch the night before so you don’t order takeout at work again



Make bad behaviors more difficult by:

  * Finding a running buddy—if you want to skip your run, you’ll have to contact them first 
  * Only using _one_ specific credit card for takeout, and keeping it in an inconvenient place, like your garden shed



#### Change-Supporting Spaces

Other times, physically rearranging your space can help guide you toward performing more change-supporting behaviors.****

  * For example, one executive received poor results on a feedback questionnaire from her employees—they reported that she wasn’t good at communication, though she prided herself on an open-door policy. She realized that she had a bad habit of looking at her computer screen while talking to the people who stopped by her office. She redid her office to include a small meeting area far away from her computer screen. She stopped her bad habit of distracted listening, and her communication scores went up. 



For you, this might look like moving The Chair that sits by your back door and seems to gather clutter no matter what you do. If you remove this natural drop-zone, you’ll likely find that your clutter gets put away where it belongs.

#### Environment-Building Tool: The Haddon Matrix

Injury-prevention experts—responsible for inventions like childproof medicine bottles and crumple zones on cars—use a framework called the Haddon Matrix to think about how and why accidents happen. The Haddon Matrix has three parts: pre-incident, incident, and post-incident. For example, if your goal was to find ways to decrease fatal injuries from collisions between bikes and cars, you would consider:

  * What would prevent the incident from happening (pre-incident): wider bike lanes, right-of-way for bikes laws, mandating front and rear lights on bikes, mandating reflective clothing on bikers, and so on. 
  * What can reduce the harm of the incident when it inevitably happens (incident): helmets, softer crumple zones on cars, protective vests for bikers, and so on. 
  * What can minimize the negative effects of the incident (post-event): well-run medical response teams, more people trained in basic first aid, and so on. 



**When setting up change-supporting environments, you can use a Haddon Matrix thought process—consider** **ways to _prevent_ bad behaviors from occurring, _how to reduce harm_ when the bad behavior does occur, and _how to respond_ in a way that minimizes the negative effects of the bad behavior.**

Imagine you make a goal of eating healthier.

  * Pre-incident: You rid your house of junk food, add “go to farmer’s market” to your Saturday schedule, and start learning how to meal prep so you won’t be tempted by “easy” food. 
  * Incident: You give in and head for the office vending machine, but only ever keep $1 in loose change at your desk to avoid binging. You keep a bar of dark chocolate in the house so your midnight cravings are satisfied in a relatively healthy way. 
  * Post-incident: You let yourself have a huge “cheat day,” so you follow it up with a day of eating at _least_ five different vegetables. You bought a jumbo pack of chips, so you leave it in the office break room to be shared by the whole office.



### Creating Change-Supporting Environments for Others

**When helping other __ people make changes, keep in mind that good behaviors don’t _naturally_ start happening once you suggest a new way of doing things. **As a leader, your job is to identify the root causes of anti-change behavior. Then, consciously create an environment that cuts these problems out—making anti-change behaviors more difficult.

#### Example: Reducing Medication Errors

A San Francisco hospital wanted to reduce its nurses’ medication errors, which could be harmful or even fatal. Medication errors happened most frequently when the nurses were distracted—which was often, as the medication administration area was directly in the middle of the nurse’s station. **Here, the core problem was discovered—the nurses weren’t the problem, but rather, the people around them.** Even in the middle of medication administration, nurses were considered “fair game” for questions and orders.

Ideally, nurses would have a separate room to work in for medication administration, eliminating the possibility of interruption, but this wasn’t possible. The environment had to change in a way that would make interrupting nurses obviously “off-limits.” A hospital director suggested that nurses put on bright orange vests while in the middle of medication administration, to signal to others that they were busy and not able to talk.

  * Two units that tested the system saw a 47% decrease in medication errors in just six months.
