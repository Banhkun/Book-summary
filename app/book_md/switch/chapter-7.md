## Chapter 7: Cultivate Identity

When making decisions, we usually follow one of two lines of thinking:

**1) The consequences of the decision.** We do a cost-benefit analysis to determine which decision will have the most satisfying outcome. We usually follow this line of thinking when it comes to small, simple decisions—such as what to get for lunch.

  * However, relying on this thought process when trying to create significant changes _won’t work_ because it’s too hard to predict the outcome of a change—there’s no way to know what the most satisfying outcome will be. 



**2)** **Our identity.** We ask ourselves: Who am I? What would the kind of person I am do in this situation?

  * When trying to get people on board with ambiguous ideas or big changes, it’s most effective to appeal to identity—the essential part of your sense of self and the way you make decisions.



### How to Cultivate Identity

Identities can be relatively flexible in that people naturally adopt different identities throughout their lives, such as _parent_ , _world-traveler_ , or _musician._ **However, identities can be rigid in that _if you propose a change that contradicts someone’s identity, they’ll naturally resist._** Therefore, you need to either align your proposed change with someone’s identity _or_ align their identity with your proposed change.

**When proposing a change, start by asking yourself if the people you’re appealing to would say: “I want to be the kind of person who makes this change.”** If so, you don’t have to convince them of much—they’ll happily make a change that nudges them closer to an identity they want to have. If the person _doesn’t_ aspire to be someone who makes the change, you’ll have to convince them to adopt a new identity.

To do this, start small. Ask your audience to perform a minor change-supporting behavior. This small behavior prompts them to see themselves differently—the behavior serves as evidence that they _do_ align with the identity you suggested. In turn, they start performing more behaviors that align with the change, which reinforces the idea that they’re the type of person who makes the change.

  * For example, while asking college students to buy less bottled water, you encounter several students who state that they’re not interested in being more environmentally conscious. You ask these students to sign a “Keep North College Clean” pledge—this prompts these students to think about themselves as responsible citizens. They start picking up trash on campus and participating in clean-up initiatives. Six months later, you get them to commit to not buying bottled water. 



#### Example: Saving the St. Lucia Parrot

In 1977, the St. Lucia Parrot was well on its way to extinction due to hunting, the illegal pet trade, and habitat destruction. Paul Butler, a freshly-graduated conservation student, was tasked with saving the St. Lucia Parrot on a shoestring budget.

He’d studied the parrots and came up with several crucial steps for preserving the species. However, each step required law changes that depended on the support and votes of the public, who didn’t care about the fate of the parrot. **To save the species, he needed to get St. Lucians on board with his plans.**

He didn’t have enough fuel to approach the issue from an analytical angle—there wasn’t any financial gain to saving the parrot, and it didn’t make up a vital part of the ecosystem. Most St. Lucians wouldn’t notice the parrot’s disappearance at all.

Realizing he needed to use emotions to get the St. Lucians on board, **Butler decided to appeal to their identity and align it with his cause by establishing the idea that _St. Lucians are people who are proud and protective of their rare parrot._ **He started by making the parrot a public mascot of the island, inserting the parrot into every aspect of St. Lucian life.

  * He gave out t-shirts, hosted puppet shows starring the parrot, had volunteers dressed as parrots lead educational events, got a local band to record parrot-themed songs, and had a telecom company create calling cards with the parrot on them. At public events, he reminded people: “This parrot is _ours alone_ and it’s our job to protect it.” 



The St. Lucians quickly adopted the parrot as a central part of their national identity and threw their support behind the law changes that ensured the parrots’ conservation.

### Why Identity Cultivation Fails—and Why That’s Okay

You can convince people to take on new identities—or take on a new identity yourself—relatively quickly, but it can take much longer to _consistently make the decisions and perform the behaviors of that identity._

  * For example, you might convince a college student in a few minutes to identify as environmentally conscious, but it might take her several weeks or months to consistently recycle, bike to work, or bring reusable bags to the grocery store.



This is important to keep in mind—there are usually numerous setbacks throughout the process of change. **Approaching these setbacks with the right mindset is the difference between change that succeeds and change that fails.** There are two main types of mindset: _fixed mindset_ and _growth mindset._

**1) Fixed mindset:** You believe that you are “wired” a certain way—there are things you’re good at and bad at, and they don’t change. The way you act is simply a reflection of your natural abilities. For example, you avoid social situations because you’re _naturally shy_ or you volunteer for presentations because you’re _naturally good at public speaking._

  * People who have a fixed mindset usually don’t take on new challenges because they fear failure and the judgment of others. To them, failure indicates a lack of ability—that presentation didn’t go well, so you must _actually_ be a bad public speaker. 



**2) Growth mindset:** You believe that ability is something that can be practiced and built up over time. Those with a growth mindset value _effort_ over _ability_ —they’re more likely to be successful because they’re not afraid of the hard work it takes to get there.

  * People who have a growth mindset aren’t afraid of challenges because they know that trying new things will help develop their abilities—and they see failure as a learning opportunity. 



Imagine the student trying to be more environmentally conscious takes her car to work—a _half-mile_ walk—every day for a week due to iffy weather.

  * If she had a _fixed mindset_ , she would say, “I’m a bad environmentalist. I can’t even stick to this simple challenge. I should just give up.” 
  * If she had a _growth mindset_ , she would say, “This wasn’t my best week, but I learned that I’m prone to being thrown off by inconvenience. I’ll have to be more aware of that.” 



#### Developing a Growth Mindset

**The good news is, fixed-mindset people can _develop_ a growth mindset. **When facing a personal change or leading a group through a change, think about the different parts of the process and the _inevitable_ failure you’ll meet.**** Change processes usually have two distinct parts:

  1. The first part of change involves gathering information about the best way forward and finding solutions to problems. This stage comes with a strong sense of hope and motivation.
  2. The second stage involves synthesizing all these hopeful ideas into a coherent plan and starting action on it. This part often doesn’t go entirely to plan, and can feel cumbersome and messy—it’s demotivating because it feels like failure. 



**When you reach this second stage, it’s crucial to remember that _what looks like failure is in fact a learning process._** Normalizing failure in this way reassures you (or the group you’re leading) in several ways.

  * Failure is seen as an essential part of the process rather than a dreaded or shameful event. 
  * It affirms that failure isn’t the end of the road—there’s an “other side” of failure to reach. 



When you feel reassured enough to push through the messy stage of failure—rather than quit—your chances of success increase. Getting through the failure and seeing problems untangle boosts your confidence and builds momentum.

(Shortform note: Read our summary of Mindset for more tips on fostering a growth mindset.)
