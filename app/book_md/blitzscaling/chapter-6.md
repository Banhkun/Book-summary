## Chapter 6: Responsible Blitzscaling

The final chapter of _Blitzscaling_ is Reid Hoffman opining about the inevitability of blitzscaling and our country’s need to collaborate on it, rather than suppress it out of fear. His points:

  * Large modern companies that spark concerns of being monopolists (Google, Facebook, Amazon) are clearly improving consumer welfare. Contrast this to the more exploitative monopolies of the past that cornered markets and artificially inflated prices. If consumers dislike any single company like Google, there are plenty of alternatives to use.
  * Scale creates wealth for everyone. Look at how cheap TVs and mobile phones are today, how much more value Netflix gives relative to a cable subscription. Consumers are better off when companies scale to massive sizes.
  * Any country that restricts company growth will see its companies moving offshore to more hospitable grounds, taking jobs with it.
  * Large companies should self-regulate to avoid government intervention.
  * People have complained about changes for millennia. Socrates warned that the written word would harm memory; another argued that printing presses would cause too much confusing information. Social media and smartphones is just another iteration of this. So this wave of technology shouldn’t be feared.
