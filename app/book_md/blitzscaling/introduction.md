## Introduction

In markets where Internet technology is a dominant factor, there are powerful winner-take-all dynamics. The first company to achieve a critical mass can dominate its industry for a long time.

The enabler is the Internet - specifically, its power of zero-marginal-cost distribution. The ability to reach millions (or billions) of users and service their needs automatically, at nearly no marginal cost, creates situations where a powerful company becomes ever more powerful through positive feedback loops. These second-order effects include network effects and virality.

While similar positive feedback loops have led to massive organizations for millennia - see the Roman Empire, Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, and Microsoft - **the Internet has dramatically shortened the feedback loop iteration time and enabled unprecedented global scale**.

Thus, for companies vying for market dominance, it’s imperative to move fast and take on large risk, or forever lose the fight. _Blitzscaling_ is a book that covers important questions:

  * Why do you need to grow fast?
  * In what situations should you grow fast? When do you not?
  * How do you grow fast? What problems slow you down, and how do you fix them?
