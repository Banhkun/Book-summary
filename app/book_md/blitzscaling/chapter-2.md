## Chapter 2: Business Models that Scale

Business models are how the company makes money by serving its customers. This chapter discusses aspects of successful business models in general, and business models that are especially suited to blitzscaling.

### Four Growth Factors

There isn’t a universal business model that works for every company, but most great business models overlap with these four growth factors.

#### 1\. Market Size

A big market has a **large number of potential customers** and **efficient channels for reaching those customers**. Ideally, the market is also growing quickly, meaning markets that seem small initially can grow to become massive.

Sometimes the market size for an innovative company is underestimated, because the potential to grow the market and the potential for the company to expand are underestimated. Therefore, don’t fix your sense of market size to the size of the incumbent - this can drastically underestimate how large the market can grow.

  * Analogy: Don’t size the car industry off of how many horses there were in 1910.
  * Some analysts once found Uber’s valuation ridiculous since it represented a sizable percentage of the global taxi market. It turns out Uber’s superior customer experience grew the market beyond what taxis did, and ridesharing eventually eclipsed all of taxis.
  * Airbnb grew to carry more rooms than the entire hotel industry.
  * Amazon grew far beyond its early beachhead in books, which now accounts for less than 7% of company sales.



#### 2\. Distribution

Many startups focus on product but overlook the importance of distribution. Roughly speaking, there are two general categories: existing networks and word-of-mouth.

**Existing Networks**

  * Traditional web models include paid acquisition and SEO.
  * Companies also get exposure from existing platforms like Facebook, app stores.
  * Scrappy startups can find ways to co-opt existing networks.
    * PayPal made it easy for eBay sellers to add a “Pay with PayPal” button to listings
    * Airbnb sent requests to Craigslist posters to replicate their listings on Airbnb.



**Word of Mouth/Virality**

  * A virality strategy requires good retention, to better increase the number of referrals made.
  * Virality usually requires a free or freemium product. The authors can’t recall a company with a paid product that grew to massive scale using virality.
  * Examples
    * Linkedin built address book scrapers to invite contacts; added public profiles which users started integrating in their email signatures.
    * For each referral, PayPal paid the referrer $10 and the new user $10. People obviously like free money.
    * Dropbox gave perks (extra storage) for inviting friends.



#### 3\. High Gross Margins

Gross margins = Revenue - cost of goods sold. This is a good measure of long-term unit economics.

Software companies have high fixed costs and low marginal costs, often above 60%. In contrast, “old economy” businesses like restaurants have low gross margins. (Shortform note: part of the reason is that the low upfront costs of “old economy” businesses like restaurants lower the barrier to entry, thus driving down prices. Further, “old economy” businesses often exist in the physical world rather than virtually, thus costing more to operate.)

High gross margins give big strategic benefits:

  * For a fixed amount of revenue, **higher margins create more funds for companies to reinvest in R &D and growth **to ward off competitors.
  * Operations scale with revenue or sales volume, moreso than with earnings. In other words, fixing profit, a company can have lower operational complexity with higher gross margins. It’s easier to service customers who generate $15MM in sales and $10MM in margins, than to service customers who generate $100MM sales with the same $10MM in margins.



#### 4\. Network Effects

Network effects apply when a **user using the product makes the product more valuable for other users**. This is also called “demand-side economies of scale” by economists.

The major types of network effects are:

  * **Direct:** Usage directly increases value
    * Messaging apps like WeChat, social networks like Facebook
  * **Indirect:** Usage encourages consumption of complementary goods, which increases the value of the original product
    * Tech platforms invite developers to build applications on the platform
      * Operating systems like Windows, iOS, Android
      * Gaming consoles like Playstation
  * **Two-Sided Network Effects:** Usage by one set of users increases value to a different set of users
    * Marketplaces like eBay, Uber, Airbnb, Steam, Adwords
  * **Local Network Effects:** Usage by a small subset of users increases the value for a connected user
    * Cell phone companies used to offer unlimited cell phone calls to “favorites”
  * **Compatibility and Standards:** Use of one technology encourages use of compatible products
    * More people using the MS Word .doc made rivals like WordPerfect less useful



Network effects generate positive feedback loops: more users makes the product more valuable, which attract more users. Inversely, a network with relatively fewer users is useless relative to more popular alternatives.

**The game is thus to be the first to gain a critical mass of users, thus kicking off the virtuous cycle.** Companies like Uber are willing to subsidize users in the belief that they can capture more value once they become the winner in the space.

The Internet has enabled faster acceleration of network effects, because of low marginal cost of reaching more users. Building phone lines to connect people was one pace of growth; allowing a user to instantaneously invite 100 friends, who can join within minutes, is wholly another.

### Avoid Two Growth Limiters

Design your high-growth company around these two obstacles.

#### Lack of Product/Market Fit

Product/market fit is having a product that can satisfy the market. If you don’t build what the market wants, then you won’t succeed, no matter how much money you throw at it.

Ways to improve product/market fit:

  * Get your product in the hands of users and iterate (Shortform note: see our summary of Lean Startup a comprehensive guide on this.)
  * Use your network and talk to smart people with relevant knowledge



#### Inability to Scale Operations

This is a nice problem to have, since it means you’re growing faster than you can handle, but it can’t be ignored if you’re growing quickly.

Inability to scale includes two types of limitations:

**Human Limitations of Scale**

As your team grows, communication and coordination become exponentially more complicated, since the number of pairwise combinations grows rapidly (n choose 2). Where a team of 5 has just 10 such connections, a team of 20 has 190, and a team of 100 has 4,950. The team grows 20x, but the number of unique connections grows by 495x.

Team growth therefore requires significant overhauls of management methods (explored later in the book)

Mitigation: Design a business model with as few human beings as possible.

  * WhatsApp supported 500 million users with 43 employees



Mitigation: Outsource work to contractors or automate it.

  * Note: Per Michael Porter, do not outsource anything that is key to your competitive advantage.



**Infrastructure Limitations of Scale**

You must avoid degradation of service when you have more users. Otherwise, a better executing competitor will steal your users.

  * Friendster was a social network phenomenon, but its servers couldn’t handle the growth. Profiles might take 40 seconds to load.
  * Tesla has more demand than it can service now.



Mitigation: Outsource logistics to large providers.

  * Outsource server hardware and management to AWS.
  * Outsource hardware manufacturing to Chinese factories.



### Proven Business Model Patterns

Some business models are more likely to scale to large businesses than others. Open-source software has been successful on some counts - user count, technology improvement, network effects - but has rarely resulted in large businesses, with Redhat being an outlier.

_Blitzscaling_ cites these **patterns as common features of massive businesses** :

#### Bits, Not Atoms

Being mostly software lets you scale with low marginal costs, increasing gross margin. It increases virality and speeds up product iteration. Global expansion is much easier.

Working with atoms raises marginal cost, thus slowing growth and reducing gross margins.

Examples

  * AdWords lets small businesses pay $5 for a small search ad campaign. Forget doing this with TV commercials, which require far more coordination with people, and thus requires high minimum purchases.
  * Netflix can maintain a huge back catalog of tens of thousands of content pieces, available on demand. TV stations and physical rentals come nowhere close.



#### Platforms

Build technology that enables others to build on top of yours and service users themselves. You capture some of the value you create.

Examples

  * Operating systems like Windows and iOS
  * Social networks like Facebook and WeChat
  * Software platforms like Unreal Engine for gaming or AWS.



#### Free or Freemium

Set the price free to grow through virality and network effects. Capture some value by charging premium users for extra features or by serving ads.

Examples

  * Ad-supported products (like Google, Facebook) are free for users. 
  * Dropbox and many SaaS companies are free to use, with limits.



#### Marketplaces

Match buyer and seller. Network effects are at play.

Larger marketplaces achieve liquidity better, which increases the number of successful transactions and create more value.

Examples

  * eBay, Airbnb, Uber, Steam, Google AdWords.



#### Subscriptions

SaaS was an innovation beyond traditional on-site software deployment, which required costly installation and servicing. Because of subscription’s lower servicing costs, it allowed targeting smaller businesses.

Recurring subscriptions tend to have more predictable revenue, as opposed to large software releases. This predictable revenue allows more aggressive long-term investments.

#### Digital Goods

Digital goods have no literal value, but do have emotional value to its users. They tend to have nearly 100% gross margins.

Examples

  * Japanese messaging app LINE’s stickers
  * Cosmetics items in video games.



#### Feeds

Present a constantly updating set of information to increase engagement. Learn what the users like or dislike to improve the feed and to target more compelling ads.

### Being Contrarian to Find New Business Models

It’s hard to find an opportunity in a hot space. If an opportunity is obvious, the chance you’ll be the one who succeeds is low. Furthermore, obvious opportunities will be chased by strong incumbents.

Instead, be contrarian and look where other people aren’t focusing. Pursuing an opportunity that conventional wisdom is ignoring gives you time to refine your strategy. There were plenty of reasons for Google, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber to not work - and in fact many investors passed on them.

“Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.” - Peter Thiel
