## Exercise: Assess and Reflect on Grant’s Legacy

Chernow suggests that Grant’s triumph in the Civil War and subsequent attempt to reconcile North and South had lasting effects on the US today. In this exercise, reflect on these effects and consider how Grant’s ideological views might fit into the US today.

* * *

To what extent do you believe there’s a cultural divide between the North and South in the US today? If you’ve lived in the US, answering this question might involve reflecting on your own experience; if not, it might involve reflecting on your external perceptions of the US.

Do you think there were any concrete strategies Grant could have employed to better reconcile the North-South divide as President? Why, or why not?

In contemporary US society, where do you think Grant might lie on the political spectrum? Explain your answer.
