## Exercise: Debate Markets and Morality

Explore the proper balance between markets and morality.

* * *

Imagine you were participating in Sandelâ€™s discussion about markets and morality. What role would you argue for markets to play in our society? Should we place greater restrictions on markets or remove existing restrictions on them? Explain your answer.

What other solutions would you propose to moderate the influence of markets in our lives? (For example, should we do a better job of educating children about civic values and intrinsic rewards?)
