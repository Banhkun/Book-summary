## Principle #5: Stay in Control Through Incremental Achievements

In the last chapter, we talked about the benefits of finding a way to rise above challenges by learning and growing from them. **In order to fall up, you have to feel that you have some control over your fate—but control can seem elusive when you’re stressed and overwhelmed.** In this chapter, we’ll discuss the benefits of feeling in control, the reasons you sometimes lose that feeling, and strategies for getting it back a little at a time.

Since your perception shapes your reality, the actual amount of control you have matters less than how much control you _think_ you have. That doesn’t mean that you should falsely and foolishly claim control over things like the weather—rather, it has to do with how you interpret situations, similarly to the way your explanatory style determines how you make sense of challenges. There are two lenses through which you can interpret your control:

  1. **People who have an _internal_ locus of control believe that they can have a direct impact on their futures.** When these people face a challenge or setback, they reflect on how they could have performed better, and then they improve for future situations. 
  2. **People who have an _external_ locus of control blame events and circumstances on external forces** over which they have no control. This perspective leads to learned helplessness because if you don’t feel that you have any control, then it doesn’t matter what you do or don’t do—so, why bother? People with this view not only shirk the blame for failures, but they also deny credit for successes, which robs them of the feelings of confidence and commitment that come with achievement. 



Feeling a sense of control is one of the biggest factors in both happiness and success, and it contributes to:

  * Increased motivation
  * Higher levels of job satisfaction 
  * Lower stress levels
  * Stronger relationships
  * Effective communication and problem-solving skills
  * Improved physical health



### Your Emotions Can Hijack Your Rationality

Despite all the benefits of feeling in control, your sense of self-efficacy can fly out the window when you feel overwhelmed. The reason for this is embedded in the evolutionary wiring of your brain. Your brain has two dueling influences:

  1. **The emotional system is a primitive part of the brain that takes over when you’re faced with danger or, simply, stress.** This part of the brain initiates reflexes like the fight-or-flight response, making it critical to survival because it enables you to act before you have a chance to think.
  2. **The rational system is responsible for carefully weighed logic and reasoning** that allows you to think before you react.



When you experience stress or fear and your emotional brain takes over, this is called emotional hijacking. While that response is helpful when confronting a life-threatening danger, it becomes problematic when the trigger is something more mundane, like a stressful project at work. **Emotional hijacking impedes your decision-making, problem-solving, and communication skills, which makes it more difficult to tackle the task at hand and exacerbates stress and anxiety** , creating a vicious cycle.

Furthermore, you don’t have to be facing a single, daunting challenge to experience emotional hijacking. When small, daily stresses can accumulate with time, a minor problem can become the straw that broke the camel’s back and lead to an emotional hijacking. When you’re on the verge or in the grips of an emotional hijacking, the effects of that hijacking can make it even more difficult to regain control.

(Shortform note: For a deeper explanation of emotional hijacking and tips on how to overcome it, read our summary of Emotional Intelligence. And, to learn more about how the dueling emotional and rational systems affect our decision-making, read our summary of Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

### Regain Control With Incremental Progress

Your emotional system hijacks your rational brain when you start to feel overwhelmed, and it’s easy to become overwhelmed when social and cultural norms push people to achieve big goals quickly: For example, new CEOs are expected to make the companies profitable within the first quarter, and new coaches are pressured to win games immediately. Lofty, often unrealistic goals become daunting, and, when you fall short, you may wonder whether you have any control at all. From there, it’s a short slide into a cycle of learned helplessness.

Instead of trying to win big right away, take an incremental approach to achieve steady, continuous improvement. **By tackling small, manageable goals, you not only make incremental progress, but you also gain confidence, knowledge, and resources that help you continue your effort.** For example, apply this to something as simple as a backlogged email inbox, which can cause consistent anxiety. Start by responding only to new emails. Then, address emails from the day before, and then the day before that. Limit the time you allot to this project each day—perhaps cap it at an hour—in order to break the large task into bite-sized chunks. This process helps to calm the emotional brain’s panic and instead tap into your problem-solving abilities.

The key is to start small. Follow these steps:

  1. **Raise your self-awareness by acknowledging your emotions and articulating how you’re feeling** , either by talking with someone or journaling. Research shows that the act of putting your feelings into words actually tames the power of negative emotions. 
  2. **Identify what you can control and what you can’t.** Once you’ve verbalized what is causing you stress, make a list on a piece of paper or a spreadsheet of the aspects that you can affect and those that are beyond your control. Let go of your concerns about the things you can’t impact, and focus your energy on the areas you can control. 
  3. Look at the list of things you can control, and **create one small goal that you can accomplish right away.** This small achievement won’t fix the whole problem, but it will give you a sense of accomplishment, control, and motivation to continue. 
  4. **Pick another small goal, and accomplish that.** Repeat this process—progressively taking on larger tasks—until you’ve resolved the issue.
