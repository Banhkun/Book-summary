## Exercise: How Can You Focus on the Positive?

Developing a positive thought pattern takes practice.

* * *

List three things that you’re grateful for today.

If you were to make a daily habit of writing this gratitude list, how would you incorporate it into your routine?

How could you involve other people in this ritual, either at home or at work (for example, by having each person recite their list at the dinner table or the meeting room)?

Think about your schedule for the day and week ahead. Identify one opportunity you hadn’t previously recognized. (For example, attending a work conference may be an opportunity to get to know a new coworker better.)
