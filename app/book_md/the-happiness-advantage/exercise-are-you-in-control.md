## Exercise: Are You in Control?

Regain your sense of control over a daunting task or situation.

* * *

Describe something thatâ€™s currently causing you to feel stressed or overwhelmed (such as a project at work or an issue among your family members).

Explain why it makes you feel stressed.

List two or three things about this situation over which you have control, and two or three that are beyond your control.

Based on the things you can control, what is one goal you can accomplish today?
