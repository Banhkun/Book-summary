## Principle #4: Learn and Grow Through Adversity

As much as you may be able to improve your positive mindset, it can be particularly difficult to be optimistic in the face of adversity. When you confront a challenge, you have three options:

  1. Keep circling around the problem, which will result in no change. 
  2. Make bad choices that create further negative consequences, thereby putting you in an even worse position than before. 
  3. Take the setback as an opportunity to build resilience, improve your abilities, and increase your fortitude. This is the Third Path, or the act of “falling up.”



**Adversity is inevitable, but, if you stay positive during challenging times, you will not only carry on, but also learn and grow through the process.** In fact, the most traumatic and heart-wrenching experiences can also be the most positive and transformative when people remain optimistic and find ways to rise above their hardships. People who choose to fall up in the face of traumas—such as chronic and life-threatening illnesses, natural disasters, and military combat—experience Post-Traumatic Growth or Adversarial Growth, which results in increased:

  * Compassion
  * Openness
  * Personal strength
  * Satisfaction with life
  * Self-confidence
  * Spirituality
  * Appreciation for and intimacy in social relationships



**Instead of seeing failure as something to avoid or endure, when you learn to fall up, failure becomes an invaluable opportunity for growth.** When you fall down, don’t simply get back up and return to the status quo—take a deliberate approach to your challenge and fall _up_ to greater heights. Successful people and organizations frame failure as a stepping stone to greatness, and one that forces them to:

  * Be more creative to work around obstacles
  * Accelerate their learning to find alternative routes and solutions
  * Increase their competitiveness to avoid getting snagged on the same hurdles in the future 



Many companies and organizations highly value failing early and often because those failures provide opportunities to learn before investing too heavily in a particular model, project, or approach. For example, the CEO of Coca-Cola is known for beginning each of his annual investor meetings by talking about all of the products the company created that year but never launched. Rather than a parade of the company’s failures, the presentation serves as an opportunity to highlight lessons learned and to reflect on how those lessons will position Coca-Cola to grow to greater heights.

### Learned Helplessness Obscures the Third Path

Even without knowing the big-picture benefits of the Third Path, anyone could see that moving past an obstacle is better than letting it defeat you. So, why doesn’t everyone choose to fall up? Simply put, when you get knocked down, it’s hard to pick yourself up and carry on. Generally, when faced with the stress of a crisis, most people get so caught up in their misfortune they forget that a Third Path exists.

**When you’re defeated by failures often enough, giving up becomes habitual.** This phenomenon, called learned helplessness, explains why some people don’t even bother trying to improve their circumstances. This effect was first discovered in the 1960s, when scientists put dogs into a compartment and delivered a small shock every time they rang a bell. After the dogs had learned to expect the shock, the researchers moved the dogs into a box with two compartments—one with shocks, and one without. Although the dogs could have easily jumped over the divider into the safe compartment, when they heard the bell, they simply stayed put and endured the shock. The dogs’ conditioning had taught them to be helpless.

A similar experiment showed that the same is true of humans: Two groups of people were put into rooms with panels of buttons that would supposedly turn off a blaring noise. However, the first group was given a trick panel, and, despite their best efforts, they couldn’t turn off the noise. By contrast, the second group’s buttons worked, and they quickly and easily silenced the loud noise. Afterward, both groups entered a new room with panels that turned off the noise with a simple hand movement—but, while the second group quickly shut off the noise, the first group had been conditioned to give up, and they didn’t even bother trying.

Learned helplessness prevents people from even considering a Third Path. Making matters worse, learned helplessness tends to spread to all areas of life. In other words, if you develop learned helplessness at work, you’re likely to also give up when you face personal challenges. **Once you submit to helplessness in all areas of your life, you’re on the path to pessimism and depression, which also impede your ability to see opportunities to rise above defeat, creating a vicious cycle.**

### How to Fall Up

**In order to find a way to fall up, look at adversity as a building block for your personal growth, rather than an obstacle in your path.** People who find and follow the Third Path tend to do so through:

  * Acceptance of the situation
  * Coping mechanisms that involve confronting the problem (instead of hiding behind denial or avoidance)
  * Optimism
  * Reinterpreting the situation as positive



To change your mindset, examine it. Consider this hypothetical scenario: You walk into a bank where there are 50 other people, and a robber walks in, shoots his gun once, and the bullet gets you in the arm. Were you lucky or unlucky? People who call it unlucky point to the bad fortune of walking into a bank as it’s being robbed, and that, out of 50 people, they were the ones to get hit. By contrast, people who call it lucky say that they could have been shot fatally, or that the bullet could have hit a child.

Both groups base their answer on a counterfact, which is a hypothetical alternative scenario that they use to frame the reality: People who deem the bank shooting unlucky imagine a far better outcome and are therefore disappointed in the results, while the lucky group imagines a far worse scenario and are thus content with the outcome. You have the power to create your counterfact—**a counterfact that encourages positivity brings the motivation and performance benefits that we’ve discussed, while a negative one distorts your perspective to make obstacles seem greater than they actually are.**

In addition to examining your counterfacts, assess your explanatory style, or the way in which you make sense of a challenging event:

  * People with an optimistic explanatory style view adversity as specific and temporary. 
  * People with a pessimistic explanatory style view adversity as widespread and permanent, which leads to learned helplessness.



Explanatory style impacts success in all areas of life—including academic success, athletic performance, physical recovery from medical procedures, and productivity at work. A study at one insurance company revealed that salespeople with an optimistic explanatory style sold 37 percent more than those with a pessimistic style, and the most optimistic sellers sold 88 percent more than the most pessimistic. Following the study, that company began basing its hiring on explanatory styles more than industry knowledge; as a result, turnover dropped and market share soared.

#### Falling Up Strategy: Use ABCD

Practice is key in learning how to find and follow the Third Path to success. When you are faced with a challenge, follow the ABCD model:

1) **A is for adversity** , which is the challenging event or situation. Accept that you can’t change it.

2) **B is for belief** , which is how you interpret the event. How do you explain why this happened and how it will impact your future? Do you use a positive or negative explanatory style?

3) **C is for the consequences you’ll face** as a result of the challenging situation. Your consequences actually depend more on your belief than the adversity: Positive explanatory style (believing that the problem is short-term and a learning opportunity) increases the likelihood of positive consequences, while pessimistic framing (believing that the problem is permanent and disastrous) leads to negative consequences.

4) **D is for disputation**. When you catch yourself facing pessimistic beliefs and negative consequences, dispute them. Remind yourself that your belief is dictating this outcome, and that you can change your belief to a more optimistic one. Pretend that you’re disputing a friend’s pessimistic belief—challenge the basis for the belief, and consider other possible interpretations.

In a phenomenon called immune neglect, people often underestimate how effective their psychological immune system is at helping them bounce back from difficulties. As a result, when facing adversity, people typically overestimate how unhappy they will be and for how long. However, if you’re confronting a truly significant problem, try decatastrophizing, or acknowledging that you’re facing a real challenge while reassessing whether it’s _as bad_ as you first thought. **Things might be bad, but they are rarely as bad as your mind makes them out to be.**
