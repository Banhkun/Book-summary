## Exercise: What Positive Habit Will You Form?

Turn healthy behaviors into habits for long-term benefits.

* * *

What is one positive habit you want to start (for example, writing in your journal every day)?

How can you reduce the activation energy to less than 20 seconds (for example, keep your journal and a pen on your bedside table)?

List one or two rules you can implement to support your habit.

What is the counterproductive bad habit that impedes you from doing this positive habit? Or what is a different bad habit that you want to stop doing?

How can you increase the activation to that habit to be more than 20 seconds?
