## Enron Digs a Deeper Hole

The bad practices were begun to hide losses and prop up stock price. As the fundamental core of Enron failed to yield actual revenue, Enron felt forced to expand its deception, putting off its day of reckoning to later.

### Enron’s Two Big (Failed) Bets

All the financial machinations around SPEs were meant as **temporary measures while Enron bet big on its next two major businesses**. Both of them, however, sustained massive losses.

#### Enron Energy Services - Retail Utilities

Enron’s historical bread and butter was large wholesale contracts with commercial buyers. But it believed there was a coming wave of deregulation, where federal/state governments would release municipalities from local monopolies to allow the free market to drive prices down. Enron could then sell directly to businesses and homes.

In reality, the federal government wasn’t interested in intervening in state affairs, and **only a few states started pilot programs toward deregulation** (New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, California).

In the few hotspots it could work in, Enron campaigned aggressively to recruit consumer households to sign up, promising lower utility costs. However, the local suppliers fought back, pulling their political strings and running ads against the big guy coming into town.

In the end, **few consumers really signed up for Enron’s services** \- 50k in California (1% of the market) and 300 in New Hampshire.

**After the residential failure, Enron targeted businesses**. This was enticing - a big company spends millions a year for light, heating, and cooling. Couldn’t Enron get a share of this?

The commodity part of this business was actually a money-loser - Enron’s hope was that it would make money on contracts to reduce energy costs and increase efficiency.

**Enron signed lots of deals at below-market utility rates** \- Ocean Spray for a $116MM 10-year agreement; Owens Corning for a $1B 10-year contract. The “total contract value” (TCV) was $8.5 billion - an impressive number on the surface. But TCV bore no relation to revenue or profits - **it merely represented the cost of all the utility needs a customer had outsourced to EES**.

Regardless, this new TCV became the sought-after metric of the day, since it gave the appearance of Enron signing big business. As usual, **Enron deal makers were given bonuses on total TCV and the projected profitability of the deal (which were wildly optimistic). Naturally, a lot of bad deals were signed very quickly.**

The operational requirements of this new business put Enron out of its depth - servicing customers directly required customer service, attention to detail, and hard manual work that Enron executives referred to derisively as “butt crack” work.

Enron tried to argue that efficiency improvements would help them make the deals profitable, but soon it became clear those efficiency improvements wouldn’t pay for themselves.

#### Enron Broadband

In 1999, Internet stocks were overheated. Put “broadband” in your company somewhere, and the stock price would rise without tying to fundamentals.

  * Skilling calculated that every $1 invested in broadband would pay back $20 in market capitalization.



Skilling promised such large returns that the **division was strongly pressured to make deals happen**. They burnt a lot of money ($500MM a year) trying to find a valuable business plan.

The larger vision was that **broadband might ultimately become a tradable commodity** , like natural gas or oil. But this vision failed to meet reality:

  * Physical technicalities got in the way. Internet lines were set up so sharing bandwidth wasn’t possible. In one sense, internet pipes were parallel pipes that never intersected.
  * Enron promised that it was inventing new routing technology that would enable bandwidth sharing, but this never made it out of the lab.
  * Meanwhile, the incumbent telephone companies were uninterested in hooking into Enron’s market. This would turn bandwidth into a commodity that would cut into their control of markets.



Enron even began **partnering with Blockbuster to build content streaming services**. Its rosy projections made napkin-calculations on how many cities they would enter, the market share they’d have, and the # of movies users would buy. In classic Enron fashion, **it booked $110 million in profits from this deal immediately, before anything had materialized**.

The reality of executing on content streaming was difficult. The content owners had massive leverage and were wary of entering a distribution medium they couldn’t control. Streaming from the Internet to the TV required expensive special boxes. And incumbent DSL providers controlled access to the last mile and were tough in negotiations.

The trials were tiny - 300 households involved - and the ultimate real sales from this were laughable, in the dozens of dollars. An Enron executive handed the business manager $5 and said “there, I doubled your revenue.”

The deal fell apart months after announcement, with Enron claiming Blockbuster hadn’t lined up content providers like promised.

Even though the failed deal should have been written down as a loss, Enron reasoned that it should actually be a _gain_ \- Enron would no longer have to share the proceeds!

* * *

Unfortunately, both Enron Energy Services and Enron Broadband bets were off the mark. Enron spent billions on unprofitable projects. This put Enron in an impossible position - **having spent all that money and raised expectations, there was no room for failure**. They could only hide the massive losses through more machinations.

### Andy Fastow Profits from Deals

Meanwhile, CFO Andy Fastow positioned himself aggressively to profit from Enron’s deals.

The cash-losing EES and broadband divisions chewed through so much money that **Enron became even more dependent on Fastow’s deals** to avoid appearance of losses.

Fastow set up private equity funds (named LJM) that would be the 3% “independent capital” for the SPE deals that Enron was addicted to.

  * As a part owner, he would earn “normal fund returns” like management fees and 20% of carry.
  * He also invited select Enron lieutenants and friends to participate - ultimately, they would get an 180x return.



The possible conflict of interest was obvious to most concerned - Enron employees in the know, the board, and LPs of Fastow’s funds. But they all stepped out of the way for their own reasons:

  * Enron employees were worried about being berated by Fastow and having their ratings punished. Objectors were publicly transferred to other departments out of Fastow’s way.
  * The board was comforted by assurances that all deals would be reviewed by the Chief Accounting Officer, and Fastow could be removed at any time. (In reality, the CAO was a rubber stamp.) Further, the board were likely emboldened by the stratospheric rise in Enron’s stock price in the late 90s.
  * LPs wanted access to Enron deals, and Fastow made clear that participation in his private fund was required to stay in his good graces.



Many of the deals were rigged in LJM’s favor - **Enron essentially guaranteed LJM against losses** and bought back bad assets at inflated prices.

  * Why would Enron do such bad deals? LJM’s job was to make Enron look good - warehouse troubled assets, getting them off Enron’s balance sheet and allowing Enron to book profits and cashflow. **Enron needed LJM so desperately to keep up appearances of earnings that it structured great deals for LJM**.
  * The deals were structured in a way that implied the fundamental belief that Enron stock would never fall.
  * Some deals were outright fraudulent - three Natwest partners deceived their employer on the value of portfolio assets and arranged transactions to pocket $2.4 million each.



Fastow set up 3 of these funds, and was angling for a 4th that would raise $1 billion and be his ticket out of Enron. (At the end, Fastow’s total take would reach $60 million.)

### Energy Traders Take Bigger Risks

Meanwhile, the energy traders were making lots of money in the volatile markets. They were one of the few really profitable centers of the company, giving credence to Skilling’s vision of a next-generation, asset-light energy company.

In the early inefficient markets, traders used fundamental research to make smart trades - like finding dam water levels to estimate future water prices or using weather to estimate fuel prices. Money came so easily they were bewildered.

They made even more when they launched **Enron Online** \- a virtual trading floor for energy futures.

  * Enron served as the marketmaker, representing both sides of the trades. This dramatically increased the capital requirements (the danger will become apparent later).
  * Its dominant position, as well as proprietary info on what outside traders were doing on their platform, **allowed Enron to possibly manipulate markets to move prices in its favor**. Enron supposedly did 25-50% of the trades in gas futures and electricity.
  * They justified manipulating prices as just mere supply and demand - “traders don’t determine long-term price. No one _had_ to use EOL - it wasn’t their fault others couldn’t come up with anything better.”



Within Enron, the traders saw themselves as the intellectual elite and the salvation of the company, since they were actually making money.

#### Enron Trading and California’s Blackouts

Enron traders participated in California’s partial deregulation of electricity, becoming enmeshed in the controversy around California’s blackouts and emergencies.

The regulatory change: California opened electrical grids to competition in a market, where electricity had previously restricted it to certain providers with controlled costs. Utilities had to sell off their generating facilities and buy power on the open market.

But the regulation was **partial** \- price caps were instituted; rates to consumers were fixed; and utilities were precluded from longer-term agreements that might have allowed hedging and reduced spikes in prices.

  * Other rules (made with good intentions): if a power line became congested, companies would be paid fees to relieve the congestion - even if there wasn’t enough demand to cause congestion in the first place.



Enron took advantage of the rules to manipulate markets, to the detriment of consumers:

  * Energy producers kept power plants off to spike prices.
  * Electricity rates were tied to the price of natural gas, which Enron was also in a natural position to control.
  * Enron got paid for electricity through routes that didn’t have the bandwidth to transmit it. The utilities then had to hustle to find last-minute power at high prices.
  * Enron submitted schedules reflecting illusory power demand.
  * Enron would sell power as reserves without actually having it.
  * Enron exported power from California and brought it back in desperate times (“megawatt laundering.”)
  * The partners (out of state utilities, power suppliers) were happy to oblige because they made money too.



Ultimately **utilities were forced to pay far more for power than they could collect from customers** , who were still paying regulated rates. One incumbent went bankrupt.

Vicious cycle: because of this instability, power producers began refusing to ship to California. (Later the US Energy Secretary imposed a state of emergency, requiring marketers to sell to California.)

**If Enron had a long-term view** , it would have seen that California’s experiment needed to do well to make bigger business for it later. But it held destructive short-term views, like “other people are doing this too” and “California didn’t fully deregulate like we suggested so it deserves what it gets.”

Free market supporters claim that California’s partial deregulation set up a worse scenario than total deregulation, and California didn’t do enough to create enough electricity supply (for example, by removing price caps to incent development or realizing that hydroelectric power was subject to risk from low rainfall).

Ultimately Enron lawyers told the traders to stop.

#### Enron Trading Takes Bigger RIsks

Their hubris in energy trading led them to launch trading ventures in a host of other commodities - steel, paper, lumber, metals, bandwidth. Skilling thought Enron could be the market maker for everything! None of the others launched to much success.

They continued taking progressively riskier positions, breaking the trading limits.

As always, mark-to-market became a risk - they made their books look better through optimistic projections.

Long-term trades wouldn’t deliver cashflow immediately. **So despite being one of the few profitable centers, the trading floor also became dependent on Fastow’s deals.**

In 2001, Enron took a large short position on electricity (forecasting lower energy prices and less volatility due to the weakening economy and conservation).

### Enron International is In Trouble

Meanwhile, former head of Enron International Rebecca Mark was in deep trouble at water services company Azurix.

With typical Enron hubris, Rebecca Mark thought water was easy and the incumbents were ancient. They would come in, make large deals, and figure out the details later. They also anticipated privatization of water supply, and a coming water crisis.

Immediately they ran into competition with two global heavyweights who competed aggressively for contracts to service municipalities.

Azurix was also in money trouble - the Wessex deal had cost a lot, and Enron saddled Azurix with large debt. So Azurix IPO’d in June 1999, raising $800 million at a stock price of $22 - despite people knowing Azurix obviously wasn’t ready to go public.

Now a public company, **Rebecca Mark stressed the _appearance_ of making big deals to buttress their stock value**. In the few deals that Azurix won, they vastly overbid, largely out of desperation to signal momentum.

  * Azurix won a contract in Buenos Aires, where the operations they inherited were so poor they couldn’t bill 40% of their customers and the facilities were lacking basic maintenance. It became clear Azurix would never make money on that deal.



4 months after IPO, Azurix had fallen to $13 a share; on a pessimistic earnings call in November, it fell to $8.

By the end of 2000, Azurix had less than $100MM in operating profit, down from $232MM at its start. Its debt load had quadrupled to $2 billion. Enron announced it would acquire the public shares at $8.375 a share.

Jeff Skilling, Rebecca Mark’s rival, took every opportunity to ridicule Azurix as a failed business model, in comparison to his asset-light “logistics” and trading businesses.

Enron believed that Azurix was so unimportant that if it failed, it wouldn’t have any effect on Enron. This later proved wrong. For instance, Enron had $1 billion of debt they were not clearly on the hook for.

(To Mark’s credit, Azurix at least represented real assets and cashflow - low, but cashflow nonetheless).

### Enron’s Stock Price Rockets

![smartest-guys-stock-price-1.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/smartest-guys-stock-price-1.png)

Despite all this trouble bubbling under the surface, in the heady period of 1999-2000,**Enron stock exploded in price** , reaching ~90 in Aug 1999 before being split 2:1, then doubling to reach 90 again in Aug 2000 for a market cap of $70 billion. It outperformed the S&P by over 200%.

This is a testament to how powerfully its accounting distortions disguised the true nature of the problems brewing.

  * 2000 revenues showed $100 billion, 100% over 1999. Earnings hit $1.3 billion, up 25% per share.



Enron was paraded as a visionary company, building new businesses like Enron Online in the Internet era.

To the public, Enron only ever expressed certainty of being a juggernaut. Said Enron, **it would inevitably own 20% of every major market, which meant its fledgling businesses were already worth billions, and should be priced accordingly**. After such an announcement in their analyst meeting in Jan 2000, Enron’s stock rose 26% in a single day.

Enron employees started drinking the kool-aid. They thought they couldn’t make mistakes and were bulletproof.

(Shortform note: also consider yourself in this situation: Enron’s stock price has quadrupled in the past 2 years. How easy would it be to overlook bad behavior in these heady times?)
