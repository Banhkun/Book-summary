## Shortform Exclusive: How to Avoid an Enron

Here we invert the question - how do you avoid building an Enron? Make sure you avoid the bad practices of Enron with this checklist.

  * Don’t tolerate bad behavior just because they’re making money for you.
  * Don’t avoid doing diligence because you believe that everyone else has done their due diligence. Everyone else likely believes the same, and it’s possible no one has done diligence.
  * Do sanity checks even if you fear being called dumb. Lose your ego around being intelligent - if something seems too complicated for you to understand, it’s probably not because you’re dumb. Someone might be actively hiding something.
  * Set compensation schemes correctly - in service of long-term value and sustainability, not in terms of misleading short-term metrics.
  * Avoid these standard excuses that are more reassuring than they should be.
    * “It’s fine to be over-optimistic in our estimates - analysts don’t _have_ to believe it.”
    * “The proper controls are in place. I could be removed at any time if I were doing something wrong. The company doesn’t _have_ to do any of these deals - they can reject them at any time.”
    * “This will have no impact on our earnings/statements.”
  * Don’t let management lose sight of the fundamental nature of business and relax their oversight.
  * Avoid too-clever schemes that stretch the rules for the promise of a quick return.
  * Don’t overlook seemingly small things like compensation - even small percentage incentives can contribute to the problem. Don’t be sloppier than you need to be, just because small terms don’t seem to matter.
  * Don’t believe what the press writes about you (both positive and negative). They see so little of the situation that they’re often not reliable.
  * Don’t use superficial markers of progress (deals on paper, valuation of deal) instead of real fundamental progress (cashflow). 
  * In good heady times, don’t lose grasp on the discipline that got you there. This is when you get overconfident and make bad bets.
  * Don’t wait to bite the bullet on bad news. Avoid hoping for a bet-it-all strategy that will pay off and rescue the company.
  * Be careful doubling down on a key assumption that, if falsified, would cripple everything. In Enron’s case, they believed their stock price would never fall, allowing them to use Enron stock to prop up shaky deals.
  * Don’t avoid taking seriously the concerns of employees on the ground. Be careful of dismissing them as not seeing the bigger picture.
  * When the financial grim reaper comes, clamp down spending and appearances immediately. Don’t fly on private jets.
