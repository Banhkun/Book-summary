## Enron's Final Moments

The nightmare scenario is more or less what happened at the end of 2001. Over a series of months, Enron collapsed, one step after another.

Internal rumors began circulating about issues at Enron.

  * Accountants looking into the SPE deals realized that the falling value of assets in the SPEs, along with the falling Enron stock price, were going to become difficult to pay off. **“It’s a bit like robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back 2 years later.”**
  * It was known that EES’s losses were being hidden in wholesale. In an employee letter: “This is common knowledge...and is actually joked about.”



The SPE Raptor deals ran into trouble.

  * The Raptor deals became underwater by 9 figures, especially in the market hit after September 11.
  * Andersen auditors realized they made an accounting error - Raptor restructuring had been booked as a boost in shareholder equity and needed to be reversed, costing equity $1.2 billion.
    * This would be recorded as a simple equity reduction, rather than a restatement, which would admit mistakes and trigger SEC inquiries and lawsuits.
  * COO Whalley argued to take the hit and clean up. They felt Enron would recover after cleaning up.
  * To make the accounting look more favorable, Enron wanted the correction as a nonrecurring charge. **Since this was originally booked as operating profit, this was grossly inappropriate**. Andersen put up a fight, but ultimately Enron forced their hand.



On Oct 16 2001, Enron shared its third quarter report. They were sanguine as usual: “recurring Q3 earnings of $.03 per diluted share; reports nonrecurring charges of $1.01 billion...reaffirms recurring estimates.”

  * The Wall Street Journal attacked the nature of the writedowns in a series of articles. 
  * Prompted by these articles, the SEC began an informal inquiry into Enron’s dealings with Fastow’s partnerships. Announcement of this sank the stock 20% to $20.65
  * Oct 17: Moody’s announced it was placing Enron’s debt on review for a possible downgrade. It focused on 3 issues: negative operating cashflow, slow progress in asset sales, and more writeoffs involving Dabhol, Azurix, and broadband.
  * Oct 23: Andy Fastow was interviewed about his income from the LJM deals. The next day, Whalley fired him.



On Oct 24, 2001, Enron was unable to roll its “commercial paper,” short-term loans used for day-to-day expenses. It had no operating cash.

  * It desperately tried to make deals for cash - like opening up its books - but no one was willing to bite. It had to draw down $3 billion in backup credit lines.
  * The last-ditch solution was to sell their pipelines, the only steady cash generator Enron had left.
  * Enron’s trading also required credit to survive - trading partners would start demanding cash collateral.



Through this turmoil, Arthur Andersen began realizing how bad their work with Enron would make them look.

  * Andersen had previously paid fines for accounting fraud at Waste Management - it had a cease-and-desist from the SEC from misconduct. In that case, Andersen’s records had provided regulators with plenty of proof - it wanted to avoid that mistake again.
  * **There was a shredding frenzy in both Enron and Arthur Andersen** (following normal “document retention procedures”) until an official subpoena on Oct 26 forced them to stop.
  * Andersen also saw major mistakes in Enron’s SPEs accounting, with the 3% not being truly independent capital. This meant the deals had to go back on Enron’s books. 



Once dancing to Enron’s tune, the bankers realized their new leverage over Enron and took advantage.

  * Beyond its credit line, Enron needed an extra $2 billion in cash. Banks refused to let it borrow the loans unsecured like before - now it demanded the only collateral remaining - the pipeline systems - and exclusive business with Enron for the next 18 months. 



In early November, a possible savior came in a possible merger with smaller energy company Dynegy.

  * For years, Enron took pot shots at Dynegy for being a tiny wannabe and threatened to steamroll it in every business line. The Dynegy CEO now saw a chance to get even, inherit its valuable trading operations, and vault his company to leading position in energy trading.
  * The structure - Dynegy would buy Enron at market price. ChevronTexaco (26% owner of Dynegy) would provide $2.5 billion ($1.5 billion now, $1 on closing).
    * In reality, this was undercapitalized from the start - Enron assumed that having ChevronTexaco onboard would be so reassuring its capital needs would shrink.
  * Dynegy estimated it would boost earnings per share by 35%, with over $200 billion in revenue and over $90 billion in assets.
  * The traders weren’t happy about this deal. They had already felt they were carrying Enron, and now they felt small dumb Dynegy was unworthy of buying Enron. The traders banded together to demand bonuses in cash upfront, or they’d blow up the deal.



Meanwhile, the SEC required that Enron disclose the Fastow partnerships and restate its earnings on Thursday November 8.

  * Also, all three ratings agencies cut Enron to one notch above junk by Nov 5. Shares went below $10.
  * On Wednesday, the stock dropped 25% on news that Enron was unable to line up $2 billion from private investors.



On Friday, Enron announced the merger with Dynegy. Shares rose 16% to $10.

On Tuesday, November 13, $2 billion arrived for Enron. They took a breath, but it wasn’t enough.

  * Enron realized it was going to need to repay more than $9 billion by the end of 2002. It would need a _lot_ more money.
  * Enron’s trading partners continued demanding collateral. The number of transactions plummeted, and trading profits crashed. 
  * An SPE (Rawhide) was structured to unwind if its debt had been downgraded to one step above junk. It now had to repay $690 million in debt.
  * In six days, Enron had burned through a billion dollars. Its stock fell to below $5.



On Dynegy’s side, the lack of transparent disclosure of possible problems and Ken Lay’s insistence on maintaining control of Enron crashed the deal. The banks weren’t coming up with more money that Enron needed.

On Wednesday November 28, **the rating agencies cut Enron into junk territory**.

  * This triggered $3.9 billion in debt.
  * Dynegy officially canceled the deal.
  * Enron Online shut down. Shares dropped to $0.61



Banks moved to minimize their losses, asking for return of collateral. Enron didn’t have it.

On Sunday, December 2, Enron filed for bankruptcy.

Here is Enron’s complete stock price history:
