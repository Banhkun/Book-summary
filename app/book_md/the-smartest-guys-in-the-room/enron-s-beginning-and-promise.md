## Enron's Beginning and Promise

_The Smartest Guys in the Room_ chronicles the history of Enron, from beginning to end. Putatively, it began with good intentions and a believable vision. Then, as it focused on short-term stock prices, it became corrupted by deceptive accounting, making more egregious bets.

### Ken Lay Sees an Opportunity

Ken Lay, founder and CEO of Enron, believed in efficient markets. The 1970s energy crisis caused natural gas to become deregulated. Lay saw an opportunity to profit from this deregulation.

Lay had served in various roles in gas companies before heading Houston Natural Gas (HNG) in 1984. His vision was to control a large fraction of pipeline which would allow better negotiating leverage.

Larger Omaha company InterNorth, in danger of being taken over by corporate raiders, wanted to defensively increase its size and debt load. It acquired HNG in 1985, with terms very favorable for HNG. Ultimately, Lay gained control of the board and became CEO of the company, renaming it Enron.

Things didn’t immediately work out quite as well as Lay hoped. A glut of gas on the market depressed prices and put Enron’s long-term gas contracts underwater. Management of the combined entity was tough, riddled with politics. As a public company, Enron was desperate for real earnings. It turns out for all his enthusiasm, **Lay didn’t personally have strategic insights** into how to create a new business model in this new deregulated world.

### Enron Builds a Futures Market

In this strategic vacuum, a consultant had an answer.

In 1987, Jeff Skilling, a McKinsey consultant who worked with Enron, envisioned Enron building a **futures market** , turning natural gas into a commodity (then a novel concept).

Put simplistically, Enron would be the mediator between gas producers and gas buyers, with Enron earning the spread.

Enron was able to loan gas producers more money than banks, because it knew the clearing price of the gas. So producers signed contracts to supply gas to Enron, in exchange for upfront money to develop reserves. Enron could then trade the future contracts, just like oil futures.

Enron’s physical assets, ability to actually deliver gas, and its history and reputation gave it an edge over Wall St competitors who later entered the industry.

Securitization of gas lifted capital and balance sheets as constraints on growth. Selling its loans allowed Enron to eliminate debt from balance sheets and get cash to grow further.

This later became Enron Capital and Trade Resources (ECT) and by 1996 it made $280 million in EBIT, more than 20% of Enron’s earnings.

### Enron International

The Enron International arm began in Teesside in the UK, with a natural gas cogeneration plant built in 1991. This plan supplied both electricity and heat to the local area. This was a successful project, prompting energy companies to ravenously seek similar deals in developing economies.

Rebecca Mark headed Enron International. Fueled by a **compensation scheme that rewarded closing deals and not actually _building_ the businesses**, Rebecca Mark globetrotted and closed deals in dozens of countries. She positioned Enron as the “solver of the unsolvable problem.” She was hungry to come up with projects bigger and better than Teesside.

The projects were often troubled. The largest scandal was in Dabhol, India. A province struck a deal very favorable to Enron, guaranteeing a long-term purchase of highly priced energy. The Indian population revolted, seeing it as rapacious globalization. This stymied development for years.

Furthermore, the financing for projects was often unclear. Enron International hoped the funding they would come from non-Enron sources, but sometimes Enron ended up guaranteeing the debt.

Enron International fed Ken Lay’s desire to hobnob with international luminaries like Kissinger and heads of state, making it less likely to be scrutinized.

By 1996, Enron International accounted for 15% of Enron’s earnings.

### Leadership Changes

#### Rich Kinder

In 1996, Enron COO Rich Kinder was expecting the CEO job. Around this time, Ken Lay was expected to go into politics, but he knew he wouldn’t get a political appointment under Democratic Clinton. Lay also didn’t respect the work that Kinder did. So Lay ousted Kinder, who founded energy company Kinder Morgan afterward (still a healthy company today worth around $45 billion as of time of this writing).

Kinder was a voice of reason within Enron, expecting discipline and skeptical of bad deals. After the collapse of Enron, some suspected Enron could have saved itself had he been appointed CEO.

#### The RIse of Jeff Skilling

With the power vacuum, Skilling (head of Enron’s trading operations) maneuvered into the COO role, basically by threatening to quit if he didn’t get it. This triggered a number of changes:

**1) The focus shifted to trading as the core of Enron’s business.** Physical assets that actually dealt with supplying energy were sold off.

  * EOG (Enron Oil and Gas) was spun off. It still survives today as a public company, EOG Resources.



2) Enron’s trading scope expanded outside natural gas. Their aim was to become “The World’s Leading Energy Company.” They expanded into electricity, and they engaged in plant deals from gas plants to water, steel, and paper. The promise was huge - if Enron could create an electricity-trading business and claim 20% of it, the payoff would be enormous.

  * **But they overextended, believing the markets were more similar to gas than they really were**. For example, as an outsider to electricity, Enron was feared as the big player that incumbents shouldn’t partner with.



3) Enron International head Rebecca Mark was sidelined and knew she wouldn’t rise further in management. She decided to buy a British water utility, forming the company Azurix. (This would later end in failure, described in a later chapter.)

4) Skilling set up **a Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) department** , which publicly was believed to be watertight and having strong veto power over risky deals. Stock analysts believed Enron had tight risk management capabilities, which gave Enron the leeway to take on more risk than other companies.

  * In reality, RAC was just a yesman, with a weak manager in place who didn’t fight against bad deals.
  * RAC staff also faced strong pressure to close deals to hit quarterly numbers. Enron’s staff had a peer review system that was a key component of promotions and compensation. Deal originators within Enron threatened poor peer reviews for RAC peers who didn’t approve deals.



### Wall Street Expectations

Enron promised Wall Street 15% growth a year. This obsession with meeting earnings targets powered the deception that was later to come.

In 1997, Enron made $105MM, a 82% drop from 1996.

  * Gas trading had become more competitive. Banks were making loans, and buyers were loath to sign long-term origination deals.
  * Some earlier deals had turned out unwise and missed projections, requiring writedowns.



In this environment, where Enron made aggressive promises to investors, but had shakey core operations, it couldn’t resist the temptation to conduct fraud to meet numbers.
