## Chapter 6: Climate Change

As a result of the accelerations in technology and globalization, **climate change—what the author calls “Mother Nature”—is also accelerating at a pace greater than anything seen before in human history.** For example, on July 31, 2015, Bandar Mahshahr, Iran recorded a heat index (a combination of heat and humidity) of 163 degrees Fahrenheit, one of the most extreme readings ever recorded anywhere in the world.

### How Did We Get Here?

The earth formed about 4.6 billion years ago and scientists divide this time into chunks (epochs, periods, and eras) based on major events that happened at certain times.

**For most of the earth’s existence, the climate swung between hot periods and ice ages and human life as we know it couldn’t exist** —the climate was too unpredictable for agriculture, city-building, or industrial revolutions.

Then, after the last major ice age approximately 11,500 years ago, the earth entered the _Holocene_ epoch. **In the _Holocene_ , the climate and environment created a perfect balance for human life. **The atmosphere contained the right amount of gases to keep the global temperature survivable, forests released enough oxygen to make the atmosphere breathable, and freshwater was plentiful.

During the Industrial Revolution, however, human activity started to affect the balanced conditions of the _Holocene_. For example, burning fossil fuels released greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere, which warms the planet.

In the 1960s-1970s, middle classes all over the globe emerged and more people began driving cars and flying in planes, both of which release carbon dioxide. Middle classes also began living in single-family homes and using more resources and energy.

The earth is good at maintaining equilibrium, so for some time, it’s been able to adapt to human effects. **Today, however, changes are happening so fast and so globally that we’re approaching the limit of the planet’s ability to buffer the climate.** As a result, we’re about to enter (or already have entered, according to some scientists) a new epoch—the _Anthropocene_ , a period in which changes to the environment are caused by humans.

(Shortform note: For more information on how humans have changed the earth, read our summary of Elizabeth Kolbert’s The Sixth Extinction.)

### Planetary Boundaries

In 2008, a group of earth scientists came up with the idea of planetary boundaries. **These boundaries are the limit of how much we can change the earth before the changes become permanent.** Permanent change is bad news—modern society is based on the environment we live in and modern infrastructure may no longer work in a changed world.

The baseline for all of the boundaries is the conditions of the planet in preindustrial times. There are nine boundaries, some of which we’re within, some of which we’ve exceeded:

#### We’re Safely Within the Boundaries

**1\. The ozone layer** is a shield in the atmosphere made of a gas called ozone. This layer protects the planet from the sun’s ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer. In the 1970s, scientists learned that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a human-made chemical, were damaging the ozone layer. In 1989, the world collectively banned the use of CFCs and the ozone layer recovered.

  * The boundary: no more than a 5% loss from preindustrial levels.



#### We’ve Exceeded the Boundaries

**2\. Global warming** is an increase in the average global temperature since preindustrial times. The global temperature is affected by the presence of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, in the atmosphere. The more carbon dioxide there is, the more heat the atmosphere retains.

  * The boundary: no more than a two-degree Celsius increase since preindustrial times, and no more than 350 parts per million carbon dioxide concentration.
  * Where we are: 400 ppm.



**3\. Biodiversity** is the number of species on the planet and the habitats they live in. Biodiversity is closely related to climate—trees take in carbon dioxide and trees require the presence of other living creatures to survive such as pollinators, soil microorganisms, and animals that spread their seeds. Naturally, 0.0001% of species go extinct per year.

  * The limit: no more than a 10% loss of biodiversity from preindustrial times, and no more than a 0.001% loss of species per year.
  * Where we are: in parts of Africa, biodiversity has dropped to 84% of preindustrial levels, and species loss is between 0.001% and 0.01% per year.



**4\. Deforestation** is loss of forests and trees.

  * The limit: no more than a 25% loss of the planet’s forest cover since preindustrial times.
  * Where we are: 38%.



**5\. Biogeochemical** flows refer to the number of nutrients in the environment. Nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen are necessary for life—if plants and animals don’t have enough, they can’t grow—but the presence of too many nutrients chokes them. Nutrients are found in fertilizers and pesticides and we’re currently overusing these products.

  * The limit: 25% less than we’re currently using.



#### We’re Toeing the Line

**6\. Ocean acidification** is the ocean’s absorption of carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide mixes with water, the reaction produces carbonic acid. This acid dissolves calcium carbonate, which is a key ingredient of the shells of marine organisms. The acid also harms coral reefs and fish.

**7\. Freshwater use** is the amount of water we can take from groundwater sources and rivers. If we take too much water, wetlands and rainforests will dry out.

**8\. Atmospheric aerosol loading** is the tiny pollution particles in the atmosphere—such as the ones that make up smog—that come from burning fossil fuels. Pollution blocks sunlight and makes it more difficult to breathe.

**9\. Chemical pollution** is the release of chemicals such as plastic and nuclear waste into the environment. These compounds would never form naturally and affect the environment in unpredictable ways—they might even eventually change organisms’ DNA.

### Population Growth

Population growth has a huge effect on Mother Nature—**the more people there are on the planet, the more resources they’ll need to survive, placing further stress on the environment.** The United Nations predicts that in 2050, the earth’s population will be 9.7 billion.

In earlier times, many people had lots of children but there was also a high mortality rate. Now, in general, the human mortality rate is decreasing and people are having fewer children. However, **in certain parts of the world, the mortality rate is decreasing but people are having the same number of children.** Most of the estimated population growth will take place in nine countries, including India, Nigeria, and the US. These nine countries either already have a large population or have high fertility rates. Countries with high fertility tend to also have high levels of child marriage, gender inequality, and opposition to birth control.

**Many of these countries are already contending with poverty, resource limitation, environmental destruction, or political conflict. Adding more people to the mix will multiply these issues.**

#### Population and Globalization

**Population explosion makes it difficult to keep up with globalization—education and new jobs can only be developed so quickly.** Because globalization accelerates exponentially, a country can fall far behind even in a short period of time. Previous methods for catching up—for example, exports—are no longer as viable in an automated, digital world. Additionally, countries that were able to catch up in the past, such as East Asian countries in the 20th century, had smaller populations.

Falling behind on global flows can have two consequences:

  * Mass unemployment, which can lead to political instability and migration.
    * For example, Mati Almaniq of Niger left his family and his village to search for work in Europe or Libya. He couldn’t find a job, ran out of money, and is stuck in a desert town of Niger.
  * Return to agriculture, because there are no other jobs. Agriculture exacerbates population growth (children are free labor) and is vulnerable to climate change. 



#### Class and Resource Use

**Not every person on the planet uses the same amount of resources, and the middle and upper classes use the most** —they can afford to buy cars, install air conditioning, and so on. Tom Burke, chairman of Third Generation Environmentalism, divides people into four groups:

  * **1** billion people are middle class or above and live in cities. They have assets and secure incomes.
  * **1.5** billion people are transitioning to the middle class. They have secure incomes, often in the public sector, and some assets, but their jobs may be in danger of disappearing due to globalization and technology. They more recently moved to the cities, within the last 15 years.
  * **2** billion people have insecure incomes and few assets. They just arrived in cities.
  * **2.5** billion people aren’t part of the global economy. They live rurally and work in agriculture.



The 1.5 and 2 groups who live in the city can see the inequality between what others have and what their groups have. They have the potential to disrupt the middle class, pursue political instability, and create social unrest. For example, many of the people in the Arab Spring Awakening were members of these two groups.

**For future stability and growth, it’s important that the 1.5 and 2 groups acquire secure incomes.**

#### Solutions to Population Growth

According to Adair Turner, the chairman of the Institute for New Economic Thinking, extreme measures such as China’s one-child policy aren’t necessary to control the population growth. What is necessary is:

  * Easy access to contraception. 
  * Educating women. (Shortform note: Educated women have fewer children.)
  * Women having control over their reproductive choices. Religious institutions and politicians shouldn’t put pressure on women to have lots of children.



The author adds that introducing modern gender norms would go a long way because decreasing gender inequality and reducing child marriage would result in lower fertility.
