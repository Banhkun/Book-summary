## Exercise: Reflect on the State of the World Today

The world is changing faster than ever.

* * *

What discoveries and world events have significantly changed how you do your work or live your day-to-day life?

What’s a change that affects your job that you struggle with? What have you done so far to adapt? What could you do to further adapt?

What technologies currently exist that you’re not taking advantage of? What’s preventing you from engaging with that new technology?

What new industry or invention do you think the world is behind in regulating? Why?
