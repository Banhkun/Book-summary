## Introduction

Neurology is often seen as a purely cold and clinical science, dealing with the concrete wiring of the brain. Indeed, we often think of brain science as a field of study too esoteric and advanced for it to have anything deeper to say about the human condition.

But this view is false. **The human brain is not a computer or purely rational processor of data. The brain is precisely what _makes_ us human**, giving us our identity and deepest sense of self. Neurology is that rare field that can bring the rational empiricism of science together with the deepest philosophical questions that mankind has always sought to answer. **What makes us human? What is the true nature of the self, of memory, knowing, or action?**

By studying the work of neurologists—specifically their work with people who have suffered brain damage—we rediscover their humanity, and our own. The late neurologist Oliver Sacks dedicated his life to studying the mysteries and extraordinary powers of the human brain. In _The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat_ , Sacks presents the stories of some of his patients, all of whom suffer from one neurological impairment or another.

The stories of the people demonstrate the remarkable complexity of the human brain and its extraordinary capacity to adapt. Every story we’ll explore is more than just a case history; it is **a narrative that tells a profoundly _human_ story of struggle, survival, and, in some cases, hope.**

As we study the lives of these patients, some key themes emerge:

  * **The brain has a remarkable ability to compensate for neurological shortcomings in one area with neurological strengths in another**. Thus, a patient with impaired powers of speech might excel at the visual arts or a patient suffering from an inability to understand words might be better at discerning the non-verbal parts of language.
  * **The neurological profession has often misunderstood neurological disorders, thinking of them solely as illnesses that must be “cured.”** But sometimes, the disorder gives meaning, hope, and identity to the patients experiencing them—and the patients have no wish to be “cured.”
  * **What manifests outwardly as the symptoms of a disorder are often attempts by the brain to provide order, regularity, and a consistent self-narrative for the patient.** Thus, a man with retrograde amnesia that prevents him from forming short-term memories might constantly weave fantastical stories about who he is to strangers, so that he always maintains a consistent notion of the self.
