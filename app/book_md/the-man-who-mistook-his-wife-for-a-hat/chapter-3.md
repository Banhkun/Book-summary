## Chapter 3: Visions

In the first two chapters, we looked at how neurological disorders can manifest as either deficits or superabundances—the brain either underperforming or overperforming. In this chapter, we’ll explore another dimension of how neurological abnormalities reshape the human experience: through our dreams, revelations, and visions.

Many of us have entered such mystical and otherworldly states before—an old memory suddenly unearthed, seemingly from nowhere; déjà vu, the mysterious sense that one has lived through some present situation before; or spiritual experiences that seem to bring us face-to-face with the divine. These sublime moments are central to the human experience and have been the focus of art and spirituality throughout human history.

**But what we think of as spiritual or mystical journeys have a foundation in neurology and the inner workings of our brains, specifically the temporal lobe**. Indeed, there are organic determinants to our most transformative moments. Studying the cases of people who have suffered severe neurological trauma can give us insight into these phenomena and demonstrate how it is the complex interplay of transmitters, receptors, cortexes, and neurons within our brains that truly makes us human.

### Frontal Lobe Stimulation: Reproductions of Reality

We should not, however, succumb to the belief that these transformative experiences are somehow cheapened or diminished by ascribing a physical, scientific explanation to them. Studying these brain functions, to the contrary, brings us _closer_ to understanding the workings of our spirituality. For**it is within our temporal lobes that we create the images and reminiscences that transport us to other dimensions and planes of being.**

In the 1950s, the great neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield demonstrated that stimulation of the temporal lobes in his patients produced extraordinarily vivid auditory, visual, and even olfactory memories. They could be so powerful, in fact, as to blot out real events happening concurrently, a sort of “doubling of consciousness.”

**It is important to note that these experiences were _memories_ , not fantasies. And they triggered the same wave of emotions that the patient had experienced during the original experience. **They seemed indeed to be perfect and authentic reproductions of reality. Penfield’s research suggested that the brain had a perfect record of one’s entire life experience, a way to travel back in time in one’s mind.

Many times, these memories were pleasantly evocative, allowing patients to revisit old friends, family, and scenes of their youth. But other times, the frontal lobe stimulation unearthed dreadful memories, long-suppressed, of the worst moments in patients’ lives. We'll explore some cases of each type in this chapter.

### Opening a Closed Door

**Music has a great power to evoke memories and touch the soul. And in some cases, it can be the neurological link to a lost world of childhood memories and experiences**. One of Sacks’s patients was an 88-year-old deaf woman named Mrs. O’C, who lived in a retirement home. She had begun hearing old Irish folk songs playing, often quite loudly, sometimes waking her up in the middle of the night.

But she could not find the radio or external source for the mysterious music. Even more curiously, she only seemed to be hearing one very particular set of Irish songs that she’d heard long ago when she was a girl in Ireland. It became clear to her that the music was playing entirely in her head.

What was Mrs. O’C experiencing? How could such a vivid musical episode come to her mind, more than 80 years after she’d heard these songs—of which she had no active memory? When he ran an EEG test on her, Sacks saw that Mrs. O’C had suffered a stroke and was experiencing temporal lobe seizures during the moments when she indicated that a song was playing. **The stroke had activated long-dormant musical memories in Mrs. O’C’s cortex that transported her back to back to her early childhood in Ireland** , a period of her life of which she had no concrete memories at all.

Her parents had both died before she turned five, after which she’d been sent to America to live with an aunt. Although she knew that this had been part of her life, she could never access it in her mind and had always yearned to rediscover the lost memories of her mother and her life in Ireland. As we’ve seen with other patients with neurological disorders, **Mrs. O’C did not see the temporal lobe seizures as a curse—for her, they were a gift,** an opportunity to regain a lost part of herself and open a door that had always been shut.

Three months later, the seizures stopped. The songs were gone and the door was closed once more. Mrs. O’C told Sacks that hearing the music in her head had been one of the greatest and most emotionally resonant experiences of her life, one for which she was deeply grateful. In her nearly ninety years, she’d lived a hard life, feeling alone, unloved, and abandoned. Now, **she was comforted in the knowledge that she _had_ been loved and cared for after all.** It brought a profound sense of closure.

### Forced Remembrance and L-Dopa

L-Dopa is an amino acid used to treat Parkinson’s disease. It can also trigger forced memories and a reactivation of older versions of the self. One of Sacks’s patients, a 63-year-old woman with Parkinson’s, found herself with a sharply resurgent sexual drive after being administered L-Dopa. But the renewed libido was really just one component of a broader transformation. **This woman came to relive the life her younger self had lived during the 1920s.** Like Mrs. O’C’s musical reminiscences, this woman found herself effortlessly remembering long-forgotten songs and jokes from the period. Even more remarkable, she began using the idioms and slang from that time. When the L-Dopa levels were brought down, the forced reminiscences ceased.

To some extent, we _all_ experience these journeys to the past through the common experience of déjà vu, the mysterious sense that one has lived through some present situation already. Often, such rushes of reminiscence are triggered by sensory experiences like music or smell. In these moments, we are transported to another time and place. It suggests that **these memories are permanently stamped in the brain, awaiting the right stimulus to reactivate them** and make them “real” once more.

(Shortform note: The most famous work on involuntary memory may come from the world of literature. In Marcel Proust’s seven-volume novel _A Remembrance of Things Past_ , the narrator takes a bite of a madeleine, a French tea cookie he’d eaten as a child. The smell, texture, and taste of that one bite of cookie cause a vast surge of long-forgotten memories and imagery of the past to come flooding back into his consciousness.)

### Bhagawhandi’s Journey to the Past

Bhagawhandi was a young woman of Indian origin who was suffering from a brain tumor that caused seizures in her temporal lobe. The seizures transported her to the scenes of her girlhood in India, an experience she found enjoyable.

**But her dreams were far more vivid and lucid than those often produced by temporal lobe seizures**. They were no mere hallucinations or flights of fancy. They were rich and detailed, presenting consistent and coherent landscapes and characters. She saw her childhood home, village, and the surrounding countryside in vibrant detail. She was not merely _seeing_ these scenes—she was inhabiting and experiencing them.

As we saw with Penfield's research, there was a “doubling of consciousness.” The visions occurred alongside and supplemented Bhagawhandi’s _real_ experiences, enabling her to describe to Sacks and the other doctors what she was seeing and experiencing.

Bhaghawandi knew that she was dying from her tumor. She saw the visions as a homecoming that was getting closer and closer as her illness progressed. She retreated further and further into her dream world, before she came to live there exclusively right before her ultimate death. Her journey to the past was finally complete.

### A Repressed Memory Unearthed

**But the reactivation of lost memories can also be dark and disturbing**. One Sacks patient named Donald tragically murdered his girlfriend while under the influence of PCP. Because of the drug, he had no memory of committing the act. He was sentenced to a hospital for the criminally insane (although staff seriously doubted whether he was criminal _or_ insane—psychologically speaking, the murder had been committed by another person).

After five years, Donald was released on weekend parole, which allowed him to journey outside the prison campus before returning at the end of the week. One day while bicycling, he became involved in an accident that caused damage to his frontal lobes and even put him in a coma for two weeks. When he awoke**, Donald began having awful nightmares of the long-suppressed murder.** The nightmares turned into waking visions, in which he could remember and see it now in all its horror.

Interviews with police showed that the details of his nightmare-visions corresponded perfectly with the forensic evidence. It was impossible for Donald to have known some of the particularities that he described from outside sources—because the details were too gruesome to have been revealed in open court during his trial. The only explanation was that**the damage to his frontal lobes had reactivated the memory, which he now could not escape.**

We’ve seen other patients who experienced disinhibitions, like Ray with his tics and Natasha with her reactivated libido. But Donald’s disinhibition was not related to some aspect of his personality or behavior. What was being disinhibited, instead, was his capacity to repress this traumatic memory.

Thankfully, with therapy and anticonvulsant drugs, Donald’s temporal lobes returned to a normal state and he found peace in gardening and nature, away from people. He got to a place where he could remember the murder, but was no longer consumed by it.

### An Olfactory World

One final example of the transformative power of the brain to open new avenues of consciousness and transport the individual to another plane of being can be seen in the case of a young medical student named Stephen. Stephen was a heavy user of cocaine and amphetamines. One night while he was high on these stimulants, he dreamed that he was a dog and could experience the world through the sense of smell.

When he awoke, he found that the dream had come true. **His nose suddenly became a key that unlocked the door to a world he’d never known.** It was like nothing he’d experienced before, as if he had been “blind” to the world of smell and was “seeing” it all for the first time. He was able to distinguish everything in the world by the sense of smell. Even people were identifiable purely by their smell (he claimed that everyone had a unique “smell-face”) and he was able to navigate New York City purely through smell.

After three weeks, Stephen’s dog-like state abated. He resumed normal functioning, but he missed the richness and immediacy of what he’d briefly experienced and, now, permanently lost. Like Mrs. O’C and Bhaghawandi, he had caught a fleeting glimpse of a world lying just beneath the surface.
