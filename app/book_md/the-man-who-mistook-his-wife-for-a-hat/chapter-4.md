## Chapter 4: Intellectual Disability

In the previous three chapters, we explored the case histories of patients whose impairments either inhibited some core neurological function, super-charged these functions, or transported the individual to a world of forgotten memories. But we have not yet looked at those patients whose brain functioning, at first glance, seems to be the most compromised—those with severe intellectual disabilities.

(Shortform note: In this summary, we have eschewed a lot of the outdated—and, in modern times, insensitive—language that Sacks uses to describe some of his patients in this chapter. For instance, Sacks describes “retarded” patients who are “idiots” or “morons.”)

### Concrete Vs. Abstract Thought

Sacks believed that there was something profoundly moving about working with intellectually disabled patients. **Much of this had to do with the distinctions between abstract and concrete thought.** Broadly speaking, abstract thought deals with the world of ideas and concepts that don’t “exist” in the physical world. Concrete thought, meanwhile, concerns those things that _do_ exist in the physical world. The concrete world is that of the tactile, particular, and immediate.

**Individuals with intellectual disabilities often struggle to grasp abstraction**. Instead, they inhabit a purely concrete world. Because they were freed from the encumbrances of abstraction, they had a quiet sense of completeness and innocence that was rarely found in “normal” people. Moreover, their world was often more intense and vivid, freed as it was from the encumbrances of abstraction.

This view of intellectual disability, however, was at odds with much traditional neurology at the time he was writing. Classic neurology saw the ability to comprehend abstract ideas as one of the crowning achievements of the human brain, a trait that separated it from the brains of other, lower organisms. Meanwhile, this school of thought viewed concreteness as primitive and regressed.

But, as we will see with the case histories to follow, such a view is misinformed. **Concrete thinking is a crucial part of what it means to be human**. Its absence can wreak havoc—to see the consequences of this, we don’t need to look any further than the story of Dr. P from Chapter 1, an otherwise intelligent man who nevertheless had no ability to understand the concrete world right in front of him and could only make sense of it in terms of stylized abstractions.

As we’ve seen with all of our cases, poor functioning in one area of the brain seems to lead to enhanced functioning and ability in another. Without abstraction, intellectually disabled patients can fully immerse themselves in the world of the concrete, amassing a dazzling mental collection of details and particulars.

Concrete thought is capable of expressing emotion and feeling just as poignantly and powerfully as abstract thought. **We see some of the essential elements of our own humanity in studying the intellectually disabled.**

### Finding Meaning Through Narrative

Rebecca was a 19-year-old girl with severe intellectual disabilities. She had an IQ of 60 (90-110 is considered to be normal or average intelligence) and was unable to dress herself, read, write, or count, to list just a few of her limitations. Overall, she struggled with tasks that required abstract thought and seeing the “big picture.”

But **Rebecca had an extraordinary capacity to understand stories and narrative and fully grasped the metaphors, symbols, and imagery contained within them** —because symbols, after all, are just concrete objects representing abstract ideas. Indeed, story and symbol were the keys that Rebecca used to unlock the abstract mysteries of her world.

She had a great appetite for story, frequently begging her grandparents to read to her. Sacks observed that it was not unlike how small children can understand ideas like empathy and love when they are represented in a story, but are unable to understand such abstract concepts when they are presented outside the context of a narrative.

Rebecca could even understand complex poetry and fully participate in the prayer services at her family’s Orthodox Jewish synagogue in New York—despite being otherwise unable to comprehend even the most basic verbal commands. She was liberated from her intellectual constraints when she entered the narrative-based world of literature and spirituality.

**She had the soul and spirit of a poet; she was spiritually and emotionally complete, even if she was running an intellectual “deficit.”** Rebecca could create narrative and meaning just as well as she could understand it, too. Sacks several times observed her conjure poetic imagery in wonderful, unexpected bursts when she was contemplatively looking at nature. Despite having no capacity to see abstract patterns or schema, she saw the real world with a clarity that few others could.

When her beloved grandmother died, Rebecca could only express her profound grief through allegory and metaphor—literary devices that are, of course, ways of linking the concrete world to the abstract world of ideas. She told Sacks, “It is winter, I feel dead”; “Part of me died with her”; “She’s gone to her Long Home.”

In working with Rebecca, Sacks found that treatment in traditional clinical settings did little for her. **But when she enrolled in a special theatre group for the intellectually disabled, she thrived.** Rebecca was able to make meaning and become complete by playing characters. Rebecca described her own condition in an apt simile: “I’m like a sort of living carpet...I come apart, I unravel, unless there’s a design...I must have meaning.”

**Rebecca’s limitations concealed the parts of her that were preserved—and indeed, thriving.** After his experience working with her, Sacks realized that neurology focused too much on deficits, with its diagnostic and treatment tools failing to properly account for the full powers of a human being.

### The Opera Aficionado

Another intellectually disabled patient of Sacks’s was Martin, a 61-year-old who came to live at the facility Sacks operated. Martin suffered from Parkinson’s disease and had been severely brain damaged by meningitis as an infant. His disabilities prevented him from holding down a job or taking care of himself.

**But Martin had a gift for music. Specifically, he possessed an exceptional musical memory and knew the music from over 2,000 operas** , as well as all the other details of each production—the roles, who had sung the leads, and where they’d been performed anywhere in the world. This love of music was an inheritance from his late father, who had been a singer with New York’s Metropolitan Opera. Father and son had bonded over opera and it remained Martin’s passion and guiding light.

When he first came to live at the facility, Martin could often be irritable and unsociable, given to childlike fits of temper that made him unpopular with staff and patients alike. He later confided to Sacks that he missed being able to sing. He had sung in a choir every Sunday with his beloved father, he explained, until the latter passed away. Music was what sustained him.

Seeing that Martin was being denied his crucial creative outlet, Sacks arranged to have him resume his singing at churches and cathedrals across New York City, where he soon became valued for his encyclopedic musical knowledge.

**Martin was utterly transformed when he sang. Gone was the childish and often spiteful person Sacks had come to know at the facility—in these moments, Martin was a complete person** , fully at peace. In working with him, Sacks saw that Martin’s musical knowledge was no mere knack or trick of rote memory. Instead, he had a deep and sincere musical intelligence, one that could grasp the rich subtleties of a composer like Bach and appreciate the complexity and structure of the music.

### The World of Numbers

One of Sacks’s most interesting windows into the concrete world of the intellectually disabled was his work with a pair of autistic twins named Michael and John. The twins had earned some level of national fame for their television appearances, in which they demonstrated their ability to immediately tell the day of the week for any date, no matter how far into the past or into the future. They also were able to perfectly recite 300-figure long number strings.

When asked to retrieve a date or a number sequence, their eyes would appear to “scan,” as if they were seeing and retrieving data. It dawned on Sacks—the twins were not human calculators; instead, they “saw” the dates and events, as if they were splashed across a vast canvas in their minds. Numerical concepts were completely concrete for them, as real and physical as anything in the outside world.

**Michael and John, however, were unable to perform simple operations like addition and subtraction** **and had absolutely no comprehension of multiplication or division**. These concepts were too abstract for them to process.

#### Savoring Numbers

While visiting the twins one day, Sacks accidentally knocked a pack of matches on the floor, causing its contents to spill out. The twins immediately declared, “111.” When Sacks picked up the matches, he saw that there had been precisely 111 matches on the floor. Moreover, they murmured “37, 37, 37” after they identified the 111 matches—the prime factors of 111.

In speaking with Michael and John, Sacks realized that they hadn’t done any sort of counting or calculation. **They simply “saw” 111, as if that number had certain unique qualities or properties (Sacks labeled it “111-ness”)** that made it instantly recognizable. It was akin to someone who has perfect pitch, the ability to identify and reproduce any musical note without using a reference.

This provided an important insight into how the twins’ minds worked. On another occasion, Sacks observed the pair sitting quietly and contemplatively as they recited six-figure numbers to each other. They would name seemingly random numbers like “100,153” or “999,773,” to one another and smile contentedly as they “savored” the numbers, appearing to appreciate each for its own unique qualities—almost as if they were appreciating some piece of visual art or a nature scene.**They found serenity and harmony in this ritual, an almost religious reverence for the beauty of numbers.**

#### Prime Numbers

While trying to discover the significance of the numbers the twins were savoring, Sacks consulted a mathematical book and discovered that **all of the six-figure numbers they were passing back and forth were _prime_ numbers** (divisible only by one and themselves).

This was remarkable—the twins had no understanding of division or multiplication, so it was impossible for them to do the calculations necessary to determine what a prime was (and there is no simple method or formula for calculating primes). **They just “saw” primes in their minds and recognized them intuitively.** It also explained why they said “37, 37, 37” when they saw the 111 matches on the floor—37, of course, being a prime number.

Sacks decided to join their prime number game and (cheating by using a book as reference) ventured his own _eight_ -figure prime number. The twins contemplated it and, after some time, smiled in satisfaction. By some unknown process, they evaluated it as a prime number. Over the course of the session, the twins expanded their game, reaching new prime numbers going up to _twenty_ figures.

It was impossible to discern the true workings of their ritual, but it seemed to Sacks as if the twins inhabited a rich and detailed universe of numbers, and could identify and retrieve primes on sight—as if they were walking through an endless meadow and plucking only a particular kind of flower.

#### “Socially Acceptable”

Sadly, the hospital where Michael and John lived decided to separate them from one another, in the hopes of breaking them out of their isolated world and making them “socially acceptable.” To be sure, there were some positive results—they could perform menial jobs, take the bus, and maintain a decent outward appearance.

**But the separation robbed them of their numerical communion and ritual, which was clearly the main joy and purpose of their lives**. Their skills at identifying and appreciating prime numbers rapidly deteriorated. Sacks wondered if they really needed to be “cured.” If they were able to appreciate beauty in numbers and derive meaning and purpose from this pursuit, were they really damaged or defective? Sacks lamented their situation, which left the twins with all their deficits and none of their gifts.

### Communication Through Drawing

The last Sacks patient whose story we’ll explore is Jose. Jose was a young man in his early 20s who, at age eight, had suffered a severe case of encephalitis. The illness wreaked havoc on Jose’s neurological functioning. He became prone to frequent and violent seizures and was no longer able to communicate verbally—symptoms that doctors would later use to diagnose Jose with autism.

His parents, fearful that he would suffer a seizure in public and become injured, began keeping him in the cellar of their home. **For 15 years, Jose was deprived of nearly all links to the outside world.** After a particularly violent seizure, Jose’s parents finally took him to the hospital, where he was able to get the treatment he needed. EEG scans confirmed that Jose was experiencing severe temporal lobe disorders on both his left and right sides.

The hospital staff discovered that Jose had a remarkable talent for drawing. Indeed, **Jose’s sketches were his only mode of self-expression, deprived as he was of other means of communication.** His excellent performance in visual and spatial tasks seemed to compensate for verbal skills deficits.

The first time Sacks met Jose, he was thoroughly impressed by the young man’s success in drawing a watch in great detail. At their next meeting, Jose was able to reproduce a landscape scene on a magazine cover. In fact, Jose’s copy surpassed the original in many ways—**he imbued the scene with mood, feeling, and character that had been lacking in the original.** Subsequent drawings from Jose hinted at an interior life filled with creativity, emotion, and a sophisticated appreciation for aesthetics.

Jose’s artistic works demonstrated his entirely concrete and particular mind. They evinced no understanding of general categories or fixed forms and were free of ambiguity. Sacks saw that a talented artist like Jose had the potential to lead a rich and fulfilling life, perhaps as an illustrator. But he lamented the short-sightedness of the mental health system of which Jose was a part. Nurturing his prodigious talents would require a patience that the other doctors around him lacked.

**His gifts were too often written off by the hospital staff as being merely tricks of a human Xerox machine, rather than the artistic fruits of a sensitive and delicate soul.** Sacks lamented that Jose’s talents were likely to be wasted, his potential remaining forever untapped.

### Conclusion

Sacks’s work with his patients shows the pitfalls of traditional thinking about neurological disorders. As we’ve seen, people suffering from these conditions can lead purposeful lives filled with joy and creativity. Studying disorders of the human brain, ironically, can give us insight into just how powerful it is and how it is the source of so much of our humanity.

It is incumbent on the neurological profession to expand its view of neurological disorders and of the people who are afflicted by them. There is enormous untapped potential and capacity for them to lead meaningful and productive lives. But first, we must abandon the idea that such individuals are irreparably damaged or abnormal. But perhaps their “normal” isn’t deviant or wrong, but merely different than our own. Rather than attempting to cure or alter it, we should open ourselves up to the possibilities that the study of their unique brains can reveal to us. In recognizing their humanity, we come to recognize our own.
