## Chapter 2: Superabundance

In the last chapter, we focused on the impact of neurological deficits—disorders that produce some impairment or inhibition of crucial functions like speech and memory. Throughout most of the history of neurology, practitioners have focused on these deficits and the problems that result from the _loss_ of function.

But what about the opposite phenomenon, of excesses and superabundances? **What happens when neurological functions work on _overdrive_?** That is what we’ll explore in this chapter.

### Illness as Wellness

**Disorders of superabundance make it difficult to control crucial aspects of our humanity—impulse, will, action, and passion.** Patients who experience these uninhibited rushes often don’t feel ill or lost at all, as did some of the patients like Jimmie G. and Christina whom we met in the previous chapter. Indeed, this other class of patients often reports feeling more alive and human than ever as a result of their disorder. The rich interior life of a person, once dormant and dull, can become truly activated by neurological illnesses.

But there is a dark side to this frenzy and mania. The excesses can subsume the individual. Illness can masquerade as wellness. The activation of pleasure centers in the brain caused by disorders like Tourette’s, syphilis, and even some forms of Korsakov’s syndrome (which we explored in the last chapter) can be powerfully addictive; **the patient does not wish to be “cured,” because they do not believe themselves to be ill.**

### Tourette’s Syndrome

The first disorder of superabundance we’ll explore is Tourette’s syndrome. Tourette’s was first diagnosed in the late 19th century by the French physician Georges Albert Édouard Brutus Gilles de la Tourette (who gave the disorder its name). It was largely forgotten over the next century, thought to be a rare syndrome. It began to receive renewed interest within the neurological community, the media, and among the general public in the 1970s.

Associated with an excess of the hormone and neurotransmitter dopamine, Tourette’s is characterized by an excess of nervous energy, commonly finding expression in repetitive motor movements called tics, as well as in verbal outbursts like coprolalia, the compulsive utterance of obscenities and slurs in socially inappropriate situations (these are called verbal tics).

Tourette’s can sometimes give the appearance of exerting a demon-like control or possession over its sufferers. **The syndrome _becomes_ their identity, blocking out all other aspects of the personality that lies beneath.** Unnerving and frightening for outsiders to witness, Tourette’s patients can suffer severe social stigma and isolation.

In the most severe cases, the tics can go beyond physical gestures and verbal outbursts. They become tics of the mind, jerking perception and personality itself back and forth. Unlike severe forms of amnesia, the Tourette’s sufferer is all too aware of their disorder and the impulses it causes, constantly battling it in an epic psychic tug-of-war, a struggle to form their own identity from under the weight of Tourette’s.

#### Witty Ticcy Ray: An Identity of Tics

In the 1970s, Sacks met a Tourette’s patient named Ray, who called himself “Witty Ticcy Ray.” He was 24 years old and had experienced severe tics since the age of four. Ray had suffered severe social stigma as a result of his condition and had been fired many times for his outbursts (he was known to yell obscenities like “Fuck!” at inappropriate times).

And yet, **Ray had found the strength to forge a meaningful life for himself despite his affliction—indeed, it seemed to give him an entire identity.** He was an accomplished jazz drummer and a masterful ping pong player, both fields in which the speedy reflexes and reactions caused by his syndrome appeared to give him an advantage. He was sharp and witty in repartee, which he attributed to the superabundance of energy due to Tourette’s. As Ray put it, “I consist of tics and nothing else.” It was, in short, an essential part of himself—one that he did not wish to lose.

Sacks began treating Ray with Haldol, an antipsychotic medication that blocks dopamine receptors in the brain and is also used to treat schizophrenia. Ray’s initial treatment with Haldol seemed to be effective and the tics disappeared. But they soon reappeared with a strange twist: they were slower, with Ray even becoming stuck in catatonic mid-tic states. Moreover, he had lost some essential part of himself. Ray was now slow and deliberate, unable to engage in the witty spontaneity and flights of inspiration that had so defined him. Worse still, he’d lost his musical fluidity as a drummer.

**Sacks realized that medication alone would not be sufficient to treat Ray.** He couldn’t just suppress the neurological basis of his syndrome; he needed to break Ray of his addiction to the wild thrill of Tourette’s, _show_ him how rich and full his life could be without it. Only then could pharmaceutical options be exploited.

Ray wanted to maintain what he saw as the _benefits_ of his tics, but be able to function better in the world. Sacks and Ray decided on a dual strategy—he would take Haldol during the weekdays but would stop taking it on weekends. On Saturday and Sunday, he would fully embrace his “Witty Ticcy Ray ” persona.

#### The Imitation Game

If Ray presents us with a hopeful story, however, we should be reminded of **the psychic prison that the manic energy of Tourette’s imposes on many of its sufferers.**

One day on the streets of New York City, Sacks saw an older woman wildly convulsing on the sidewalk. On closer inspection, he saw that she was imitating the people who passed her by on the street, grotesquely caricaturing and exaggerating their faces and gestures—each only for a split second.

The spectacle created a dizzying feedback loop. As people passed by the woman and realized what she was doing, they expressed their anger, bewilderment, and disgust. The woman, in turn, imitated _these_ reactions in her highly stylized and lurid way, further eliciting more cycles of reaction and counter-reaction.

Eventually, the woman could maintain the dizzying imitation game no longer and ran to a nearby alley. There, she made a gesture of “expurgating” the personalities she had “consumed,” as if she had taken in her fill and could take no more. This was the tragedy of her condition—she was powerless to stop drinking in the demeanors and expressions of strangers, even when it clearly caused her great distress to do so. **There was no self, just the masks and personas she borrowed from others.**

### The Frisky Natasha

We see another example of a patient succumbing to the dizzying highs of their neurological excesses in the story of Natasha. Natasha was an 88-year-old woman when she came to see Sacks. She reported feeling more energized and young than she had in decades. She even said she felt sexually “frisky,” pursuing and flirting with younger men.

Curiously, she diagnosed _herself_ with what she termed “Cupid’s Disease.” Sacks had never heard this term before, but Natasha explained that it referred to the sexually transmitted disease known as syphilis. Although easily treated with penicillin in the modern era, syphilis was once a devastating disease. In the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was left untreated, it could lead to devastating neurological impairment and sharp personality changes—with these symptoms sometimes not manifesting until decades after infection.

Natasha explained that she’d been a prostitute at a brothel in the Greek city of Thessaloniki over 70 years before and that this was where she likely had caught the disease. Sacks knew that syphilis had a long latent period, but a seven-decade lag between infection and the onset of symptoms was extraordinary. But tests confirmed that Natasha’s self-diagnosis was spot-on—the bacteria’s spirochetes were stimulating her cerebral cortex and inflicting the cerebral damage that was causing her change in personality.

But **Natasha did not want to cure her disorder. For her, it had become a wonderful new reality, giving her a new lease on life and a vibrancy she had not experienced in decades**. Just as he had with Ray, Sacks opted for a middle course. The medical team administered her penicillin to kill the spirochetes but leave intact the cerebral damage that was causing her freeing flights of inhibition. She would live the rest of her life voluntarily in thrall to her illness. She gave herself up to Cupid.

### Mr. Thompson

The last case we’ll explore in this chapter touches on the very nature of reality, our need to derive meaning from our world, and **the demands of the human psyche to shape a narrative about ourselves and how we came to be who we are.**

Sacks encountered a patient named Mr. Thompson, who, like Jimmie G. from the previous chapter, suffered from Korsakov’s syndrome. But the manifestation of his disorder was of an entirely different character than that of Jimmie’s. Although Jimmie was frozen at a moment in time, he retained a hold on the person he once was. Jimmie had a consistent life-narrative, albeit one that was totally at odds with the lived reality of his present.

In contrast, **Mr. Thompson’s __ retrograde amnesia caused him to constantly adopt _new_ personae for himself, **refashioning his world in an ever-changing drama with a revolving cast of characters. One minute, he might believe that he was a deli owner, addressing Sacks as if he was one of his customers. Another time, he might be a reverend. All the while, Thompson would regale those he encountered with fantastic anecdotes. He gave the outward appearance of being a funny, charming, and ebullient man.

#### Reinvention of the Self

But Mr. Thompson was suffering from the devastation of his short-term memory, using his powerful imagination to reinvent the world around him. He displayed a superabundance of energy, gregariously spinning new yarns to anyone he encountered. In fact, he seemed to be _constantly_ talking and narrating. He was weaving a dense web of fantasy and illusion around himself. As we’ve seen with other neurological disorders, **this was the way Mr. Thompson’s mind imposed rationality on an entirely irrational state.**

It kept his sense of self intact, even if it was constantly being torn down and rebuilt—for indeed, Thompson had no awareness of the condition he was in. The fantasy and reinvention helped him make sense of the world surrounding him, providing him with what _felt_ like stability and normalcy, when his reality had gone utterly to pieces.

**Mr. Thompson’s gregarious storytelling was a way of creating a new world to replace what was lost, a constant creation and re-creation of a new self**. And the fantasies worked—Mr. Thompson could never be convinced that anything at all was wrong with him. Poignantly, his condition speaks to the human necessity for an inner narrative, a knowledge of who we are and how we got to be that way—even in a man who had no short-term memory or point of self-reference.

#### The World as Unreality

Mr. Thompson was in a state of perpetual bewilderment, needing to fix the gaps in his memory all the time through endless reimagination. It was an exhilarating, but terrible existence. His world and his being were consumed by unreality. Even when he could identify real figures, like his younger brother Bob, he could not extricate them from fantasy. Mr. Thompson merely incorporated Bob into the neverending confabulations, scarcely treating him as a real person, but instead relegating him to become just another character in the fantasy where he permanently resided.

Unlike his fellow Korsakov’s sufferer Jimmie, Thompson was unable to have genuine emotional relations or be moved by music or spirituality. The nuns at the home where he lived acknowledged that while he may have had an immortal soul in the eyes of God, he did not have a soul in the way that we might typically think of one—a capacity for feeling and experience. **The thick veneer of fantasy prevented him from ever engaging with the real world.**

Sacks and the other doctors believed that if they could get Mr. Thompson to quiet down, to tame his boundless energy for story and self-reinvention, he might find some inner safe harbor. The only way he could quiet the fantasies was when he was divorced from people altogether. In the garden, among the plants and flowers, Thompson had less need to invent new realities. There, he could be at peace, alone with whatever his thoughts may have been, free from the human pressure to weave a new self-narrative.
