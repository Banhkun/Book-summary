## Exercise: Start Thinking

Cunningham asserts that the best way to avoid “stupid” mistakes (mistakes you made even though you knew better) in business is to take time regularly to think deeply and rationally about the issues you or your company is facing and ask yourself thought-provoking questions. In this exercise, we’ll ask you a few questions to kick off your thinking session.

* * *

Think of the most recent mistake you’ve made that you wish you could go back and undo. If you could ask your earlier self one question to make yourself rethink the issue and avoid the mistake, what question would you ask?

Think of a project or venture that you’re planning or considering right now. List at least three assumptions that have to be true for it to work out. (For example, do people have to behave or respond a certain way? Do prices or interest rates have to stay in a certain range?)

Think of a product, service, or system that you have some influence over. List at least one way it could be misused, and briefly describe what the unintended consequences of such misuse might be.

What could you do to either prevent the type of misuse you listed above or mitigate the unintended consequences?
