## Exercise: How Has Your Environment Affected You?

Several external and internal factors affect confidence.

* * *

When you were a child, were you pressured to be good? Did you succumb to this pressure? Why or why not?

When you first entered the workplace, what was one of the rules for success? Did this rule correspond to anything you’d learned growing up? Why or why not? (For example, perhaps you learned that not interrupting people was polite in childhood, but interrupting is crucial if you want to be heard in meetings.)

Do you feel more or less competent when you’re reminded of the stereotypes of the groups you belong to (for example, when talking to a mechanic about a car problem)? Why?

How often do you impose any obstacles on yourself (for example, holding back because you’re afraid of doing something that will make people dislike you)? How might you eliminate this obstacle?
