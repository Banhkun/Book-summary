## Exercise: Build Confidence in Other Women

The authors provide several suggestions for building confidence in others.

* * *

Think of a woman you know who’s achieved something impressive at work recently. How might you encourage her to**** acknowledge and talk about this achievement? (For example, you might remind her that her boss _wants_ to know the employees she’s chosen to hire are capable.)

Think of a woman you know who’s been wanting to do something but is hesitating. How could you encourage her to take action? (For example, instead of being sympathetic to the challenges, tell her to stop making excuses.)

How might you help other women advance their careers? (For example, you might encourage them to participate when you’re leading meetings.)
