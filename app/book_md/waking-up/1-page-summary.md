## 1-Page Summary

More and more people are turning their backs on religion, adopting a secular lifestyle based on our scientific understanding of the world. However, is it possible that these people—atheists, agnostics, humanists, and those who prefer no labels at all—are leaving something crucial behind? Philosopher and scientist Sam Harris thinks they are. In particular, he argues that those who reject the contemplative aspects of religion when they adopt a secular lifestyle are missing out on the peace and contentment that comes from seeking transcendental states of consciousness—experiences we normally associate with the realm of _spirituality_.

According to Harris, science doesn’t invalidate these higher states of consciousness, but because they’ve historically been co-opted by religion, people with a secular worldview unjustly dismiss them out of hand. In _Waking Up_ , published in 2015, Harris lays out a reason-based approach to seeking and enjoying a spiritual lifestyle firmly rooted in what science and human experience teach us about the workings of the mind.

Harris is best known as a pioneer of the New Atheist movement, which encourages skeptics to confront religious beliefs with the same level of intellectual criticism and rational debate that’s applied to scientific models and theories. In his book _The End of Faith_ , published in 2004, Harris calls attention to the negative effects of religious beliefs throughout history. In 2009, Harris earned a Ph.D. in neuroscience for his studies on the neurological roots of doubt and belief within the human brain.

In this guide, we’ll explore Harris’s nonreligious definition of spirituality, what neuroscience says about the nature of consciousness, and what meditation can teach us about the human mind. We’ll investigate Harris’s argument that consciousness and feelings of individual selfhood are two separate aspects of experience, and while consciousness is real, your sense of self is an illusion. Finally, we’ll delve into the practical aspects of seeking spiritual enlightenment, what that looks like from a secular worldview, and the implications of seeking self-improvement within such a system of belief.

In addition to Harris’s writings on the subject, we’ll look into our current scientific understanding of how consciousness is generated by the brain, as well as theological interpretations of the divide between the mind and body. We’ll point toward a wider variety of meditative practices than Harris mentions, as well as the nuances of Buddhist schools of thought that Harris touches on in his book.

### Secular Spirituality

To talk about spiritual experiences within the realm of a rational, scientific worldview, the first step is to define what “spirituality” means in this context. For Harris, **spirituality is the process of exploring your consciousness** in a way that dispels the illusion that your existence is defined by your thoughts and feelings. Such explorations can also include achieving states of consciousness outside the realm of normal experience. Harris discusses why such a practice is desirable, how to separate spirituality from the confines of religion, and why out of all the major faiths, Buddhism provides the most practical roadmap to having spiritual experiences without the baggage of superstition and dogma.

Harris starts from a simple foundation—everybody just wants to be happy. Unfortunately, on the “hedonic treadmill” of our materialistic culture, peace and contentment are always somewhere in the future while you try to run away from the pain in your past. Spiritual endeavors, such as prayer and contemplation, are an attempt to break yourself out of this cycle, bringing your awareness into the here and now. This is the practice of _mindfulness_ —the deliberate choice to focus your awareness on the present moment and experience it without judgment. **Happiness and tranquility can only be found in the present** because the present moment is all you can actually experience.

(Shortform note: While many writers, including Harris, conflate the practices of mindfulness and meditation, by some definitions they’re two different things. In _Hyperfocus_ , Chris Bailey argues that _mindfulness_ means being aware of everything going on around and inside you, whereas _meditation entails narrowing your attention to one thing_. In _The Power of Positive Thinking_ , Norman Vincent Peale describes the act of prayer in a similar way—as a method to focus your spiritual energy on one particular problem or need. In _Mindfulness in Plain English_ , Bhante Gunaratana resolves the mindfulness/meditation dichotomy by explaining that mindfulness should be your ultimate aim, while meditation is the practice for achieving that goal.)

Practicing mindfulness (in the form of meditation) teaches three simple truths:

  1. Your thoughts shape your subjective experience.
  2. Positive emotions are skills you can train.
  3. Your “sense of self” is an illusion.



(Shortform note: The first two of Harris’s truths are in line with the beliefs of Greek philosophers of the Epicurean and Stoic traditions. As Derren Brown explains in _Happy_ , these ancient schools of thought teach that your experience of life is entirely dependent on how you frame it in your mind, though putting this idea into practice requires retraining how you think and react in difficult situations. Nevertheless, the ancient thinkers may have disagreed with the third of Harris’s statements. In _Meditations_ , Stoic philosopher and Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius defines the self as being composed of the body, the spirit, and the intellect, of which he places the intellect as the most important of the three.)

According to Harris, it’s the last of these tenets—that **selfhood is illusory** —that lies at the heart of spirituality. A _spiritual experience_ is the feeling of transcending your limited existence, freeing your awareness from the constant grind of anxiety, longing, sadness, and pain. Throughout history, many people have felt such transcendence, usually in the context of a religion that attributes moments of rapture to divine origin. However, since people of _all_ faiths have had similar transcendent experiences, even between religions that directly contradict each other, then, logically, some factor outside of religion must be the source of the spiritual experience.

(Shortform note: For many people, there may be more to the spiritual experience than just transcendence of the self. In _The Book of Joy_ , Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama discuss the intersection of their different faiths and find that common values such as humility, humor, forgiveness, and gratitude are also essential to a spiritual life. Their views overlap with Harris’s transcendence of the self in that they both insist on the importance of developing a perspective of the world beyond your own instead of being preoccupied with yourself.)

#### The Buddhist Approach

If we discard any supernatural causes, then the common ground shared by anyone who’s had a spiritual experience is the human condition itself—namely, cognition and emotion. This shared human experience is where we find the universal truths that various opposing religions have uncovered. Harris says that while most religions hide the path to these truths behind a maze of superstition, ritual, and dogma, **Buddhism approaches spirituality with an almost scientific focus on experiment and observation,** which opens a path for nonbelievers to experience a transformation of consciousness without paying heed to any supernatural claims.

(Shortform note: Harris isn’t alone in noting Buddhism’s applicability outside the realm of religious belief. In _Sapiens_ , Yuval Noah Harari classifies Buddhism as a form of religion based on natural laws rather than the laws of a deity. Harari notes that the particular rules upon which Buddhism is founded are those of psychology—the behavior patterns of the human mind. Harari’s definition of what constitutes a religion is fairly broad, encompassing non-supernatural belief systems such as capitalism, humanism, and some atheist philosophies, like Harris’s.)

To be fair, Buddhism makes supernatural claims just like any other religion, such as the existence of spirits, reincarnation, and that some Buddhist adepts have extranormal powers. Nevertheless, Harris points out that when stripped of its mythological framework, Buddhism has an empirical core—a practical process to bring your awareness into the present moment so that you can realize that your thoughts and emotions don’t define your existence. Instead of asking you to take this idea on faith, Buddhism makes the _testable assertion_ that **the more you practice meditation, the more you’ll be able to free yourself from suffering.**

(Shortform note: Buddhism’s focus on suffering as a universal human trait has led some to criticize it as a fundamentally pessimistic religion. However, in _The Book of Joy_ , the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu both affirm that acceptance of suffering doesn’t entail rejecting happiness. Instead, the opposite is true, because acceptance of suffering leads directly to compassion and creates opportunities for personal growth if you can find meaning in the circumstances that cause you and others pain. From this point of view, suffering isn’t the antithesis of joy—joy is simply what comes afterward.)

### The Science of Consciousness

Before delving into how to apply Buddhist practices to a nonreligious life, we’ll explore what neuroscience and psychology have to say about the nature of consciousness and the mind. Unfortunately, **modern science is currently at a loss to even define what _consciousness_ is**, much less to study it directly. What we can do is examine scientific conjectures about consciousness, what current research can tell us about the complicated nature of cognition, and how studies of certain neurological processes offer tantalizing clues about how your sense of personal identity emerges in the brain.

Biologically, what we can say for certain about consciousness is that it’s a product of the brain, though no medical test or imaging of the brain can point to a specific neurological process that generates consciousness. Rather, consciousness appears to be an _emergent property_ of the nervous system—one that’s dependent on how the brain functions, while independent of any single part of the brain. Because consciousness is a purely subjective experience, Harris doubts that scientific research will ever be able to explain what it is from a neurological perspective, though he admits that science and medicine have answered other supposedly “unsolvable” riddles, such as how the matter that makes up our bodies can heal and reproduce itself.

(Shortform note: Harris’s conception of consciousness being an emergent property of the brain addresses the philosophical problem of dualism—the question of how the mind can be seemingly autonomous yet dependent on bodily function. However, not everyone agrees with Harris that consciousness can’t be scientifically observed, though scientists currently grappling with the problem admit that research has to be reframed to admit “first person” subjective data as being equally valid as objective data obtained by an impartial, outside observer.)

The things research can explore, says Harris, are the different mental processes that we think of as being pieces of our consciousness, such as language, behavior, and sensory perception, though as individuals we’re completely _unconscious_ of how these neurological processes function. Neural imaging shows that language processing and fine motor skills are controlled by the brain’s left hemisphere, while spatial mapping and emotional processing occur in the right side of the brain. None of these processes define consciousness, though. People who suffer brain injuries may lose one or more of these aspects of consciousness without losing the power of consciousness itself.

(Shortform note: It’s a common scientific generalization that certain mental functions chiefly take place in one or the other hemisphere of the brain, supported by authors such as Jill Bolte Taylor in _Whole Brain Living_ , Jordan Peterson in _Maps of Meaning_ , and Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson in _The Whole-Brain Child_. However, further studies have revealed that mental processing is far more complex, with many skills such as creativity and mathematics requiring input from both sides of the brain.)

One phenomenon that sheds an interesting light on the nature of consciousness is the experience of people who’ve undergone surgery to sever the hemispheres of the brain as a treatment for epilepsy. Once divided, each hemisphere demonstrates different skills, personalities, and even desires, behaving as two separate minds in one body. Harris argues that this division of consciousness shows experimentally that the mind is a property of the physical brain and not a phantasmal “soul” living inside it. After all, to believe in a soul implies that your mind is independent of your body—but how could a mind housed in a soul be divided in two by a medical procedure?

(Shortform note: Harris’s argument is based on two assumptions: that minds and souls are the same thing and that souls, if they exist, are indivisible. In _The Seat of the Soul_ , Gary Zukav presents an alternate view—that your soul is an expression of a universal consciousness not limited to yourself and that the spiritual essence of which souls are made can be broken down into smaller components, such as individual beings. Following Zukav’s reasoning, a person’s soul _could_ be divided in the case of people who undergo split-brain surgery, resulting in two separate expressions of the universal consciousness.)

#### Theory of Mind

In addition to your conscious awareness of your thoughts and feelings, another function of the brain is to interpret the thoughts and feelings of others. Psychologists call this the “theory of mind”—the understanding that other people have a point of view that’s different from your own. On the neurological level, this function of the brain is rooted in mirror neurons, the nerve cells that fire in response to other people’s behavior. In addition to modeling the actions of others, mirror neurons extrapolate the _intent_ behind what other people do. Scientists believe that this process of the brain identifies other people as separate beings and is inextricably linked to your sense of individuality and selfhood.

(Shortform note: How mirror neurons reflect and interpret other people’s states of being plays a vital role in cognitive development. In _The Whole-Brain Child_ , Siegel and Bryson explain that mirror neurons integrate a child’s developing sense of self with the family and community of which they’re a part, perhaps providing the neurological basis for empathy and compassion. While some research has called into question how important mirror neurons are to human empathy, the link that Siegel and Bryson make between a child’s sense of identity and how well they integrate with their larger community offers support for Harris’s next point.)

Harris suggests that there’s an even more basic link between the theory of mind and your feeling of selfhood, which is your**** understanding that other people are aware of you. **The feelings of personal identity we cling to are defined in opposition to the identities of others** , whom we recognize as beings separate from ourselves as modeled by our mirror neurons. When other people aren’t there to observe us, we still maintain an inner dialogue as if our identity requires an audience to exist.

(Shortform note: If anything, Harris understates the importance of having other people around to maintain your mental equilibrium, as evidenced by the dramatic example of prisoners sentenced to solitary confinement. A large body of scientific research shows that regardless of the length of time spent in confinement, isolation causes psychological damage that can manifest as depression, anxiety, psychosis, and hallucinations. Even social and emotional isolation can have similar damaging effects, including mood swings, confusion, and poor physical health.)

As we’ll cover later in this guide, Harris argues that your feelings of identity and selfhood are an illusion created by a multitude of interlinked mental processes, and that transcending the illusion of the self through deep contemplation is the core of spirituality as he defines it.

### Meditation and the Mind

Since current scientific methodology is insufficient to fully explore the nature of the mind, Harris turns to meditative introspection to investigate the properties of consciousness, identity, and selfhood, as well as what it means to transcend them. Harris describes the fundamentally subjective nature of consciousness, how it can be explored on a personal level, and why consciousness and individual selfhood are two separate aspects of the mind, with the latter being more illusory than you think.

In this context, **_consciousness_ is your subjective awareness of your existence and that of the world around you.** The limiting factor in examining consciousness is that nothing but __ consciousness can observe it, and only from a first-person point of view. You can examine your own conscious mind, but you can’t directly observe the minds of others, and no one else can directly observe yours. This has led some thinkers to suggest that consciousness itself is an illusion, but Harris says that argument is silly. If consciousness is an illusion, then _the experience of that illusion_ is proof that consciousness is real.

(Shortform note: Several other writers define consciousness differently than Harris, though still in terms of subjective experience. In _Homo Deus_ , Yuval Noah Harari lists _desire as one of consciousness’ defining characteristics_. In _Flow_ , Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi discusses consciousness purely in terms of attention and intention. In _The Untethered Soul_ , Michael A. Singer takes a stance diametrically opposed to Harris’s, insisting that the self is the only real identity, and consciousness is merely the window through which the self can experience life.)

It’s through spirituality, which Harris defines as deep contemplation of your conscious mind, that you can truly learn about yourself. While psychology has demonstrated the underlying power of the unconscious mind, **it’s in your conscious awareness that you subjectively experience life, the universe, and everything in it.** Consciousness is where you feel pain and pleasure, as well as where you make moral judgments. For example, consider the widely held conviction that it’s wrong to inflict pain on another being. That conviction stems from a person’s subjective experience of pain and a conscious understanding that other people and creatures are capable of the same subjective experience.

(Shortform note: Not everyone agrees with Harris that so-called “moral behavior” is a product of the conscious mind. In _The Selfish Gene_ , Richard Dawkins proposes that behaviors that might be viewed as altruistic are in fact biological adaptations that promote the health and survival of a group so that their shared genetic makeup can propagate into the future. If this view is correct, then the moral judgments that Harris refers to might be no more than our conscious rationalization of behaviors whose true motives are unconscious drives.)

Too often, such moral judgments are seen as the purview of religion, yet even religious practices can shed light on the nature of consciousness. For instance, consider monastic traditions that seek inner peace through contemplation and self-isolation. Harris suggests that while these monks are attempting to commune with the divine, they’re also conducting a philosophical experiment to determine if psychological health can exist outside the struggle for self-gratification that defines the normal, everyday world. Over the centuries, these experiments have yielded many positive results, including transcendental states of mind, especially when meditative practitioners have learned to silence their own inner monologues.

(Shortform note: Though Harris presents an image of monks as silent, meditating hermits, the reality behind the stereotype is that monasteries are active communities in which every member must work and contribute. While life in a monastery or convent is certainly less driven by materialism than in the world at large, living in close quarters with many other people requires the same level of interpersonal finesse as working every day in a corporate office. Despite that, the monastic example demonstrates that contentment can be found by slowing down, being mindful of your feelings, and letting go of old patterns of behavior.)

#### Separating Consciousness From Selfhood

The crux of Harris’s argument in favor of a “secular spirituality” is that **a meditative practice can help you find tranquility by experiencing moments of pure, unfiltered consciousness.** This happens when you experience _consciousness without thought_ , when you let your inner voice—as well as the constant churn of emotions that your thoughts inevitably trigger—slide away. Harris says that if you can experience awareness unburdened by your constant internal chatter, you’ll realize that your consciousness is independent of any feelings of personal identity and selfhood, and that your sense of identity is merely an illusion. This is a counterintuitive concept, so some definitions are in order.

When Harris says the “self” is an illusion, what exactly does he mean? The selfhood he’s referring to is **the feeling that you’re an incorporeal being sitting inside your head, looking out through your eyes, and steering your body like a vehicle.** Harris asserts that this particular feeling is a product of what he calls “psychological continuity,” the constant creation and narration of memories about your physical and cognitive experiences from one moment to the next. This moment-to-moment continuity creates the illusion that the “you” inside your head is the same “you” you were yesterday or will be tomorrow. But is that really the case? Are “you” the same person “you” were five years ago, or when “you” were a child?

> **The Continuity of Self**
> 
> A possible answer to Harris’s question was the subject of a 2012 psychological study that evaluated personality shifts in more than 170 people over a 65-year period. The study found that a person’s ability to regulate their moods remains consistent throughout life, but other personality traits do not, though the changes are gradual. A different study suggests that out of all of a person’s characteristics, your moral beliefs and attitudes are most closely related to your sense of identity, with memory coming in second place.
> 
> A counter-argument to Harris’s statement that psychological continuity is the root of feelings of selfhood is the experiences of people with Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID, formerly known as Multiple Personality Disorder). People with DID exhibit several distinct identities, each with its own separate sense of self, but without continuity over time—memories available to one identity may not be accessible to others, and vice versa. In practice, this manifests as each identity having partial amnesia, missing chunks of their past.

However, when meditation interrupts your mental chatter, you experience awareness unclouded by the internal narrative that normally defines your sense of identity. You realize that from a subjective point of view, all that can really be said to exist is your present awareness and the thoughts it contains. Harris isn’t arguing that you don’t exist or that you haven’t experienced the things you remember. What he’s saying is that your sense of selfhood is a construct of your memories and thoughts, and that it covers up a deeper reality—that **all you really have is your conscious awareness,** which isn’t defined by the thoughts, feelings, and memories that routinely impinge upon it.

(Shortform note: If feelings of selfhood are based on memories, as Harris suggests, then that opens up another argument that selfhood is an illusion—because memories are unreliable. In _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ , Rolf Dobelli writes that your brain constantly rewrites your memories, altering details as your beliefs change over time. In this sense, your memories and your sense of identity are in part a fabrication of your brain. Like Harris, Dobelli isn’t saying that everything you remember is wrong, but that your memory is subject to cognitive biases such as fixating on recent events and forgetting information as soon as you don’t need it.)

### Practical Enlightenment

All of this contemplation about the mind begs a practical question: In what way does understanding the nature of consciousness benefit you in your day-to-day life? The answer is in the leverage it gives you to control your mind. The central tenet of any meditative practice is that **your ability to direct and frame your thoughts and feelings dictates the quality of your experience** of life and the world around you. Harris explains the documented benefits of practicing meditation, as well as pitfalls to look out for. He then goes on to explore what “enlightenment” means in a nonreligious context and the underlying paradox of seeking self-improvement if the self is an illusion.

Harris cites psychological studies in which people report that their thoughts wander at least 50% of the time. This mental wandering goes hand-in-hand with increased unhappiness and heightened brain activity, regardless of whether their ruminations are pleasant or unpleasant. On the other hand, **studies on focused attention show reduction in stress, improved cognitive functioning, and better emotional regulation.**

(Shortform note: More recent studies than the ones referenced by Harris reveal a middle ground between mental wandering and focused meditation. This third path is _daydreaming_ —which can also be described as “thinking for fun”—and new research shows that like meditation, it’s a skill that can be learned. Engaging in daydreaming can stave off mental boredom and boost physical wellness. Proponents of daydreaming tout it as a positive mental workout that allows you to regulate thoughts and emotions in much the same way as meditation.)

The trouble is that for beginners, it’s hard to tell the difference between active meditation and letting your mind wander. The key is in learning to be aware of the present _before_ your thoughts interfere with your perceptions. Without mindfulness, the thoughts that fill your head become an endless inner monologue narrating your life to yourself.

(Shortform note: Harris writes as if having a running inner monologue is a universal human experience, and while it may be largely true, there are people whose inner thoughts take the form of abstractions instead of spoken language. There are also variations in the degree of mental chatter people experience. In _The Introvert Advantage_ , Marti Olsen Laney cites research that introverts use longer neural pathways to access information than extroverts, leading to more active and vocal inner monologues.)

#### The Path of Mindfulness

To quote Hamlet, “There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.” Taking control of the chatter in your mind requires accepting that your response to any situation—whether it’s suffering, elation, or indifference—is entirely the product of your thoughts. **Mindfulness lets you choose your responses consciously instead of giving in to habitual reactions,** such as anger or resentment. Harris cautions that he’s not recommending you detach from reality; he’s just stating that you don’t have to let the outside world dictate your emotional responses.

(Shortform note: This is another point on which Harris’s writing overlaps with the Stoics. As described by Derren Brown in _Happy_ , the tenet behind the Stoic way of life is that of taking responsibility for your thoughts and feelings. For Stoics, this is practical advice for achieving contentment rather than a path to transcendentalism. Nevertheless, just like Harris, the Stoics don’t advocate detachment from the world, merely detachment from thoughtless reactions. In _The Daily Stoic_ , Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman affirm the Stoics’ engagement with worldly issues—they simply practice detachment from the _outcome_ of their efforts.)

Harris also warns that a fully contemplative approach to life requires a certain intellectual maturity, though mindfulness practices have benefits for people of all ages, such as teaching emotional self-awareness. There are certain psychological and physical conditions that meditation practices could actually make worse. If you suffer from one of those, Harris recommends consulting a physician before launching yourself on a meditative journey.

(Shortform note: Harris doesn’t elaborate on the specific reasons why someone shouldn’t meditate, but like any other mind-altering practice, it comes with a certain degree of risk. For instance, people suffering from severe depression may find that meditation exacerbates their symptoms, and some trauma survivors have reported having flashbacks while attempting to focus during meditation practice. If inward-looking meditation might be distressing or dangerous, an alternative is to find mindfulness practices that focus your attention outward, such as hiking, gardening, or artistic creation.)

If you decide to pursue meditation, Harris says it’s important to find a good teacher, someone who can model the calm and sense of presence you’re trying to achieve on your path to enlightenment. However, be wary. The teacher-student relationship is ripe for exploitation, and the role of spiritual guru is especially attractive to frauds. Even teachers who offer good meditative guidance will sometimes make spurious claims about science or medicine as it relates to their field. As in all things, it’s good to maintain a certain level of skepticism, especially if you feel you’re being conned or abused by someone who claims to be a spiritual master.

(Shortform note: Telling the difference between an authentic spiritual teacher and a fraud can be tricky. In _The Confidence Game_ , psychologist Maria Konnikova explains that frauds don’t just lie about themselves, but they also exploit your confidence in your personal narrative. A skilled con artist identifies your unspoken desires, mirrors your values and personal experience to gain your trust, then uses that leverage as a means to convince you to do what the con artist wants. According to Konnikova, those who’ve fallen victim to religious frauds or cults often have strong feelings of denial that they’ve been conned at all.)

> **Choosing a Meditation Practice**
> 
> Finding the most effective meditation routine for your personal journey can be daunting, given the vast amount of writing on the subject. Shortform’s Master Guide to Choosing a Meditation Practice can help with a general overview of the field, covering the four major variations:
> 
>   * Buddhist meditation focuses mainly on mindfulness, managing strong emotions, and practicing compassion. Its aim is finding happiness through self-improvement rather than seeking a connection with the divine.
> 
>   * Hindu meditation, also known as yoga, is directed at achieving a union with the divine, though with its focus on posture, breath, and concentration, it’s been known to offer benefits to physical health.
> 
>   * Christian meditation, equated with prayer, is envisioned as a way to communicate with God, and it can result in a greater sense of well-being and purpose in life.
> 
>   * Western meditation, while harder to define than older traditions, generally focuses on self-improvement through achieving goals and manifesting the life that you want.

#### The Nature of Enlightenment

If you’re still unclear about the end goal of meditation beyond learning to be more present in the moment, you’re not alone. The “enlightenment” that meditative masters speak of is notoriously tricky to define. **Harris describes enlightenment as losing your sense of individual selfhood** and becoming aware of the world around you without the barrier created by your thoughts. He discusses what a state of enlightenment might feel like, the steps you go through on the way to achieving it, and what enlightenment teaches about the workings of the mind.

Achieving enlightenment does _not_ mean that you suddenly gain mystical powers or that your mind becomes one with the universe. Instead, enlightenment means achieving a state of mental equilibrium in which you’re not shaken by the highs and lows of life—or if you are, you can regain your balance quickly. It doesn’t mean giving up the things you love or turning a blind eye to suffering and injustice. **An enlightened mindset simply recognizes that all things are transitory** and lets you navigate the good times and the bad with calm and openness.

(Shortform note: In a broad sense, to be enlightened simply means “to gain an understanding,” whether that’s of science, a personal truth, or the fact that tacos are delicious. Though Harris frames spiritual enlightenment as one specific realization, others pose it differently. In _The Fifth Agreement_ , don Miguel Ruiz and don Jose Ruiz equate enlightenment with the realization that all of your experiences are subjective. In _The Power of Now_ , Eckhart Tolle states that enlightenment comes from living fully in the present moment. According to the Taoist text _Tao Te Ching_ , an enlightened person sees through their subjective illusions to face the objective world as it actually exists.)

To be clear, the goal of enlightenment isn’t to stop thinking and feeling. **The goal is to stop identifying with your thoughts and emotions** because that self-identification lies at the root of all your suffering. Harris says that meditation can break you from the cycle of pain by training you to recognize your thoughts and feelings as objects that exist apart from your consciousness. You can spot them when they appear, examine them as an impartial observer, and let them slip away without dominating your attention.

(Shortform note: This goal speaks against the advice of self-help gurus who suggest using your thoughts for positive gain. In _As a Man Thinketh_ , James Allen writes that by mastering your thoughts, you find purpose in life, while in _The Power of Your Subconscious Mind_ , Joseph Murphy says that conscious thought can retrain your subconscious and improve your state of mind. The ultimate example of self-identification with your thoughts and feelings may be the practice of “manifesting” espoused by authors Rhonda Byrne and Napoleon Hill, who suggest that directing your thoughts and emotions can bring material wealth and success, which mindfulness proponents such as Harris argue will keep you trapped in a cycle of misery.)

##### The Meditation Journey

Of course, meditation is a skill that must be practiced. When you first learn to meditate, you may feel an initial thrill of success. However, as you practice, you may feel more and more distracted during meditation. Harris writes that this is a natural step along the way, and though it feels like you may be getting worse at meditating, it actually means you’re getting better. If you start to feel distracted while meditating, it means **you’re getting better at noticing your thoughts** —in other words, you’re on the right track. True enlightenment may still be very far away, but you’ll find that the process of getting there makes your mind incrementally healthier.

(Shortform note: If you approach meditation with unrealistic expectations of how much or how quickly it will change your awareness, you may walk away disappointed. In _Mindfulness in Plain English_ , Bhante Gunaratana lays some ground rules—that meditation requires patience and being honest with yourself, and that the meditation process and its results are neither automatic nor predictable. Like Harris, Gunaratana points out that you’ll run into pitfalls in your meditation practice, such as boredom, disappointment, and even physical pain. These sensations are themselves thoughts and feelings that should be examined within the context of being mindful and not looked down upon as signs that you’re not meditating right.)

Eventually, during meditation, you may notice your consciousness as it exists _between_ one thought and the next. When this happens, you can finally understand that you are not your thoughts. Instead, you are the conscious awareness that your transitory thoughts pass through. It’s as if your awareness is a movie screen, and your thoughts are the images projected on it. No matter what those images are, they can’t harm the screen itself.

This is spiritual enlightenment at its core—that **consciousness without thought is your true, underlying experience.** Harris doubts that anyone can live in this state of awareness all the time, but he does believe that through practice you can glimpse it. Doing so can free you from the suffering triggered by the thoughts projected on the blank screen of your mind. How can you suffer when the “self” that is suffering is just an illusion, a “movie special effect” of the brain?

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Trap_ , Russ Harris presents another way of looking at the same idea that Harris is trying to convey. Instead of declaring that the self is an illusion created by a stream of passing thoughts, he says that you have a “thinking self” and an “observing self,” each of which serves a different function in your mind. In this view, the purpose of mindfulness is to disentangle these two parts of your awareness so that you can observe and recognize which thoughts are helpful and which thoughts aren’t. Rather than seeing your “thinking self” as an illusion, you can simply learn to distance yourself from its more destructive tendencies.)

#### The Paradox of Enlightenment

Realizing that your sense of selfhood is just a figment of your imagination brings up the following conundrum: Why should you work to improve yourself if your “self” doesn’t really exist? Harris explains how different schools of thought address this riddle, then explores the teachings of Dzogchen Buddhism and how it points toward a healthy approach to accepting life’s pitfalls while striving to be better. Harris says that meditation doesn’t “make your mind better”—it reveals a state of tranquility that was there for you to access all along.

(Shortform note: That the brain has a built-in capacity for transcendental awareness has been documented by neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor, not through meditation or experimentation, but by suffering a stroke on the left side of her brain. In _My Stroke of Insight_ , Taylor recounts that when her stoke shut down her inner monologue and her capacity for linear thought, she ceased to perceive herself as a separate entity from the world around her, but rather as part of a continuum of existence that brought feelings of peace she’d never noticed before. Taylor’s experience revealed to her that a deep sense of peace and connection with the world is hardwired into the human brain and that anyone can learn to engage it.)

However, since the _practice_ of meditation is a skill that must be mastered and improved, there are two different schools of thought regarding the attainment of enlightenment through seemingly meaningless “self” improvement. Here, Harris turns to Buddhism for guidance, for while he disregards Buddhism’s mystical claims, he embraces its “try this and see” approach toward spiritual understanding.

(Shortform note: Harris isn’t the first to comment on the practical, grounded aspects of Buddhism. In _The Art of Happiness_ , the Dalai Lama himself lays out a pragmatic approach to contentment based on education, self-motivation, and doing the mental work of mindfulness, none of which call for a belief in the supernatural. While he recommends making spirituality a part of your daily life, the Dalai Lama explicitly states that it doesn’t matter if your spirituality is religious or secular—what’s important are the positive actions that result from your spiritual life.)

The approach embodied by Theravada Buddhism ignores the paradox of self-improvement entirely by setting **enlightenment as a distant future goal that may never be achieved** but should always be worked toward. Harris argues that the problem with this approach is that it intellectualizes the concept of the illusion of the self. After all, if you’re thinking about how your sense of selfhood is an illusion, _you’re still thinking_ instead of experiencing pure awareness. Another approach, Advaita Vedānta, asserts that meditation _isn’t_ a path to enlightenment and that a full understanding of the illusion of selfhood can only come as a flash of insight, one that once seen cannot be unseen, almost like an optical illusion.

(Shortform note: Though the other systems of thought that Harris writes about are Buddhist, Advaita Vedānta is a Hindu philosophy dating back to the 9th century CE. A central tenet of Advaita Vedānta is that there’s no distinction between the individual self and Brahman—the underlying reality of the universe. In Advaita Vedānta, the spiritual goal is to realize that the whole world is an illusion, one that you can learn to transcend as you perceive higher truths.)

Harris adopts a personal approach adhering to the teachings of Dzogchen Buddhism, whose ideas lay somewhere in the middle ground. **The point of Dzogchen is to break through the illusion of selfhood and experience pure consciousness at any given moment.** This breakthrough isn’t a product of drawn-out meditation, but rather takes the form of an instant awareness of the illusion. However, Dzogchen teachers acknowledge that you’re unlikely to have the “flash of insight” you’re trying to achieve without the observational skills developed by practicing meditation. Therefore, in Dzogchen, you meditate to strengthen your awareness so that when your moment of insight comes, you’ll be able to recognize it for what it is.

> **A Brief History of Buddhism**
> 
> Siddhartha Gautama, the historical Buddha, was born in what is present-day Nepal in the 6th century BCE, and though he lived in luxury, he’s believed to have achieved enlightenment after witnessing and meditating on the suffering of others. Theravada Buddhism, as practiced in southeast Asia, is believed to be the oldest existing form of the religion. More than other Buddhist sects, Theravada recognizes the historical humanity of the Buddha rather than viewing him as a divine figure.
> 
> The other major branch of the faith is Mahayana Buddhism, practiced in China, Japan, and Tibet. It dates back to Buddhist monks of the 1st century BCE who viewed the Buddha as a transcendental being and believed that it’s possible for anyone to attain enlightenment. Dzogchen, the path that Harris recommends, is not a separate school of Buddhism but is instead an advanced set of practices within the Tibetan Mahayana tradition.

Harris says that by following the teachings of Dzogchen Buddhism, he’s able to see through his own illusion of selfhood. He can’t do it all the time, but with practice, he can access an unclouded awareness of the present moment on a regular basis. He finds that this kind of spiritual awareness doesn’t lead to detachment or a lack of motivation to improve himself. Rather, he argues that such an awareness can help you find a place of calm and clarity from which **you can accept your life and the world while striving to make things better.**

(Shortform note: Much like the paradox posed at the start of this section, Harris’s assertion that you can accept how things are and still work to improve them may seem like a contradiction. This concept is resolved more fully by Buddhist psychologist Tara Brach in _Radical Acceptance_. Brach argues that growth through acceptance is a two-part process. The first is to accept your feelings and emotions without judgment so you can let go of the harmful narratives you might have constructed around them. This frees you to take the second step: treating yourself and others with compassion. For Brach, compassion isn’t just a feeling; it’s a positive response that can change your life, just as Harris suggests you can do once you see past your own illusions.)
