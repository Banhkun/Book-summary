## Exercise: Define Your Values

According to Shetty, defining the values you want to live by is vital to experiencing satisfaction and happiness in your life.

* * *

Describe two types of experiences that feel most meaningful to you. Consider moments during which you feel satisfaction, joy, or at peace with yourself. For example, you may feel satisfied when you’re making use of your creative talents, or at peace with yourself when you’re walking your dog early in the morning and see the sun rise.

What values do you think these experiences point toward? For example, if seeing the sun rise feels meaningful to you, it might be because you value experiencing the inherent beauty within nature.

Think of someone who inspires you. Name the specific qualities about them that you admire. For example, it could be their generosity, warmth, or their ability to always know the right thing to say.

What values do you think guide this person? For example, if they are always warm and generous, they might be guided by compassion or kindness.
