## Exercise: Create an Overview of Your Target Market

Create a brief overview of what you’re selling and to whom, the size of your target market, and your market share goal.

* * *

Think of one product or service you intend to profit from. What specific benefits does it offer?

What is the specific market you’re targeting? Narrow this down to a group of customers that rely on a common pool of competitors and distribution channels. (For example, people who want to buy designer jewelry on online auction sites.)

What is the size of your target market?

Consider your target market’s life cycle stage, your current resources, and the strategies you’ll need to employ to acquire market share. What share of the market can you realistically aim to acquire?
