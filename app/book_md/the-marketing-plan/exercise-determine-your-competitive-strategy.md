## Exercise: Determine Your Competitive Strategy

Consider your competitors and the strategies you can use to outmatch them.

* * *

Describe one product or service you intend to profit from and your target market. Write down the name of at least one of your competitors.

Why should customers choose to buy from you? How is your product or service currently better than what your competitor is offering?

Describe at least one thing you can improve to gain a competitive advantage. (According to Luther, there are four ways to be better than the competition: provide a better offer, pretend to provide a better offer, provide a cheaper offer, or provide better customer service.)

Consider how you want consumers to perceive your business. Write down one way that you can differentiate your brand or your marketing message to influence consumers to choose you over the competition.
