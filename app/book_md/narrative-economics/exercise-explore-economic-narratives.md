## Exercise: Explore Economic Narratives

Use these exercises to understand the narratives and stories that drive your economic beliefs and behaviors.

* * *

What is an economic narrative, story, or belief that you accept? Why do you believe this to be true, and how does it influence your economic decision-making? For example, you may believe that AI will make most jobs obsolete, so you spend extra time familiarizing yourself with large language models like ChatGPT.

Have you ever changed your mind about an economic narrative that you once believed? Explain your answer. If so, what caused you to reevaluate your views?

Do you believe that certain economic narratives can be harmful? Please explain your answer.
