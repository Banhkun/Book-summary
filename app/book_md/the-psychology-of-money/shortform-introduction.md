## Shortform Introduction

How can you become financially successful? In _The Psychology of Money_ , finance writer Morgan Housel posits that the secret lies in understanding human behavior: When you understand the emotions and beliefs that influence your financial decisions, you make better decisions. In his book, Housel illuminates these emotions and beliefs, explaining why we make bad financial choices—and what you should do instead.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Harriman House

Published in 2020, _The Psychology of Money_ is Housel’s third and most popular book. It differs from his previous book because it is full of new and original insights: His first book, _Everyone Believes It; Most Will Be Wrong, _is a collection of previously published essays, while his second, book, _50 Years in the Making: The Great Recession and Its Aftermath_, is a collection of interviews with other financial experts. That said, _The Psychology of Money_ is based on Housel’s viral 2018 blog post with the same name.

### The Book’s Context

#### Intellectual Context

Housel focuses on sharing timeless truths about wealth. So in some ways, _The Psychology of Money_ acts as a synthesis of some of the best personal finance wisdom shared through the decades—from 1996’s _The Millionaire Next Door _to 2012’s _Antifragile_. But unlike other personal finance books, Housel presents almost no equations or specific strategies. Rather, he focuses on presenting the broad principles you need to understand to gain wealth.

#### The Book’s Impact

_The Psychology of Money_ became an international bestseller and was particularly popular in finance media, with several publications devoting articles to the lessons shared in the book. It is also set to be made into a movie: Cavalry Media purchased the screen rights in 2020.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Online reviewers who appreciate the book love the timeless, simple lessons that Housel shares. They find his teachings useful and impactful, and they love the real-life stories Housel uses to illustrate his arguments.

Online reviewers who find fault with the book find Housel’s teachings unoriginal and repetitive. They also note a lack of diversity in the real-life stories Housel describes, which almost exclusively star men.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

The lessons Housel shares in _The Psychology of Money_ mostly make intuitive sense. However, Housel’s support of these lessons is uneven. Sometimes, he backs up his claims with research and anecdotes of well-known people. Other times, he supports his ideas with only personal experience. Research shows that many of the ideas that aren’t as well-supported are already popular and well-known in the personal finance genre—but Housel often doesn’t attribute these ideas to the people who originally popularized them.

Additionally, while marketed as a collection of timeless lessons about finance, _The Psychology of Money_ is most applicable if your financial strategy includes investing in the United States. Much of Housel’s advice involves investing in financial markets specifically—indeed, Housel doesn't seem to consider that you can create a financial strategy without doing so. Furthermore, Housel recommends many strategies based on his assumption that the US economy will continue growing long-term. So if you’re not investing in the US, his strategies may not work as well for you.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Housel devotes the first 18 chapters of his book to teaching 18 lessons he thinks you must understand in order to achieve financial success. Each of these chapters contains a paragraph at the end connecting its ideas to the immediately following chapter—but otherwise, the chapters do not seem to be grouped in a meaningful way. After sharing his lessons, Housel presents a synthesis of his ideas in Chapter 19 before describing how he manages his own wealth in Chapter 20. Finally, Housel shares an epilogue where he briefly describes American economic history in an attempt to explain why modern-day Americans think about money how they do.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve focused on making Housel’s lessons easy to follow. To that end, we’ve re-ordered his lessons: We’ll first describe the mindsets you need to achieve financial success before diving into how to create and follow a good financial strategy. We’ve also eliminated many of Housel’s anecdotes for clarity, as well as Housel’s description of how he manages his own money, since it only applies to him.

Given that Housel focuses mostly on broad principles, we’ve supplemented many of his ideas with concrete recommendations from other finance experts. We’ve also noted how Housel’s ideas have changed over the years by drawing upon his previously published works—including the original blog post he based this book on.
