## Exercise: Protect Your Money

Now that you’ve learned why planning for setbacks is essential to a successful financial strategy, you can think about where your own financial strategy might be vulnerable—and how to protect yourself.

* * *

First, select a financial area of focus: either your income or your investments. Describe a worst-case scenario for that area and the results. What would happen if, for example, you get fired or the market you’re invested in crashes?

Now, imagine that the worst-case scenario you described above happens tomorrow. What financial safeguards do you have in place right now to protect you from that impact?

Would those safeguards protect you adequately from the fallout of your worst-case scenario? In what areas would you still need to adjust your investments, behavior, or plans for the future?

If the financial safeguards you’ve placed already don’t seem like enough, write down a few additional safeguards you can implement. For example, if your worst-case scenario would mean you pass away and leave your family without a household income, you might look into purchasing life insurance.
