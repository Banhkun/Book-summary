## Exercise: Analyze a Familiar Story

To better understand McKee’s story theory, analyze a story using the framework you’ve just learned.

* * *

Pick a story you’re familiar with—this might be your favorite movie, a book you’ve just read, or a memorable play. Identify the story’s climax, then use that climax to identify the story’s theme. (For example, the climax of _The Shawshank Redemption_ is the scene in which Andy Dufresne finishes his tunnel out of prison. Judging by this climax, the theme might be “When you work for a better future, eventually, you’ll be rewarded.”)

Use the climax to help you identify the inciting incident that it resolves. What is your story’s inciting incident, and what goal does it establish? (For example, the inciting incident of _The Shawshank Redemption_ is when Andy is falsely accused of murdering his wife and imprisoned at Shawshank. This event plunges Andy into a miserable life in prison, giving him the story goal to create a life worth living for himself and his fellow inmates)

List the story’s act climaxes: the scenes with the most significant changes. What extreme value changes occur in each of these scenes? (For example, the Act Two climax of _The Shawshank Redemption_ is when the warden kills Tommy to prevent him from leaking evidence that proves Andy’s innocence. Negative value change: Andy loses a friend as well as the hope of being exonerated.)

Pick one scene from the story and analyze it on the level of story beats. Describe several beats of the protagonist’s action and the world’s reaction, then identify the value change at the end of the scene. (For example, while tarring the roof of the prison, Andy stops working and offers to help a guard exploit a loophole in his taxes. The guard threatens to throw him off the roof. Andy talks the guard into accepting his deal in exchange for beers for his fellow prisoners. The guard agrees. Positive value change: Andy gains the admiration of the inmates.)
