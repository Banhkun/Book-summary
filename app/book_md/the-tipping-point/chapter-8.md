## Chapter 8: Think Small and Question your Intuition

Tipping Points are all about small ways to make significant change. So-called Band-Aid solutions — despite the term’s negative connotations — can actually be the most effective strategies by taking **focused, targeted action with the least amount of time, effort, and cost**. Using a heavy amount of effort to tackle all aspects of a problem is not always possible or the best use of energy.

As we’ve discussed with the three rules of epidemics, you just need to pinpoint the right tweak (or tweaks) to tip an epidemic — whether it’s finding the right messenger, changing your presentation, or altering the context.

### Case Study: Spreading Breast Cancer Awareness at Beauty Salons

A nurse named Georgia Sadler launched a grassroots campaign to raise awareness about diabetes and breast cancer. She started by hosting seminars in black churches, but she found that the few people who attended already knew about the diseases, so she wasn’t reaching a new or large audience. However, when she moved the campaign from churches to beauty salons, she had epidemic success. **Sadler changed the context by meeting people where they already were spending time (at the hair salon), instead of asking them to fit another commitment into their schedules.**

Sadler capitalized on the existing relationships between hair stylists and their regular clients. The stylists were Connectors, so she trained them on information about the diseases that they could share with their clients. She also had a folklorist train the stylists in strategies to deliver the information in a compelling way, with conversation starters and other tidbits that made the information fit a typical salon conversation.

Sadler followed up by assessing how well her campaign was changing women’s attitudes and motivating them to get mammograms and diabetes tests, and she found that it was successful. (Shortform note: The book doesn’t offer any way of quantifying that success.)

### Question Your Intuition

We have looked at several ways in which our intuitions — about how people think and why they behave the way they do — are often wrong; for one thing, we severely underestimate the influence of nonverbal and contextual cues. **In order to successfully incite a social epidemic, you must consistently test and question your intuitions.**

Tipping points can be so unpredictable and volatile because humans — whose behavior must change in order for an epidemic to tip — are themselves unpredictable and subject to a wide variety of influencing forces. **The volatility of tipping points, while potentially puzzling, is hopeful; with the right strategic action, you can create massive change.**
