## Introduction: Ideas Spread Like Viruses

You see the phenomenon every flu season: Someone in your office catches a bug, and within a week it seems half her department is infected. In two weeks, there are people showing those same flu symptoms in every department, and by the end of the month half the office has caught the bug.

Each person who catches the virus can infect a whole new set of people, and each of them does the same, in an ongoing ripple effect. The virus continues spreading this way, ultimately creating an epidemic. This is how epidemics grow through geometric progression: When a virus spreads, it doubles, and doubles again, and doubles again, and through that process it grows exponentially.

**Ideas, messages, behaviors, and products can spread through a population in a social epidemic in the same way that viruses spread.** Epidemics have a few common characteristics.

  * Epidemics are contagious. Whether a virus or an idea, it passes quickly and easily from person to person. 
  * Small changes have big impacts. In the case of a flu going around the office, a change in the strain of the virus could make it last longer, which creates a bigger window of time that people are sick and can spread the germs. Or, something as small as running out of tissues or hand sanitizer in the conference rooms could make a significant difference in the virus’ spread. 
  * **Epidemics don’t build gradually and steadily; they grow and reach a boiling point or critical mass, at which point they explode and turn into an epidemic. That threshold is called the tipping point.**



It can be hard to wrap our head around the notion that drastic change happens at one particular point because we tend to think that significant changes occur in a steady progression (e.g. a river doesn’t flood instantaneously when a storm hits; the water steadily rises over hours of heavy rain). But **the tipping point is a critical moment when minor change makes all the difference** (e.g. the moment the water crests the river bank).

Think of snow: The difference between 34 and 31 degrees Fahrenheit doesn’t feel much colder than the difference between 37 and 34 degrees. But when that same three-degree drop happens at the tipping point — 32 degrees — rain becomes snow.

This book focuses on how to push ideas or products to a tipping point in order to create a social epidemic. In Chapters 1-5, we’ll discuss in detail the three factors that can tip epidemics and examples of each of these strategies in action. Then, in chapters 6 and 7, we’ll take a more in-depth look at how these principles play out in practice and examine how you can use your insight about what tips an epidemic to develop a strategy for _stopping_ an epidemic.

(Shortform note: While the book outlines the principles of how to tip epidemics and illustrates them in numerous examples, it lacks in specific tips for applying these principles. It may be that each situation and would-be epidemic calls for such a unique combination and application of these strategies that there’s no way to give general advice, but Gladwell’s primary focus is on getting readers to understand the foundations of social epidemics, not advising how to put them to practice.)
