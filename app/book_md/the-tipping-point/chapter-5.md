## Chapter 5: The Power of Small Groups

The principle of the Power of Context applies to not only our physical environment and the circumstances of a situation, but also who’s around us. Specifically, people behave differently when they’re in a group than when they’re alone. When we’re alone we’re more likely to act independently, but **around other people our behavior is affected by peer pressure, social norms, and other influences; those influences can be enough to tip an epidemic.**

**Small groups, in particular, have a strong power to amplify a message or idea and help create an epidemic** for a few reasons.

  * The power of group influence is stronger when each member of the group knows her fellow group members (e.g. you care more about what your friends and family think of you than strangers’ opinions).
  * Humans have a mental and emotional limit to the number of social relationships they can maintain, so the size of these groups must be within that limit in order to have that relational level of social influence. 
  * People rely on each other for division of labor and division of knowledge in order to work more efficiently in groups. This creates a network of interconnectedness and influence. 



> **The Epidemic Success of the _Ya-Ya Sisterhood_**
> 
> The success of the bestselling book _Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood_ (later turned into a Hollywood movie with a celebrity cast) is largely because it became an epidemic among small groups — specifically, book clubs. One piece of evidence for this is that the book first tipped in Northern California, where there is a strong book club culture.
> 
> The book’s compelling characters and emotionally engaging storyline make it ideal for book club discussions, and the act of sharing and discussing the story among friends increased _Ya-Ya Sisterhood_ ’s stickiness by creating a whole experience around the book. What’s more, the book’s focus on mother-daughter relationships and female friendships resonated with many female readers, resulting in book club discussions that were more personal and amplified readers’ connection with the book.
> 
> Being a book club pick meant the _Ya-Ya Sisterhood_ sales grew more quickly — with book club groups of five or more — than it could have through individual sales. The epidemic then spread further when the (primarily) women in these book clubs recommended _Ya-Ya Sisterhood_ to other friends, family members, and, of course, book clubs.

### In Groups, Less is More

Every species has a limited capacity for how much information individuals can store, including how many close relationships they can maintain.

Channel capacity is a term in cognitive psychology that says humans have limited space in our brains for certain kinds of information: by and large, we can only remember six or seven things — whether objects, numbers, categories, or sounds — before we get overwhelmed and start to lose track. Similarly, social channel capacity states that we have a limited emotional capacity. **We can only maintain deep relationships with a limited number of people before we hit our limit.**

The concept was developed as anthropologist Robin Dunbar noted the difference in brain size of various primates (including humans). Specifically, compared to other mammals, primates have an exceptionally large neocortex. The neocortex is the part of the brain responsible for complex thought and reasoning.

Primates with a larger neocortex live in larger groups, with humans having the largest of all in both categories (neocortex and community size). Dunbar argued that a large neocortex is necessary to handle the complexities of larger groups; the more people (or primates) in a group, the more relationships and dynamics you have to keep track of.

  * (Shortform example: In your circle of friends, you know which people have close personal bonds, which people only see each other in group settings, and which people have a history of conflict. The same is probably true (at least to some extent) among your coworkers.) 



**The power of peer influence is strongest in groups that are small enough where each member has some kind of acquaintanceship or relationship with the rest of the group.** This group dynamic makes small groups ideal for influencing behavior to tip an epidemic.

> **Case Study: Establishing the Methodist Church Through Small Groups**
> 
> The founder of the Methodist church, John Wesley, created an epidemic by mobilizing many small groups throughout England and North America, expanding the religion from 20,000 to 90,000 followers within six years.
> 
> Wesley traveled around England and North America preaching open-air sermons to thousands of people. In each place, he would stay long enough to form religious societies from his most zealous followers. Converts had to attend weekly meetings and follow a strict code of conduct, or else face expulsion from the group. This way, **each group self-regulated and maintained the principles of the faith.**
> 
> In his travels, Wesley regularly visited these societies to reinforce the structure and ensure the standards of the religion remained strong. But overall, the groups he’d created became communities that largely kept themselves in line.

### The Rule of 150

On a community level, people have a capacity to have some kind of social relationship with about 150 people. In different cultures and organizations — from tribes to military divisions — people have organically realized that social structure functions best at or under 150 people. This is called the Rule of 150.

**In a community of 150 or less, people know everyone well enough to keep each other accountable to get work done, to abide by social standards, and to follow other group policies and norms.** Groups of this size are better able to reach consensus and act as one. Beyond that limit, smaller groups start to break off and organizational hierarchies (e.g. management structures in companies) may be needed to keep order.

Groups also use a joint memory system called transactive memory to act more efficiently and cohesively. People are not limited to the facts and information we can memorize; we remember the sources of useful information — like phone books and maps and recipe books — to give us access to much more than our memory can hold. When we rely on the people we have close relationships with to hold information for us, this is called transactive memory.

Couples and families do this often. If you’re talking about a movie you saw and can’t remember an actor’s name, you may turn to your spouse to help you fill in the missing information because she tends to be better at remembering those kinds of details. Or if you just came home with a new tech device and don’t know how to program it, you know your teenage daughter is the best person in your family to ask for help.

In this way, groups develop a joint memory system in which each person organically becomes the resident expert on one topic or another, based on who is best suited to remember that kind of information. **Transactive memory makes groups more efficient because each person does not need to know a little bit of everything. Instead, she just needs to know _who_ has the expertise she needs.** For this to work, the group must be small enough that the members know each other well enough to know who knows what, and to trust each other to be proficient and reliable within their individual areas of expertise.

> **Case Study: Gore Associates Succeeds By Following the Rule of 150**
> 
> One example of the application of the Rule of 150 in a business setting is Gore Associates, a multimillion-dollar company that produces Gore-Tex fabric as well as high-tech products. Gore has followed the Rule of 150 throughout its growth as a steadily and increasingly profitable, innovative company with low turnover.
> 
> The company’s founder continually creates new divisions of the company to keep each one at or under 150 employees, essentially creating communities. Production plants are built to hold up to 150 people, and when one plant gets close to capacity, another one is built nearby. **Although all the plants are part of the same company, each one has its own culture and community.** Through transactive memory, each person in a plant or division knows which coworker has the expertise to help with any question that comes up.
> 
> **Keeping plants and divisions of 150 or fewer employees creates peer pressure, social norms, and other group influences that help maintain the company’s standards.** It’s harder for employees to slack off, for example, if they know everyone in the building — and everyone knows them, and knows who’s responsible if there’s a delay in one part of the production process. Gore does not have formal management structures in its plants because communities of this size self-regulate.
