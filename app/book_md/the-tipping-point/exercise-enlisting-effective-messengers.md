## Exercise: Enlisting Effective Messengers

To turn your product, message, or idea into an epidemic, you may need to enlist the help of skilled messengers (Connectors, Mavens, or Salesmen) to help you get the word out. Use this exercise to help you identify these people and determine how they can help tip your epidemic.

* * *

Describe a product or idea you are trying to tip into an epidemic. (This can be the product your company is selling, the culture change you’re trying to create at your workplace, even an effort at home to get everyone to wash dishes as soon as they’re dirtied.)

In this situation, who would be a Connector, a person (or group of people) who is well-known among the people you’re trying to influence?

Who is a relevant Maven, who has trusted expertise in this subject area? Who is someone that people go to for the best advice?
