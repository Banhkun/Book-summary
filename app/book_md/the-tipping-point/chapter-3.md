## Chapter 3: The Stickiness Factor - Make Your Message Stick

The Law of the Few declares that the right messengers can tip and spread an epidemic. However, your messengers can only succeed when the message is one that will catch on — in other words, it must be “sticky.” To be sticky, a message must be memorable enough to inspire action or change.

Stickiness is particularly difficult in the Information Age because modern media exposes consumers to so much information that it is harder for an individual message to stick. In the advertising industry, this conundrum is called the clutter problem.

**An idea is not inherently sticky or un-sticky; to make an idea sticky, you have to tweak the way it is presented.** A message doesn’t need to be loud or in your face to be sticky. In fact, small, subtle changes are often the key to stickiness.

#### Make It Personal and Practical

In a 1960s experiment, social psychologist Howard Levanthal tried to influence a group of seniors at Yale to get tetanus shots. He distributed pamphlets with information about the dangers of tetanus, the importance of getting vaccinated, and details about the campus health center offering free tetanus shots to students. These pamphlets came in three versions:

  * The first was a “high fear” version that emphasized the disease’s dangers and included dramatic photos of people inflicted with tetanus. 
  * The second was a “low fear” version that omitted photos and somewhat de-emphasized the risks. 
  * After Levanthal found the first two versions had hardly any effect in persuading students to get the shot, he distributed a third version that listed the times the shots were available and included a campus map with the health center circled. 



Although most of the students probably already knew where to find the health center (remember, they were all seniors), 28 percent of students got vaccinated as a result of this third version, compared with just 3 percent from the first two versions. **When the information had a practical and personal touch, it was more effective.**

### Case Study: _Sesame Street_ and _Blue’s Clues_

Two television shows that launched 30 years apart had the same mission: broadcast educational programming sticky enough to capture the attention of 2-, 3-, and 4-year-olds and have the lessons stick with them to give them a leg up in school. Both shows used careful research to find strategies that made the content extra sticky for their young viewers — some strategies overlapped, while others were totally different.

In both cases, **small, often unexpected changes made a significant impact on whether or not preschoolers retained the information.**

#### The Pioneer: _Sesame Street_

When a television producer named Joan Ganz Cooney masterminded _Sesame Street_ , she wanted to start an epidemic: She wanted to use television to infect preschool-aged children with literacy. **Her literacy virus had to be sticky enough to overpower the effects of poverty and parental illiteracy** to give a leg up to young children who would otherwise enter school at an academic disadvantage. So the show’s creators conducted studies to help them engineer stickiness.

To this day, many people believe that both children and adults alike watch TV almost addictively because the visual and aural stimulation transfixes them, regardless of whether we are understanding or absorbing the content. However, one finding revealed that **kids watch what’s on TV when they understand the content, and look away when they become confused or disinterested**.**** They don’t just stare hypnotized for hours on end.

This insight allowed researchers to test childrens’ understanding and interest by simply observing them as they watched episodes of _Sesame Street_ , then adjusting the program to keep children’s interest.

Here’s one example:

  * The show originally kept the Muppet characters and human characters separate, appearing in different scenes and settings, and never interacting. This approach was based on psychologists’ advice that if the Muppet world were mixed with the real world, young children wouldn’t be able to distinguish the difference between make-believe and reality. However, through the testing research, the show’s creators learned that children’s interest dropped during the human segments. 
  * They didn’t want to lose children’s attention every time the humans came on screen, so they created Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch, and Snuffleupagus, to bring Muppets into the human scenes in the street. This paved the way to the iconic Muppet-human interactions that continue to today.



**_Sesame Street_ ’s creators built the show on the concept that if they could keep kids’ attention, they could educate them. **As long as the show’s content was produced in a way that directed viewers’ attention to the educational aspects (e.g. the letters appearing on the screen, not just the bright, fluffy Muppet pointing to them), children retained the lessons.

#### Take Two: _Blue’s Clues_

Almost 30 years after _Sesame Street_ first aired, the creators of _Blue’s Clues_ wanted to make a children’s educational show even stickier than _Sesame Street_. The producers made a format that improved on two major stickiness limitations of _Sesame Street_.

First, _Sesame Street_ includes jokes and wordplay aimed at adults, in the hopes that more children will watch the show if their parents or guardians are willing to watch with them. The problem is that these adult jokes go over kids’ heads and can become a distraction, reducing the stickiness of the overall message.

  * _Blue’s Clues_ , by contrast, is extremely literal and kid-centered (so much so, that it can be tedious for adults watching with young viewers). 



Second, with preschoolers’ short attention span in mind, the creators of _Sesame Street_ formatted it as a magazine show, consisting of dozens of segments that are each under three minutes long. But later research revealed that **narrative structures make information stickier for kids, because kids better engage with and remember information presented in a story.**

  * Each episode of _Blue’s Clues_ is one continuous story that always follows the same structure: The host, Steve, and his animated dog, Blue, are presented with a puzzle and discover clues throughout the episode to ultimately solve the puzzle. 



_Blue’s Clues_ also borrowed some of _Sesame Street_ ’s tried and true methods of stickiness. For one thing, **information is stickier for children when they interact with it in some way, so both shows elicit responses from their young viewers.** If you watch a child watching either _Sesame Street_ or _Blue’s Clues_ , you may notice them occasionally talking to the TV in response to a character’s question or prompting.

Secondly, **_Sesame Street_ effectively uses repetition to help lessons sink in to children’s minds so that they gain a deeper understanding with each repetition. _Blue’s Clues_** did a different take on this principle and aired each episode for five days in a row, Monday through Friday, before airing a new one the following week. Over the course of the week, children became more advanced at following along with the clues and solving the puzzles as the lessons took a stronger hold (read: became stickier) in their minds.
