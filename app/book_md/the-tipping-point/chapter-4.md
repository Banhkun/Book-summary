## Chapter 4: Context Alters Our Behavior

Whereas the first two principles of epidemics address the people who help spread the message far and wide (The Law of the Few) and how effectively an idea or message can take hold (The Stickiness Factor), the third principle has to do with the conditions that lend themselves to an epidemic catching on. According to the Power of Context, **people are so sensitive to conditions and changes in our environment that context can determine whether or not an epidemic tips.**

In the case of Paul Revere, the fact that he made his ride in the middle of the night was pivotal in helping the word-of-mouth epidemic catch on. First, it was easier to reach people knowing they were all at home in bed — rather than scattered around at work or running errands. Second, people understood that if Revere’s message was urgent enough that he had to wake them in the middle of the night, it must be important.

**Subtle, seemingly insignificant changes in our immediate environments can make us more likely to change our behavior** ; when done on a broad enough scale, this can ignite an epidemic. These changes may be in our physical environment or social context (think of the murder of Kitty Genovese where bystanders stood watching, from Chapter 1).

### Case Study: Environmental Context Reducing Crime in NYC

During the 1980s, New York City had some of the highest crime rates in its history. Suddenly, in the 1990s, crime rates plummeted faster and more dramatically than any other city during that same period.

This drop appeared to be an anti-crime epidemic in how quickly and widely it took hold, but it didn’t really follow the first two principles of epidemics — The Law of the Few and The Stickiness Factor.

  * First, it’s not as if Connectors, Mavens, or Salesmen were broadcasting a message across New York City that now is the time to run amok with crime, or now is the time to collectively stop.
  * Second, crime is not one specific idea, product, or message. Crime is a collective term for a wide range of actions and behaviors, which each have their own complex set of contributing factors (e.g. the reasons for a rise or fall in home burglaries can be completely different than the reasons for a change in the murder rate). It’s hard, if not impossible, to pinpoint a stickiness factor for such a range of actions and behaviors. 



NYC’s anti-crime epidemic relied strongly on the third principle, The Power of Context. The change in context had to do with a policing approach called the **Broken Windows Theory** , which says that smaller signs of disorder — like broken windows left in disrepair on a building — send the message that anything goes. This subtle message leads to greater crime and public disorder. In other words, **the environment is spreading a message that changes people’s behavior and leads to an epidemic.**

Initially, NYC police’s Broken Windows approach led them to tackle graffiti in the subway systems. They made enormous efforts to keep trains clean of graffiti in order to send the message that someone was paying attention and even small infractions would not be overlooked.

Then, transit police cracked down on fare-beating, when people would hop subway turnstiles or find other ways to get onto the trains without paying the fares. Again, if one person skipped paying the fare, it signaled to other passengers that they shouldn’t have to either. That mentality easily snowballs into defiance against other, more serious rules as well.

The transit police had to take a gamble on putting so much effort and resources on fare-beating — which, in isolation, is a small offense — at a time when more serious crimes on the subway were at an all-time high. It can be challenging to put the Power of Context to practice because **making small contextual changes to create a big impact feels counterintuitive. But if you make the right changes, you’ll see the results.**

After seeing results from their strategy in the subway system, NYPD implemented the Broken Windows approach across the city. Officers targeted minor crimes including public drunkenness, public urination, throwing empty bottles on the street, and minor property damage. Ultimately, violent crimes dropped in the subway system and across the city, and NYPD administrators believed the Broken Windows approach deserves the credit.

The mayor and police chief reasoned that enforcing minor infractions sent the message that no criminal activity — even seemingly insignificant offenses — would be tolerated. That message spread and altered would-be criminals’ behavior, reversing the crime epidemic, or alternatively creating an anti-crime epidemic. This exemplifies the Power of Context, illustrating how small environmental changes can tip an epidemic.

(Shortform note: Since Tipping Point was published, alternative hypotheses for the reduction in crime have been proposed.

  * The lead-crime hypothesis claims air pollution from leaded gasoline played a significant role in the rise of violent crime in the 1960s, ‘70s, and ‘80s, as well as the dramatic drop in crime in the ‘90s and ‘00s. As leaded gasoline use rose steadily after World War II, the babies born during and after that era were exposed to higher levels of lead in the air and experienced more lead poisoning, which affects brain development. As those children became teenagers and young adults, crime rates climbed. Then, when the U.S. phased out leaded gasoline in the early 1970s, the reverse happened: Babies born around that time had less lead exposure and collectively committed fewer crimes as teenagers and young adults in the ‘90s and ‘00s.
  * Economists John J. Donohue III and Steven D. Levitt, author of “Freakonomics,” propose another theory that the legalization of abortion in New York in 1970 (three years before Roe v. Wade made it legal nationwide) led to fewer children who would have been at greater risk of becoming criminals when they reached adolescence and adulthood in the 1990s. This is a controversial hypothesis that critics have said doesn’t account for other contributing factors, such as decreased drug use and population changes.



There isn’t consensus yet on a definitive answer, but the Broken Windows idea still illustrates the role of context on behavior.)

### The Power of Social Context

We tend to think of ourselves as products of nature and nurture, meaning the greatest influences on who we are and how we behave are our genetics and our upbringings. However, context is so powerful that certain situations can eclipse our natural dispositions.

The Fundamental Attribution Error is a psychological term for humans’ **tendency to overestimate the importance of fundamental personality traits in explaining people’s behaviors, and underestimate the role of context**. In other words, when we see someone behave a certain way, we’re more likely to assume it’s a fundamental personality trait, rather than the influence of temporary context.

For example, two comparably skilled basketball players are shooting baskets, but one is in a well-lit gym and one is in a dimly lit gym. The player in the well-lit gym obviously makes more baskets. But when spectators are asked to judge which of the two is more skilled, they choose the player in the well-lit gym, disregarding the conditions (better lighting) that greatly contributed to his success.

We make this error because human brains evolved in a way that makes us very good at processing certain kinds of information — and bad at processing others. The Fundamental Attribution Error makes the world simpler and easier to understand than considering all the variables of context, but it creates a blind spot in our understanding of all kinds of actions and events, from cheating to committing crime.

Although it’s humbling to admit that we are so inept at judging the causes of most situations, the Power of Context is actually promising: **Problematic behavior is not the inevitable actions of inherently bad people, but instead is the result of context and circumstances that can be changed and adjusted for a better outcome.** Your character is not a fixed set of inherent traits — as the Fundamental Attribution Error would have us believe — but a collection of habits and tendencies that are subject to change under different conditions and context; many of us appear to have consistent character traits only because we are good at controlling our environments.

#### Case Study: What Makes Children Cheat?

One example of the power of social context is a 1920s study to measure the honesty among children. Students were given various tests in different situations that made it harder or easier to either cheat or inflate their scores.

There were some unsurprising findings: older children cheat more than younger children, students from stable homes cheat a little less than those from unstable homes, and girls cheat about as much as boys.

However, there were some surprising inconsistencies.

  * A child might cheat on one test but not on another, or cheat at school but not at home.
  * If one group of kids took the same test under the same conditions six months apart, the same children would cheat in the same ways. But if the context was altered by changing the test material (e.g. the subject was different or an answer key was provided) or the rules (e.g. administrators imposed a time limit), the rates of cheating would change as well. 



This revealed that **a trait like honesty is not fundamental, but rather largely influenced by context.**

#### Case Study: Stanford Prison Experiment

Another example of social context impacting our behavior is the Stanford Prison Experiment, in which participants were randomly assigned the roles of either prisoners or prison guards.

The participants assumed their roles to such an extreme that they acted cruelly and completely out of character; the prison guards abused the prisoners, waking them up in the middle of the night to do push-ups and random tasks, spraying them with fire extinguishers, making them march handcuffed and with paper bags over their heads, and even throwing one prisoner into solitary confinement. The behavior was so alarming that the two-week experiment was ultimately called off after six days.

After the experiment, participants recognized that they had acted dramatically differently than they ever would have believed possible. The context of the experiment, with their **temporary roles as prisoners or guards, was enough to overpower their natural disposition and totally alter their behavior**. The fact that voluntary participants in an experiment could be so overtaken by their context suggests that it is entirely possible to create (much less drastic) behavioral changes in a targeted audience in order to tip an epidemic.
