## Exercise: Take Steps to Implement a Marketing Plan

The author emphasizes that the key to his simplified marketing plan template isn’t creating your own plan, but _implementing_ it. He faults many small businesses owners for failing to implement.

* * *

What’s a recent business initiative or idea that you considered at length but never implemented?

Why didn’t you implement it? (The author cites three reasons for failure to implement: analysis paralysis, reluctance to delegate, and believing your business is different. Others are fear of making a mistake and being overwhelmed with information.)

What would keep you from implementing a marketing plan, and how can you preempt or overcome these obstacles?
