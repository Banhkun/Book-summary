## Shortform Introduction

_Range_ is a bold challenge to widely-held assumptions about success and human potential. Whether you want to become an Olympic sprinter, a neuroscientist, or a virtuoso musician, the traditional advice is the same: Start practicing as soon as you can and don’t stop until you’re the best in the world.

However, David Epstein argues that this narrow, highly specialized path is not as reliable as it’s been made out to be. Instead, **broad competence in a wide range of skills is the best way to get ahead of the competition**. Counter to what you’d expect, learning to do several things well makes you better at each one. Being a jack of all trades is often the way to become master of all.

In reality, very few world-class professionals attain success in the way you’d expect. Rarely have entrepreneurs, scientists, or even athletes trained from birth to do what they’re doing. In this book, Epstein makes the case that starting late or switching fields is nothing to be ashamed of. No matter where you are in life, you have as good a chance as anyone to become one of the greats—your unique history may even give you the upper hand.

### About the Author

David Epstein first gained public recognition as a senior writer for _Sports Illustrated,_ investigating current events in the world of sports __ and frequently making use of his scientific background (an MS in environmental science).

After leaving _Sports Illustrated_ , Epstein worked as an investigative journalist for the Pulitzer-winning online news source ProPublica, delivered TED Talks such as “Are athletes really getting faster, better, stronger?” that have collectively racked up more than 10 million views, and hosted a podcast called _How To!_ for online magazine _Slate_.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Penguin Random House

Imprint: Riverhead Books

_Range_ was published in 2019, becoming a New York Times bestseller. This is his second book, preceded in 2013 by the best-selling The Sports Gene, a deep dive into the various ways both genetics and life experience impact an athlete’s potential for success. _Range_ is a broader application of many of the ideas in _The Sports Gene_ (where Epstein first challenged the 10,000-hour rule) and is more directly argumentative.

Since _Range_ ’s publication, Epstein has started the _Range Widely newsletter_ , intended to help readers “expand their range” and learn about interesting connections between seemingly unrelated fields.

### The Book’s Context

_Range_ ’s thesis directly challenges many popular books on the subject of learning and human performance, especially those that emphasize “deliberate practice” such as _Peak by Anders Ericsson_ and _Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell_. One chapter, “The Trouble with Too Much Grit,” is a direct critique of _Grit by Angela Duckworth_ , which Epstein argues underestimates the value of quitting in some situations.

Additionally, _Range_ is significantly influenced by previous books that have challenged the role that pure quantity of experience plays in human success, directly utilizing ideas from _Make It Stick by Peter Brown_ , _The Dip by Seth Godin_ , and _Superforecasting by Philip Tetlock_. Most of the knowledge in _Range_ is aggregated from other sources rather than fully original, but Epstein weaves these ideas together into a single cohesive argument.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Range_ received glowing reviews from _The New York Times_ , _The Wall Street Journal_ , _Forbes,_ and _NPR_. It was one of six books on the McKinsey and Financial Times shortlist for Business Book of the Year.

Critics praised _Range_ for its convincing argument against commonly accepted wisdom, as well as the life-affirming conclusion of that argument. Critics and readers also appreciated Epstein’s engaging writing style. The true stories he uses in support of his thesis are consistently fascinating. Despite the fact that _Range_ was intended to disprove the main idea of his book _Outliers_ , Malcolm Gladwell has expressed admiration for _Range_ and provides the blurb on the book’s front cover.

Critics of _Range_ have claimed that Epstein is a little too optimistic about the average person’s chances to succeed without much deliberate practice. “Those who are richly endowed with talent may find it easy to excel in multiple domains,” writes the New York Times. “The rest of us, however, must lean heavily on the practice part of the equation.” They argue that Epstein could get away with downplaying talent or practice, but not necessarily both.

Additionally, some readers find _Range_ ’s one-note argument to become tedious when stretched across several chapters. They also criticize Epstein for lacking the evidence necessary to support his argument, saying he relies too heavily on anecdotes.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

_Range_ is an intentionally fluffy, accessible collection of scientific evidence in support of a thesis with strong mass appeal. Epstein strikes a tone between inspirational optimism and even-handed science-based realism. Some readers may feel that Epstein’s empowering argument leans too far toward wishful thinking, but his consistent return to statistics and concrete studies urges the reader to seriously consider his ideas.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Each chapter in _Range_ tackles a single idea, beginning with an extended anecdote that lays the foundation for its argument. However, Epstein doesn’t explicitly connect each chapter to the others in any overarching structure, instead alluding to previously discussed concepts whenever the opportunity arises organically. The book tends to rely on narrow segues from one topic to another instead of zooming out to make the big picture easy to see.

### Our Approach in This Guide

We’ve split this guide into three parts. We’ve reorganized Epstein’s ideas to make it as easy as possible for you to apply them to your own life. The new outline is as follows:

  * Part 1: Why the Specialist’s Path to Excellence Falls Short → Book Introduction, Chapters 1, 2
  * Part 2: The Generalist’s Path to Excellence → Book Chapters 3, 4, 6, 7
  * Part 3: Generalists Triumph in the Professional World → Book Chapters 5, 8-12



In Part 1, we’ll lay the groundwork by exploring the specialist point of view in detail and explaining what specific features of today’s world make it much more favorable to generalists.

Part 2 is a chronological guide through the life of a generalist. We’ve broken up a few chapters and sorted their ideas into life stages to make it easier to pinpoint which ideas apply to your current situation in life and what you should be aiming to do next.

In Part 3, we’ll conclude by exploring the various advantages available to generalist professionals that narrow specialists lack.

Throughout the guide, we’ll provide additional relevant arguments from books that inspired _Range_ , such as Seth Godin’s The Dip and Peter Brown’s Make It Stick. We’ll also take a closer look at the scientific studies that Epstein cites in the book and include intriguing relevant details that he chose to leave out.
