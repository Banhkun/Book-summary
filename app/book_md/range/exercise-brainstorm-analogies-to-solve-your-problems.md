## Exercise: Brainstorm Analogies to Solve Your Problems

Deliberately brainstorming a wide range of analogies is a proven strategy to reframe your problems and make them easier to solve. Try it for yourself.

* * *

Think of a problem that’s been troubling you for some time. This might be an obstacle at work, a bad habit you want to break, or a conflict with a family member. Have you encountered any problems like this before? How did you solve them?

Think of the last movie you saw. In what ways can you relate the characters’ problems to yours? Remember, distant analogies often work best—even if it’s a stretch, try to make some connection.

Go to any Wikipedia page and click the “random article” button on the left. Can you think of anything this article has to do with your problem? Is it sparking any new ideas?

If you’re still stuck, free-write for a bit, as quickly as you can. Come up with any analogy you can to describe your problem in a new way.
