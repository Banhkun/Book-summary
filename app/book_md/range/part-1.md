## Part 1: Why the Specialist’s Path to Excellence Falls Short

David Epstein argues that in today’s modern world, _generalism_ —a broad competence in many professional fields—is the key to living a fulfilling and productive life. However, for much of history, accepted wisdom has painted early specialization in one narrow skillset as the ideal way to get ahead.

This is still a common mindset today. We see parents hire violin teachers for kids who can barely walk, high schoolers expected to have the next decade or more of their lives planned by the time they graduate, and successful doctors who spend their entire lives studying a single gland in the human body. We view changing course, whether it be switching majors, switching jobs, or switching careers as wasting years of past experience.

According to Epstein, this school of thought couldn’t be more wrong. In Part 1 of this guide, we’ll show why the specialized path to excellence is no longer the wisest strategy.

First, we’ll define the commonly accepted traditional path to excellence. Next, we’ll show why this old path to excellence is increasingly obsolete in today’s world. Finally, we’ll take a look at the flaws of an education system that’s still built around the traditional path to excellence.

> **Malcolm Gladwell’s Traditional Path to Excellence**
> 
> Recently, this traditional path to excellence was formalized and popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in his 2008 book Outliers. His famed “10,000-hour rule” states that the way to become a master in any field is to spend 10,000 hours practicing. Gladwell attributes the success of virtuosos such as Mozart, the Beatles, and Bill Gates not to inherent talent, but to the sheer volume of time they spent practicing.
> 
> The other key element of the traditional path to excellence is _the specific kind of practice that best facilitates success_ , an idea Gladwell doesn’t cover in _Outliers._ Researchers often refer to this type of practice as “deliberate practice.”
> 
> The term “ _deliberate practice_ ” was first defined by Anders Ericsson, a Swedish psychologist and expert on human expertise, whom Gladwell cites extensively in _Outliers_. Deliberate practice is a uniquely intense form of training intended to endow mastery in the most efficient way possible. It involves breaking down a skill into its component parts and rigorously repeating each part until it becomes effortless. Often, coaches or mentors provide guidance and feedback. You can read more about deliberate practice in our guide to Ericsson’s book Peak.

### The Traditional Path to Excellence

According to Epstein, the traditional path to excellence has been more or less treated as common sense for years. Obviously, if you want to get good at something, you have to practice a lot. **By this logic, the path to success is to start deliberately practicing as early as possible.**

If you believe in a purely linear relationship between practice time and success, specializing at a young age and never deviating from a given path would allow humans to accomplish never-before-seen levels of greatness. Extreme devotees of the 10,000-hour rule apply this logic to everything.

For example, Epstein describes Laszlo Polgar, who deliberately raised three of his daughters to be world-class chess masters and proclaimed to the world that if more children were brought up deliberately practicing from birth, they could become skilled enough to easily cure diseases like cancer and AIDS. In _Bounce, _Matthew Syed attributes the failure of the British government to the fact that its officials rotate from department to department without the opportunity to specialize.

Even if you don’t believe quite this deeply in the role of deliberate practice, it’s likely that you’re giving it more credit than it deserves.

> **Nature Versus Nurture**
> 
> Epstein isn’t the first person to critique the traditional path to excellence championed by Polgar and Syed. Studies have shown that genetics still play a significant role in skill acquisition. Experiments testing twins on fundamental musical skills showed that some skills, such as the instinct to match melodies with the same rhythm, are entirely gene-dependent—discrepancies in hours spent practicing had no impact. A broader study found that identical twins are far more likely to have similar levels of drawing ability than fraternal twins.
> 
> However, a disproportionate reliance on genetic contributions to success has its own problems. If you become convinced that your ineffective genes prevent you from succeeding, you’ll give up before you’ve even begun. Studies have confirmed that high self-esteem leads to increased initiative, as well as greater ability to set and achieve goals. In this way, unrealistic beliefs like Laszlo Polgar’s faith that scientific prowess can be taught from birth can be beneficial, even if (as we’ll see later) they’re not true.

### Specialists Struggle in the Modern World

Epstein argues that specialization is a far less reliable life strategy than we would expect, especially in recent years. This is true for a number of reasons.

#### Reason #1: The World Is Unpredictable

The main reason specialization isn’t ideal is that the world is far more unpredictable than we’d like to believe. Epstein distinguishes between “kind” and “wicked domains”—what we’ll call Stable and Unstable Environments.

Stable Environments are settings in which the ways to achieve success are easily understood and unchanging. Games with clearly defined rules such as basketball or billiards are Stable Environments, as are simple procedural jobs, like installing circuit boards on an assembly line. Unstable Environments are settings in which the ways to achieve success are unclear and constantly changing. Almost every environment in the “real world” is unstable to a certain degree.

Experience in Stable Environments will provide you with permanent value. For this reason, Epstein argues that specialization and deliberate practice are the most valuable in Stable Environments. Practicing your free throw a hundred times a day will make you better at basketball because the rules aren’t going to change.

Epstein warns that experience in Unstable Environments, on the other hand, may be worthless—or worse, it may harm your future performance. Dating, for instance, is an example of an Unstable Environment. Failed relationships often teach lessons that are inaccurate and/or unhelpful—someone who gets cheated on may come to the conclusion that no one will ever love them, when in reality they just weren’t with the right person. The rules of the environment are hidden and ill-defined, and as a result, _experience doesn’t always result in improvement_.

> **The Ludic Fallacy**
> 
> Coined by author Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book _The Black Swan_ , the “Ludic Fallacy” refers to the misapplication of Stable Environment rules to an Unstable Environment. The word “Ludic” comes from the Latin word _ludus_ , meaning “game,” as people falsely assume that the same strategies used to calculate probability within a game can be used in the real world.
> 
> For example, Taleb explains that casinos calculate their real-world risk using the same strategies they use to calculate risk within a game like blackjack. They spend millions of dollars on high-tech security systems designed to prevent people from cheating, which, according to their calculations, profitably mitigates their risk.
> 
> However, in the Unstable Environment of the real world, the largest losses never come from the places you’d expect, making the goal of accurately calculating risk impossible. Taleb visited a casino that lost $100 million dollars after one of its entertainers was mauled by his own tiger, had to pay a gargantuan fine to the IRS after an otherwise reliable employee forgot to send in certain tax forms for years, and had to pay the ransom for the kidnapping of the casino owner’s daughter. These losses cost 1,000 times more than the cheating losses predicted by their risk analysts. Statistical models like the one the casino used to calculate risk fail in Unstable Environments.
> 
> Specialists’ path to success fails in much the same way—they fail to realize that their narrow, inflexible plans keep them from taking advantage of the unpredictable, as we’ll see in Part 2 of this guide.

Epstein argues that, because they assume that the world is a largely Stable Environment, **followers of the traditional path to excellence strive for efficiency above all else.** Specialists see skills and knowledge as a simple commodity—the more you practice, the more you “collect.” As a result, they assume that to reach the top of your field, all you need to do is accumulate skill as quickly as possible.

Generalists, on the other hand, recognize that we live in an unstable world—**it’s impossible to perfectly predict what experience will be valuable to you.** As we’ll see throughout this guide, experience that feels like a waste of time often pays off in ways you could never have imagined. Additionally, some inefficiency is necessary to perform at a world-class level. This leads us to one of _Range_ ’s main ideas—**efficiency is a bad metric with which to judge your life**. We’ll explore this in great detail in Part 2 of this guide.

> **Stop Trying So Hard**
> 
> Optimizing your life around efficiency is not just ineffective—it can take a toll on your life satisfaction. On an episode of _The Tim Ferriss Show_ podcast, entrepreneur Derek Sivers recounts the story of how he learned to be happier by not trying as hard.
> 
> When he lived in Los Angeles, Sivers would bike down a long beachside path every day, pushing himself non-stop until he made it back home. Every day, he challenged himself to beat his record, as if he were training for a race, but he eventually got stuck at 43 minutes. He began to dread going on his daily bike ride, so one day he decided to take it easy and enjoy the sights and sounds of the beachside path. When he got home, he was dumbstruck to discover that the relaxed trip only took him 45 minutes. What had felt like Olympic-level training only shaved two minutes off his time.
> 
> The moral Sivers gleaned from this experience was this: Trying to squeeze the most out of every possible second of your life often causes more stress than benefits. It’s possible to accomplish great things without making yourself miserable in the process.

#### Reason #2: Strategy Matters More Than Tactics

**Epstein argues that specialization is becoming more obsolete as time goes on.** To help explain why, he distinguishes between two modes of decision-making: tactics and strategy.

Tactics are instinctual procedural responses to certain repeated patterns. You recognize a situation and immediately know what to do in response. For example, Epstein notes that chess experts primarily use tactics. They recognize game states and board positions, then utilize the appropriate memorized counterplay. Tactics are all about instinctively doing things you’ve practiced before.

Strategy, on the other hand, is all about broad, abstract understanding. By combining past experience with higher-level reasoning, humans can make effective decisions in _situations they’ve never experienced before_. For example, Netflix employed the unorthodox strategy of operating at a loss for about a decade, borrowing over sixteen billion dollars since 2011 to keep the lights on. This strategy is based on the idea that original content is a far more sustainable investment than licensing rights.

Epstein asserts that, generally, **specialization teaches tactics while generalism teaches strategy.** And in the modern world, strategy (abstract decision-making) is what matters.

> **The Value of Subconscious Tactics**
> 
> This isn’t to say instinctive tactics are useless in modern times—in fact, we use tactics far more than we realize. In his book _Skin in the Game_ , author Nassim Nicholas Taleb criticizes the “rationalist” school of thought for over-attributing human behavior to innate complex strategy instead of recognizing simpler tactics. For example, he quotes “rationalist” and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins (_The Selfish Gene_), who argued that, at some subconscious level, the brain of a baseball player trying to catch a pop fly is calculating incredibly complex differential equations in order to determine where to stand. In reality, however, the baseball player has subconsciously picked up on a much simpler _tactic_ —fix your gaze on the flying ball, and run toward it at a speed that keeps the ball steady in your field of vision.
> 
> Taleb uses this example to make the point that we vastly _overestimate_ the potential of human strategy. While Epstein focuses on the creative potential of human strategy, Taleb focuses on its fallibility. In contrast, even though tactics can only function in narrow situations, they’re incredibly reliable in those situations. Walking, driving, and biking all involve sets of internalized tactics, and for the most part, we do those tasks extremely well.

##### In the Past, We Only Used Tactics

**In the distant past, there was no use for abstract strategic thinking**. Epstein cites the work of psychologist Alexander Luria, who studied isolated villages in modern-day Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan that were entirely untouched by industry of any kind.

The villagers in these communities were entirely unable to think in abstractions or classification. When asked to name colors, they used concrete descriptions such as “cotton in bloom,” or “decayed teeth.” When shown a picture of three adults and a child and asked which one did not belong, one villager insisted that they all must stay together—it was the boy’s job to fetch things for the working adults.

**The premodern villagers had no need to learn strategy because they thrived by learning tactics** : Growing food and cotton requires repeated procedures in predictable situations.

Today, however, strategy is what helps us succeed. Epstein describes the Flynn effect, the phenomenon that global IQ scores are rising over several generations, requiring tests to be constantly re-standardized to a new level of average intelligence.

The Flynn effect shows that **as the world becomes more and more modernized, our brains are adapting to a greater demand for the ability to think conceptually and identify abstract patterns**.

Epstein argues that just as the premodern villagers’ brains adapted to think concretely in order to succeed, this notable adaptation in our brains reflects how the world is changing. Our increasingly conceptual way of thinking is a result of widespread scientific classification—for example, the labeling and organization of every part of the body—as well as the economic rewards promised to professionals who can conceptualize strategically, such as entrepreneurs and scientists.

Epstein asserts that the ability to think strategically is humans’ greatest strength. While tactics can certainly be valuable, they can also more easily become obsolete.

> **The Plastic Brain**
> 
> The brain’s ability to rewire itself in response to our environment is called “neuroplasticity,” and it explains why Luria’s villagers thought in an entirely different way than city folk. Neuroplasticity research took off in the late 1970s, when researchers first detected microscopic changes in the brain’s wiring caused purely by external experience.
> 
> As demonstrated by Luria’s villagers, the guiding principle behind neuroplasticity is “use it or lose it.” When the brain is repeatedly directed toward a specific task, new synapses form and neurons shift function in order to make that task easier in the future. If parts of the brain remain unused, they will wither or shift in function. For this reason, neuroplasticity has changed the way we treat stroke victims—instead of allowing them several weeks of “rest,” allowing time for unused neurons to die, stroke victims are given incremental training as soon as possible, in order for the brain to repair the parts that were destroyed.
> 
> Neuroplasticity allows the brain to do things we would never expect. Dementia is a purely genetic disease, so it’s easy to assume that there’s nothing we can do about it. You can’t change your genes, after all. But recent research into neuroplasticity has found that certain behaviors can strengthen the parts of the brain that dementia would attack, reducing the risk of getting dementia by up to 60%. Specifically, regular vigorous exercise has been shown to be the best tool for fighting dementia.
> 
> Perhaps the most shocking example of the incredible power of neuroplasticity: Children are able to survive hemispherectomies in which half of their brains are removed, as the remaining hemisphere adapts to perform the functions of one full brain.

#### Reason #3: Modern Technology Replaces Specialization

Epstein argues that as industry and technology have advanced, specialization has only become less valuable.

For much of the 20th century, specialization was handsomely rewarded. Employees stayed with the same companies for decades. Loyalty to the company meant the prospect of promotion, and pension plans for long-term employees were common.

However, computers rendered many specialized procedural jobs obsolete. Epstein points out that **the qualities of tasks that make them suitable for specialization—repeated recognizable patterns, unchanging rules—also make them suitable for automation.**

Today, we’ve entered the era of the “knowledge economy,” where the ability to innovate and generate good ideas has grown to define success.

The advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning has only intensified automation’s threat to specialized workers. For example, IBM has recently developed a chatbot called Watson Assistant that could make call-in customer service representatives obsolete. Similarly, the Internet has increased the ease with which we can access knowledge, further devaluing in-house specialists. A significant amount of expert knowledge is now online.

> **How to Be a Linchpin in the Knowledge Economy**
> 
> In his book _Linchpin_ , author __ Seth Godin elaborates on Epstein’s argument that today’s knowledge economy requires us to become one-of-a-kind commodities in order to thrive.
> 
> Since the Industrial Revolution, people have flocked to safe corporate jobs where they’re told exactly what to do because they provide a comfortable certainty. These jobs weren’t always fun, but they were low-risk. However, as technology has advanced and labor markets have developed, jobs that simply consist of “following the rules” have become more and more scarce, driving down wages and killing job security. In Godin’s words, “There are no longer any great jobs where someone else tells you precisely what to do.”
> 
> Attaining a highly specialized skill seems like a safe bet. But if you bind yourself to a single specialized path, you’ll never stand out from others who do the same.
> 
> Godin asserts that **in order to succeed in this new economy, you need to do things differently than anyone else.** If all you do is fill your expected role, you’ll need to put in a massive amount of work to create even marginally more value than your peers. However, if you start executing on original ideas within your organization, you could deliver something worth hundreds or thousands of times more than someone else doing the same job**.** As he put it on an episode of _The Tim Ferriss Show_ podcast, “**We can’t out-obedience the competition.** ” Your most valuable contributions will be what your organization isn’t already asking for.

### Unfortunately, We Still Teach Specialization

Unfortunately, despite the fact that specialization is becoming increasingly obsolete, our education system is more specialized than ever. Our modern education system fails to teach the most valuable skills—those required for critical thinking and problem solving. Epstein cites a study showing that, among college seniors, GPA has nearly zero correlation with critical thinking skills.

Specialization is rampant, especially in higher education. College students are taught how to successfully think within the bounds of one academic discipline, but it’s been shown that they struggle to apply similar ideas to new contexts. In Epstein’s eyes, they rely too heavily on tactics and not enough on strategy. In a world where three out of four undergraduates advance to a career unrelated to their major, narrow training in a single discipline is not good enough.

Hyper-specialized higher education also results in scientific professionals that are far too specialized. Some still lack these basic critical thinking skills. Epstein recounts an example: When physicians and med students at a Boston-area hospital were given a simple, albeit counterintuitive problem involving calculating the probability of a patient having a certain disease, only about one in four got it right.

In the study, “Medicine’s Uncomfortable Relationship With Math,” subjects were told that there’s a false positive rate of 5% for a test for a disease that affects 1 in 1000 people. If someone tests positive, what’s the likelihood that person has the disease? 27 of the 61 respondents said “95%,” and only 14 gave the correct answer of around 2%.

> **Why the Doctors Got It Wrong**
> 
> These results are baffling when you consider that these were medical professionals with degrees from Harvard and Boston University, who theoretically are dealing with problems like this every day. Attending physicians performed no better than the med students.
> 
> Arguably, this mistake is rooted in an extremely common problem: Most people avoid thinking in _base rates_ —the probability of something being true in the absence of any case-specific evidence. The medical staff being tested neglected to calculate that, out of 1,000 people, 50 will get false positives, while only one will actually have the disease.
> 
> This tendency to avoid dealing in base rates contributes to a number of mental biases, as detailed in psychologist Daniel Kahneman’s Thinking, Fast and Slow _._ Consider this question: Julie read fluently when she was four years old. What do you estimate her college GPA will be? We assume that a relatively smart child will be a relatively smart adult, so she’ll probably have a GPA of 3.7 or 3.8. The more accurate way to estimate this fact, however, is to begin with base rates: The average college student’s GPA is 3.1, so you would need much stronger evidence to assume that Julie has a GPA of 3.8.

Epstein cites esteemed microbiologist Arturo Casadevall, who argues that scientific progress is slowing as more students are pushed through higher education without having first learned to think critically. The number of retractions in scientific literature is increasing, indicating a growing inability to spot flawed research. Even though biomedical research funding has skyrocketed over the last 35 years, new discoveries have slowed.

But what would an education that emphasizes critical thinking look like? For a start, Epstein endorses Casadevall’s call for fewer required classes and greater opportunities for students to learn outside of their field.

Epstein cites a computer science professor who argues that the “computational thinking” required to code should be a part of the gen ed curriculum, as it’s a problem-solving framework that involves breaking down complex problems into solvable components.

To give another example of how critical thinking could be taught in schools, Epstein describes a valuable skill he learned in college: how to solve “Fermi problems.” Fermi problems are puzzles intended to test your estimation skills—for example, what is the mass of all automobiles scrapped in North America this month? You’re supposed to break down this problem into a series of rational assumptions. Roughly, how many people in North America own cars? How often does a car need to be scrapped? How heavy is the average car? Epstein argues that this process allows you to roughly know what statistics are reasonable and what aren’t, no matter what discipline you’re in.

> **Measuring Critical Thinking in Schools**
> 
> The Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+), one of the most popular tests of critical thinking in higher education, provides us with insight as to which of these recommendations would be the most successful. The 90-minute exam tests students from around 200 schools across the United States, ranking them and comparing freshmen to seniors to determine how much students learn at each school. It requires students to analyze real-life research data and synthesize logical arguments based on a given set of evidence.
> 
> The institution boasting the biggest improvement in critical thinking is Plymouth State University, a liberal arts school in Plymouth, New Hampshire. PSU faculty attribute this prestigious score to their focus on concrete problem solving across their majors. Students in a technical writing class, for example, were asked to design a new course on resumés and covers. They ended up conducting interviews with professors and students before condensing their research into a proposal. Students in a philosophy of law class were asked to conduct a mock trial of Lizzie Borden, an alleged ax murderer from 1892. This kind of problem lacks fixed instructions or a single definitive answer, and as such, more closely resembles problems in the real world.
> 
> Big-name schools that scored low on the CLA+, including the University of Kentucky and the University of Texas at Austin, blamed the test itself and stopped using it. Seniors at those schools performed about as well as freshmen—and at UT Austin, they did slightly worse. To many, the lackluster value of large universities like this is not a surprise—43% of the general public no longer believes that a college education is a “good investment,” and one-third of millennials regret going to college themselves. Just as Epstein argues, many college graduates are suffering from a lack of emphasis on critical thinking.
