## Part 1: Individual Foundations | Chapter 1: Become a Master Salesperson

The first thing you have to do to become a master at sales is to commit to the craft and develop your work ethic and skills, which we’ll cover in Part 1. Then in Part 2, we’ll cover the application of this mastery when confronted with a customer.

**There are many salespeople in the world, but only a few of them are good, and only a handful are masters.** Masters can predict customers so well they appear to have mind-reading skills, are unaffected by recessions, and have complete control over their lives—they work for whomever they want, sell whatever they want, and make as much money as they want. In this chapter, we’ll look at the steps to becoming a master.

### Step #1: Commit

**The first step to mastering sales is to commit to the art by putting _all_ of your time, resources, and energy toward it.** As soon as you commit, you’ll see results. (When you’re not committed, on the other hand, the results are delayed or don’t come through at all.)

  * For example, when Cardone decided to commit to sales, he automatically started making more money as well as dressing better, picking up good habits, changing his language, and gaining more energy. 



There are seven ways to develop your commitment to sales:

**1\. Convince yourself that sales skills are critical to living a successful life.** Your life (the life you want) depends on your ability to learn to sell.

**2\. Mythbust your negative perception of sales** (if necessary). There’s a lot of inaccurate information about selling floating around in the world because people tend to pass on myths or “common knowledge” that they don’t actually have any experience with (and money is a subject that’s particularly susceptible to this).

**Myth #1: Sales is unpleasant.** People will tell you that selling is unstable (income, commissions, and the economy fluctuate), requires long hours, isn’t a “real” job, and is harder today than it's ever been. None of this is true. In fact:

  * The money is good and there’s no maximum salary—you can make as much as you want. Additionally, commission-only positions may _seem_ unstable, but consider how stable salaries are—they depend on companies that are at the mercy of the stock market and banks. If you work on commission, you depend only on yourself, and you’re far more invested in your success than a CEO is. Finally, all economic conditions have pluses and minuses—for example, when the economy is tight, fewer people want to spend, but there’s less competition for their dollars.
  * You can control your own hours, and when you’re working for yourself, the days don’t feel long—you already work for yourself 24/7 just by being alive.
  * There are just as many opportunities to make money in sales today as there were in the past. While there may be shortages of certain products (such as oil), there are also shortages of master salespeople, so there’s little competition.



**Myth #2: Salespeople are con artists.** Very few salespeople are swindlers, and if they are, their tactics (dishonesty, aggression, and manipulation) are amateur and ineffective. The most successful salespeople are honest, admired, and calming; they provide good service, have a strong desire to help people, and are leaders.

**Myth #3: Selling isn’t important.** In fact, selling is critical to society and the economy. If people didn’t sell things, no one would produce, store, ship, or advertise them.

**3\. Get over your dislike of selling**(if necessary). The only reason people don’t like doing things is that they’re bad at them—feeling incompetent and powerless makes them uncomfortable. If you don’t like the idea of selling, it’s only because you don’t know how to do it yet. Once you learn the techniques, you’ll feel perfectly comfortable.

**4\. Be proud of being a salesperson.** Believe that selling is noble, important, and inherently good. Additionally, believe that there’s nothing wrong with getting your way. This will set off a self-perpetuating cycle—your pride will make you more successful because it makes you more confident and committed, and as you become more successful, you’ll become even more proud.

To strengthen your pride and belief in sales, think of someone in your life who’s positively influenced you and write down five of their traits. Then, consider how all these traits apply to sales.

**5\. Stop looking for and eliminate other career options.** This will force you to commit.

  * For example, think of sales the same way you think of your partner—once you’re married, you don’t keep looking for someone new; you put work into the relationship you already have.



**6\. Don’t wish for what other people have.** They have it because they committed to getting it. If you commit, you can get it too.

**7\. Regularly remind yourself of your commitment.**

  * For example, Cardone regularly wears a pin that says “100%” to remind himself of his commitment to selling.



#### Commit to Success

Once you’ve committed to sales, you need to commit to success with the same fervor. **Think of success as a duty, obsession, and ethical requirement—if you ever see success as something optional or that will “just happen,” you’ll never reach it.**(A lack of commitment to success is why few people get the life they dream of and even fewer of them get the life they have the potential to have.)

To determine if you’re committed enough to success, ask yourself the following questions (this applies to any field, not just sales). If you answer no to any of them, you need to strengthen your commitment.

  * Do you think success is a responsibility?
  * Are you making full use of your abilities?
  * Are you willing to accept the challenges that success brings, such as more work?
  * Are you and your family on the same page about creating success?



To commit to success when selling:

**1\. Take responsibility.** Decide that whether or not someone buys is completely dependent on _you_ , not them. Cardone doesn’t ever allow his staff to blame lack of sales on the customer’s indecisiveness, cheapness, and so on.

**2\. Don’t make excuses.** Never try to justify your failure. You will inevitably fail sometimes, but instead of abdicating responsibility or telling yourself you didn’t want whatever you failed to get anyway, be honest with yourself and analyze the situation. Don’t let anyone else console you by placing blame elsewhere (for example, your coworker might blame lack of business on the economy). If you’re not honest about why you failed, you won’t be able to troubleshoot accurately and you’ll keep making the same mistakes, which will ultimately sabotage your success.

You’ll be more likely to make excuses after you’ve had some success but then stalled, so be particularly vigilant in these moments.

**3\. Think of making the sale as your duty.** Decide that succeeding in sales is critically important.

**4\. Take “massive action.”** When you want something, put in at least 10 times more effort than you think you need, and be unreasonable and insane. For example, when Cardone was working on a client, he called him 15 times in 72 hours even though the client never returned his previous calls.

**Take so much action that you create new problems for yourself.** For instance, if you’re trying to get appointments, book so many that your schedule is overwhelming.

Even if you don’t know what you’re doing, take a lot of action. This will make up for your inexpertise.

**You’ll know you’re taking enough action when people start advising you to live in the moment, slow down, relax, and so on. Ignore them** —people who give this kind of advice aren’t doing enough massive action themselves and have given up on their dreams. Getting things done—producing—is what makes people happy.

(Shortform note: Read our summary of Cardone’s The 10X Rule for more on taking massive action.)

**5\. Acknowledge that success has nothing to do with luck.** Luck is a byproduct of hard work and preparation. People who have multiple successes might seem lucky, but this is just because success is a self-fulfilling prophecy—once you have it once, you’ve put yourself in a better position to get it again.

#### Low Moments

You’ll inevitably experience low moments in your life and career that can shake your commitment. Here’s how to handle some common, emotionally painful scenarios:

**Scenario #1: Your product is rejected.** It’s normal to dislike rejection, but it’s impossible to avoid, both in sales and in life. Handle it like this:

  * **Take responsibility.** Rejection will only feel negative if you cast your customer as powerful and yourself as a victim. Instead, focus on how you can learn from the experience, which gives you agency.
  * **Don’t take it personally.** Customers aren’t rejecting _you_ ; they just don’t want your product or offer.
  * **Don’t try to avoid it.** This will make you timid and prevent you from taking the risks you need to take to make sales.
  * **Don’t let it affect your conviction.** Remain sold on your product, even if other people turn it down.



**Scenario #2: You’ve lost your motivation.** The best way to stay motivated, in any industry, is to keep busy. This will keep your mind occupied and unable to dwell on negatives or the past.

  * As an extreme example, if your kitchen is on fire, you don’t have any mental bandwidth to be depressed—your circumstances require your full attention.



Additionally, avoid negative people because they’re demotivating.

**Scenario #3: You experience call reluctance.** Call reluctance is a lack of enthusiasm to aggressively get in touch with clients and often includes procrastinating with busywork. If you have call reluctance, it doesn’t mean you’re inherently unqualified for sales—in fact, reluctance stems from a lack of motivation and competence.

To get over call reluctance, prepare a script in advance. You won’t be reluctant once you’re confident you can be well-spoken and field questions.

### Step #2: Train

The second step to becoming a master salesperson is training. Even if you have natural talent, if you don’t cultivate it, you’ll never succeed. Talent alone won’t stand up against recessions, competitions, and changes in the industry.

**Sales isn’t part of the school curriculum, so you’ll have to take the initiative to learn it on your own.** This will give you an enormous advantage because you’ll be one of the few with this rare skill. (Most salespeople don’t read books about sales.)

Many people object to training because it's expensive to attend seminars and buy books, but as you improve your game, you’ll sell so much more that you’ll quickly recoup your investment. (Additionally, if you do the math on how much money you _lose_ by missing sales, the numbers will prove the value of training.) Put as many hours and dollars into your sales training as you put into your attire.

A good training program must be both theoretical and applied—you need to practice so you know what to do when you encounter particular circumstances. **Engaging in this kind of committed, serious study will help you learn and memorize behavior patterns to the point where you can predict people’s actions, which is the mark of an expert in any field.** You might:

  * Carry around a notebook and write down every objection customers give you. (When Cardone did this, he became so familiar with common objections that he could predict them well enough to address them before customers even voiced them.)
  * Consider it a learning opportunity when you lose a customer to a competitor. Analyze why the competitor or product might have appeared more attractive than your offer. You can even ask a colleague, ideally a manager, to call the client and ask why she didn’t buy from you.



Even if you’ve been in sales for a long time, you need to engage in constant professional development. **Mastery doesn’t automatically come with time—you have to work for it.**

#### Individual Training Program

Here is Cardone’s recommended training regimen for individual salespeople. Ideally, do each step every day:

  * While you’re driving,**listen to audio programs about sales**. Choose programs with concrete information (for example, how to handle an objection) rather than motivational programs. 
  * **Watch 2-4 video segments that train the sales process** at some point during the day, such as the ones on Cardone’s website.
  * **Practice role-playing scenarios** to prepare for situations that make you uncomfortable or that you have trouble succeeding in.
  * **Take notes or record your interactions** with customers so you can analyze them. This kind of observation improved Cardone’s productivity by 200%.
    * For example, Cardone videotaped himself talking to customers and studied his body language.
  * Whenever you lose a sale, reflect on why. Consult Cardone’s books and videos for help withdiagnosing the problem. 



Additionally, you should do some product-specific training so you can credibly answer customers’ questions about the product and tell them about its features and value proposition.

#### Organizational Training Program

Here are Cardone’s recommendations for organizational training. The program must:

  * **Include daily practice.** All staff meetings should feature training and people should practice on their own throughout the day.
  * **Act as a warm-up.** Training should take place just before encountering real sales situations.
  * **Focus on selling situations.** (Many programs focus on motivation rather than concrete scenarios.)
  * **Use short (less than five minutes), interactive sessions** to keep the trainees’ attention.
  * **Be measurable.** You should be able to track and reward people’s application of the training. But overall, if training doesn’t increase sales immediately, it’s not being used effectively or often enough.
  * **Focus on the best salespeople.** To engage them, the training should be cutting edge and contain new information, not just basics.
  * **Be accessible.** Whenever someone runs into a problem, they should be able to access materials that will help them solve it.



### Step #3: Adopt a Positive Attitude

The third step to mastering sales is adopting a positive attitude. Sales environments are often negative because it’s easy for negative people to get a job in sales—there’s no screening out of negative people, and many companies have low training standards.

However, **your environment needs to be positive, both physically and mentally, for you to sell successfully**. This is because **attitudes are contagious and people are motivated by the need to feel good.** Especially today, with a lot of bad news in the papers and online, customers prioritize interaction with someone positive who can solve problems over product features or price.

  * For example, when Cardone was selling trucks, an aggressive customer approached him and demanded a ridiculously low price. Cardone responded with a positive attitude—he smiled and thanked the man for coming in. He then spent an hour showing the man a truck. When the man was ready to buy, Cardone added $2,000 to the requested price to cover Cardone taking care of the man for four years. The man said he could get the truck elsewhere to avoid that fee, and Cardone agreed but pointed out that he couldn’t get Cardone somewhere else. The man bought the truck at Cardone’s price because he thought Cardone was valuable.



If you’re not getting what you want or making as much as you want, your attitude is at least partly responsible. To improve it:

  * Avoid media such as radio, TV, and newspapers.
  * Avoid people who believe in limitations, aren’t successful, and have problems. You can try to help them, but don’t spend much time with them.
  * Assess your coworkers. Anyone who’s negative about their coworkers, company, or products should be your enemy.
  * Don’t let anyone talk negatively in your presence. Put up signs to remind people.
  * Ask management to ban negative talk about clients.
  * Don’t drink or do drugs (even prescription ones) because they dull your awareness and make you slow.
  * Become aware of how negative you are yourself—you can’t change anything until you notice it. When you have a negative thought or action, write it down.
  * Practice eliminating negative thoughts. Actions stem from thoughts, so if you can control your thoughts, you’ll be able to control the actions that shape your life. Try the following exercise: For 24 hours, don’t let any negative thoughts enter your mind and don’t do any negative actions (such as badmouthing). If you don’t last 24 hours, write down the negative thought or action that derailed you and restart the exercise. (It’s going to be hard—Cardone knows a lot of people who don’t make it 10 minutes before having to restart.)
  * Tell everyone in your life what your goals are and how they can help you achieve them.



### Step #4: Manage Your Time With Discipline

The fourth step to mastering sales is managing your time with discipline. Discipline is critical to success in any field, but especially in sales because sales is so changeable—there are surprises every day, and a lot of the work is commission-based. (It’s easier to manage change in sales when other parts of your life, such as your morning training routine, are stable.)

**You should treat time like money and use it wisely.**

  * For example, when Cardone was going to Las Vegas for a speaking engagement, he could have stayed an extra day and been a tourist. Instead, he decided to come home as soon as possible so that he could use his time to make sales rather than staying in a hotel or visiting an attraction that would make _someone else_ money.



In particular,**use your hour-long lunch break wisely—it amounts to 312 hours a year if you work six days a week.** Don’t bring your lunch from home or go out with your coworkers or boss—they’re never going to buy anything from you.

Instead, do one of the following:

  * **Take customers to lunch.** Spending time with either existing or new customers can lead you to sales. For example, when Cardone took a customer and his family out for lunch as a thank-you for buying, the customer ran into a friend at the restaurant who wanted the same product.
  * **Scope out restaurants for potential customers.** People who go out for lunch, especially to expensive restaurants, are potential buyers because they have money. Go to the same few restaurants regularly so you can get to know the owner, staff, and then ultimately the customers. Start conversations by commenting on something you have in common. For example, you might tell someone you like her shoes or ask her where she bought them.



**If you feel like you don’t have enough time, it’s probably because you’re wasting it.** Everyone has the same amount of time in a day, but some people watch three hours of television and other people use those 180 minutes to pursue sales.

Anytime you do something unproductive, such as calling your family, daydreaming, or taking coffee breaks, write it down. This will help you be aware of how you’re spending your time so you can stop doing things that waste it. You’ll have time to relax and spend time with your loved ones after you’ve become successful.

#### Example Schedule

Here is a schedule you can use to make $250,000 a year:

Two hours before work starts:

  * Get up.
  * Jot down long-term goals.
  * Exercise.
  * Watch or listen to motivational training materials.



One hour before work:

  * Get dressed.
  * Listen to sales training audio while driving to work.
  * Get breakfast at a restaurant that’s popular with potential customers.



15 minutes before work:

  * Arrive at work.



Throughout the morning:

  * Have a sales meeting and a save-a-deal meeting (a meeting in which everyone discusses sales that were previously lost and how they might be salvaged).
  * Make a list of everyone you’re going to speak with that day and a battle plan for how you’ll handle them. 
  * Contact everyone and enact your battle plan.
  * Follow up on any opportunities that cropped up the day before.
  * Call five customers about service updates.
  * Call and/or fax everyone you sent a mailer or email to the week before.



Lunch

  * Eat with a customer or eat somewhere you might meet a potential customer.



Throughout the afternoon (1-5 p.m. for Cardone):

  * Send mailers to five past customers, five friends, five5 business contacts, and any traffic that’s older than 10 days.
  * Mail five birthday cards. Sending out birthday cards randomly is a way to encourage people to contact you—when you inevitably get the date wrong, they’ll call to tell you when their birthday actually is, starting a conversation.
  * Go visit clients.



In the early evening (5-8 p.m. for Cardone):

  * Keep calling customers.
  * Hold appointments.
  * Help any customers who walk in.



In the late evening (8-10 p.m. for Cardone):

  * Create a plan for the next day.
  * Make a list of contacts you could approach during the rest of the week.
  * Rewrite long-term goals.
  * Go home and spend time with your family and loved ones.
  * Don’t watch TV.
  * Sleep.



Check off each item as you do it. This will help you maintain discipline and make the schedule a habit.

#### Social Media

Many people try to save time by avoiding social media. However, **having a social media presence is critical to sales and can actually _save_ you time if you use it properly.** (Shortform example: If you provide information about your products and prices online, people might approach you instead of you having to track them down.)

You need a social media presence because **it helps people find you and regularly reminds them of your existence.** Today, most people’s first step to making a purchase is to research products, companies, and potentially even individual salespeople online. You need to be online so people can find you, and you need to be _active_ online so people regularly encounter you. You want to become so prevalent in people’s minds that whenever they think about buying something, they think about you first.

As far as what to actually post, think of social media like going to a party—your job might come up in conversation, but most of the conversation will be about social things. Cardone suggests looking at his Twitter and Facebook accounts to get a sense of the balance.

Another major topic when it comes to social media is reputation. Before social media, if people had a bad experience with you or your company, they’d tell the people they knew. **Today, a bad online review can reach thousands of people, and if you get more than a few bad reviews, you’ll start losing customers.**

You’re inevitably going to get some online negative publicity at some point for three reasons:

  1. As soon as something starts getting attention it also attracts criticism.
  2. Unhappy customers are more likely to write reviews than satisfied ones.
  3. There’s no fact-checking process for reviews, so people can write whatever they want, even if it’s not true.



Here’s how to deal with negativity online:

  * **Preemptively create a positive image before anyone attacks you.** Encourage your happy customers to leave reviews or give testimonials, and run campaigns about the good things your company does, such as sponsoring community events or making donations. If someone posts something negative later, the positives will outweigh it.
  * **Give your social media reputation the same weight as your personal reputation.** Take attacks seriously and deal with them personally.
  * **Address complaints or negative reviews as soon as possible.** If handled correctly, these are opportunities, not problems, because customers will appreciate a quick, effective resolution so much they might change their minds about their complaints and become fans. Cardone’s policy is that all complaints go straight to him.
  * **Contact complainers directly.** If you post publicly, you’ll draw attention to the problem.
  * **Don’t ask people to take down their comments or suggest that they were unfair.** Your response should be to ask people how you can solve their complaints. If you do this well, they’ll probably take down the complaint of their own volition, or post a positive comment about how easy and fast it was to get the complaint solved.
  * **Avoid trolls.** Some people on the Internet just want to stir up trouble, so if someone’s looking for a fight and not a solution, don’t engage.
