## Part 2: Customer Foundations | Chapter 3: Connect With Customers

In Part 1, we worked on ourselves. Now, we’ll work on our customers, and in this chapter, we’ll first learn how to find customers and then three steps to connecting with them.

### Finding Customers

Most salespeople focus the majority of their efforts on trying to sell to people they don’t know, and companies advertise to strangers and people who will never buy their product.

In fact, **it’s far easier to sell to people you know, such as family, friends, and past customers,** for two reasons:

**1\. They already know you.** Your family and friends like you, know what you sell because they’re interested in your life, and want you to be successful. Your past customers like familiarity and trust you, so always keep in touch with them.

**2\. You already know them.** You know their expectations and what they like.

  * For example, one day Cardone got a new product that he knew one of his long-time customers would love. Cardone asked him to sign the buyer’s order without even telling him what the product was. The customer signed it, confident that Cardone would never mislead him, and he was right—he loved the product.



**Approaching people you know isn’t an imposition** because setting them up with a useful product helps them, and buying it from you lets them help you. (If they don’t buy the product from you, they’ll buy it from someone else anyway.)

#### Build Your Network

To assess and build your network:

**1\. Make a list of everyone you know** including family, friends, past customers, coworkers, and so on. Even include people you don’t get along with.

  * For example, Cardone once got in touch with someone he’d fought with as a boy in high school. The man later bought a product from him.



**2\. Figure out where these people are** and how you can get in touch with them.

  * (Shortform example: If you went to college with someone, the alumni organization may be able to give you contact information or forward a message for you.)



**3\. Make contact.** Ideally, set up an in-person meeting, but phone calls, email, and more creative solutions (such as the birthday card suggestion in the example schedule) work too.

**4\. Rekindle the relationship.** The goal of the conversation is to reconnect, not to make a sale—that will come later. If selling comes up naturally as you catch up on each others’ careers, it’s fine to chat about it in detail if the other person is interested.

**Each time you add one person to your network, the people in _her_ network are added to your network too. **You now have a connection to them through her, and if they need your product, she can put them in touch with you.

#### Cold Calls

If you do find yourself needing to connect with customers you _don’t_ know, follow these steps:

  1. **Select your prospects.** This should be easy because once you’ve sold yourself on your product, you know what problems it can solve, and who might have those problems.
  2. **Harness fear.** You can use fear to guide yourself (whatever you fear most is what you should do) and motivate yourself (the best way to make the feeling of fear go away is to take action). The more you practice using fear, the more doing difficult things such as cold calling will become habit, and the more confidence you’ll gain.
  3. **Dress professionally so you feel and project confidence.**
  4. **Visit potential customers in person** because it's easier to sell yourself and your product face-to-face.



#### Keeping the Pipeline Full

Your sales “pipeline” is a list of potential customers, and it empties in two ways:

  1. A customer permanently decides not to buy.
  2. You make a sale—as soon as a customer buys something, they’re no longer potentially going to buy it from you anymore.



You need to keep your pipeline full (the list of potential customers long) in order to keep selling. As soon as a customer exits the pipeline, replace her. (Too many companies and salespeople make the mistake of celebrating the sale instead of immediately trying to find a replacement.)

### Four Steps to Customer Relations

Now that you have potential customers, how do you get them to buy things from you? There are four steps to building a good relationship with customers. Most of the steps involve behaving in the way you’d like customers to behave, which will encourage them to behave the same way toward you.

#### Step #1: Prioritize People

**No matter what you’re selling, your priority should be people.** Don’t think of your job as selling products—think of it as helping people make good decisions and solve their problems. Giving good service has a karmic effect—you’ll receive something (such as a sale) in return and you’ll have tremendous freedom and confidence to sell whatever you like to whomever at whatever price.

To prioritize the customer and give her good service:

**1\. Focus on her from the moment she arrives until the moment she leaves** , even if you don’t think she’s likely to buy anything. Don’t take calls, answer emails, or let anything else interrupt your time together. Most people don’t get as much attention as they’d like in life, so if you provide this, you’ll meet a need.

**2\. Think like the customer to anticipate her wants.** This will show the customer that you want to help her. Exceed her expectations.

  * For example, if a customer asks for a drink, Cardone opens the bottle for her and gives her a glass, ice, and a napkin. This shows he’s willing to go above and beyond.



**3\. Take an interest in her.** Become more interested in her than you are in anything else, including your commission and yourself. Exchange ideas and ask questions—for example, you might ask what she likes or doesn’t like about what she already owns. This will help you get information about what she values that you can use to help her find the perfect product. Asking questions isn’t sleazy—you’re not amassing information to manipulate the customer later; you’re trying to help. (The sales-y trick of responding to questions with new questions _is_ manipulation and will never work.)

  * For example, when Cardone wanted to buy a computer, the salesman at the first store he went to rattled off technical specs and so overwhelmed Cardone that he didn’t buy anything. Later, Cardone went to a different store and encountered a salesperson who asked him questions about what he wanted the computer for. He was so helpful that Cardone bought three computers and additional accessories.



**4\. Maintain your interest in the customer** even after you’ve made (or not made) a sale.

**5\. Resolve post-sale problems personally.** Any time a customer has a problem, it’s an opportunity to provide service. Seek out problems (for example, call to check in on a product) and handle them. This will also create opportunities for sales in the future.

**6\. Use organizational aids,** such as customer relationship management (CRM) tools, **to help you remember details about specific customers** such as contact information, pet peeves, likes and dislikes, loved ones, colleagues, and anything else you find out. Once you build up your network, you’ll have many past and potential customers to keep track of, as well as multiple sales cycles open at the same time. **Never throw out data, even if you leave a job** —you might want to talk to some of your past customers in the future.

You can check your service skills by asking yourself the following questions. If you answer yes to any of them, you need to work on prioritizing customers.

  * **Do customers ask you for better prices?** If you were giving them good service, they would think the price was appropriate because it included service. Most people want good products and service more than they want to save.
  * **Does your competition outsell you, regardless of price and product quality?** If you provide good service, it shouldn’t matter if your product is more expensive than your competitors’—lower prices mean less service, and many people don’t like that trade-off. Additionally, having a better product is temporary—new products are invented all the time and get cheaper as they develop. Service, on the other hand, is always valuable—people like convenience and being treated well. 



##### Pitfalls

Don’t ever prioritize the following over customers:

**1\. Product knowledge.** You do need to know the benefits of the product and how it matches up against competitors’ products, but only 20% of selling is product-related (the other 80% is people-related).

**2\. Sales processes.** Sales processes are step-by-step plans for approaching a customer and getting a sale. They’re often developed by management even though management is almost never buying or selling the product. If a process inconveniences a customer, don’t use it. (See Part 3 for more on good sales processes.)

  * For example, one of Cardone’s friends was a real estate salesman whose company’s sales process required its salespeople to always meet with clients at its offices. Cardone didn’t want to go to his friend’s office because it was inconvenient, but his friend insisted. Cardone refused. His friend relented and they met at Cardone’s home, but had his friend adhered to the process, he would have lost the sale. 



**3\. Company policy.** Some company policies, like sales processes, don’t prioritize the customer. If you follow the policies, you’ll miss sales.

  * For example, when Cardone learned about the Hummer H2, he immediately wanted one and called a dealership to ask for the price. The salesperson wouldn’t give him the price over the phone—company policy forbid it because it encouraged people to shop around. It hadn’t occurred to Cardone to shop around before; the policy actually planted the idea.



#### Step #2: Agree With the Customer

The first step to connecting with the customer was to prioritize them and give them good service. We’ll continue treating customers well in this step by agreeing with them.

**Always agree with the customer, no matter what she says.** You don’t have to think she’s _right_ , but you have to at least agree that _she_ thinks she’s right. (This isn’t manipulation because you’re just trying to have a positive interaction and you’re not actually agreeing with anything you oppose, you’re just agreeing with the existence of different viewpoints.) People like people and ideas they agree with and they’re more likely to buy from you if they think you’re on the same page.

  * For example, if a customer is only going to give you 10 minutes to do your sales pitch, agree that that’s enough time. She’ll be surprised and impressed.



Once you’ve agreed and gotten the customer to feel more positive about you, you can handle her in two ways:

**1\. Convince her of your position or even that hers is wrong.**

  * For example, if a customer says a roof is too expensive, agree that new roofs cost a lot of money. Then, point out that they last 30 years and that repairing old roofs is expensive too.



**2\. Give her a chance to handle the objection herself.** This will tell you how seriously she objects—if she comes up with a solution on her own, you’ll know that it wasn’t a very serious objection.

  * (Shortform example: If you’re selling a house and the customer says the bedrooms are too small, agree with her. Then, ask her what she thinks can be done about it. If she muses about putting up mirrors to make the space look bigger, you know that she’s not actually that opposed to the square footage.)



If you _dis_ agree, you’ll only make a customer more certain of her own position and unlikely to want to work with you.

  * For example, when Cardone was buying a product and wanted to pay cash for it, the salesman told him he should finance it instead. Cardone lost enthusiasm for doing business with him.



Even though disagreeing is obviously the wrong course of action, by nature, everyone wants to be right, so you’ll have to train yourself out of this reflex. **Practice agreeing with people regularly, starting with people you know** such as your family, friends, or colleagues. Cardone suggests the following drill: Spend an entire day agreeing with everyone you encounter. It will be a challenge—Cardone knows people who haven’t been able to agree with others for even half an hour.

Agreeing is also a great way to end conflict (it takes two to disagree, so if you swap sides, the disagreement automatically ends) and handle customer service complaints. When a customer accuses you or your company of making a mistake, agree and offer to fix the problem.

#### Step #3: Establish Trust

In this third step, we’ll earn the customer’s trust. Lack of trust is a major reason customers don’t buy things, and there are one of two things they don’t trust.

**1\. You (the salesperson).** This likely isn’t personal—some customers distrust salespeople on the whole because a few unscrupulous people have run scams or cons. When customers are skeptical of you, they might not believe you, they might challenge you, or they might seek other sources of information. Even if you do successfully sell something to someone who doesn’t trust you, you’ll probably have problems when it comes to following up, such as during delivery.

**2\. Themselves (specifically, their ability to make the right choice).** If customers don’t trust themselves, this probably stems from an experience with one or more of the following:

  * The customers have lied or exaggerated _themselves_. As a result, they know that every person has the potential to do so. They assume you’re no better than they are and are also not telling the truth. This is the most common reason for distrust.
  * The customers have been scammed or victims of a misunderstanding. 



Therefore, **to sell anything, you need to demonstrate that you’re credible.** This will make the customer trust you as a person, and, if she’s insecure, trust that you will help guide her to the right decision.

To create trust:

**1\. Assume the customer doesn’t trust you** (even if she knows you) and doesn’t believe anything you say. **Assume she will only believe what she can see.** People believe things that they can observe for themselves far more readily than things people tell them. Additionally, people tend to assume that anything that’s written down is true.

**2\. Facilitate the customer’s research.** The more information you give her, the more likely she is to buy something. Additionally, informed buyers can be easier to sell to because you can use logic—uninformed buyers can get emotional and unreasonable. (For instance, the auto industry disobeys this step—it’s notoriously stingy with information—and as a result, it suffers from turnover and low profits.)

Help customers with their research by providing:

  * As much accessible, up-to-date, third-party, real-time, computer-generated data as possible 
  * Internet access at your place of business so you can look things up for a customer or she can look them up herself
  * Your competitor’s ads, so customers can see what they’re offering without leaving your place of work



**3\. Show her proof that you’re telling the truth by supporting everything you say with documentation** or something tangible that she can see for herself.

  * For example, when Cardone wanted his friend to invest in a property, he didn’t pitch it. Instead, he asked his friend to meet him at the property. When his friend saw it and all the opportunities it provided, _he_ asked Cardone if he could invest.



**4\. Put negotiations and promises on paper as part of a buyer’s order.** (You aren’t going to scare the customer off by asking her to sign something).

##### What If I Don’t Know the Answer?

Customers expect you to have all the answers, even though with the rise of the Internet, they might know as much or more about the products you sell as you do. **If someone asks a question and you don’t know the answer, tell her that it’s a great question and that you’ll find out for her.** This demonstrates that you’re helpful and service-oriented.

Once you’ve found out the answer, write it down and memorize it so that the next time someone asks, you’re prepared.

#### Step #4: Keep in Touch or Follow Up

Regardless of whether a customer makes a purchase or not, keep in touch with her. Here are some tips for following up:

  * Use customer relationship management (CRM) tools to keep track of people’s contact information. Being organized will help you remember who to talk to when.
  * Remember your conviction. Your product is so good that absolutely everyone needs it.
  * Don’t give up and stay interested. Cardone has some clients he followed up with for 10 years before they bought something.



**If someone doesn’t return your calls, don’t assume it’s because they don’t want your product—perhaps they didn’t call you back because they were busy or didn’t get your message.** Instead of taking an unreturned call personally or speculating about whys:

  * Call the customer again and leave another message.
  * Try different communication methods including email, mail, and personal visits.
  * Ask your other clients if they can help you get in touch. You may already know someone who knows the person you’re trying to connect with.
  * Never mention that someone failed to call you back.
  * Always return other people’s calls, even if it’s just to say you’re not interested, because this keeps communication open and may have a karmic effect.
