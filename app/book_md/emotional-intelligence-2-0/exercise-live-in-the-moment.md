## Exercise: Live in the Moment

A crucial aspect of social awareness is an ability to live in the moment. If you allow distractions to pull your focus, you wonâ€™t catch critical information.

* * *

Think of a recent conversation that you had in which you felt disconnected. Describe it.

Were you distracted? If so, by what?

What could you do to remove these distractions from future conversations?

What are some specific ways you could have practiced active listening? Think about listening to tone, pacing, and volume and silencing your inner voice.
