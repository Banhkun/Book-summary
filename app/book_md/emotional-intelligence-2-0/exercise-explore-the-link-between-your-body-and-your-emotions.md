## Exercise: Explore the Link Between Your Body and Your Emotions

Understanding how your body responds to emotions allows you to identify your feelings as they emerge. Use this exercise to explore the ways your body responds to different emotional stimuli.

* * *

Close your eyes for a minute or two and begin to observe the sensations throughout your body. Are you breathing deeply or shallowly? Are you tense? If so, where? How fast is your heart beating? List the physical sensations you're experiencing. Be specific.

What do these physical sensations tell you about your current emotional state?

Now, think of a trigger that evokes a negative emotional response from you. This can be a pet peeve or an interaction with a person you canâ€™t stand. Close your eyes for a minute or two and think about the trigger. As you do, observe the sensations throughout your body. What are they?
