## Exercise: Handle Tense Situations Effectively

The way that you handle tense situations reveals a lot about your emotional intelligence. The higher your EQ, the better you are at navigating these situations while maintaining strong relationships.

* * *

Think of a recent disagreement with a colleague in which one or both of you began blaming one another for a problem. Describe it.

Now, think of “fix-it” statements that could have helped deescalate the disagreement. Remember, “fix-it” statements are neutral statements that refocus everyone’s attention towards the problem at hand. Write down 2-3 statements.

Think of a recent conversation with a colleague in which you had to deliver difficult or bad news, and the conversation ended in a fight. How did you handle delivering the information? What did the other person have to say? Describe the conversation.

Now, think about the ways to navigate difficult conversations (start on common ground, ask the other person for their perspective, don’t plan rebuttals, explain your side, keep the conversation moving, and stay in touch). What could you have done differently to keep the conversation from growing into a fight?
