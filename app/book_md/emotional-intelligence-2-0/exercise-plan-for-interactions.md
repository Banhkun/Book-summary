## Exercise: Plan for Interactions

Having a plan for social gatherings allows you to get out of your head and be more socially aware.

* * *

Think of a recent social event where you felt overwhelmed. In what ways did you feel overwhelmed? (Did your conversations feel stilted? Did you forget things? Did you feel uncomfortable?)

Now think of the ways that you could have planned before the event to make things run more smoothly. Think about creating talking points, setting reminders, and listing your goals.

Think of a similar event you’ll attend in the future. What are some ways you can prepare?

A “back-pocket question” gives you material to save a dying conversation. List some questions you could use next time you talk to a friend or co-worker.
