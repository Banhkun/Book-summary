## Exercise: Visualize Your Success

Visualizing yourself managing a situation well allows your brain to develop EQ skills before difficult situations arise.

* * *

Think of a situation in which you have previously had trouble managing your emotions. Describe it.

Now think of a way that you would want to handle the situation effectively in the future. Describe how you would have ideally handled the situation.

Now close your eyes and visualize yourself handling the situation well. Be specific in your imagination and take the time to play out the entire scenario. Describe your visualization.
