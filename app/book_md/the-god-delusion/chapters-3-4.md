## Chapters 3-4: The Unlikelihood of God’s Existence

In the last chapter, we talked about the extraordinary claims made by religion, all of which would have a significant impact on the world if they were true. In this chapter, we will evaluate the _likelihood_ of the theistic position we explored in the last chapter. Specifically, we’ll:

  * Explore some of the most common arguments that theists put forward for the existence of God—and expose their fundamental weaknesses
  * Examine how science, and particularly the theory of evolution by natural selection, offers a more durable, testable, and evidence-based explanation than religion for the things we observe in the world



### The Weakness of Creationism

Most arguments for God’s existence postulate a supreme designer, similar to the figure we discussed in the previous chapter. Proponents of this belief are called creationists.

**Creationists believe that the universe we observe is the handiwork of an intelligent designer who consciously and knowingly created everything** , from the movement of galaxies throughout the universe to the orbit of electrons within an atom. For creationists, an intelligent God is the ultimate and simple explanation for everything.

The medieval Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas, writing in the 13th century, argued that all things must have a primary cause and that the mere _existence_ of physical things proved the existence of God. He reasoned that there must have been a time _before_ physical things existed. But that meant that a non-physical force must have, at some point, brought the physical world into existence. For Aquinas, that force could only have been God.

But this is where the “simple” theistic position begins to fall apart. **If all things can be said to have their root cause in an intelligent God, then one must raise the obvious question—what is the root cause of God? Who designed the designer?**

This is the fundamental flaw at the heart of most theistic arguments. You can postulate an infinite regression of the physical universe that terminates with God. But if you can’t explain the existence of God in the first place, the argument collapses.

### The Weakness of Other Theist Arguments

Not all theist arguments are based in creationism—although they _are_ all just as flawed and weak as those that are. Let’s look at some of the most famous arguments that theologians have put forward and examine why they fail to achieve their objective.

#### The Ontological Argument

There is a class of theological arguments known as _a priori_ arguments. These arguments exist independently of observation and are formulated entirely through abstract thought experiments.

**The most famous _a priori_ argument for God is known as the ontological argument, first promulgated by the English monk St. Anselm of Canterbury, who lived primarily in the 11th century.**

The basic premise of the argument is as follows:

  * God is perfect; therefore, nothing can be imagined that is greater than God.
  * Such a great being that actually _exists_ must be greater than a being that does _not_ exist, because existence is superior to non-existence.
  * If God existed only in the mind (as atheists believe), one could imagine an even greater being—namely, a God that existed in reality, not just in the mind.
  * Thus, there is a logical contradiction, because it should be impossible to imagine something greater than God.
  * The only way to resolve this contradiction is to accept that God _does_ exist in reality, not just in the mind. 



The basic weakness of this argument (as was pointed out by 18th-century philosophers like Immanuel Kant and David Hume) is that it proceeds from false premises. The argument falls apart if one does _not_ accept the idea of a perfect God in the first place. And, indeed, atheists do _not_ accept this starting premise. **Likewise** , **the ontological argument suffers from the logical fallacy known as begging the question—in which the premise of an argument already assumes the truth of its conclusion.**

Beyond these weaknesses, **there is no reason to accept the other pillar of the argument: that an existing God is by definition greater than a non-existent God.** By inverting Anselm’s slippery logic, you could argue that a non-existent being is _greater_ than an existing one. A God who overcame the handicap of non-existence to create the universe is surely a greater being than one who created the universe while existing!

#### The “Beauty by Design” Argument

Another argument often advanced by theists is the argument from beauty. This states that the most sublime works of human creation, like the plays and sonnets of Shakespeare or the symphonies of Beethoven, are so exquisitely beautiful that they could not have been created by mortal humans. Instead, they could only be products of some divine spark _within_ humans, planted by God.

This is barely an argument at all, as it does not even offer any logic or proof in support of its conclusions. Why does Shakespeare’s _Hamlet_ or Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 require the existence of a deity? **Art can be appreciated and celebrated by the religious and non-religious alike; one does not need to accept the premise of a higher power in order to be moved by great artistic works.**

This even includes religious art, like the Sistine Chapel ceiling by Michelangelo. An avowed atheist can be struck by the beauty of this work without believing in God. Much European art, in fact, _is_ religious (specifically Christian) in nature, because the Church was the primary patron of the visual arts for most of the medieval and Renaissance periods. Artists like Michelangelo had no choice but to create religious works because they were commissioned to do so by the religious authorities. Left to their own devices, they may well have created secular works of equal greatness.

#### The Miracle Argument

We often hear of people experiencing religious visions or witnessing miracles. For example, religious people often claim to have heard God speaking to them or to have seen a vision of the Virgin Mary. **Before we can accept that these events are miracles—which would be a phenomenally rare occurrence—we must first rule out other explanations that are more likely.** The only way we could accept an account of a religious vision or miracle is if rejecting it would be even _more_ implausible than accepting it.

As it happens, there are multiple more plausible explanations for these so-called miracles. First, the human brain is hardwired to recognize human faces and hear human voices, even where they do not exist. This is most likely an inheritance from evolution. Natural selection would have made it advantageous to be able to quickly identify a potential intruder, even if most of the time this instinct would have generated false negatives (we will cover natural selection in greater detail later in the chapter).

Hallucinations, mass delusions, and simple human error might be rare phenomena—but they are much less rare than direct interventions by God in the physical world. The only reason that we treat hallucinations differently than claims of epiphany is that **most people don’t experience genuine auditory or visual hallucinations, but most people _do_ accept the core claims of theistic religion. Religion simply has the numbers on its side.**

#### The Argument From Biblical Authority

Many religious people employ the circular logic of appealing to the Bible itself for proof of God’s existence. The Bible is divinely authored, according to this argument, and it says that God exists and regularly intervenes in human affairs. Therefore, there is incontrovertible proof of his existence.

Of course, non-believers _don’t_ accept that the Bible is divinely authored or inspired, so this argument also assumes facts not in evidence. Moreover, the Bible was written and compiled by several different authors, writing centuries after the events they purported to describe.

Thus, **the Bible is riddled with inconsistencies and scholars don’t consider it a reliable historical account.** For example, the Bible is unclear about whether Jesus was born in Bethlehem or Nazareth. That the Bible is unable to even get the facts straight on where the supposed son of God was born argues strongly against relying upon it as a historical source.

#### Pascal’s Wager

Lastly, Pascal’s wager, proposed by the French philosopher Blaise Pascal in the 17th century, isn’t an argument that seeks to prove God’s existence, but it does try to make the case that an individual ought to _believe_ in God. The argument goes:

  * If you believe in God and he _does_ exist, you are rewarded with an eternity in heaven (according to Christianity at least). 
  * If you believe in God and he _doesn’t_ exist, you gain nothing but also suffer no penalty. 
  * Likewise, if you don’t believe in God and he _doesn’t_ exist, you gain nothing but suffer no penalty.
  * However, if you don’t believe in God and he _does_ exist, you will suffer eternal torment and damnation.



**According to Pascal’s wager, there is no cosmic upside to being an atheist; but there is potentially an enormous downside.** Therefore, the only logical thing to do is to believe in God.

However, this thought experiment fails to make an airtight case for belief in God. You can’t be _forced_ to believe something; you either believe it or you don’t. The only thing Pascal’s wager could compel is _false_ belief, pretending to accept the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient God. But wouldn’t this all-seeing, all-knowing deity see through your ruse? Might he then be inclined to punish you further for your attempts to deceive him?

What’s more, **how do you know if the God you happen to believe in is the one that really exists?** By picking the “wrong” God, you might have damned yourself just as much as by believing in no God at all.

### Natural Selection and the Improbability of God

**Based upon the serious flaws in these arguments, we can see that the God Hypothesis is flimsy at best.** But people of faith persist in their belief nevertheless. One common argument that they often put forward is the argument from complexity or improbability.

They start by observing the intricate details of the natural universe, from the movement of the planets within the solar system to the workings of cells within the human body. Given the sheer complexity and detail of the observable world, they conclude that an intelligent designer is the only possible explanation. What are the odds that all we see around us is the product of chance? According to this view, the world being the result of simple luck is as likely as an entire Boeing 747 being assembled from a single gust of wind.

**But the problem with this argument is that it presents a false choice. The choice is _not_ between design and luck. It’s between design and natural selection**. And natural selection offers a far more logical and likely explanation for why the world is the way it is.

#### Natural Selection: Creating Complexity From Simplicity

Before Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection, intelligent design seemed to offer a much stronger explanation for the complexity we observe in the natural world. It made sense that our world was the product of design by an unfathomably complex maker.

An analogy could be made to a complex human stonemason making a relatively simple stone wall. But it had never been shown to work in the other direction—no stone wall had ever made a stonemason. In other words, **it was impossible to imagine something _complex_ arising from something _simple_.**

But Darwin and natural selection solved this great mystery and dealt a blow to the creationist account of the universe from which it has never been able to recover. Natural selection states that certain small genetic mutations in individual living organisms give them a slightly greater chance of survival than their peers. Because those organisms best suited for survival are more likely to survive, they have a greater likelihood of passing on their own genes to their offspring. **Over time, traits that are advantageous for survival get passed on; those that aren’t die out.**

Environmental change over the course of billions of years complements the evolutionary process, as plants and animals evolve through natural selection to become better suited to their environment. From simple, single-celled organisms arise primates like human beings capable of abstract and concrete thought. And the process of evolution is ongoing. Millions of years from now, Earth’s organisms—including humans—will look radically different from how they do today.

### Theist Arguments Against Natural Selection

Because natural selection represents such a threat to their system of belief, theists have been trying to discredit Darwin’s ideas since the 19th century. Here, we’ll explore some of the theist arguments against natural selection and show how they derive from an inaccurate or incomplete understanding of how natural selection actually works.

#### A Cumulative Process

**Theists often mischaracterize natural selection as implausible because they misunderstand it (or willfully choose to not understand it).** They caricature natural selection as claiming that evolution was a straightforward process that made the current state of the world inevitable. In many ways, their picture of natural selection treats the evolutionary process as a direct substitute for God.

But of course, this is not how natural selection works. Natural selection does not posit that evolution proceeded quickly on a linear course to arrive at exactly the state we observe today, nor does it claim that every facet of the natural world we see was inevitable. **Natural selection is a _cumulative_ process full of twists and turns, dead ends, and failed species along the way.**

Slight changes in genetic mutations or in the natural environment at some point along the way would have drastically altered the process of evolution. We have abundant evidence in the fossil record of how and when today’s species evolved into the forms by which we know them today, including early versions of animals that died out along the evolutionary journey.

It is true that the _totality_ of the world as we observe it today is a great improbability. But that is only because the natural world is the product of countless _individual_ steps along the evolutionary process, each one of which was only _slightly_ improbable. **Creationists misleadingly try to focus attention on the improbability of the _end_ product, rather than the much greater probability of each iterative _step_ along the way.**

They point to gaps in the evolutionary record as “proof” that the whole theory of natural selection ought to be scrapped. For example, they might point out that a fossil hasn’t yet been discovered that can be linked to human ancestors for a particular period of evolutionary history. But this is simply cherry-picking the evidence to support a predetermined conclusion. The evidence in favor of evolution by natural selection is overwhelming, and specific gaps in the state of our knowledge do not disprove the fundamental soundness of the theory. And even if they did, it is a complete _non-sequitur_ to then conclude that the only alternative is an intelligent God.

#### The Falsity of Irreducible Complexity

**Creationists also put a great deal of energy into looking for evidence of irreducible complexity in the evolutionary record.** Something of irreducible complexity would be an organ or feature that could not have come about by natural selection, because it could not exist in anything other than its “finished” form. Anything less than the final, complex form wouldn’t function correctly.

**Because natural selection is a gradual process that involves many iterative changes over time, it could not produce something of irreducible complexity.** The discovery of such an organ would indeed be a serious blow to the theory of natural selection. Thankfully for the theory, however, nothing _has_ been found that would meet the criteria for being irreducibly complex.

Even something as seemingly complex as the human eye is made up of constituent parts that evolved over time into their present form. We know this because we see organisms living today that have organs that contain constituent elements of the human eye—but nevertheless fall short of being a full eye. In fact, the flatworm has something very close to half a human eye. It can detect light, but it cannot see an image. Certain mollusks, meanwhile, have a “pinhole” eye that can detect images, albeit blurry and distorted ones, far inferior to those detected by the human eye.

While these are not the equal of the human eye, they are vastly better than no eye at all—and they show that even an eye can exist in simplified or partial form, just as natural selection predicts that it would.

### The Anthropic Principle: Why We’re Here

**Even if one accepts the theory of natural selection, it does not explain how the process started. How did life begin in the first place?** Religious people claim that God must have at least _started_ life in the universe, even if some of them might concede that evolution by natural selection is the _means_ by which it arrived at the forms we observe today.

But science has a better explanation, known as the anthropic principle. It states simply that our planet, and by extension our universe, must have the right properties for intelligent life to develop—like water, the right temperature conditions, and a stable orbit and gravitational field—because we are here and able to make observations about it.

(Shortform note: To learn more about the anthropic principle and the origins of our universe, read our summary of Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time.)

#### The Luck of Intelligent Life

The anthropic principle provides a useful framework to think about the likelihood of intelligent life in the universe.

Astronomy conservatively estimates that there are around one billion billion planets in the universe. **Even if you put the odds of intelligent life emerging on any given planet at one in a billion, this would still yield one billion planets capable of sustaining such life.** We are not accustomed to accepting events with a one-in-a-billion probability of happening, because they _never_ happen in the course of day-to-day human experience.

But we are also not used to dealing with the sheer scale of the universe, which makes such events _likely_ to happen at least _somewhere_. If we accept the anthropic principle, then we just happen to be on one of the lucky few planets that can support beings like us, living in a universe with the right mix of fundamental constants to create such planets.

#### God Setting the Conditions?

Indeed, our existence as intelligent beings is highly unlikely. But we must measure the unlikelihood of our existence in the universe against the God Hypothesis, which posits a supreme being carefully setting precisely the right conditions in the universe to support intelligent life.

**The existence of a deity capable of precisely calibrating the conditions of the universe so as to support the survival of intelligent life is surely even less likely than the existence of those conditions themselves.** Moreover, God is not a “simple” explanation for the existence of intelligent life, despite what theists claim.

If the God Hypothesis were true, the deity it posits would be mind-bogglingly complex, capable of controlling the movement of every subatomic particle in the universe. This once again raises the inevitable question—**by what mechanism could such a complex being arise? Who designed the supreme designer?**
