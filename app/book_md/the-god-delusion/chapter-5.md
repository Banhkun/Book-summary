## Chapter 5: The Non-Divine Roots of Religion

In the last chapter, we established that evolution by natural selection is a far better explanation than creationism for the complexity we observe in the world. Even though we’ve seen that the factual claims made by theism are highly unlikely to be true, we cannot ignore the fact that religion _itself_ has existed and continues to exist, across all societies and all periods of time.

If we don’t accept the truth of religious claims, we have to account for religion’s existence by means of natural selection, evolutionary psychology, and cultural transmission, instead of divine received wisdom. In this chapter, we’ll explore the origins of religion and its survival into the present by looking at:

  * How religion may have been advantageous to human survival
  * Alternatively, how religion might be an unintended by-product of _other_ cognitive traits that _were_ advantageous to survival
  * How religion could have been a cultural transmission that was passed on from generation to generation with mutations along the way, in a process analogous to genetic transmission



### The Possible Benefits of Religion

If we accept natural selection, then we must place religion itself in a Darwinian framework. But from a purely Darwinian perspective, **a belief in religion seems to be an extraordinarily _dis_ advantageous trait that ought to have died out very early on in the evolution of humans.**

After all, it compels individuals and societies to expend enormous resources on elaborate buildings, ritual sacrifices, and the maintenance of a priestly caste that does little to ensure the practical, day-to-day survival of either the individual or the group. It also encourages other practices that are disadvantageous to the passing on of one’s genes, including religious war, martyrdom, and celibacy.

And still, religion has survived and indeed thrived, despite what appear to be its significant handicaps. Is there something we’re missing? Does religion confer some evolutionary advantage upon those who believe in it?

#### The Religious Placebo Effect

Religious people often claim that religion provides them with a sense of hope or comfort. A belief in the power of prayer, for example, might provide someone with a greater sense of control over the events in their lives. They are never powerless, because they can always appeal to God to intervene on their behalf. Similarly, a belief in the afterlife might make the grief and despair of losing a loved one more manageable, as the bereaved person can take comfort knowing that they will be reunited with their loved one in heaven.

Holding such comforting beliefs might hypothetically make religious people less likely to succumb to stress-related maladies. If religious faith did indeed have this effect, it would confer an evolutionary advantage, as people of faith would have a greater likelihood of passing on their genes. Unfortunately for theists, the evidence for the health benefits of religious faith is weak; after controlling for other variables, religious people don’t demonstrate any better health outcomes than non-religious people.

Religion might still work like a placebo, in which a dummy medication succeeds in producing positive health effects because the unaware patient _believes_ they are taking a real drug. The placebo effect is very real and well-documented, and shouldn't be dismissed out of hand. However, it’s arguably far too small a phenomenon to explain the sheer ubiquity and power of religion. Religion is one of the most dominant forces in all of human history. It has to have arisen from something greater than the placebo effect.

Likewise, we also can’t ignore the fact that **religion also _causes_ stress, often by threatening eternal damnation and torture if you don’t unquestioningly accept its claims. **This would make religion an evolutionary disadvantage, as people of faith would be _more_ likely to suffer from stress-related conditions and have a lower likelihood of passing on their genes.

#### In-Group Solidarity and the Free-Rider Problem

While religious devotion might be disadvantageous to an individual—for example, because it causes emotional distress and often demands costly material sacrifices such as tithes and offerings to the priesthood—it could conceivably be advantageous to a _group_. Common belief in the same God (or gods) is a powerful way to foster in-group solidarity and altruism (we’ll explore the origins of altruism in the next chapter). People within a tribe or confederation will be more likely to aid one another if they are members of the same religious faith. This, in turn, will make the survival of the group more likely and enable the transmission of religious belief as an advantageous Darwinian trait.

However, this theory of the origin of religion through the mechanism of group selection runs into trouble when we consider the problem of free riders. One tribe, tightly knit by its shared devotion to a religious faith that emphasizes war and the slaughter of heathens, might indeed have a strong military (and thus, evolutionary) advantage over a rival tribe with no religion at all.

But a non-believing _individual_ within that warlike tribe would benefit from hanging back in battle and letting his co-religionists engage in the slaughter instead. This free rider would have an advantage at the game of natural selection, because he would have all the _advantages_ of being in the religious tribe (getting to subjugate and expropriate a rival tribe) with fewer of the _disadvantages_(getting killed because of religious zealotry).

Such a free rider would stand a better chance of passing on his genes to his offspring. Owing to their evolutionary advantage, those descended from non-believers would come to outnumber the progeny of the faithful.

### Religion: An Evolutionary Misfiring?

If religion directly confers few concrete evolutionary advantages, why have humans always been so vulnerable to its false claims? The picture becomes clearer if we consider **religion as a by-product of _other_ instincts and cognitive traits that _do_ confer a significant advantage in natural selection. **If we look at it this way, religion represents a massive misfiring of an instinct that’s usually useful.

#### Child Obedience to Authority

**Religion could have emerged as a misfiring of the generally advantageous fixed-action behavior pattern of child obedience to adult authority figures.** With regard to natural selection, children obeying community elders makes perfect sense. In early human societies, children who adhered to adult commands such as, “Don’t go swimming in that river with the fast-moving rapids,” or “Stay out of that section of the woods where bears are known to prowl” would naturally have had a far greater chance of survival than those that didn’t. These obedient children would have a greater chance of growing up to have children of their own, to whom they would pass on their obedient genes.

But this unquestioning obedience would also make children vulnerable to the authoritative claims of religion. If you are hardwired to blindly adhere to all adult rules and regulations, there is every reason to accept the claims of religious leaders who tell you which gods to pray to and which rituals to perform.

These children grow up and pass on their propensity for religion to the next generation. Of course, the specific content of the religion will vary from place to place and evolve over time, depending upon the natural environment and the broader social structure of the community. But the basic mechanism of transmission would remain the same.

#### Teleology and Intentionality

**Religion may also represent a misfiring or by-product of the natural tendency toward teleology and intentionality.**

Teleology is the belief that there is a purpose for everything we observe in the natural world. Child psychologists observe that children appear to have a natural tendency toward teleology, believing that trees exist to give animals shelter from the rain or that the ocean exists so fish can have a place to swim.

Teleology gives us a shortcut to understanding how things work. It is easier to comprehend complex phenomena like the workings of the human lung if we conceive of them as purpose-driven (in the case of the lung, its purpose is to pump oxygen throughout the body). Closely related to teleology is intentionality, the belief that the things we observe in the world are the products of conscious agents with a specific intention. This likewise would have been a useful trait for survival (it would be advantageous, after all, to assume that a hungry lion intends to eat you).

But it is a short leap from teleology and intentionality to religious belief, and the idea that God controls everything in the physical and spiritual world.

#### The Moth to the Flame

The misfiring concept is easier to understand if we use a metaphor from the insect world. It is a commonly observed phenomenon that moths will sometimes fly directly into an open flame, burning themselves to death in the process. If we’re looking at it from a strictly evolutionary perspective, this makes no sense. Why would an animal concerned with survival and producing offspring do something so self-destructive and irrational?

The reason is that moths usually rely on sources of _natural_ light like the stars and the moon to guide their way back home after a night of foraging and feeding. Moths survive by flying into the path of light. This behavior with respect to light is a fixed-action pattern: Upon presentation of a certain stimulus (light), the moth instinctively engages in a behavior (flying toward it), because throughout almost their entire evolutionary history, this behavior _is_ what maximized their chances of survival and producing offspring.

But with the relatively recent arrival of humans and their control of fire, the fixed-action pattern became scrambled. The stimulus _appeared_ to be the same, but the corresponding behavior came at a deadly price. Thus, the act of suicide-by-flame is in fact an unintended by-product of an evolutionary instinct that is nearly always advantageous to the moth.

(Shortform note: To learn more about fixed-action patterns and how they influence human behavior as well as that of animals, read our summary of Robert Cialdini’s Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.)

### Memes and Cultural Transmission

Religion may also have persisted over time through memes and cultural transmission. **Culture, like genetic material, can pass down over time. The basic unit of culture is the meme.** A meme is some element of culture (like architecture, cuisine, or religion) that can be transmitted from generation to generation.

As with genetic natural selection, cultural transmission involves the replication of memes across generations. But, inevitably, slight “mutations” or imperfect copies occur along the way. We can observe this in the real world by playing simple children’s games like Telephone. A child whispers a sentence or phrase into the ear of another child, and tells her to pass it on to the next child, who passes it along to the next one, and so on until the final player says aloud the message she received. Often, the final message is vastly different from the original. “Suzie lives down the lane” becomes something like “Lucy loves to play games.”

We can treat memes as somewhat analogous to genes. Those memes that are “good” at survival get passed on; those that aren’t don’t survive. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the memes are advantageous to human survival; it simply means that the _memes themselves_ are successful at being copied and passed down with comparatively few transcription errors along the way.

One factor that might aid in the survival of a meme is the presence of other memes. This also has its parallel in genes. A plant-eating gene wouldn’t last long in a meat-eating gene pool. Similarly, a snow-god meme wouldn’t last long in a hot climate, within a culture dominated by belief in a sun god.

**Evolutionary anthropologists believe that cultural transmission might be a better mechanism than natural selection to explain ubiquitous but highly varied features of human culture, like religion.** This is because the process of natural selection is slow, taking place over millions of years. Meanwhile, the evolution and diversification of human culture has taken place in a comparatively short few millennia. In that time, we have seen remarkable variety in language, material culture, and, of course, religious practice. Natural selection through genes could never produce this much variety this quickly.

#### Religious Memes

We can bring this analysis to bear on the transmission of religious ideas from generation to generation. In certain conditions and in the presence of certain other memes, various aspects of religious belief and practice might simply be better at replicating themselves over time. **Some ideas flourish better in different cultural contexts than others.**

Some common religious memes that have survived and successfully replicated include belief in an afterlife, the eternal rewards that await martyrs, and that non-believers must be punished or killed. This might explain why particular religions developed and evolved where and when they did.

##### Example: Cargo Cults and the Birth of a Religion

**The phenomenon of cargo cults offers a fascinating insight into how quickly organized religions can spring up and evolve within certain cultural contexts.**

During World War Two, Allied forces set up bases on remote islands in Melanesia, often recruiting local islanders to work in and around the military encampments. The pre-industrial natives of these islands had seldom had contact with the outside world and had certainly never seen the wondrous technology the newcomers brought, including canned food, telephones, radios, tanks, and aircraft.

The sudden abundance of these once-unimaginable goods drastically changed the standard of living for the islanders. Having no experience with this technology, they believed the cargo to have been brought to them through some sort of divine mechanism. The islanders mistook the routine phone calls and shipment orders they saw the white soldiers engaging in as some sort of religious ritual that brought the magical cargo.

When the war ended and the soldiers left, charismatic leaders on the island of Tanna in modern-day Vanuatu prophesied that an American soldier named John Frum would return one day with new shipments of cargo, at the time of the apocalypse. To bring the vision to life, cult adherents to this day perform the “rituals” that they believe will bring the cargo back. These include the construction of phones, radios, and even life-sized airplanes, landing strips, and control towers out of bamboo, which they believe will return the bounty of cargo to the island.

**The John Frum cult is important because it represents the evolution, within modern times, of a religious tradition based on a messianic figure.** One cannot help but compare a figure like John Frum to Jesus Christ—a mysterious charismatic figure who may or may not have existed, claimed to work divine miracles, and promised a glorious bounty upon his return. If nothing else, the cargo cults show how little it takes to start a religion complete with rituals, a priesthood, and an established dogma—clearly the human psyche is hardwired for religion.
