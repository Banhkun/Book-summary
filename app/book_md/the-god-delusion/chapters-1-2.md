## Chapters 1-2: The Theist Position

Before we discuss the reasons why religion is harmful and should be abandoned, we first need to explore two topics. First, we’ll discuss what the claims of theists (and atheists) actually are. Then, we’ll discuss why it’s appropriate to evaluate and challenge the claims of religion. **Religious people often claim that their faith is under unique threat of persecution**. Therefore, in their eyes, any criticism, mockery, or even the mere _expression_ of skepticism regarding anyone’s religious beliefs constitutes an act of bigotry.

In this chapter, we’ll cover:

  * Why claims of an intelligent creator deserve to be evaluated on their merits, and not merely accepted as inherently unknowable
  * How religion commands an undeserved level of respect and reverence, even from non-believers
  * How any harmful or discriminatory action can be accepted—as long as it is justified on the grounds that it is part of one’s religious beliefs



### The Claims of Theism

Prior to delving deeper into our discussion of God and religion, we should clarify some terms. When we say “religion,” we are referring to the **belief in a supernatural being who created the universe and who has the power to intervene in human affairs.**

This supernatural being—we will refer to it as “God” from here on, for simplicity’s sake—can be prayed to, petitioned, and even called upon to punish one’s enemies. **This form of religion, which postulates the existence of an intelligent and omnipotent creator, is known as theism.**

The particular _form_ of theism we’ll be discussing in this summary is monotheism, the belief in _one_ supreme God. While polytheism (a belief in multiple gods) does exist, the vast majority of people in the West are far more familiar with the three major monotheistic or Abrahamic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

#### Deism and Pantheism

**Defenders of traditional religion often like to make the claim that celebrated historical figures in philosophy, politics, and science were committed monotheists. However, these claims are nearly always exaggerated, if not outright false.**

For example, many of the American Founding Fathers, including Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin, were not monotheists at all. Rather, they were _deists,_ believing that, while God did indeed create the universe, he played no role in the management or governance of its day-to-day affairs. These men were deeply anti-clerical in their writings and railed against the ignorance, superstition, and prejudice that they viewed as the natural byproducts of religion.

And while some scientific luminaries like Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, and Albert Einstein used the word “God” in their writings (which have been subsequently cherry-picked and decontextualized by religious writers to provide “proof” that these figures were religious), they were almost certainly _not_ using it in the monotheistic sense, but rather, pantheistically: as a metaphor for the totality of the universe.

#### Defining Atheism

Now that we have an understanding of monotheism, we have to define its opposite number—atheism. **An atheist is someone who assigns an extremely low probability to God’s existence and lives their life on the assumption that he does not exist.**

Atheists reject the idea of an intelligent creator on the grounds that the only process that can produce beings capable of such conscious creation is evolution by natural selection (which we’ll explore in greater detail later in the summary).

### Evaluating the God Hypothesis

Since it is logically impossible to prove a negative, one can never be certain that God _isn’t_ real. But that does not mean that we can’t reasonably assess the _likelihood_ of his existence.

Proponents of God’s existence say that we should simply accept their account of how the universe came to be and the divine forces that govern it on faith, without question or evaluation. But why should we not apply the same rigorous testing and analysis to the question of God’s existence (we’ll refer to it as the God Hypothesis for the remainder of the summary) that would to any other assertion of fact? After all, the God Hypothesis is merely a hypothesis like any other.

And, of course, not all hypotheses are created equal. We use likelihood and probability to evaluate the truth of the claims put forward by any hypothesis. For example, the Tooth Fairy Hypothesis is a hypothesis about how money appears under children’s pillows in the morning after they place a baby tooth under them at night. No one can ever definitively “prove” the non-existence of the Tooth Fairy. But because we have more rational and more likely explanations for the appearance of the money under the pillow (namely, that parents are placing it there while their children are asleep), we can confidently assign a very low probability to the Tooth Fairy Hypothesis.

**Agnostics, who claim to be on the fence about the existence of God, wrongly conflate absolute proof with likelihood**. Even learned people working in advanced scientific fields, like the late American paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould, hold to the agnostic position that science is simply incapable of rendering any judgment at all on the question of God’s existence.

But this claim rings hollow. **The theistic account purports the existence of a God who consciously created the world and can bend the very laws of physics** on the request of a believer through the mechanism of prayer. Christianity alone puts forward virgin birth, the transformation of water into wine, and the resurrection of the dead as material claims about the world.

A universe in which such things were possible would be vastly different from the one we observe. It would throw all known scientific findings into question. Therefore, **the God Hypothesis is a perfectly legitimate one for science to study, evaluate, and, ultimately, reject, if the evidence is found to be lacking**. It deserves to be tested just like any other hypothesis.

#### The Burden of Proof

**Moreover, the burden of proof does not rest on those who question the God Hypothesis.** The burden is, rather, on the _theists_ to provide evidence for their positive claims. And, happily for the atheists, there is little evidence to support the claims made by religion.

For example, in one double-blind study conducted in the United Kingdom, researchers found that hospital patients who were prayed for did not experience health outcomes any better than those who weren’t prayed for—if anything, they fared a bit _worse_. While this one study cannot disprove God’s existence, it certainly casts doubts upon the efficacy of prayer, which is a core claim of monotheistic faith.

Now that we’ve seen that the God Hypothesis ought to be judged on its merits like any other hypothesis, we should turn our attention to actually _evaluating_ the truth of the claims it puts forward.
