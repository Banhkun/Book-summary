## Introduction

**Religion has been central to nearly every human society in history**. It is difficult for many people to imagine a world without a supreme deity.

But what if faith in God represents a great error? What would be the possibilities for human advancement if we were to shed our religious faith and embrace reason and science as the ultimate arbiters of truth and justice?

In _The God Delusion_ , University of Oxford biologist and anti-religion activist Richard Dawkins argues **that religion has exerted a harmful influence on human society since its inception and that we ought to abandon it in favor of science.** In this summary, we’ll explore:

  * The unwarranted favor and deference granted to religion
  * The unlikelihood of God’s existence and the weakness of the arguments in favor of it
  * How religion is nothing more than a by-product of other, unrelated evolutionary mechanisms
  * Why we don’t owe our morality to religion
  * How religion promotes values that are distinctly _immoral_
  * How humankind would benefit from the ultimate destruction of religion and a positive embrace of atheism.
