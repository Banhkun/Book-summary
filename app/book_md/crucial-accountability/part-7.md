## Part 7: What NOT to Do While Discussing Accountability

The authors stress the importance of understanding what _not_ to do in an accountability conversation almost as much as what _to_ do. Because we’ve likely grown up watching people handle accountability issues incorrectly, these learned behaviors slip out when we least expect them to. By understanding what _not_ to do, we can recognize and halt these behaviors as soon as we see ourselves enacting them.

(Shortform note: The authors emphasize what _not_ to do during accountability conversations because these bad behaviors are common practices for many people. Experts second this assertion, explaining that in order to develop better habits, we first need to identify what we’re doing wrong, which is the purpose of this section.)

### Before Giving Advice, Listen to the Other Person’s Perspective

The authors assert that we need to listen to the other person’s point of view in order to make accurate judgments and solutions. The issue is about the other person, therefore, they’re the ones who’ll have the most information about what went wrong and why.

**Without hearing the other person’s perspective, you might be seeing the issue incorrectly or incompletely.** For example, after hearing the other person’s side of the story, you might realize that their reaction was correct in that particular situation, even if they failed to meet expectations.

Ultimately, you need to speak to the other person to get the full picture and identify all the possible barriers. _Then_ you can develop solutions.

(Shortform note: Experts second the author's argument here, explaining that when we enter a conversation with the belief that we fully understand the problem and how to solve it, it becomes difficult to truly listen to the other person and sends them the message that we don’t think they’re capable or valuable in solving the issue.)

### Don’t Bias Their Response

**The authors warn that when you’re brainstorming solutions, don’t bias the other person’s response by first proposing a solution and then asking what they think.** When you start off the discussion with something like “to solve this problem I think that it’s best to do X. What do you think?” you’re preventing new, and possibly better, solutions to enter the conversation.

The authors explain that this strategy stifles the production of new and better ideas in two ways:

  1. **You’re putting ideas in the other person’s head which can stifle any new solutions they might have come up with.**
  2. **They might be hesitant to disagree with you.**



Instead, the authors advise that you ask open-ended questions that don’t assume the solution.

> **Don’t Use Leading Questions**
> 
> This practice is called asking with leading questions: Leading questions are defined as questions that lead or persuade the other person to give a certain response.
> 
> These types of questions are banned from interrogations and research studies because of the effect they have on peoples’ responses. When you ask a leading question, it's unlikely that you’ll receive the other person’s genuine, unbiased response. So, as the authors recommend, if you truly want to receive the other person’s opinions and the best possible solutions, avoid asking for their ideas with leading questions.

### Don’t Make the Other Person Guess What You’re Thinking

**The authors explain that if you already have a solution in mind, don’t disingenuously ask the other person for their opinion until they eventually guess what you’re thinking.** Doing so is disrespectful and manipulative—humans can’t read minds, so don’t expect them to.

Instead, the authors advise entering the conversation with an open mind and hearing the other person’s recommendations before adding your input. You can have ideas about possible solutions, but don’t enter the conversation with the belief that you already have the _best_ solution.

(Shortform note: Some experts describe this type of questioning as “GWOMMing,” or making others “Guess What's On My Mind.” They second the authors’ argument about why we should avoid this type of communication, explaining that the other person might perceive you as disingenuous or dishonest. They add that GWOMMing can also cause the other person to hold back their input or become resentful towards you.)

### Don’t Cut the Conversation Short

**Keep the conversation flowing honestly and freely.** The more information you have, the easier it is to pinpoint the underlying cause of the key issue. With this information, you can better pinpoint an effective solution.

> **How to Keep the Conversation Flowing**
> 
> The authors recommend that we keep the conversation flowing in order to achieve the best solutions; however, they don’t provide guidelines on how to do this. Experts suggest that we can have a successful and rewarding conversation by:
> 
>   * Making sure the conversation is roughly 50/50. Make sure you’re not speaking too much and dominating the conversation, or too little and forcing the other person to come up with irrelevant things to say to avoid awkward silence.
> 
>   * Using effective and active listening. Make eye contact and use nonverbal cues like nodding to encourage their response. Ask questions and reflect on information with comments like “I understand how you feel” or “that must have been difficult.”
> 
>   * Using reciprocal disclosure. When the other person discloses something personal, try to disclose something equally as personal.
> 
>   * Be positive so that the other person knows you appreciate their time spent talking with you.
> 
>   * Regulating the flow of conversation by using pauses to speak up, and once you’ve made your point inviting the other person to respond.

### Don’t Use Threats

The authors urge you to **be aware of your motives when relaying natural consequences.** If your intent is to threaten or intimidate the other person into doing what you want, they will likely react negatively.

(Shortform note: Experts explain that threatening the other person is ultimately a play for power that occurs when we fear our requests won’t be met. These threats can cause hurt and resentment within the relationship that can take weeks or months to heal. Psychologists recommend that when we feel tempted to make threats, this is an indication that we need to take a time-out from the conversation to cool down, and finish the discussion at a later time.)

### Stop Talking When the Other Person Understands

**When you believe you’ve reached a point where the other person understands the natural consequences and will comply, you can stop piling on more consequences**. This may make the other person feel patronized, belittled, or discourage them from wanting to participate in future conversations.

(Shortform note: To avoid excessively talking when the conversation has reached a natural close, we should actively listen to the other person, absorbing everything they say _before_ considering our response. Experts explain that one of the reasons why we keep talking when the conversation should end is because we’re hearing rather than listening. When we’re _hearing_ the other person, we’re not fully absorbing what they’re saying because we’re so caught up in our own thoughts. Doing so can prevent us from realizing when the other person has understood our point and agreed. So, to stop talking once the other person has complied, turn up your active listening skills.)
