## Exercise: Create a Plan

When you’ve finally finished the conversation, you must make a plan of action and set a time to follow up to ensure that commitments are followed through on. How you approach the follow-up, though, depends on the situation.

* * *

Think of a recent accountability problem you’re having with an employee, coworker, or someone in your personal life. How has this person been failing to meet your expectations? For example, maybe you’ve noticed lately that a coworker, who usually does a great job, has been overlooking details and thus adding to your responsibilities, as you’re the one who then has to catch these details.

What would your plan of action look like to solve the problem? Be sure to identify the _who, what,_ and _when_ of your plan.

Now consider how you might follow up on your action plan. Think about the factors discussed above—how reliable and experienced is the other person? What is their track-record on following through with commitments? How complicated is your request? Are there any deadlines involved?
