## Shortform Introduction

Accountability conversations are the crucial and complicated discussions we have when someone breaks a promise, violates a commitment, behaves badly, or otherwise fails to meet our expectations. If we don't manage these conversations effectively, our personal and professional relationships can suffer and even collapse. _Crucial Accountability_ was written to address these problems, offering a step-by-step guide that teaches people how to effectively plan, execute, and follow up on accountability discussions so they can maintain healthy relationships and effective organizations.

### The Book’s Publication

_Crucial Accountability _was published in 2013 by McGraw Hill Education and is the second edition of the original title _Crucial Confrontations,_ first published in 2004. The book is part of Crucial Learning’s two-book series and follows _Crucial Conversations,_ published in 2002. _Crucial Conversations_ , the first book in the series, provides readers with tools and techniques to handle stressful conversations (referred to by the authors as “crucial conversations”). One of the types of crucial conversations addressed in the book is the accountability conversation. Because accountability is so crucial for healthy relationships and effective organizations, the authors chose to go in-depth on this topic in the second book of the series, _Crucial Accountability_.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical and Intellectual Context

While _Crucial Accountability_ followed _Crucial Conversations,_ as well as a few other communication-based self-help books like _Emotional Intelligence_(1995) and _Difficult Conversations_(1999), it was revolutionary for its time in that it was one of the first books to put scientific research into an easily accessible, readable, and applicable text. Before 1995, the majority of interpersonal communication research was published in scholarly journals, making it difficult for the average person to access, let alone understand and apply.

The Crucial Learning series was at the forefront of the boom of communication-based self-help books. The book’s predecessors _Emotional Intelligence_ and _Difficult Conversations _respectively __ explain that we should learn to control our emotions and detail how to do this in different types of difficult conversations. The Crucial Learning series builds upon these insights by providing new and groundbreaking research—the authors assert that humans tend to handle these situations improperly by default, and the result of this inability can ruin our relationships.

Furthermore, _Crucial Conversations_ adds to the list of hard conversations from _Difficult Conversations_ , goes into more depth on why we mishandle them, and explores what we can do instead. _Crucial Accountability_ goes into the most detail yet,__ delving into the topic even further by focusing on a specific kind of crucial skill that hasn’t yet been discussed in a self-help book: holding others accountable for their behavioral failures. The authors explain why holding others accountable is vitally important to our relationships and organizations, why people fail to do this, and how we can effectively master the skill. Furthermore, the authors base their claims on years of their own research gathered from observing and interviewing leaders across a wide range of organizations.

While communication-based self-help books were few and far between before _Crucial Accountability,_ the genre took off after the book’s release in 2004.

#### The Book’s Impact

_Crucial Accountability_ rose to the No. 8 spot on the _New York Times_ Business best-seller list, No. 6 on the _Wall Street Journal_ best-seller list, No. 1 on Amazon’s Business List, No. 1 on 800-CEO-READ, and won “Book of the Year” from Soundview Executive Book Summaries.

The book was one of the first to convey scientific research in terms that were easily understandable and applicable to the general public. Nearly 1 million copies have been sold thus far, and due to the rapid success of the Crucial Learning series, the authors turned both _Crucial Conversations_ and _Crucial Accountability_ into a hands-on learning course offered both virtually and in person with live teachers. The course has been adopted by Fortune 500 companies and individuals alike.

Since the publication of _Crucial Accountability_ , the demand for communication-focused self-help books has boomed. _B_ est-selling books like _Creating the Accountable Organization _(2006) by Mark Samuel, _The Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Workbook _(2007) by Matthew McKay, _Just Listen _(2009) by Mark Goulston, _Never Split the Difference _(2016) by Chris Voss and Tahl Raz, _Principles _(2017) by Ray Dalio, and many more all built upon the insights of the book.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Crucial Accountability_ was well received and praised by critical reviewers like _The New York Times, Wall Street Journal,_ numerous Fortune 500 companies, and best-selling authors like Steven Covey of _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People._

Many people appreciated the book’s advice on common mistakes people make, why they make these mistakes, how to avoid them, and what to do instead.

On the other hand, a number of reviewers critiqued the book’s organization and structure. They noted that although the data was great, it was difficult to follow the arguments because they were masked by too much fluff and story-telling. Furthermore, the book tends to jump from idea to idea rather than completing an argument before moving on to the next one. These comments were a consensus among critics and the general public alike.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization and Approach

The chapter-by-chapter organization of _Crucial Accountability_ is straightforward: Each chapter maps out one of the steps needed to have an effective accountability conversation. As a whole, the chapters are categorized into three parts: what to do before an accountability conversation, what to do during the conversation, and what to do after.

The authors __ make their arguments by supporting them with primary research and examples. At the start of each chapter, the authors clearly state their argument and then use a story to convey their point.

However, their arguments are sometimes buried within chapters, making it difficult to understand what the authors want us to do and when. They tend to meander back and forth from one suggestion to the next while referencing examples, research, and suggestions of what _not_ to do. While this information is all helpful in proving their point and illustrating their suggestions, it distracts from the logical flow of information and makes it difficult at times to pinpoint their advice on what _to_ do.

### Our Approach in This Guide

We’ve followed the book’s general organization in outlining the sequential steps detailing how to have an accountability discussion, as this is the most logical way to convey the information.

In doing so, however, we’ve isolated the authors’ recommendations from the examples and discussions that sometimes make it difficult to understand their advice. We include examples where they help in understanding the concept, and we reorganized slightly throughout to group similar concepts: For example, we pulled out all the authors’ recommendations of what _not_ to do and put them in their own section (Part 7).

Throughout the guide, we include commentary that links the author’s arguments and suggestions to widely accepted theories in interpersonal communication, management, and psychology, such as John Gottman’s “Four Horsemen of a Relational Apocalypse,” the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument’s five styles of conflict management, and other widely accepted concepts like “gunnysacking” and “I” language.
