## Part 8: Making a Plan and Following Up

After you’ve successfully discussed the accountability issue and determined a solution, the authors recommend creating a plan of action and then following up to ensure that everyone follows the agreed-upon plan.

While this step seems pretty straightforward, don’t underestimate its importance; leaving the plan of action and follow-up vague could undermine the hard work and planning you put into preparing for the conversation and developing a solution.

### Determining Who Does What and When

**The first part of creating a plan of action is identifying the specific tasks that need to be completed, who needs to do them, and when they need to be done.** For example, if the agreement is that the other person will work on being more creative, you might say: “I want _you_ to come up with _three new ideas_ for how to market our product _each week by noon on Friday_.”

The authors especially emphasize the importance of being clear about _who_ will complete each task. Avoid using vague statements like “ _let's_ come up with three new ideas.” Terms like “let’s” and “we” undermine accountability. If one person is required to complete the task, make it clear that they are the one responsible.

They also advise that you be specific when naming deadlines. Statements like “complete it by next week” or even “by the _end_ of next week” are too vague. Set an exact date and time: “Please have it done by Friday at noon.” This removes any room for misinterpretation.

Once it’s clear what needs to be done, who needs to do it, and when, check for understanding—ask if there are any questions about specifics such as quality, quantity, characteristics, or anything else the other person might be confused about.

(Shortform note: Experts second the authors’ argument here, explaining that the three things necessary for an employee to effectively complete a task are clear goals, detailed parameters, and accurate deadlines. No matter how self-sufficient, responsible, or hard-working someone is, they can’t effectively meet expectations without certain structures and boundaries.)

### Following Up

**After determining the plan of action, the authors assert that you must determine when and how to follow up on the results.** While you don't want to make the other person feel micromanaged, you also don’t want to take an entirely hands-off approach. To determine how soon after the conversation you need to follow up and the appropriate frequency and method, consider the following questions:

**1) How important or risky is the task:** If the task is very important or complicated, you should closely monitor the situation by following up soon after the discussion.

**2) Can you trust that they will perform the task well?** If the other person has not proved reliable or has little experience, you may need multiple follow-ups throughout the process to check on their progress.

However**, i** f the other person has a fairly good track record or they’re experienced in the area, your follow-up approach can be less aggressive. Rather than planning an exclusive meeting, you can follow up during a routine interaction, for example. Furthermore, if the task is routine and the person is reliable, you can have _them_ initiate the follow-up. For example: “when you’ve completed the outline for the project, send me a message and we’ll schedule a time to meet.”

> **How to Know if You’re Micromanaging**
> 
> The author's recommendations in this section are aimed at effectively following up without micromanaging. However, even if we don’t intend to micromanage, we might not _realize_ when we’re doing it. People who micromanage are likely to follow up on accountability issues too aggressively because regardless of how simple the task is or how trustworthy the other person is, they hold the underlying persistent belief that they’re the only ones who can complete the task perfectly.
> 
> Experts explain that the following behaviors are manifestations of this underlying belief and indicate that you might be a micromanager:
> 
>   * You don’t like to delegate work to other people because you do it best yourself.
> 
>   * You always ask employees to check with you before making a decision.
> 
>   * You prefer to be CC’d on every email.
> 
>   * You have a high employee turnover.
> 
>   * You’re rarely satisfied with deliverables.
> 
>   * Most of your employees have a hard time meeting deadlines.
> 
>   * You want everything done following rigid guidelines with no room for creativity.
> 
>   * You're constantly focused on the efficiency of employees and want to know what they’re working on and when.
> 
>   * You frequently re-do or majorly edit an employee's work.
> 
>   * You tend to think that employees rarely take initiative or be creative.
> 
> 

> 
> If you recognize yourself frequently enacting more than one or two of these behaviors, consider that you might not be accurately assessing the risk of the task at hand, the other person's responsibility, and their capability.
