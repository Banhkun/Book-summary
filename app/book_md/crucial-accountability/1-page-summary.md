## 1-Page Summary

**Accountability conversations are the discussions we have when someone breaks a promise, violates a commitment, behaves badly, or fails to meet our expectations.** These conversations are important because without them, our relationship with the other person could end up permanently damaged. Unfortunately, people tend to handle these conversations incorrectly—or not have them at all. In _Crucial Accountability_ ,__ communication and management experts Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, David Maxfield, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler explain how we can effectively have these conversations to solve the issues at hand while preserving our relationship with the other person.

### Why Accountability Conversations Are Crucial

**Holding others accountable is a crucial skill because if we handle our issues incorrectly or not at all, we may experience negative consequences.** If we neglect the issue and remain silent, we could permanently damage our relationship with the other person by developing toxic communication and passive-aggressive behaviors. If we bring up the issue and handle it improperly, we could risk offending the other person, thereby damaging our relationship and reputation with them. In either case, if we fail to bring up the issue or do so incorrectly, we allow the issue to continue and possibly get worse.

(Shortform note: In _12 Rules of Life, _psychologist Jordan Peterson corroborates the authors’ argument that you must plan a crucial discussion to effectively execute it. He explains that if we communicate our interpersonal conflicts without planning ahead, we risk inciting emotional reactions from the other person such as resentment, jealousy, frustration, and even hatred. Like the authors of _Crucial Accountability_ , Peterson notes that if we ignore an issue because we fear these emotional reactions, we may end up creating more negative consequences, such as building up negative emotions and allowing the issue to persist. Either way, these outcomes will damage our relationship with the other person.)

Consequently, the authors wrote _Crucial Accountability_ to help bosses, employees, parents, friends, and others effectively handle these conversations. They have written several best-selling books on communication, performance, and leadership skills and have created a leadership training company, Crucial Learning, that offers supplemental courses. Overall, they refer to these fundamentals as “crucial skills.” _Crucial Accountability_ hones in on one of these crucial skills—holding others accountable.

**_Crucial Accountability_ is a step-by-step guide that teaches us how to properly prepare for, execute, and follow up on our accountability conversations.** As an added bonus, the authors discuss a few exceptional situations that may require a slightly different approach from the steps in their guide, and advise us on how to handle these situations.

### Preparing for the Discussion

The authors explain that to prepare for your discussion, you first need to identify the _key issue_ at the root of the accountability grievance and then determine whether or not you should discuss it. You also need to avoid making assumptions by trying to see the issue from the other person’s perspective.

#### Identify the Key Issue

**The first step to an accountability conversation is identifying the key issue and then determining whether or not it’s worth bringing up**. The authors explain that accountability grievances usually come in bundles; instead of just one problem, there are often a whole host of issues that make up the grievance**.** However,**** there is usually one _key issue_ at the root of the grievance—the underlying problem causing all the other issues. When the key issue is identified and solved, the other issues will likely be resolved as well.

If we don’t pinpoint the underlying problem, we could end up addressing the wrong issue or addressing too many issues at once, neither of which will solve the problem.

> **Avoid Gunnysacking**
> 
> Sometimes when trying to identify the key issue, you’ll end up with more than one fundamental issue that’s bothering you. This may be because you’re actually dealing with _several_ key issues that are independent of each other rather than linked to a single accountability grievance—in other words, an older set of issues that you’ve harbored over time.
> 
> Harboring small resentments over time is called gunnysacking and can severely damage or even end your relationship. To address this kind of problem, you’ll need to have multiple conversations so each individual key issue can be discussed and addressed.

#### Determine Whether or Not to Address the Issue

**The second step is deciding whether the issue is worth bringing up.** The authors explain that sometimes, the issue we’re upset about doesn’t warrant an accountability conversation. They explain that the purpose of holding an accountability conversation should be to maintain a positive and productive relationship with the other person. If your intent for the conversation doesn’t match this definition, or having the discussion won’t achieve this goal, you should probably cope or get over the issue rather than bringing it up.

For example, if you want to have an accountability conversation because your adult daughter dyed her hair, this probably isn’t a valid issue—your _intent_ for the discussion isn’t to improve your relationship or its productivity—rather, it’s to impose your worldview on her. And, the consequences of the discussion will neither improve your relationship nor resolve the problem—instead, it will probably make both of them worse.

> **How to Get Over an Unjustified Accountability Issue**
> 
> In a situation where the accountability conversation isn’t justified, the authors instruct us to cope or get over the issue; however, they don’t specify how to do this. Experts explain that if we don’t address an issue but are still upset about it, it can seriously damage our relationship with the other person.
> 
> In _Difficult Conversations_ , Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen explain that when we find ourselves in one of these situations, we can help get over the issue by:
> 
>   * Releasing the negative feelings we have about the situation, the other person, or ourselves.
> 
>   * Telling ourselves a different story to explain what happened. For example, your daughter isn’t irresponsible because she dyed her hair—rather she’s expressive, creative, and proud of her identity.
> 
>   * Accepting who we were when we got upset and who we are now, after the fact. We may not be able to control our initial reaction to a situation; however, after reflecting, we’re in a different mindset and can recognize that our previous impulses weren’t justified.
> 
> 


**The authors argue, however, that more often than not, an accountability conversation is justified but people remain silent.** The most common reasons people choose silence are:

  1. **They downplay the costs of silence.** When people ignore an issue, they often tell themselves that nothing bad will happen. However, if we ignore a problem, it will usually continue, will often get worse, and can even create _new_ problems, like damaging the relationship.
  2. **They exaggerate the risks of speaking up.** People tend to imagine extreme consequences, such as the other person becoming aggressive. However, these consequences are less likely to occur than people fear. 
  3. **They believe they’re helpless in solving the issue.** If people have had failed accountability conversations in the past, or grew up in a household where accountability wasn’t discussed or handled well, they’re likely to have the underlying belief that nothing they can do will resolve the problem, so they might as well not try.



Either way, the authors contend that none of these are valid reasons to remain silent. If you find yourself justifying silence with one of them, it probably means you need to speak up.

> **Why Staying Silent Can Destroy Your Relationship**
> 
> The authors warn that staying silent can be devastating for our relationships. Some experts argue that harboring unresolved issues can cause _contempt_ —feelings of resentment and a lack of respect for the other person—which psychologists recognize as a key factor in the destruction of relationships.
> 
> Thus, if we remain silent on an issue that should be addressed—even if we do so in an attempt to preserve a relationship—as the authors’ three reasons above generally indicate—we could unintentionally sabotage our relationship.

#### Consider the Other Person’s Point of View

**The third step is seeing the issue from the other person's point of view to avoid entering the conversation with negative assumptions**. It’s human nature to make negative assumptions about why the other person did what they did and to not consider outside factors that might have impacted their decision. The authors explain that this is called the _fundamental attribution error_ , which holds that when we’re the ones who make a mistake, we justify our actions in some way, but when another person messes up, we attribute the mistake to a flaw in their character.

(Shortform note: In _A New Earth, _Eckhart Tolle explains that the fundamental attribution error is a result of our ego. The ego constantly seeks to inflate our self image by deflating the image of others. When other people make mistakes and we automatically assume it’s because they are flawed, the assumption inflates our ego by making us feel better than them. By understanding why the fundamental attribution error happens, we can better avoid falling into its trap and more effectively see both sides of an issue.)

### Executing the Accountability Conversation

The authors then move from _preparing for_ the conversation to _having_ the conversation.

To effectively execute our discussion, we need to bring up the issue in a way that makes the other person feel safe, work with them to identify barriers and solutions, handle any new issues that arise during the conversation, and be aware of behaviors to _avoid_.

#### Establishing Mutual Respect and Shared Purpose

**The fourth step is addressing the issue in a way that establishes mutual respect and a shared purpose with the other person.** In other words, vocalize the issue while letting the other person know through your words, tone, and body language that you respect them and want to improve your relationship—which will benefit both parties.

To do this, explain the issue succinctly: Express your expectations and how the other person failed to meet them. Then, invite them to respond. Throughout the conversation, watch for signs that the other person is feeling unsafe and re-establish safety when necessary (either by clarifying your respect or shared purpose).

(Shortform note: If you fail to establish mutual respect, a shared purpose, or explain the issue succinctly, the other person is likely to feel overwhelmed and stifled. The most common reaction to these negative emotions is to _stonewall_ —to tune the speaker out by ignoring them, acting busy, turning away, or engaging in obsessive behaviors. Stonewalling could permanently damage or end a relationship. You can avoid this consequence by following the authors’ suggestions: Be succinct, be respectful, and establish a mutual purpose.)

#### Addressing Motivational and Ability-Based Barriers

Once you’ve vocalized the issue, the fifth step is to address any barriers that might be preventing the other person from completing their task. The authors point to two kinds of barriers you need to consider: motivational barriers and ability-based barriers.

**If you think the barrier is motivational, explain the negative consequences of the accountability issue to the other person**. If they see why meeting your expectation is important, and what bad things might happen if they don't, they’re more likely to become intrinsically motivated to meet expectations long-term.

(Shortform note: In _Drive_ , Daniel Pink seconds the authors’ argument, explaining that relaying negative consequences to the other person is the most effective strategy because it increases motivation. On the other hand, positive consequences, like rewards, decrease intrinsic motivation, quality of work, and creativity. So to most effectively motivate the other person to _want_ to complete a task, explain to them the negative consequences that will happen if they fail to do so.)

**If you think the barrier is ability-based, do your best to make the task possible and easy for the other person. W** ork with them to identify whether the root cause of the ability barrier is personal, social, or structural. Once we have this information, we can determine the best strategy to remove the barrier.

If the ability barrier is _personal_ , the other person lacks the internal resources to complete the task, such as knowledge, skill, or experience. If the ability barrier is _social_ , the other person is unable to complete the task because of another person—they may be waiting for someone to pass on resources necessary to complete the job. If the ability barrier is s _tructural,_ the other person is unable to complete the task due to an environmental factor, such as a distracting or uncomfortable work environment.

(Shortform note: You may have difficulty identifying an ability barrier if the other person is resistant to exposing their or others’ shortcomings or simply doesn't know what the barrier is. Luckily, even if the other person refuses to or can’t explicitly state what the barrier is, psychologists explain that we can identify the root cause by focusing on the phrases they use to describe the issue. Phrases such as “I’m trying,” “I don’t understand,” and “I thought” indicate that the root barrier is internal or personal. Phrases like “I’m waiting for,” “I’m stuck at this step,” “I need,” or “I don’t have enough time” can indicate that the root barrier is external—either social or structural.)

The authors encourage you to i**nvolve the other person in this process** because the other person is closest to the issue and will be best able to identify the barriers and figure out how to solve them. Furthermore, when you actively involve the other person in the process, they’ll be more motivated to follow through.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that the best way to solve conflict is by collaborating with the other person to identify solutions. The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Model Instrument explains that a collaborator is someone who approaches conflict by being both assertive and cooperative, and by working with others to identify problems and solutions. Many psychologists agree that this is the ideal strategy because it indicates that the initiator has a high concern for both self and others, allowing all parties to get what they want while minimizing negative feelings.)

#### Handling New Issues That Arise

**The sixth step, the authors explain, is to deal with new, urgent issues that may arise during our conversation.** When new, urgent issues arise, such as the other person lying or expressing a different problem, they need to be dealt with immediately.

To deal with emerging issues:

  1. Bookmark the conversation by acknowledging the new issue. 
  2. Identify the problem. In doing so, refrain from making assumptions and try to see the other person’s perspective. 
  3. Describe the gap between your expectations and the reality of the situation. (If the other person brought up a new issue, explain what you understand about _their_ expectations and what _you_ did to break them.) 
  4. Seek a commitment that the issue won’t happen again. 



Once you've gone through these steps, you can return to the original discussion.

> In _Thanks for the Feedback_ , Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen explain that sometimes when an urgent issue arises, you should finish the original discussion and schedule a later time to discuss the new issue rather than addressing it immediately. This is because sometimes, the other person might bring up a new issue as a distraction tactic to avoid accountability. Stone and Heen call this practice _switchtracking_. They warn that if you pivot the conversation to this new issue, you may end up derailing the conversation and falling into the other person’s trap—to prevent you from holding them accountable. When this happens, Stone and Heen recommend that you:
> 
>   * Verbally acknowledge that there are two separate issues at hand.
> 
>   * Acknowledge that both issues need to be addressed.
> 
>   * Set aside a separate time to talk about the new issue _after_ you’ve finished the original discussion.
> 
> 


#### What NOT to Do While Discussing Accountability

**Now that we know how to effectively have an accountability conversation and handle emerging issues, the seventh step is to look at some behaviors we should _avoid._** The authors explain that the following list of behaviors should be avoided at all costs r to maintain a safe environment, preserve our relationship with the other person, and effectively solve the problem:

**1.** Don’t propose solutions until you’ve listened to what the other person has to say—they’re closer to the issue than you and probably have insights that you don't.

(Shortform note: Experts explain that when we enter a conversation with the belief that we fully understand the problem and how to solve it, it becomes difficult to truly listen to the other person and sends the message that we don’t think they’re capable of solving the issue.)

**2.** Don’t propose solutions and _then_ ask their opinions—this can bias their response and stifle their good ideas and genuine input.

(Shortform note: This practice is called asking with leading questions: questions that lead or persuade the other person to give a certain response. When you ask a leading question, it's unlikely that you’ll receive the other person’s genuine, unbiased response. Avoid this if you truly want to hear the other person’s opinions and the best possible solutions.)

**3.** Don’t enter the conversation with a solution in mind and then try and get the other person to guess what you’re thinking—if you ask the other person for their ideas disingenuously when you already have a solution in mind, you come off as disrespectful and manipulative.

(Shortform note: Some experts describe this type of questioning as “GWOMMing,” or making others “Guess What's On My Mind.” This can cause the other person to perceive you as disingenuous or dishonest, and they might hold back their feedback or become resentful.)

**4.** Don’t cut things short—the more dialogue there is between you and the other person, the more likely you are to understand the issue and develop an effective solution.

(Shortform note:****Experts suggest that we can have a successful and rewarding conversation by making sure the conversation is 50/50, using effective and active listening skills, engaging in reciprocal disclosure (when they relate a personal fact, relate one back to them), remaining positive, waiting for the other person to pause before responding, and inviting them to respond when you’re done.)

**5.** Don’t turn consequences into threats—there’s a big difference between explaining the natural consequences of someone’s behavior and threatening them with the consequences. Remember that your goal is to _inform_ them of things they might not have known, not to _scare_ them into submission.

(Shortform note: Experts explain that threatening the other person is ultimately a play for power that occurs when we fear our requests won’t be met. These threats can cause hurt and resentment within the relationship that can take weeks or months to heal. Psychologists recommend that when we feel tempted to make threats, this is an indication that we need to take a time-out from the conversation to cool down and finish the discussion at a later time.)

**6.** Don’t make the conversation unnecessarily long—once the other person has complied, there’s no need to continue explaining consequences and dragging out the issue.

(Shortform note: Experts explain that one of the reasons we keep talking when the conversation should end is because we’re hearing rather than listening. When we’re _hearing_ the other person, we’re not fully absorbing what they’re saying because we’re so caught up in our own thoughts that we don’t realize when the other person has understood our point and complied. To stop talking once the other person has complied, turn up your active listening skills.)

### Following Up

**With the details of how to initiate and execute the conversation down, the last step is to effectively follow up on our chosen solution.**

First, we need to explain to the other person what needs to get done by identifying specifically _who_ does _what_ by _when_. Don’t leave any of these tactics up for interpretation or you may be disappointed with the results.

(Shortform note: Experts second the authors’ argument here, explaining that the three things necessary for an employee to effectively complete a task are clear goals, detailed parameters, and accurate deadlines. No matter how self-sufficient, responsible, or hard-working someone is, they can’t effectively meet expectations without certain structures and boundaries.)

Next, we need to determine the intensity, frequency, and type of follow-up. How soon and often will you check on results? Who will initiate the check-in? Does it need to be during a private meeting or a routine interaction? The authors explain that there are a few factors to consider when making these decisions: how reliable the person is, how experienced they are in the area, how difficult the task is, and how crucial the task is.

(Shortform note: The authors explain that our follow-up will depend on the person and the circumstances—we want to give them as much responsibility as they can handle so we don’t become micromanagers. However, micromanagers usually don’t realize that they’re micromanaging because of their subconscious lack of trust in other people’s abilities. Experts explain that you might be a micromanager if you do the following: You don’t like delegating difficult tasks because you’ll do it best, you require employees to check in before making decisions, you’re rarely satisfied with deliverables, you find yourself constantly making changes to others’ work, and you’re obsessed with efficiency and knowing who’s working and when.)
