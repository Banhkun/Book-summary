## Exercise: Understand the Other Person’s Story

When someone breaks a promise or otherwise fails to meet our expectations, we’re quick to become angry and blame the other person’s character for their bad behavior. In reality, the other person might not have broken the promise because they don’t care about you, but because something was preventing them.

* * *

Consider an accountability issue you’re currently dealing with. Think about how upset it makes you. Using these negative emotions as fuel, what are your immediate assumptions about why this person failed to meet your expectations?

Now, imagine that the other person is the most honest, trustworthy, and upstanding person you know. Why might this amazing person have failed to meet your expectations? What personal, social, or structural factors might have impacted their motivation or ability to meet your expectations?

Based on your last response, do you think your initial emotional assumption about the person’s behavior was fair or unfair? Does this change how you feel about the other person and the accountability issue? If so, how?
