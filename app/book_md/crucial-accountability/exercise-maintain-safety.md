## Exercise: Maintain Safety

Sometimes when we’re in the heat of a conversation, we miss signs that the other person might be feeling unsafe. In order to have an effective conversation, we need to be able to identify these signs and restore safety as quickly as possible.

* * *

Think about an accountability conversation you’ve had in the past that ended badly because the conversation lacked safety—the other person felt attacked or uncomfortable. What behaviors was the other person exhibiting that hinted that they felt unsafe?

Why do you think the other person felt unsafe? Was it due to a lack of mutual respect or a lack of mutual purpose? What indicators make you believe so?

Now that you’ve identified why the other person felt unsafe, what strategy could you have used to reestablish safety? What would you have said?
