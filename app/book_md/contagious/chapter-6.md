## Chapter 6: Tell People a Story

The final attribute of contagious products or ideas is that **their marketing materials tell people a story**. Information about the product or idea is subtly woven into a gripping narrative that grabs people’s attention. For example, you could embed factual information about your product into a heartwarming story about how using it changed someone’s life. If your story is interesting or exciting enough, people will retell it to their friends and family—and they’ll pass on information about your product or idea in the process.

People pass on interesting stories about products or ideas for two reasons. First, they know that telling someone an interesting story will give them social currency—that telling it will make them seem interesting, too.

Second,**sharing a story about a product or idea is much more socially acceptable than simply spouting facts about it**. If you approached someone and, totally out of context, started listing the specifications and functions of a product that you really liked, the other person would find you boring at best and strange at worst. Whatever the case, you’re going to lose social currency. Meanwhile, embedding these specifications and functions in a story puts them back into context, making the fact you’ve brought them up a little bit less bizarre. Likewise, as long as the story is interesting, you’ll preserve your social currency.

### Example: Subway’s Low-Fat Sandwiches

Subway’s menu offers several sandwiches that contain fewer than six grams of fat. Imagine you’ve just found out about this healthy fast-food option and want to tell others about your intriguing discovery. If you went up to someone and started suddenly listing the nutritional facts and figures about these sandwiches, people would be confused and probably a bit bored.

Conversely, if you embedded these facts and figures into the story of Jared Fogle, a man who lost nearly 250 pounds by eating nothing but healthy Subway sandwiches, people are going to be interested. This is a compelling story about a man who did something remarkable. The story may well include dry nutritional information about the low fat content of the sandwiches Jared ate. However, because this data is woven into a narrative, discussing it is more socially acceptable.

By including this information about Subway sandwiches in a story, you’ve made it much more shareable. People are more likely to pass on the information now that it’s part of a narrative. In many ways, you’ve inadvertently done Subway a favor. You’ve helped them generate word of mouth about their low-fat sandwiches. You wouldn’t have done so if you’d stuck to the “spouting facts” approach.

### Telling the Right Kind of Story

It’s important to note that you can’t just incorporate information about your product or idea into _any_ story and expect that story to automatically generate word of mouth. You need to tell the _right kind_ of story: one that’s actually effective at getting people talking about your product or idea.

Effective stories have two main attributes:

  1. They factor in some of the other principles of creating contagious content: specifically, giving social currency, generating emotions, and providing practical value.
  2. They force people to share the “right” parts of the narrative—the parts that mention your product or idea. People can’t leave this information out when they retell the tale.



#### Giving Stories Social Currency, Emotions, and Practical Value

As you’ve learned, things that give people social currency, inspire high-arousal emotions, and offer some practical value are more likely to be talked about. Therefore, **if your story has these attributes, it’s more likely to be passed on**.

For example, imagine you’re trying to market a new energy bar. You decide to come up with a story for your marketing materials in which a man is in a rush to get to work and doesn’t have time for breakfast. He decides to eat your energy bar at his desk. You tell consumers that doing so leaves the man full until lunchtime, but don’t explain the “why”: for instance, the nutritional content of the bar that makes it so filling.

This story doesn’t really give social currency. It’s not remarkable because it’s a fairly ordinary, everyday scenario. It’s also arguably quite boring. Because of this, it fails to inspire any high-arousal emotions. Finally, it doesn’t provide the consumer with much practical information. All of these factors mean that people are unlikely to pay much attention to or even remember your story, making it equally unlikely that they’ll pass it on.

In contrast, you could tell a story about a man who’s in the process of climbing Mount Everest. His energy levels are depleting, so he decides to snack on your company’s energy bar. The man is revitalized because of the numerous nutritional benefits of the bar. You make sure to mention these benefits in your ad. He continues his trek up the mountain, eventually reaching the summit.

This story is much more remarkable—climbing Mount Everest is a pretty impressive feat. Therefore, telling the story provides more social currency. Climbing Everest is also pretty awe-inspiring. In this way, your ad generates a high-arousal emotion. Finally, you’ve made sure to include some information about the nutritional value of the bar in your ad, giving it some practical value.

#### Making People Share the “Right” Part of Your Story

For your story to be effective, **people need to pass on the “right” part of it** : the part that contains information about your product or idea. Unfortunately, it’s not always guaranteed that they will.

Research has shown that when people retell a story, they only pass on information that they consider to be absolutely integral to the story. This means that once a story has been passed along five or six times, around 70% of the information that was originally included in it is lost. If the information about your product or idea is part of that 70%, you’ll fail to generate word of mouth. **People may keep telling the story, but they won’t talk about your product or idea when they do.**

A famous example of this problem in action is Ron Bensimhon’s publicity stunt at the Athens 2004 Olympics. Bensimhon, a notorious streaker, jumped off the Olympic diving board and belly-flopped into the pool, wearing nothing but a tutu and a pair of tights. He also had the name of an online casino, GoldenPalace.com, written on his chest.

You might think that this stunt would generate lots of word of mouth for GoldenPalace.com: that lots of people would talk about the stunt and would mention the involvement of the website in the process. (Note: for the record, GoldenPalace.com claimed they had nothing to do with the incident and didn’t ask Bensimhon to mention them in the stunt.) But, this didn’t happen. The fact that Bensimhon had the website written on his chest was a detail that, compared to the rest of this bizarre tale, was pretty uninteresting and could be left out. People talked about Bensimhon’s tutu and tights, the fact he was arrested, and the fact that security was apparently lax enough at the Olympics for him to break in. However, they didn’t mention the website.

To avoid this issue, **ensure that your product or idea is so crucial to the narrative’s progression that people can’t leave it out when they retell the tale**. If they were to do so, the story would become completely nonsensical. Follow the example of the Egyptian dairy firm Panda, which masterfully put this principle into action in a series of TV spots.

One of Panda’s commercials tells the story of a father and his young son doing their grocery shopping. When the pair comes across some Panda cheese, the son asks the father if they can buy some, but the father says no. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a man dressed in a giant panda costume appears. He wreaks havoc, flipping over the family’s shopping cart and kicking the food that’s spilled onto the floor. He does so as revenge for the family not buying Panda products.

This story is effective because you can’t tell it without mentioning the presence of the man in the panda costume. Likewise, you can’t explain why the man in the panda costume is there without adding the context that the brand name is Panda. If you fail to do this, the ad makes no sense. People will question why a panda-costume-adorned man would turn up in a supermarket. In short, you can’t recount the story of this commercial without spreading word of mouth about the company that created it.
