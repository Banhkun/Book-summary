## Chapter 3: Generate an Emotional Response

The third attribute of contagious products and ideas is that they **generate an emotional response**. When people experience strong emotions, they often like to talk to others about how they’re feeling. For instance, someone who’s had a bad day at work will want to go home and vent their anger to their family. Someone who’s just gotten promoted will want to share their excitement with their loved ones.

When people do this, they inevitably share all the details about what made them so emotional in the first place. So, if you can make your product or idea generate an emotional response in people, it may get them talking not only about their feelings but also about your product or idea itself.

### Which Emotions Should You Generate?

An important caveat to this principle is that **not all emotions are equally effective at getting people to discuss your product or idea**. Berger’s research found that only emotions that generate high amounts of physiological arousal push people to talk about how they’re feeling.

Physiological arousal is, in simple terms, your body being “activated”—being readied for action. Signs of physiological arousal include a racing heart, tensed muscles, sweaty palms, and a general feeling of your senses being heightened.

In the early days of the human race, physiological arousal readied us for the body’s fight-or-flight response. It prepared us to either run from predators or attack prey. These days, the responses that physiological arousal triggers are somewhat less life-or-death. When people are highly physiologically aroused, they may jump up and down on the spot, pace back and forth, or fidget.

Crucially, **highly physiologically aroused people also tend to rush to tell others about the source of their arousal** —the thing that’s got them so fired up. Therefore, if you can make your product or idea a source of high physiological arousal, you’ll get people talking about it and generate word of mouth.

So, which emotions generate high physiological arousal, and which don’t? According to Jonah Berger, the five main high-arousal emotions are anger, anxiety, awe, amusement, and excitement. These are the emotions to incorporate into your marketing plan.

Meanwhile, low-arousal emotions include sadness and contentment. These emotions discourage action rather than drive it. For instance, sadness tends to de-energize the body. It makes people want to stay put on the couch and wallow, not rush about telling people about the source of their sadness. Likewise, contentment has a relaxing effect on the body. It makes people’s blood pressure go down and their heart rate decrease. People often want to relish this feeling of relaxation, not cut it short by snapping into action again.

#### Example: Denise Grady’s Viral _New York Times_ Article

Over ten years, Denise Grady had written numerous articles about science for the New York Times. Her articles had always been popular but had never become truly “contagious”—until October 27, 2008, when one of her pieces went viral.

The viral piece appeared to be quite dry. It was about fluid dynamics: specifically, how you can use a certain type of photography to capture an image of the airflow that’s released by a human cough. It was a technical article that discussed complex scientific techniques. However, it spread like wildfire among the general population.

The reason behind this article’s virality was the photo that accompanied it. It was an image of a person coughing captured using the technology Grady discussed and showed a huge, visible plume of air emanating from the person’s mouth. The photo was striking. It made people feel awed.

As awe is a high-arousal emotion, the readers of the article were driven into a state of action by what they’d seen. The action they chose was sharing the article with everyone they knew, thus making the piece go viral.

### Adding Emotion to Your Product or Idea

You’ve learned which emotions will drive people to discuss your product or idea. Now, it’s time to explore how you can make your product or idea inspire these high-arousal emotions. The key to doing this is **devising a feelings-based marketing strategy**.

A lot of marketing strategies focus too much on information: on telling the consumer everything they need to know about the product or idea. Unfortunately, hearing lots of dry details about a product or concept is unlikely to inspire high-arousal emotions. It’s probably just going to bore people. Therefore, instead of bombarding consumers with information, give them the bare basics about your product or idea and focus the rest of your efforts on making them feel a high-arousal emotion.

You could try to make people feel angry. This is a common tactic when trying to generate word of mouth around a charitable, social, or political cause. For instance, imagine you’re trying to promote a charity that wants to tackle child poverty. In your marketing, you could include the stories of real-life families who’ve struggled to feed their children. At least some people will hear these stories and feel anger that families still struggle this way in the twenty-first century. Consequently, they’ll be more likely to spread the word about your cause.

Another possibility is to focus on adding humor to your brand’s slogan, TV ads, or radio spots. This will help you generate amusement in your potential customers. For instance, in 2008, Old Spice amused its customers by making its tagline “If your grandfather hadn’t worn it, you wouldn’t exist.”

#### Finding the Right Emotion to Use

What if you’re not sure which emotion to use in your marketing materials, or which emotion will be the most effective at generating interest in your product? How can you decide which emotion to use?

When answering this question, Jonah Berger takes his lead from Chip and Dan Heath and their work _Made to Stick_. The Heath brothers advise **repeatedly asking yourself why people might want to use your product or adopt your idea**. The first answer will likely be practical and related to the product or idea’s obvious purpose. But, keep digging deeper and deeper until you find the reason that’s emotion-driven. This will show you which feeling the product or idea ultimately relates to.

For example, why might people want to support your climate change initiative? The practical answer might be because they want to stop the ice caps from melting. However, _why_ do people want to stop the ice caps from melting? Because sea levels will rise, possibly flooding low-lying areas. Likewise, animals such as polar bears will lose their habitats. These prospects make people scared and angry. You’ve found the emotion-driven reason behind people supporting your campaign.

(Shortform note: For more on finding the right emotion to use in your marketing campaign, see our summary of Chip and Dan Heath’s Made to Stick.)

##### Capitalizing on Existing Physiological Arousal

If you’re really struggling to link your product or idea to a high-arousal emotion, **consider trying to capitalize on existing physiological arousal instead.** Make sure people see your product or hear about your idea when they’re _already_ physically aroused. It doesn’t matter if your product or idea isn’t the source of the person’s arousal. When they’re already in the aroused state, they’ll rush to talk about any product or idea that’s presented to them.

For example, consider placing ads for your product or idea near a gym. Berger’s research has shown that exercise is very effective at generating physiological arousal. So, if you can catch people just after a workout, they might transfer their arousal to your product or idea.

Another option is to place TV spots for your product or idea just after the really exciting part of a TV show—for instance, just after the part of a game show in which the contestant finds out if they’ve won. The excitement of the TV show will have already generated physiological arousal in the viewer, and you can capitalize on that.
