## Exercise: Generate Social Currency

Learn how to make a product a source of social currency.

* * *

Think of a time you tried to tell someone about a product—either a product you’re marketing yourself, or a product you’ve used—but they seemed uninterested in what you were saying. What was the product? Why do you think your discussion of it fell flat?

In your eyes, what makes this product remarkable? (For instance, does it do something you previously thought was impossible? Does it modify a tried and tested formula? Is it in some way mysterious or controversial?)

Does the product have any other attributes that could give it social currency? (For example, is it part of a reward system that leverages game mechanics? Is it somehow scarce or exclusive?)

Now that you’ve considered the product’s remarkability and other interesting attributes, do you think you’d gain social currency if you talked about it again? Why or why not?
