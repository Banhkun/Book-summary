## Exercise: Make Your Product Visible

Learn how to add visibility to your product or service.

* * *

Think of a product or service you’re selling (or would like to sell). How publicly visible do you consider this product or service to be? (For instance, is it easy for people to observe your customers using the product or service? Do people only tend to buy or use it in private?)

Now, brainstorm how you might make your product or service more visible (or visible at all). (For instance, could you make your product advertise itself by clearly displaying your branding? Could you find a way to make people’s private purchasing decisions public—for example, by sending them a publicly usable free gift alongside your product?)

Evaluate whether this method of increasing visibility has behavioral residue. Will it continue to make your product or service visible in the long term? If so, how? If not, how could you amend your approach to add behavioral residue?

After brainstorming, are you confident that you can add visibility to your product or service? Why or why not?
