## Exercise: Generate an Emotional Response

Learn how to get people talking about a product or idea by making them feel a high-arousal emotion.

* * *

Think of a product or idea that you’ve created or that you support. Describe this product or idea.

Imagine you had to create a marketing campaign about this product or idea. How could you incorporate a high-arousal emotion into this campaign? (For example, could you make your marketing materials amusing? If you’re trying to promote a cause, could you make your audience angry about the injustice you’re challenging?)

After brainstorming, do you feel confident that this marketing campaign would get other people talking about the product or idea? Why or why not?
