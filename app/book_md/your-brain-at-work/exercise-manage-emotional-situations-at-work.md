## Exercise: Manage Emotional Situations at Work

Rock provides options for responding to _away_ emotions. Before a stressful situation, you can avoid or modify the situation, or keep emotions out of it. During a stressful situation, you can express, suppress, or reinterpret negative emotions.

* * *

What is an event or task at work that elicits _away_ emotions (stress, anxiety, and so on)?

How might you prepare for that event or task in the future? Are there adjustments to the situation you can make ahead of time to lessen your stress response?

If you end up in that stressful situation again, how might you use Rockâ€™s techniques to lessen the negative feelings associated with it? How might you professionally express your emotions? Can you rethink your emotions to put a positive spin on them?
