## Exercise: Are You Spending Your Time Wisely?

Aarnio argues that a strong man avoids distracting pursuits like video games and pornography and instead spends his free time pursuing his passions so that he can eventually work on those passions full-time. In this exercise, you’ll evaluate whether you’re spending your time wisely.

* * *

Imagine your dream job. What would you love to get paid to do every day?

Name three skills you need to develop to have your dream job.

Recall how you spent all the free time you had last week. How many hours did you spend developing the skills above, and how many did you spend on distracting pastimes like masturbation or video games?

Write down one thing you can do differently in the coming week to spend more time developing the skills you need to achieve your dream. For example, if you want to develop your public speaking skills so you can achieve your dream of becoming a politician, you might plan to search for Toastmasters classes in your area.
