## Exercise: Apply the Ten Types of Innovation

In this exercise, you’ll consider how you could apply some of the principles from _The Ten Types of Innovation_ to your own projects.

* * *

Think of an innovation project you’ve recently worked on or are planning to work on either in business or personal life. Which of the ten types of innovation did it involve?

The authors assert that many innovation projects fail to have much of an impact because they focus on too few types of innovation. Besides the types of innovation you listed above, what additional type or types of innovation do you think would benefit your project the most, and why?

The authors also stress the importance of building prototypes to validate that your project is going in the right direction and identify problems or refinements as early as possible. What assumptions or aspects of your project do you think are most important to test with prototypes?

Briefly describe how you could build the simplest (or cheapest) prototype that would still allow you to test everything you listed above.
