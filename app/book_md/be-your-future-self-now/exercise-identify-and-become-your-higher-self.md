## Exercise: Identify and Become Your Higher Self

Hardy explains that the first step in reaching your full potential is creating a detailed vision of your higher self. Once you do so, you can determine what it will take to achieve this standard. In this exercise, we’ll walk through Hardy’s process so you can clearly identify your goals and how to reach them.

* * *

First, create a clear vision of your higher self by imagining your ideal life and recording the details below. For example, what job would you have? Where would you live? Would you have children? How would you spend your free time? Include as many details as possible.

Next, list the achievements you’d have to reach to make the details you identified in the previous question your reality. For example, would you have to attend a certain school to get the job you want? Would you have to save a certain amount of money so you can retire early? Would you have to marry a certain type of partner who has the same hobbies as you?

Now, identify three five-year goals that will help you work toward the achievements of your higher self. For example, is it possible to achieve any of the items you listed in your previous response in the next five years? If not, what are some goals that are achievable within five years that will move you toward reaching the achievements from your previous response?

Finally, identify a few goals that you can accomplish within the next 12 months that are necessary to accomplish all three of your five-year goals. For example, if one of your five-year goals is to become a teacher, one of your 12-month goals could be to enroll in a teaching program.
