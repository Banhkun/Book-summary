## Chapter 3: The Son of God

**Much of Noah’s life existed in a world where women ruled.** The house in Soweto was all women: his aunt, whose husband lived there but was inconsequential; his grandmother; and his great-grandmother, Koko. Koko was frail and blind. She would sit by the stove all day and take in the activities. She was alert and mentally sound, but she couldn’t see or move around. Noah had a hard time thinking of her as a person because she seemed more like a statue who sometimes spoke.

Growing up with women was not unique to Noah’s life. Apartheid took his father because he was white, but the other black kids were often without fathers, too. Apartheid had taken their fathers to labor jobs far away or prison. Some fathers were in exile fighting against the laws.

The space that would typically be occupied by men was replaced with religion. **Life for his family and all other women in the neighborhood centered around faith**. They held daily prayer meetings at each other’s homes. His grandmother hosted the meetings on Tuesday nights.

Noah loved these nights because he loved to sing the hymns and pray. **His grandmother told Noah his prayers were the most powerful because he prayed in English, the language of God.** She always asked him to pray for everyone in the group, and Noah took pride in his ability to reach God and help others.

### Who Will Pray for Trevor?

The belief in the power of Noah’s prayers created a sticky situation for Noah one night.

**In Soweto, every citizen had been given a tiny parcel of land and meager supplies to build a dwelling.** Most started with a shack. Then, after saving up a little money, they might add a room or a garage.

Noah’s grandmother’s house had reached that level, with two rooms total. The kitchen was in one room, and everyone slept in the other. But **there was no indoor plumbing, and six or seven houses shared an outhouse, which was really just a seat over a hole in the ground**. They used newspaper as toilet paper.

Noah never enjoyed this arrangement, especially when he had serious business to do in the bathroom, because it was hot and infested with flies. So, one day, when everyone was out of the house, Noah came up with what he thought was a brilliant plan to make going number two more enjoyable: **Noah spread newspaper on the kitchen floor and did his business.**

It was only after beginning that he realized Koko was in her spot. She could smell it but couldn’t see him, and Noah tried to stay quiet so she couldn’t hear him. In a panic, knowing the type of beating he would get if his mother found out, he rolled up the paper and shoved it deep into the trash can.

What young Noah failed to realize was that the smell would permeate the house. When his mother and family returned, they discovered the package in the trash and freaked out. They believed they had been the victims of witchcraft and needed to rid the house of evil. This meant calling an emergency prayer meeting.

It should be noted that even though his family was deeply religious, they were like most black South Africans. **Most had adapted to the colonial religion of Christianity, but many also held on to older traditional beliefs of their tribal cultures.** These beliefs included what is commonly known as “black magic,” or witchcraft, shamans, and the like. These beliefs run so deep, people have been tried for witchcraft in the courts as recently as the last decade.

The seriousness of this symbol of nefariousness in his grandmother’s home was immense. Noah was immediately called upon to use his special prayers to rid the house of the offending presence. Noah was at a loss. He believed his prayers were powerful. If he prayed for God to remove this evil presence, and he was the presence, what would God do to him? If he refused to pray, how would he explain it?

There was no way around it, so Noah mumbled some vague prayers about evil spirits. He included a few about forgiveness and the fact that maybe it was a misunderstanding. After the women were satisfied that the evil was vanquished from the home, Noah secretly prayed to God to forgive him for lying and wasting God’s time.
