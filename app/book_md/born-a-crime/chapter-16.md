## Chapter 16: The Hardest Lesson

Patricia never liked that Noah hung out in Alexandra.**** She didn’t have a problem with the people in the hood, just the way of life in the hood. **She wanted Noah to be somewhere where progress happened** , knowing he was the kind of person who would excel just to make sure others didn’t surpass him.

During his time in Alexandra, Patricia never stopped worrying that he would get arrested and throw his potential away. **She told Noah if he ever got arrested, not to call her.** He would have to learn his lesson the hard way.

### When You Look for Trouble, Trouble Finds You

When he and Bongani were still in business, Noah saw an ad for some cell phones on the cheap that they could flip for a nice profit. He needed to drive into Johannesburg, so he took the old Mazda he’d taken to the matric dance from Abel’s garage. This behavior was nothing new. He’d been doing it for years and often got into trouble. But despite his mother’s punishment, he’d do it again.

The car, like many of the cars in Abel’s yard, wasn’t properly registered and didn’t have plates**.** But Abel kept a stack of old plates around, and Noah took one of those and put it on the car. He was nineteen or twenty and didn’t think twice about it.

He didn’t make it far before he was pulled over in Hillbrow. He knew he was being racially profiled, but he was in an illegal car, so he tried to play it cool. When the cop started asking him questions about the car, he was anything but cool. He froze up.

Being black in South Africa means being used to the law always sniffing around. In that moment, **Noah wasn’t afraid of the law as much as he was of what his mother would say when she found out**.

It wasn’t until the cop ran the random, expired plates that Noah realized he was in serious trouble. He was handcuffed and arrested for suspicion of driving a stolen car. He was taken in, processed, and fingerprinted.

The situation went from bad to worse when the cops tried to locate the vehicle’s owner. When Noah stole a car from Abel, he always stole the junk cars, never a client’s car. If he’d taken a client’s car, the cops would have found the owner and realized the car was from the shop.

But the Mazda had no clear owner. There was no way for Noah to prove where it came from.**** To compound this was the rampant nature of violent carjackings in South Africa. They were so rampant, no one was surprised when it had happened to someone they knew.

Many carjackings ended in murder, which made things worse for Noah. Not only was he suspected of stealing the car, but **if he had stolen it, he very likely could also have killed someone for it**. The cops were all over him.

At any point, Noah could have called home and straightened it all out. Abel would have told the officers that it was a car from his garage, and the whole thing would have been done. But Abel had become abusive by that time, and **his fear of what Abel would do outweighed his fear of being in jail**.

He also remembered what his mother had said about not helping him if he got arrested. He decided to go it alone—to be a man and take what was coming. He did call his cousin, just so someone knew what was going on.

That first night, one of the officers sat Noah down and told him what he could expect. He would be held in the police jail until his bail hearing. After hearing the case, the judge would either let him go free or set bail. If he could pay, he’d get to go home. If not, he’d have to wait for his trial in prison.

In prison, a person was put in cells with others awaiting trial. The gamut could run from petty criminals to real, hardened gangsters. There was no indication of how long the process would take, and Noah could be stuck in prison for months or longer before even being convicted.

The cop told Noah to request a lawyer instead of going to his bail hearing. The cop wasn’t giving him this information as a kind gesture. He was working with an attorney, getting a cut of the retainer.

Still, Noah did as he was told. He found a lawyer, but now he needed a way to pay the lawyer. He called a friend and asked if he could borrow the money from his father. The next day, the lawyer was paid. **Noah felt good about handling his situation alone and finding a lawyer.**

### The Fate of the Damned

Even after he was taken to the holding cell, Noah didn’t think much of it. Then, the cell door slammed shut and the lights went out. His mind started replaying scenes from all the movies he’d watched and all the terrible things that could happen to him.

But no one said anything to him or anyone else. Everyone was afraid. They didn’t want to be outed as weak or vulnerable. For self-preservation, Noah decided to play the part of a tough guy, which was easier than it should have been.

Colored gangs are known throughout the country as some of the most violent and debased. It’s as much of a stereotype as the mafia is in America. **Noah assumed everyone would think he was a colored gangster** , so he only spoke in slang Afrikaans with a colored accent. The facade wouldn’t have held up in front of real colored gangsters, but it was enough to fool the others.

Noah came to think that jail wasn’t so bad. The food was decent. He got to read magazines. All in all, he found it quite peaceful. He was so comfortable, he actually started to think that he could do prison for a few years. He was _that_ afraid of Patricia and Abel.

After a few days, a large foreboding black man was put in with Noah and the others. Despite days of posturing, everyone feared this man. Noah overheard the man and a police officer trying unsuccessfully to have a conversation. The cop spoke Zulu. The man spoke Tsonga.

Abel was Tsonga, so Noah had picked up the language. He stepped in and translated for the hulk. In response, the man was grateful. The two started chatting, and Noah realized this man was docile despite his size. He had been arrested for mere petty theft of video games.

The man didn’t have a job and needed the money to support his family. **His story was similar to that of so many black men in post-apartheid South Africa.** During apartheid, he’d been a slave laborer. Despite the oppression, the job had provided structure and a salary, even if it was close to nothing. When apartheid ended, he had no skills or education and became lost in the new open world.

His size and dark color made people afraid of him. But the man was like a snake, **more afraid of the world because he didn’t know how to fit in**. Petty crime and jail stints became his life because it was all he had.

Meeting this man in jail made Noah see the composition of justice. **Your race and class put you on one side of the law.** If you have money, you can afford a lawyer. If you have money, you can make things happen in your favor. If you have a support system, you can get help.

If you’re poor, you have no options. If you’re an outsider, you will get lost in the system. **This man’s crime was less offensive than Noah’s, but his punishment would be worse because he didn’t have any friends or money.** He would have to use a public defender and not be able to understand what was said in the courtroom. His fate was entirely out of his hands.

### This Could Be Your Life, Trevor Noah

Noah’s hearing was finally called, and he was taken to the holding cell under the courtroom. The holding cell was where everyone awaiting trial was held. Some were actual prisoners waiting on an appeal or retrial. Others were small-time or white-collar offenders.

This new cell showed Noah the gravity of his situation. The relaxed environment of the police jail was a beach vacation compared to real prison. He saw the difference between real bad guys and guys who do bad things.

A man in the cell was losing it. He rushed Noah and started screaming and crying about the abuse he’d already endured from the gangs in prison, abuse Noah had imagined that first night. This guy wasn’t crazy, though. He was like Noah: educated and well-mannered. He’d been in prison for a year awaiting his trial. Noah became scared for real for the first time.

The cell was divided into racial configurations. **Once again, Noah found himself stranded without a home, just as he’d been so many times at school.** He couldn’t go over to the colored gangsters, not with his fake bravado. Going to the black group was equally challenging. They might see his mixed skin and reject him. The colored gang might get offended that he chose the black group.

He did the math of each scenario, knowing he would be required to pick a side. He decided the white-collar white men were the least threatening.

Fortunately, Noah was called after only one hour. His lawyer had made a deal with the prosecutor for bail because Noah didn’t have a record. Bail was paid, and he was free to go. When Noah got outside and felt the sun, he knew he never wanted to go back inside.

At Patricia’s house the next day, Noah tried to play it off. He said he’d been crashing with his cousin for a few days. Patricia gave him a look of profound disappointment and hurt. **She asked who he thought had taken care of everything while he was in jail.** The friend’s father had called her, and she’d paid for the lawyer and bail.

Patricia told Noah she might be hard on him, but it was because she loved him. She said neither the world nor the police loved him. It was better to be punished by her than by them. **Her punishment was used to teach him a lesson. Their punishment was used to destroy him.**
