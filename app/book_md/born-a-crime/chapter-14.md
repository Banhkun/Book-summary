## Chapter 14: A Career in Bloom

Bongani was from a small ghetto named Alexandra, a black area left over from pre-apartheid. It is known as Gomorrah for its wild parties and rampant crime.

The township of Alexandra was once a white-owned farm. It was a place where black squatters lived when coming to find work in the city before apartheid. The white owner had sold plots of land to some of the black tenants before apartheid made it illegal for blacks to own land. Whereas in other similar areas, blacks were moved out and the land was turned into white suburbs, the blacks in Alexandra refused to give up their land.

**The government built wealthy white neighborhoods around Alexandra, but the residents still wouldn’t leave.** Unlike Soweto, where there was room for the town to expand after apartheid, Alexandra was boxed in. It was a dense, rundown area with shacks squeezed in like sardines.

When Bongani asked Noah if he wanted to go to the hood the summer after high school, Noah wasn’t sure. He’d only been to Alexandra a few times, and never at night. During apartheid, the hoods were the places no one wanted to be from. **You were supposed to be ashamed of being from a township.**

But as apartheid ended, American gangster rap and hip-hop were growing in popularity. Suddenly, thanks to films and music about South Central LA, the hood was increasing in its status. South African kids in the townships took this street cred and started owning it with pride. All of this made Noah intrigued, so he went with Bongani.

Noah had never experienced any place like it. There was a constant hum of human commotion. People were everywhere, walking around, hanging on the corners, or hustling this or that. The town was mostly cinder block and iron. There was no sanitation, so people were always burning garbage. Noah thought it was overwhelming. But he also saw there was structure amid the pandemonium. Certain streets held higher social clout than others.

Bongani lived on the other side of the river that ran through town in the only area the government had paid any attention to. There were actual houses on this side, and people fared a little better financially than in the more run-down areas. **If you had a little money in the hood, people would say you were a “cheese boy” because cheese was so expensive.** Bongani and his friends were all known as cheese boys.

That first day, Noah and Bongani walked to his house and sat on the wall by the yard. At the time, Noah had no idea he’d spend the next three years doing nothing but that.

### Taking the Show on the Road

Alexandra was home to amazing street parties. All one had to do was put up a tent in the street, and the party was on. Most of the parties went late into the night and only ended after violence erupted.

These parties would always have a DJ. Because most DJs were spinning vinyl, they had a limited supply of music, which translated into a finite amount of time to play. But Noah had several hours of downloaded music on his computer. The mixing software he used for his party CDs created the effect of a DJ spinning. **Bongani convinced Noah to become a live DJ.**

His first performance as a DJ was New Year’s Eve the summer after high school. Noah had moved into his own apartment in Highland North, and he and Bongani carted his whole computer system, tower and all, on a minibus to Alexandra. They set it up outside Bongani’s house, and word spread fast about the mixed guy DJing from a computer. The party was legendary, and the duo started booking more gigs.

**DJing wasn’t just fun, it was something to do and a way to make money.** During apartheid, all the jobs were low-paying slave labor jobs. Post-apartheid, employees were required to be paid minimum wage, and all that close-to-free labor went away. People were laid off because employers couldn’t afford the cost of labor. There were no jobs in South Africa for blacks, and no one would hire blacks from the hood.

**Unemployment, especially for young black men, increased by approximately 50%.** With no money and no jobs, there wasn’t much for Noah and his crew to do but chill in the hood.

Bongani already had a crew he hung out with on the corner, and Noah joined them. Most of the time, they’d listen to music and dance, but the crew also helped Noah with his business. After Noah discovered a chink in the chain of his business, he turned the crew into a dance troupe.

The problem was, Noah had access to so much music that other people couldn’t get. Sometimes, people wouldn’t know the songs he played. If they didn’t know the songs, they didn’t know how to dance to them. So, when Noah would DJ, the dance crew would put on a show, demonstrating the latest moves to the latest tracks. Of these dancers, the best one was a kid named Hitler.

Dancing was a big deal in the townships. Crews from other hoods would bring their best dancers to compete with each other. It was a cultural phenomenon. Hitler almost always won his competitions

Noah and his crew started building routines that showcased Hitler’s moves.**** The other guys would get the crowd going, then Hitler would jump in the middle and break it down. Everyone would circle around and shout “Go Hitler, Go Hitler” while bumping the beat with their arms in the air, palms down.

**With the dance crew, Noah’s popularity soared.** They were getting hired for all sorts of events, even in the suburbs and by white people.

### Lessons Not Learned

Noah and his crew were invited to perform as part of a cultural appreciation day organized by the mother of a friend. The event was held at a Jewish school in a wealthy suburb and was meant to bring different cultures together. There was a variety of cultures represented through song and dance.

When it was time for Noah’s crew, called the Hip Hop Pantsula Dancers--the South African B-Boys, **Noah set up his system in front of an audience of almost all Jewish children in yarmulkes**. He got the audience warmed up, and everyone started to cheer. As usual, the crew came out and started dancing. The audience loved it, and everyone started dancing, including the adults. Then it was time for Hitler’s spotlight.

Noah shouted out Hitler’s name, and Hitler jumped into the middle and started getting down. The rest of the crew circled around him and did what they always did; **they started chanting “Go Hitler” with their hands pumping the air**. In an instant, the whole room stopped dancing and stared with gaping mouths. Noah and the crew didn’t know what was going on, so they kept chanting.

#### The Consequences of Segregation

The problem was that **Noah and his crew didn’t know the extent of who Hitler’s namesake was or what he’d done**. The name itself is not uncommon in South Africa, which stems from the process used by black people when choosing their children’s names.

Most black people had a traditional name from their tribe, one that is meaningful and hopefully prophetic. But blacks were also required by law to have an English or European name. These names were usually random selections from popular names heard in the news or from the Bible or the name of a celebrity.

**To confound the issue was the lack of education blacks received during apartheid.** The nursery rhymes of the Bantu schools didn’t cover much ground. Further, whites didn’t communicate with the black community, so blacks had no understanding of what was happening in the white world.

**For many blacks in South Africa, what they heard on the news was all they knew of the war.** From what they could tell, WWII involved a powerful man named Hitler who was responsible for the fighting. Even in Noah’s school, which had a higher standard than most, the facts of the war were taught with a similar level of superficiality as the facts of apartheid.

Apartheid is taught much like slavery is in America: surface-level, at best. Slavery happened, then Jim Crow, then MLK Jr., now it’s over. Likewise, South African students learn that apartheid was bad, Nelson Mandela was released, and now it’s over. All anyone learned about WWII in school was Hitler invaded countries and people fought. End of story.

Noah suspects the appalling aspects of Hitler’s regime hit too close to home. Not wanting to draw any attention to the injustice of apartheid, South African curriculum glossed over both.

What black South Africans did understand was that, at some point, blacks were recruited to fight alongside the whites to defeat Hitler. To blacks, the fact that the white people were desperate enough to ask black people for help said a lot about how powerful Hitler was. **if you want a powerful child, give him a powerful name, or the name of someone powerful**. This was the origin of the name “Hitler” in South Africa.

#### A Misunderstanding for the Ages

Because of this lack of knowledge, Noah and his crew were perplexed when a teacher from the Jewish school disconnected their system. She admonished them severely for their behavior. Noah thought she was upset about an erotic dance move popular in African culture. He took offense and fought back.

The miscommunication continued, and in response to Noah’s defense, she called Noah and his crew disgusting. Noah assumed she was racist and told her black people were free now and had the right to live as they wanted. **All he saw was a white person telling them black culture was disgusting. All she saw was a group of anti-semites saying they were free to do what they wanted.**

When Noah’s crew left the venue, they didn’t walk out. They danced out. They made a defiant exit, pumping their fists and shouting go Hitler as a show of solidarity and pride.
