## Part 1 | Chapter 1: The Consequences of Apartheid

### A Little History

**Apartheid was a system of institutionalized racism in South Africa.** It began in 1948 and lasted for 46 years. The laws delineated different rights to citizens based on race, with the white race reigning supreme.

Apartheid was efficiently executed. It first developed as a result of colonial intrusion, which started in the mid-17th century. The Dutch arrived first and established a trading post in what would become Cape Town. They warred with the native blacks to attain power and instituted laws to enforce it, including enslaving them.

When British missionaries arrived, they displaced the Dutch to remote areas inland. Slavery was legally dissolved, but the practice remained. The British needed people to mine discovered gold and diamond supplies. After some time, the missionaries left South Africa, and the Dutch moved back in and reclaimed power.

By that time, **the Dutch had developed their own culture and language, calling themselves Afrikaners, a tribe of white Africans.** They wanted a way to maintain control over the expansive black population, so they created a new set of laws, which became apartheid. These laws were based on research conducted on other forms of legal racism around the world.

The newfound intricate system of oppression comprised 3,000 pages. **Blacks were to have no rights and be constantly monitored and controlled.** At its core, apartheid was like a combination of the Indian massacres, slavery, and Jim Crow in America.

All people were required to register as a specific race with the government. This registration determined what rights you had and where you lived. **Land became parceled based on race to keep people separated from one another.**

#### Tensions within the Black Community

**Apartheid was also used to breed separation within the black community.** These efforts kept the black population, almost five times larger than the white population, in a state of disunity to create a contentious environment.

Before apartheid, blacks lived within different tribes, each with their own language; the two largest tribes were the Zulu and Xhosa. The pre-apartheid history of these tribes was volatile. When the Dutch came, the Zulu, known as fighters, engaged in savage battles, whereas the Xhosa, known to be more rational, tried to embrace the change and find an intellectual solution. Neither tribe was successful, and each blamed the other’s tactics for hindering their success.

During apartheid, these sentiments remained, but there was a common enemy in the white oppressors. However, when apartheid ended, that common enemy disappeared. **The deeply ingrained rage and resentment were then turned toward each other.** Both the Zulu and Xhosa, as well as other tribes, fought for supremacy in the new democracy. The result was further separation, creating an environment of violence, rather than one of unity and rebuilding.

The ending of apartheid signaled the beginning of what became known as the Bloodless Revolution. The streets ran heavy with the blood of black South Africans, but almost no white blood was shed. **In their fight for supremacy, an uprising of the Zulu and Xhosa, under the guise of official party organizations, created a war.** There were riots and fighting in the streets. Thousands died, and bodies blanketed the ground.

### A Boy’s Introduction to Democracy

When apartheid ended and Nelson Mandela was freed, Trevor Noah was five years old. He was too young to understand the implications and celebrations. **All he understood was that the happiness of the blacks came with a heavy dose of violence.**

He and his mother, Patricia, would often drive through their community of Eden Park amidst fires and rioters in the streets. Most of their neighbors hid from the violence, but not Patricia. She had a life to lead, and she wasn’t about to allow the violence to get in her way. **Patricia was stubborn, brazen, and brave, qualities Noah admired in his mother.** On one Sunday morning when Noah was nine, he would find out just how fierce his mother was.

#### A Typical Sunday

Patricia was a devout Christian and believed in the power of God to take care of her. Because of these beliefs, **Noah and his mother went to three different churches every Sunday.** The three churches had congregations with different racial make-ups and provided different religious experiences. Noah came to refer to them as mixed church, white church, and black church.

**It was on one of these Sundays when Noah’s mother threw him out of a moving vehicle to save him from a violent encounter.** Here’s how the story began. Patricia owned a used VW Beetle that broke down constantly. That morning was no different. Without a car, Noah, Patricia, and his infant brother, Andrew, were required to take a minibus.

Minibuses had become popular during apartheid as a homemade solution to the lack of government-provided public transportation for blacks. **Different tribes operated the minibuses, which created turf wars for business.**

#### Caught in the Crossfires of War

**The bus Noah and his family took home that night was driven by a Zulu man, the natural enemy to his mother’s Xhosa heritage.** It is worth noting that within the Zulu tribe, Xhosa women were stereotyped as being promiscuous and wild. The driver, recognizing Patricia as Xhosa, became verbally aggressive, lecturing her about having children by different fathers (Andrew’s father was black, Noah’s white, and their different skin tones made it apparent).

Patricia argued with the driver, telling him to mind his own business. In response, the driver decided to teach her a lesson. He hit the accelerator and took off, refusing to stop—essentially kidnapping them. Patricia tried to reason with the driver, but she knew it was futile. The tensions between the two tribes were too significant. **Violence was likely and could include assault or even death.**

Patricia told Noah to get ready to jump at the next intersection, when the driver was forced to slow down. Noah, being exhausted from the day of traipsing from church to church, had fallen asleep. So, when the next stop came and he didn’t react, **Patricia opened the door and threw him out, following behind with Andrew wrapped tightly against her chest.**

Noah awoke with the pain of hitting the pavement, and Patricia landed in a way that shielded Andrew from the impact. She jumped up and yelled for them to run, and they ran until they were safe. Noah was incredulous that she’d thrown him out of a moving vehicle. **But he came to realize how close they’d come to being casualties of the tribal war.** Patricia’s strength and bravery had saved his life.

This is the world in which Trevor Noah grew up.
