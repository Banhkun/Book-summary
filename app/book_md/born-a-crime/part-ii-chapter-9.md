## Part II | Chapter 9: No Race To Call His Own

Noah was a boy without an island, so to speak. He was mixed, which made him appear to be colored. But **because the colored race was a cultural distinction more than a representation of a specific race, Noah didn’t belong with them** either.

There was also a lot of tension between blacks and coloreds. As stated, coloreds were treated as “almost white” in the eyes of the law. But **a colored person could rise to the status of white during their lifetime if they started to show white traits**. Their hair might become straighter or skin lighter. The decision to reclassify involved a number of factors, and some would have to undergo the “pencil test.” A pencil would be placed in their hair. If the pencil fell out, they were white. If not, they were colored.

The government made sure colored people were aware of the reason they couldn’t have full rights. There was a fear that some blacks would pretend to be colored to skirt the system. Thus, **blacks were to blame for the fate of the colored**. The most damning thing you could call a colored person was “bushman” because it drew attention to their black heritage.

#### The Breaking Point

All of **these factors created problems for Noah with colored people in Eden Park**. He looked like them, but he was culturally black. Some colored people considered him a disgrace for adapting to the inferior black race. Others thought him a snob because he had a white father and spoke English, not Afrikaans. There was no middle. He couldn’t win.

Despite Eden Park being a colored community, Noah says **his time there was the hardest of his childhood**. He wrote, “It is easier to be an insider as an outsider than to be an outsider as an insider.”

Eden Park was a lonely place for Noah. **He had no friends and was bullied often.** He was so desperate for friends, he often walked into a bully’s trap willingly, thinking their kindness was sincere. He became used to the bullying and didn’t let it bother him, but the day at the mulberry tree pushed him over the edge.

#### The Consequences of Bullying

There was a large mulberry tree in Eden Park that, like anywhere with a mulberry tree, the children frequently gleaned fruit from. Noah was one of these kids, but he always picked the berries alone. One day, a group of older colored boys came to the tree while he was playing. The leader of the pack pretended to be friendly, asking Noah to see his pile of berries. Hoping this kid wanted to be his friend, Noah showed the berries to him. The older boy knocked the berries to the ground. Noah didn’t react and went back to picking.

Then, the other kids started throwing berries at him, including unripened ones that were hard like pebbles. Noah got scared and ran home covered in berry juice and crying. He told his mother what had happened, but Patricia was so relieved he hadn’t been seriously hurt, she didn’t make much of it. However, when Abel got home, everything changed.

Abel was friendly with Noah. He acted like a big brother and played with him. Still, **Noah knew Abel had a temper**. It would be a few years before Abel started to abuse Noah and his mother, but he’d witnessed Abel’s rage at minor infractions, like being cut off while driving. Abel had also been drinking that night, which made him more volatile.

Noah usually didn’t want anything to do with Abel when he was drunk, but in that moment, he wanted revenge. He knew if he turned Abel’s rage toward the bullies, he could get back at them.

Abel and Noah drove to the tree. When they pulled up, the bullies scattered. Abel caught the leader, grabbed a switch from the tree, and beat him. At first, Noah was happy to see the boy get what was coming to him. But soon, **it became clear that Abel wasn’t punishing the boy**. He was simply an adult beating up a child.

The bully was terrified. **Noah’s joy turned to empathy when he saw the fear in the boy’s eyes**. He realized the bully was just another boy who’d become caught up in the convoluted system of race in South Africa. He’d been wrong to unleash Abel on him. He felt terrible.
