## Chapter 15: A Life of Crime

Life in the hood is one of survival for most people. The need to survive often leads to many shades of illegal activity.**** The lines between good and bad become blurred.

Even if a person wasn’t outright stealing, likely they were buying something from someone else that was originally stolen one, two, or three exchanges before. It could be as simple as a mother buying a box of canned goods that “fell” off a delivery truck to feed her hungry children. Crime is just a part of life.

Everyone grew up together in the hood and knew each other. Even the gangsters were members of the community. Everyone in the hood looked out for each other. An example of this close-knit community is the mom code. There was an unspoken rule that if a mom asked you to do something, you did it, gangster or not.

### The Hustle

Noah’s career as a criminal had originally started with the pirated CDs. But **he never thought what he was doing was a crime**. If you weren’t supposed to download music and burn CDs, why would they make it possible?

He and his crew were doing good business with the CDs and DJing gigs. Minibus drivers were their best customers. Because of the competition among them, the drivers were always looking for new music. They’d drive by Bongani’s corner, place an order, complete their route, and come back to pick up the CD.

Bongani, always the visionary, saw how they could extend their hustle. He posited that a series of minor deals could create a scenario in which the deals stacked up to lead to the biggest score. They started small, such as allowing the minibus drivers to pay for CDs on credit. The drivers would take the CDs and promise to pay at the end of the week. The boys would attach a small interest rate to the debt.

This venture started bringing extra cash, a commodity in the hood. People always needed needed cash in Alexandra. Bongani realized they could give people small loans for a bill or food and add a little interest on the backend. Once they started doing this, they were doubling, then tripling their money.

The business expanded beyond loans. **Noah and Bongani started using cash as a way to barter and make more money.** In the hood, someone was always selling something on the corner, and there was always someone trying to buy whatever was being sold. The duo started looking for ways to position themselves as the middlemen.

For example, they might come upon a man caught in a negotiation over a DVD player a drug addict was selling. Bongani would find out the price the addict wanted. He would then take the man aside and ask how much he had to spend. The addict might want 140 rand, but the man only had 120. Knowing the addict was desperate, Bongani would buy the player for 50 rand, then give it to the man on credit, adding 20 rand as interest. When the man was able to pay the 140, their profit was 90 rand. Sometimes, they could push the deal farther. If the man worked at a shoe store, they might allow him to pay his debt with a new pair of Nikes. They’d sell the Nikes to a cheese boy for 200 rand, a 100-rand discount off the store cost. A 50-rand investment turned into a 150-rand profit.

This was the hustle Bongani and Noah came to perfect. **None of it was legal (most of the items were stolen), but none of it felt like it was a crime.** No one asked where anything came from. Everyone assumed the items came from white people, who had insurance.

Noah never expected their CD and DJ business to turn into a loan service and pawnshop, but every day was more of the same. At the height of their business, they had amassed around 10,000 rand. Noah had picked up knowledge of how to make spreadsheets and keep books from his mother, and he kept every aspect of the business organized on his computer.

**Noah felt accepted in the hood in a way he never had before.**

### The End of an Era

**All of Noah and his crew’s success came crashing down at a party in a black middle-class neighborhood one night.** The cops were called because of a noise complaint. Because of the slow technology, Noah couldn’t get the system shut down fast enough, and one of the cops shot his computer.

Noah lost his hard drive of music, meaning no more DJing and no more CDs. Business was over, but they still had the hustle and some money. However, it didn’t take long for the money to dry up. Soon, they had next to nothing.

A short while after that, a man who worked at the airport and frequently stole items from people’s luggage came by with a digital camera. Noah and his crew snatched it up to flip for a profit. The camera was full of pictures from a white family’s vacation. When Noah saw the photos, they changed him.

**In all of his time as a low-level criminal, he never thought about the people who had originally owned whatever they were hustling.** Without any knowledge of the victim, he could always rationalize his actions. But seeing the faces of that family made him see the people he was affecting. He cherished his family photos, and he felt terrible that this family’s memories had been stolen. It was just plain wrong.

**This concept of not seeing who you hurt is the foundation the hood is built on.** Apartheid moved blacks to townships so white people wouldn’t have to see how they lived and be reminded of what was happening to them. If they had to acknowledge black people as human beings trying to survive, slavery would be incomprehensible. **It’s easier to do things that hurt others if you never have to see who those others are.**

#### The Final Straw

Noah and his crew were invited to a dance-off in Soweto one night. The whole crew took the minibus to watch Hitler compete, but Hitler lost the battle.

It was early morning when they got on the minibus to go home. They hadn’t gotten far outside the township when their bus was pulled over by police. The officers made everyone on the bus stand on the side of the road while they searched it.

One of the cops claimed to have found a gun in the minibus and asked whose it was. When Noah and his friends said they didn’t know, the cop went down the line slapping them in the face and demanding an answer. When he found out they were from Alexandra, he called them gangsters and rapists. He said he was going to arrest them all until one of them confessed about the gun.

Noah understood quickly that this was a shakedown. **The cop was looking to make what was called a “spot fine,” or a bribe.** But they didn’t have any money, so he took them to jail. There were other people on the minibus, but only the ones from Alexandra were arrested.

Noah called a friend in the morning, and he and his friends were bailed out. But it was a bribe, not bail. They were never formally charged or processed. He and his friends were shaken by the experience. Although they played the parts of hustlers on the streets every day, feeling akin to the gangsters, they weren’t gangsters. They were cheese boys trying to fit in and survive.

**Noah realized that his friends had few options.** They would either be the lucky ones who found a job, or they would be stuck fronting like tough guys to make it in the hood. But he wasn’t from the hood. He’d been faking it. There was always an out for him at the end of the day, and he’d always known it. **He could move on whenever he wanted, something he knew the others couldn’t do.** For the others, there was nowhere else for them to go but the hood.
