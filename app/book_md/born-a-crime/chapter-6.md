## Chapter 6: The Naughty Boy

Like many children, **Noah was self-centered and focused only on what was in front of him and benefited him**. He had an immense appetite, consuming food, books, anything he could get his hands on, and always wanted more. He never stopped to consider the sort of strain this might put on his mother.

Patricia used to send him to their relatives with a bag of vegetables and cornmeal to make up for the amount of food he would consume. He became the family garbage disposal, cleaning everyone’s plates after a meal.

Noah was also rambunctious and hyperactive, always on the move and running with abandon. His babysitters often left in tears. He wasn’t mean or cruel; rather, he was quite polite and well-mannered when it was called for. But he had boundless energy and a large ego.

Patricia used to take him to the park and run him to wear him down. Later, when he was able to go to white parks, he realized that was how people treated their dogs. But wearing him down was necessary; otherwise, he was causing trouble.

### The Merry Prankster

Noah enjoyed being naughty and pulling pranks on others. Sometimes, he’d even pull pranks on his whole school. Once, he removed all the magnifying glasses from the classroom projectors. Another time, he sprayed the entire contents of a fire extinguisher in the school piano so it would explode with foam when played at an assembly.

Yet, his favorite forms of mischief involved knives and fire. His mother once bought a bunch of fireworks for Guy Fawkes Day, and he emptied the contents into a pile. But he accidentally ignited the pile with one of the other fireworks and burned off his eyebrows and part of his hair.

The view from the outside was that Noah was mischievous, destructive, and wild. However, Noah says he did what he did because he liked to create and experiment. **His motivation was a desire to see what reaction his actions could create, not to destroy.**

Because of his behavior, **Noah and his mother had a relationship akin to a detective and their target in films** : a bitter rivalry but a high regard for each other’s prowess. When he was a kid, she could simply outsmart him or catch him easily for a beating. But as he got older, stronger, and more energetic, she had to come up with more savvy tactics to curb his antics.

One day, when they were shopping for groceries, Noah started nagging his mother to buy him a toffee apple. He followed her around the store begging and begging. Patricia ignored his whining until she was finished shopping. She finally told him to grab a toffee apple and meet her at the checkout line. Noah came back and set the apple on the counter, proudly telling the cashier to add it to his mother’s purchases.

Because Noah and his mother were so different in color, the cashier assumed they weren’t together. He told Noah to wait his turn. But Noah protested, saying Patricia was going to buy it. Patricia looked at him like he was a stranger and told the cashier that this poor colored boy must have lost his mother. She paid for her groceries and left the store. Noah, dumbfounded, ran after her in tears. When they met at the car, she had a good laugh.

The older Noah got, the more he could match Patricia’s wits. To be able to make her points without his retorts, she took to writing him letters. He would respond in kind. This process could go on for days for minor disputes. But for his more severe misdeeds, Patricia would turn to physical discipline—that is, if she could catch him.

**Despite her strict and aggressive discipline, Noah knew it was out of love.** She always made sure he understood why he was being punished. Afterward, she’d let him sulk, then treat him with her normal kindness to bring things back into balance. Her punishments were momentary lessons, not acts of frustration or hate.

#### Small Actions and Big Consequences

**Noah’s love of knives and fire would change his life in two distinct ways.** In one instance, he was expelled from Catholic school for bringing a knife for protection against bullies. This wasn’t Noah’s first offense, however. Noah was frequently disciplined in Catholic school. They’d wash out his mouth with soap when he swore, and if needed, the principal would deliver a spanking.

During one of these spankings, he started laughing because it was so weak compared to his mother’s. This event led to the school requiring him to get tested by a psychologist for the first of three times. Each time, the psychologist always came back with the same response: there’s nothing wrong with him. The consensus was that he was simply creative and clever.

Noah didn’t care about being expelled. **His mother taught him to question authority, and he did so eagerly.** He saw Catholic school as a microcosm of apartheid: strictly enforced rules and authority based on conjecture.

The other event had lasting effects. **Patricia had started dating Abel, one of the mechanics who always worked on the orange Beetle.** A black man, Abel lived in a garage/guest cottage in the backyard of a white family’s home. The white family had a black maid, who had a son that Noah played with when they went to visit.

Noah had become fascinated with burning his name into wood with a magnifying glass. One afternoon, when he was seven, he was showing the boy how to do it in the servants’ quarters, which was really a shed out back. When he and the boy went to get a snack, Noah left the glass and a book of matches on the straw mattress inside.

Unfortunately, neither boy realized the door locked from the inside, and they couldn’t get back in. **A fire started, which demolished the shed and burned down the main house.** Noah was too young and his mother too poor for any legal recourse, but the family kicked Abel out. With nowhere to live, **Abel moved in with them at Eden Park**.
