## Chapter 19: The Aftermath

After Andrew drove off with Patricia, Abel had taken Isaac. Isaac asked him why he’d killed mommy, to which Abel said he was unhappy and sad. Abel dropped Isaac off at a friend’s house after telling Isaac he was going to kill himself.

Abel went around to all of his friends and relatives and told them what he did and what he was going to do. Toward the end of the day, a family member told him he was a coward and to turn himself in. Abel turned over the gun and went to the police.

Noah tried to block Abel’s bail, but because the police had never agreed to press charges, he had no priors. And Abel claimed he needed to take care of his sons, so he was released.

The trial dragged on. Patricia’s injuries changed the severity of the charge, and he was only accused of attempted murder. **Abel took a plea deal and spent no time in jail.** He got to maintain joint custody of his sons.

Abel still lives somewhere in Johannesburg, not too far from Patricia.

Patricia’s side of the story was the most significant. She remembered everything that happened up to starting the car. **She said when Abel pointed the gun at her head, she started to pray.**

**Nobody has ever been able to explain why the gun malfunctioned.** The gun worked, then it stopped working, and then it worked again. The cops have no explanation because the kind of gun used didn’t usually malfunction the way it did.

Noah couldn’t get over that Patricia had canceled her health insurance. When he told her this, she said she had insurance: Jesus. Noah couldn’t argue with her logic. The gun jamming was miraculous. But he argued that Jesus wasn’t there when her hospital bill needed paying. The bill had only come to 50,000 rand.

Patricia told Noah he was right. Jesus hadn’t paid her bill. But he had given her a son who could and did.
