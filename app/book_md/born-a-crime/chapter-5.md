## Chapter 5: The Power of a Mother’s Love

Before apartheid, blacks were educated by the British missionaries, who wanted to Westernize the natives. Later, many of these people became leaders in the anti-apartheid movement because they were intelligent and well-educated.

However, **during apartheid, the Afrikaners didn’t want blacks to be educated**. They created separate educational systems called Bantu schools, in which the teachers were barely educated themselves. These schools didn’t teach science, history, or social studies. Blacks were taught only enough math to understand how to count during farm labor and other trade knowledge. Often, these lessons were taught like nursery rhymes, even to the older students.

More than just ensuring that blacks would not be able to think and organize, **the Afrikaners claimed there was no reason to educate a black person**. Knowledge would not be needed in their lives. Former missionary schools were forced to change or close. Many chose the latter.

But **Patricia would make sure Noah would not suffer this fate**. Properly educating him in knowledge and life experience became her priority.

### Lower-Lower-Class Citizen

Patricia, like Noah, never felt a true sense of belonging growing up.**** When she had Noah, she did so with a desire to love someone who would love her back. Someone who belonged to her.

She was a troublemaker as a child, already stubborn, and rebellious. Her mother didn’t think Patricia acted like a girl should act.

As neither the eldest daughter nor a son who would carry on the family name, she wasn’t significant in her family structure. She and her mother were always at odds, but she loved her father.**** Her father was named Temperance, which was contrary to his gregarious personality. He was eccentric and flashy, but later, they discovered he was actually bipolar. He lived with a second family, and when he’d visit, Patricia would follow him on his manic escapades.

When Patricia was nine, she requested to live with her father. Her mother complied, but instead of taking her in, her father sent her to live with his sister in Transkei, the Xhosa homeland. She wouldn’t reunite with any of them for 12 years.

At her aunt’s house, she lived with 14 cousins in a hut, all from different parents. They were also children whose parents didn’t want them around or couldn’t afford them.

In Transkei, so little land had been allocated by the government, the residents were crammed in. There was no water or electricity. The land was overrun and the soil infertile. Money was scarce, so most families subsisted through low-level farming.

Patricia was only taken in to help work the fields. There was barely enough food for all the children to eat. When they did have food, she had to fight the others for it. When they didn’t, she would steal food from the animals: whatever scraps she could scrounge. Sometimes, she ate dirt just to feel something in her stomach.

**The only saving grace in Transkei was the still-operational missionary school, where Patricia was able to learn English.** She learned to read and write, and when she was old enough, she went to work in a factory close by. As compensation, she received a meal. To Patricia, it was the best meal of her life because she’d earned it and didn’t have to rely on anyone else.

When her aunt became sick, Patricia went back to Soweto and enrolled in the secretarial school that would change her life. She was 21. **Her move to Johannesburg a year later was to escape what she called the “black tax,”** or the destiny of poor blacks who have to make up for the past degradation of their families. She knew that if she stayed in Soweto, she’d never make it anywhere, no matter how hard she tried, because she’d always be stuck trying to bring everyone in her family out of poverty.

#### A Life Better Than Her Own

Noah only heard of his mother’s life in Transkei in small doses. **Patricia wanted Noah to understand how hard she’d fought so he’d never take their life for granted.** She didn’t complain or hold grudges. She left the past behind and promised Noah he would have a different life.

Her first step in this direction was the name she chose for him. Xhosa names carry meanings that often lead to the owner fulfilling that destiny. For instance, Patricia’s Xhosa name was “Nombuyiselo,” which means “she who gives back.” She was always helping others, giving her money or energy away for others’ benefit. As a child, she’d collected bottles and used the money to feed the abandoned neighborhood children. **“Trevor,” in contrast, had no meaning. He was free to become whatever and whoever he wanted.**

**Patricia read to Noah constantly.** She read from the Bible and books from white donations. She signed up for a series of books on how to be a better person and bought a set of used encyclopedias. Trevor learned to love reading and treated his books like prized possessions.**** When he was old enough, he started buying his own books, mostly fantasy novels.

Noah was raised to be knowledgeable and strong of mind, but more than providing nourishment for his brain, Patricia did her best to provide nourishment for his body, as well. **Patricia never spent money on anything but food and books.**

Her spendthrift ways were heroic, but despite always making sure there was food, the food was not always the best. They often sucked the marrow out of bones or ate “sawdust,” the minuscule remnants of meat from the butchershop. Butchers swept the remnants into a bag for the dogs, but Patricia would buy it. **Sometimes, she’d even take the bones the butcher put out for the dogs and boil them.** When Noah became famous and was introduced to the delicacy of bone marrow in a fancy restaurant, he saw them as just dog bones.

#### Partners On A Grand Adventure

Apartheid wasn’t over the moment the laws were abolished. It took time for the laws to completely disappear. But blacks were still free to live less-restricted lives, and Patricia moved them from their illegal apartment in the city to a colored neighborhood called Eden Park, where she bought a house.

Eden Park was a completely new world for Noah. **He’d never seen a colored area before and had never been around colored people.** He was unused to paved streets and suburban life, and he didn’t like having his own room. He was used to sleeping surrounded by others, so he often slept in his mother’s room.

Patricia was also able to buy a car and bought the orange VW Beetle. The poor functioning of that car would later become the catalyst for many horrific aspects of Patricia’s life beyond the minibus experience. But at that time, when the car did run, they were truly free for the first time.

**Noah and Patricia were like two partners on an expedition, forging into a new world.** At six, Noah learned to drive on a stretch of desolate road. They’d fly down hills and back up the other side at great speeds, like a rollercoaster. They ventured into the world, exploring parts of the city and country where they didn’t have to spend money. She’d take Noah on picnics of baloney and butter on brown bread, eating while admiring the landscape. That sandwich is still a favorite of his to this day.

As impoverished as they were, **Noah never felt poor because of the life experiences she opened him up to.** Patricia raised him in a world where limitations were invisible, or as Noah put it, how a white kid might be raised. **In their world, everything was possible, and his voice and ideas were important.** She showed him that there were dreams beyond the confines of his race and culture.

Of all the amazing things his mother did, the most astonishing was having Noah when she did. There was no reason to believe that apartheid was coming to an end. Noah was 10 before democracy completely took over. **Patricia had prepared him for a world that might never exist, and when democracy became a reality, he was ahead of the curve.**

Many people would tell her she was crazy and ask why she was wasting all this time teaching her son about the world. Each time, Patricia would counter with, **“Even if he never leaves the ghetto, he will know that the ghetto is not the world.”**
