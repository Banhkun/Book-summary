## Exercise: See the Gunas in Yourself

Regardless of your own religious or spiritual beliefs, reflecting on your thoughts and actions is always a worthwhile exercise. Now that you’re more familiar with the three gunas and how they impact various aspects of life, see if you can find them in yourself.

* * *

Think about the day you’ve had (or yesterday, if you’re reading this in the morning). Which guna—sattva, rajas, or tamas—would you say was driving your thoughts and actions, and why? Give an example of one action that was driven by that guna.

What are some things you could do to embrace sattvic ideals of unity, harmony, and contentment tomorrow (or today)?
