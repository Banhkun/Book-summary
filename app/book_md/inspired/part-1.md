## Part 1: Key Concepts of Product Development

_Inspired_ gives companies and entrepreneurs a two-step process for creating and sustaining successful technology products: 1) organize and structure effective teams, and 2) develop products using a flexible “discovery” process. In particular, it explains how important product managers are in product development, teaches them how to be successful, and explains some of the biggest pitfalls that most tech companies fall into when designing products.

Author Marty Cagan, a Silicon Valley product executive, also details how product designers and engineers should function in a team and how company executives should treat their product teams. Originally published in 2008, the book was updated in 2018 to further address evolving concepts such as lean and agile techniques. This summary begins by discussing how to set up teams, then explains how to “discover” or develop products.

  * _Part 1_ explains the pitfalls and potential successes of three kinds of technology companies and discusses why some products fail while others succeed. 
  * _Part 2_ is concerned with building a successful product team. It explains each role on a successful team and the skills that employees need for the team to succeed.
  * _Part 3_ looks into the planning stage of getting a product to market. It discusses the overall strategy and vision necessary for success.
  * _Part 4_ moves from planning into executing. It’s about developing, prototyping, and testing a product.
  * _Part 5_ is about company culture and changing how we work. 



(Shortform note: In __ this summary, we’ve mostly maintained the structure of the book, but we’ve reorganized and combined many of the 67 chapters for clarity and coherence.)

**There’s a huge difference between the way most companies develop new products and the way that the best ones do.** In Part 1, we’ll examine why many products fail and then explain how products can succeed. Finally, we’ll discuss the structure of teams and companies. You’ll leave this section with an introduction __ into how product teams can succeed and pitfalls to avoid.

### Why Products Fail

To understand the pitfalls for products, teams, and companies, let’s examine how companies typically develop new products:

  * All products begin with an _idea._
  * Engineers and product managers (team leaders) build upon this idea and create a _roadmap_ for development. The roadmap makes a “business case,” which asks both how much a product will cost to make and how much profit it could lead to. 
  * Then, product managers figure out _requirements_ for the product to succeed.
  * The product is then _designed_ by a user experience (UX) team and _built_ by engineers. 
  * Finally, a company will _test_ the product, taking surveys of what consumers think of it, and then _deploy_ it to the market.



This process, though, is filled with pitfalls. Some of the most salient are:

  * Product ideas that CEOs greenlight may be related only to sales or to pleasing stakeholders. This disempowers team members and can throttle real innovation. 
  * It’s almost impossible to know how much money a product will make at such an early stage in its development. Before a product has been built, this amounts to guesswork. Additionally, before a product has been built it’s impossible to know how much it will cost to build. There are all kinds of factors that go into the cost of building technology, and we can’t guess what will take a longer or shorter amount of time or more or fewer resources before something is built. 
  * Roadmaps are usually just a list of features that people want to see included in the product. However, we have no idea what features will and won’t work. In fact, a lot of our ideas either won’t be built, will cost too much money, or won’t excite customers the way we hoped they would. 
  * UX designers come into the process so late in the game that they’re attempting to design something that, because of how the ideas have been constructed, they often can’t make user-friendly. Engineers are similarly brought into the process so late that they can’t point out potential flaws in a product. 
  * All of the risks in the process are loaded toward the end. If test customers don’t like the product, then a company has poured all of this effort and money into the production of something that isn’t going to be marketable. They’ve also lost time, and with it, incurred a huge opportunity cost. 



### How Products Can Succeed

Now that we’ve examined the usual way of creating products and the reasons that they fail, there are three ways we can do better.

  1. Incur risk **at the beginning of the process** — _before launching_ the product,**** ask whether customers will buy it, whether the product is buildable at a reasonable price-point, and whether the product is marketable or fits in with the larger sales goals of the company. This contrasts with companies that ask these questions _after_ they’ve launched a new product. ****
  2. **Bring user experience (UX) designers and engineers into the idea-creation stage.** The product manager shouldn’t be the only one responsible for idea creation—she should also receive ideas and figure out what the team needs collaboratively. 
  3. Think about the goals of products differently. **Products are meant to solve problems that customers have;** they’re not blank slates on which executives can suggest new features that pop into their heads. 



We’ll return to these three major concepts throughout the book.

#### Discovery and Delivery

Product teams that are following the rules laid out above engage in a continuous process of _discovery_ and _delivery._ Think of these two concepts as parallel lines—good teams work on discovery and delivery separately but concurrently.

##### Discovery

Product managers consider what the product _needs_(discovery). The discovery process, which the summary will discuss in Part 4, attempts to answer the following four questions:

  1. Do consumers want the product?
  2. Can consumers understand the product’s functionality?
  3. Do our engineers have the tools to build this?
  4. Do we have the money and support to create this?



To answer these questions, companies should build quick and fairly simple _prototypes_ to test on focus groups.

##### Delivery

Engineers consider how to _implement_ product needs (delivery). As we stated before, engineers can also be useful in the discovery process, but their primary role is on the delivery front. If the prototypes are popular and working well, and we’ve answered ‘yes’ to all of the four questions above, engineers should concern themselves with questions of how to get the product or feature to market, scaling up production, making sure performance is good across the board, and doing the necessary safety checks on questions of privacy and security.

There’s a big difference between a product being _impressive_ and its being _successful_. And no matter how good your engineering team, if they’re building a product that people don’t want, it won’t sell.

### Company Structure

There are three types of tech companies, each with their own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to product development:

  1. **Startups:** Startups are new companies that haven't found their product niche yet. Here, the product manager is the CEO, and there are at most five product teams. The biggest challenge that startups face is money issues. They need to find their niche with the money that they have, because if they don’t, it’s almost impossible to find new streams of revenue. The advantage to being in a startup environment is that there’s little bureaucracy and the teams can pivot to new ideas quickly. Successful startups are good at _product discovery,_ which we’ll cover in detail later in the book. Working at a startup is high-risk, high-reward—not many startups make it big, but if yours does, you’ll be in for a big payday, and you’ll likely feel rewarded by your work. 
  2. **Growth-stage companies:** If a startup does manage to find a market niche, it needs to figure out how to grow. Startups must build on early success with new products and new team members. These companies will have somewhere between 25 engineers and a few hundred. Obviously, those two ends of the scale are different, and in a growth stage, companies are usually scaling up quickly. When there are more people, some have trouble understanding the original mission of the company, and when there is more demand for the products the company is producing, the technology itself is often under stress. These companies are often looking for an IPO or are targets for acquisition from big companies—this can motivate engineers and product managers to strive for success.
  3. **Enterprise (large, often public) companies:** Even if companies get through the growth stage relatively unscathed, it’s still tough to build a sustainable business. Tech consumers want innovation, and competitors are always innovating, so enterprise companies must do so as well to remain relevant. Particularly once companies become publicly traded, the incentive structure changes, so that the culture becomes less about discovery and more about protecting what exists to please the shareholders. This means taking fewer risks, which can often unsettle the morale of employees. There’s little vision or innovation. However, the _best_ big companies continue to innovate, even under these conditions. We’ll explore this in detail in Part 5.



### Example: HP in the 1980s

As a young engineer at Hewlett-Packard in the 1980s, author Cagan was tasked with building a huge workstation that wound up costing over $100,000. Product reviewers were wildly impressed with the outcome, but it didn’t sell _at all._

He realized that the engineering team had done all that they could to deliver on their task, but that their product manager, who should have had a better handle on the marketing of the product (and whether there was a market for it at all), had failed. Cagan decided he would no longer work for teams where he wasn’t sure whether there was a market for the product they were building.

Since then, he’s helped to build many products, and while they’ve had varying degrees of success, none has been the abject failure that the HP machine was.
