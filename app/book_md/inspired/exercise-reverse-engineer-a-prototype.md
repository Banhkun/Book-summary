## Exercise: Reverse Engineer a Prototype

This exercise will help you better understand how to create prototypes.

* * *

Think about a technology product you use often. How would you pitch that technology product to test subjects who havenâ€™t seen it before?

What kind of prototype would you use and why (a feasibility prototype, user prototype, live-action prototype, or hybrid prototype)?

What would you hope to see at your demonstration that would suggest to you that the test subjects like the prototype and would actually use the product?
