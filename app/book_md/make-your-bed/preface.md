## Preface

In 2014, Admiral William H. McRaven, a retired Navy SEAL with 37 years of experience, gave the commencement speech at his alma mater, the University of Texas at Austin. In his speech, McRaven provided guidance to the graduates on how to manage life’s challenges and lead a meaningful life. **His advice comprised 10 lessons he’d learned during his tenure with the Navy SEALs that helped him deal with the trials of training and combat.**

For years following that speech, people reached out seeking more information about those lessons. In response, McRaven wrote this book to disseminate his lessons to a wider audience and share some of the personal anecdotes about the experiences that helped shape him. Although these lessons were developed in a military environment, McRaven believes they apply to the universal struggles people encounter in their daily lives.
