## Lesson 10: No Matter What, Never Give Up

When life gets tough or things don’t go your way, it is much easier to give in and quit than continue forward. Life is full of moments in which the odds of success seem so small, you can’t imagine ever winning. Throwing in the towel seems like the most logical thing to do. You can do that. You can feel pity for yourself, blame others, and complain about how unfair the world is. If you do these things, your life will be a long and uncomfortable journey.

**When you reach the precipice between quitting and continuing, hold steady and take another step forward.** Refuse to back down. Stand your ground and work despite the odds. As long as you keep moving forward, your life will be in your control. No one can stop you from doing what you love. Only you can quit, and you will likely regret it forever. Never, ever, under any circumstances quit. If life is going to beat you, make sure you go down fighting.

### The Backstory

McRaven stood at attention with 150 other SEAL hopefuls the first day of training. A commanding officer strode across the courtyard and stood next to a bell. He told the men what they could expect from the next six months. He would push them to their limits. He would make sure they understood pain. He would make them feel worthless and humiliated in front of each other. He would do everything in his power to get them to quit.

Then, the officer rang the bell. He said if any of them ever decided the training was too much, they could ring the bell three times. Ringing the bell would release them from all their pain. However, he said, if they rang the bell, they would likely regret it for the rest of their lives. **Quitting was easy, but it didn’t make life easier.**

On graduation day, only 33 of the original 150 trainees remained. Of all the lessons McRaven learned during his training, “never ring the bell” was the most significant. This lesson stayed with him during his career and helped him through difficult times. He also witnessed countless other service members refuse to quit, which inspired others to do the same.

One of the most significant examples of this refusal to give up came from a young soldier who’d stepped on a mine his first week in combat. McRaven visited him in the Afghanistan hospital and saw that the 19-year-old boy had lost both his legs and suffered massive burns to the rest of his body.

The boy couldn’t speak, but he knew sign language. Using a reference sheet, McRaven was able to hold a small conversation with the soldier. Before the boy drifted back to sleep, he signed four words: _I will be okay_. A year later, McRaven saw the young man standing with prosthetic legs. He was in uniform and back in the fold of his unit. He was joking around with fellow soldiers and looked every bit as okay as he promised he would be.

McRaven knew this young man refused to quit, even when faced with several medical procedures and months of rehabilitation. **He stayed strong and stayed the course, and he made it through to the other side.**

### How to Approach Life and Change the World

Put all of these lessons together to use as a mode of operation for how to change your life for the better. Remember:

  * Begin each day with an accomplishment.
  * Ask for help when you need it.
  * Give everyone the respect you want.
  * Realize that life is full of struggles and that you will fail. 
  * Use that failure to push you forward.
  * Be daring as you move forward. 
  * Put your best foot down when all hope is lost.
  * Find courage in the face of adversity. 
  * Lift up those who need help. 
  * Inspire others and yourself by never giving up. 



**Lead this type of life, and you can become anyone you want to be.** You may even save the world along the way.
