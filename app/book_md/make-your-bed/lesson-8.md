## Lesson 8: Stand Tall in the Midst of Darkness

Life encompasses many tragedies. You may lose a loved one, a job, or a dream. Terrorists may fly planes into buildings, and viruses may ravage a nation. There will be many moments in which your spirit gets crushed and makes you lose hope for the future.

These are the moments in which you must search for the best version of yourself. You must rise to the challenge of moving forward with strength and dignity. **In the darkest moments, do what must be done to show the world your best, and you can survive anything.**

### The Backstory

One of the most difficult tests the SEAL trainees had to pass was the final dive training mission. They were required to swim underwater for 2,000 meters and attach a practice mine to the bottom of a target vessel in San Diego Bay. They had to use a bubbleless SCUBA tool called the Emersion closed-circuit diving rig. This rig was known to malfunction, and rumor had it that some trainees had lost their lives during previous missions.

As McRaven and his fellow trainees stood on the beach awaiting orders for this mission, a thick fog rolled in, obscuring their already reduced line of sight. The commanding instructor seemed to sense the increased danger when he delivered the orders to the trainees. He warned the men that they would be in complete darkness and may become disoriented or separated from the group. He told them they would have to perform to the best of their abilities. They could not let fear, exhaustion, or a lack of confidence stop them. **In the darkness, they had to rise above and become warriors.**

McRaven never forgot those words over his career. And he saw this sort of behavior in many men and women over the years. Most notably, he was always awed by the strength these service members showed after one of their own was killed in combat. They would take part in the ramp ceremony, in which the casket was draped in the American flag and placed on a plane to be taken home.

After paying their respects, **these men and women had to rise above their grief and go back to combat and fight another day**. They couldn’t let the darkness overcome them. They knew their fallen soldier wouldn’t want them to give up. This type of strength in the face of their darkest moment was inspiring and showed McRaven what it meant to be your best in the darkest hour.
