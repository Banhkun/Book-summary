## Lesson 6: Be Daring in Life

As you learned in the previous lesson, failure is an eventual certainty in your life. More than learning from your mistakes, you first have to be willing to make them. **If you live in fear of failure, struggle, or humiliation, you will never do what is necessary to achieve your goals** or reach your potential.

Much of life is a struggle. In difficult times, you’ll feel fear. If you play it safe and limit your actions to mitigate failure, you will never know what you’re made of. You must learn to have faith in yourself and push past your anxieties to accomplish your goals. **You must be willing to push yourself to the limit to achieve something great.** Dare greatly in life and receive great rewards.

### The Backstory

SEALs-in-training must complete a strenuous obstacle course every now and then. Their times are recorded, and a poor time can mean joining the day’s Circus or suffering embarrassment in front of the other trainees. McRaven performed well on every aspect of the obstacle course except for the “Slide for Life.” This particular obstacle required the trainees to slide 100 feet down a rope that started 30 feet above ground. The optimal way to slide was headfirst on top of the rope, but it was also the riskiest technique.

McRaven was scared to slide headfirst. Instead, he hung below the rope feet first and inched his way down. After finishing with a dismal time one day, **the instructor told him he was never going to beat the course if he didn’t start taking risks**. McRaven knew he was right. The next week, he went headfirst down the Slide for Life and finished with a personal best. From this lesson, he learned that trusting in his abilities was required to push past what he thought was possible.

This lesson served him well in 2004 when he was in charge of a rescue mission of three hostages held by Al Qaeda. Rescue missions were performed at night to use the darkness as cover. But this day, intelligence informed them that the hostages were about to be moved. If they didn’t act fast, they would lose them.

McRaven gave the orders to conduct a Black Hawk rescue mission in broad daylight. It would be an incredibly daring and risky mission with no element of surprise. But **he trusted the abilities of the Black Hawk forces and knew they trusted their own**. McRaven watched the mission from his headquarters. The helicopters dropped into the small compound efficiently and were able to raid the buildings and save the hostages within minutes.

McRaven believes in the British Special Air Service’s motto, “Who Dares Wins.” This motto helped him during both of the above experiences. He believes everyone should use this motto when approaching their lives.
