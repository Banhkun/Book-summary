## Exercise: Remember Past Victories

Reflect on a past victory you can include in your cookie jar.

* * *

List your victories and hardships you’ve overcome.

Choose one victory or hardship from your list. How did you achieve or overcome it?

Think of a current goal you’re working to achieve. Write a 1-2 sentence statement that you can say to yourself about your past victory to remind yourself to continue toward this goal when you’re tempted to quit.
