## Exercise: Compartmentalize Your Schedule

Make time to do an activity that’s important to you.

* * *

What is an activity that you’d like to make time for in your day, and why?

What are 1-2 excuses for why you don’t have time for this activity?

Are these excuses valid? Why or why not?

List 1-2 activities that you waste your time on in a given day. Estimate how much time you spend on these activities.

If you cut down on the time-wasting activities, could you dedicate some of the time you’d save to the activity you’d rather be doing? Why or why not?
