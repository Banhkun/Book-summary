## Challenge 3: Get Used to Discomfort

Sometimes reaching your goals requires facing uncomfortable or difficult tasks. **Learning how to do things you dislike helps you take steps toward your goals instead of staying in your comfort zone.**

Goggins learned to face what made him uncomfortable during his service in the Air Force and the struggles afterward that motivated him to become a Navy SEAL.

### Air Force Stint

Goggins entered the Air Force because he wanted to become a pararescueman: a member of the Air Force troops that rescue downed pilots. But he faced a large obstacle: training to swim. Many of the rescue operations would be over water, so he needed to pass a series of water competency tests.

Growing up, Goggins didn’t have swimming lessons, and he could only do the most basic of strokes. He also had difficulty floating, which made many of the tests, like being able to tread water without moving your arms, difficult. He spent nights full of fear about the next swimming test he’d have to pass. **He doubted that he deserved to be there, felt rage toward the people in his cohort for having come from easier circumstances, and worried constantly about failing.**

Part-way through his swimming training, the Army doctors discovered that he had the sickle cell gene. Though he didn’t have sickle cell anemia, doctors at the time thought that having the gene placed him at risk for sudden heart attacks. They made him pause his training, then reversed the decision. He could complete his training, but because he had missed some, he’d have to start from the beginning or transfer to another team.

The choice provided him the reason to quit that he wanted after weeks of feeling he wasn’t good enough to be a pararescueman. He was physically strong, but he didn’t have the mental willpower to start over and overcome this obstacle.

Goggins served out the remainder of his term working in the Tactical Air Control Party, or TAC-P. He felt ashamed that he hadn’t continued with the pararescue, and he told his family he’d been forced to transfer because of the medical issue. **To address his shame, he exercised and built muscle mass. He weighed 255 pounds when he left.**

After Goggins’s service, he continued to put on muscle, but also fat, reaching 300 pounds. He liked being bulkier in order to look intimidating. It helped him hide the shame he felt for not completing his pararescue training. Still, he felt like he had no real prospects and worked a job in pest control.

### Training to Become a Navy SEAL

One day, Goggins watched a TV program about joining the Navy SEALs, one of the most elite special forces teams in the US military. He became convinced that he could find purpose for his life by becoming a SEAL.

He attempted to contact various naval recruiters, but most weren’t interested in recruiting previously-enlisted people from other parts of the military. One recruiter agreed to meet with him but was unwilling to enlist him because of his weight.

He found a recruiter willing to give him a chance, but to apply, he needed to get his weight down to below 191 pounds, the weight limit for a man of his height. He also needed to pass the same qualifying test he’d taken to get into the Air Force, but with a better score.

Goggins had 3 months to study for the test and lose 106 pounds. He started filling his days with running, swimming, biking, and weightlifting. At first, he could barely run 400 yards without needing a break.

If he skimped on any of his planned training, he made himself do the complete workout over again. For example, one day he decided not to do the last pull-up of his set, but he worried that cutting corners like that could cost him entry. So later that night, he returned to the gym and redid the entire set of 250 pull-ups. In addition to exercising, he adjusted his diet, eating small portions of healthy foods and ditching his go-to junk foods.

**When he started doubting himself—feeling like he was crazy for attempting this—or feeling depressed, he refused to wallow and worked to redirect that energy into the tasks at hand, like exercising.** He convinced himself that his struggles were evidence of having a new purpose in his life, which motivated him to stick with his training and studying. He was able to pass the exam and lose 106 pounds to qualify for entry.

### Take Action: Getting Used to Discomfort

To persevere and push yourself toward your goals, you have to learn to do things that make you uncomfortable.**The uncomfortable task can be related to your goals, but it doesn’t have to be—building your tolerance for discomfort will prevent discomfort from holding you back from your goals.**

As with the Accountability Mirror exercise, you’ll learn how to make incremental, achievable changes that last over time. Here’s how to practice:

  1. **Using your journal, write down things that make you uncomfortable or that you dislike doing.** Or, consider writing down things you aren’t doing, but should be.
  2. **Pick one and try doing it. Then, do it regularly.** For example, maybe you dislike flossing but want to make it a habit because it’s good for you.
  3. **Encourage yourself to do something every day that you don’t like.** Once something gets easier, make it more challenging. For example, if your goal is to run, get to one mile, then keep increasing the mileage.
  4. (Optional) Post a photo of yourself on social media and doing an activity you dislike, and explain why. Use the hashtags #pathofmostresistance #impossibletask #discomfortzone and #canthurtme
