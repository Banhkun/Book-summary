## Exercise: Identify Your Discomfort

Examine an activity you donâ€™t like to do to get comfortable with being uncomfortable.

* * *

Describe an everyday activity that you avoid doing, like flossing or taking a walk.

What are some reasons you avoid that activity?

Imagine trying to make that activity a daily habit. What would some of your excuses be?

What could you say to yourself to get yourself to do the activity and undercut the excuses?
