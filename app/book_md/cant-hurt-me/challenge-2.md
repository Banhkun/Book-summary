## Challenge 2: Set Up Your Accountability Mirror

You may struggle to take actionable steps to reach our goals. **In this challenge, you’ll learn to break your goals into smaller steps and regularly work toward them to achieve success.**

As a teen, Goggins continued to struggle with trauma, racism, school, and longing to join the Air Force. After receiving a particularly bad report card, he devised a way to make his goals more manageable: writing Post-it notes of goals on his mirror to hold himself accountable for reaching them. Goggins called this his “accountability mirror.”

### Trauma

In addition to the trauma Goggins faced at the hands of his father, another tragedy affected him and his mother in Indiana. His mother was engaged to be married to a man who was a good influence and provided some stability in their lives. They were scheduled to move into his Indianapolis home, but he was murdered days before the move.

Goggins and his mother moved to Indianapolis anyway, but his mother coped with her fiance’s death by busying herself with work. Goggins often skipped school and spent time with other kids, who negatively influenced his behavior. After his mom caught him skipping school with those students, she decided to move herself and Goggins back to Brazil.

### Racism

When Goggins lived in Brazil as a young kid, he’d been unaware of racism. This started to change when he and his mother moved back from Indianapolis. **Goggins faced a slew of direct and indirect harassment, from having his life threatened at gunpoint on a rural road to having a noose drawn in his Spanish workbook.** He struggled to understand how people could be so hateful.

Despite having many good friends, most of whom were white, he still felt the loneliness of being one of the only black people in town. He thinks it’s hard for people to understand the struggle of being the only person like yourself around, yet many minorities, women, and gay people face this daily.

#### Fighting Back

**Goggins felt a lot of strong emotions from facing racism, but he didn’t know how to channel them.** Seeking comfort, he watched the speeches of Malcolm X, the leader of the Nation of Islam whose movement called for racial justice for black people in the 1960s. He identified with X’s anger at a society that elevates white people, but he still couldn’t channel his frustration into anything beyond hate.

He started trying to come up with ways to get a rise out of the racists around him. He wore unusual clothing, trimmed his hair in odd ways, and blared music from his car.

### School Struggles and Air Force Aspirations

Though Goggins was now in high school, he still relied on cheating to pass school and was reading at a 4th-grade level.

One of his only motivations to stay in school was to play on the basketball team, but because he didn’t attend summer workouts, the coaches didn’t think he was committed to the team. **They let him go from the junior varsity team, even though he was one of the more talented players at the school.** With this loss, Goggins lost any remaining motivation he had to succeed in school.

But he wasn’t completely without purpose. He wanted to join the Air Force thanks to stories his grandpa shared with him of his time serving. However, he didn’t realize that he’d need to pass an aptitude test to join. When he found out, he assumed he’d be able to cheat on the test. On his first attempt, he was seated too far apart from other test-takers to cheat and couldn’t pass. This was the first wake-up call that he needed to change his behavior.

The second wake-up call came at the end of his junior year, when his mother received a letter informing her that her son wouldn’t graduate unless his attendance record and grades improved during his final year. This moment led him to a self-reckoning in his bathroom mirror.

### Accountability Mirror

When Goggins looked in the mirror, he felt frustrated with who he saw that day—a kid with few prospects who wouldn’t be able to make it into the Air Force without getting tough with himself and changing his behavior. He resolved to get into the Air Force by improving his reading skills and studying for the test.

To do this, he decided to use the mirror as a device to hold himself accountable and reach his goals. Each night, he wrote his goals for the next day down on Post-it notes and placed them on the mirror. Then, he’d make sure he worked toward his goals each day. Often, this involved giving himself a tough talk about what he needed to do and why. For example, he’d call himself out for being stupid and say he needed to study to fix that. He found this method more motivating than being gentle with himself.

During his senior year, he focused on studying and being in good physical shape. After he failed the Air Force entry test a second time, his mom connected him with a tutor. His tutor taught him to use memorization to learn, and he’d read textbooks and copy them, greatly improving his knowledge of reading and algebra.

As he grew his skills, Goggins gained confidence and spent less time upset with racists. He felt too focused and determined to reach his goals to let racists distract him. After 6 months of studying, he took the Air Force entry test again and passed.

### Take Action: Set Up Your Accountability Mirror

Making your own accountability mirror will help you break your goals and dreams into more manageable steps and offer a visible reminder of what you’re working toward.

Using Post-it notes or paper (rather than digital means), follow these steps:

  1. **Write down all of your insecurities.** Own your insecurities and use them as an opportunity to improve yourself. For example, if you’re overweight, call yourself out. It may seem mean, but in the US, we’re often too nice and avoid telling truths that could motivate us to change. Calling things as they are and becoming less sensitive makes it easier to work on improving yourself.
  2. **Write down all of your goals and dreams. Break them into small, specific steps, written on separate Post-it notes.** **Stick all your notes on the mirror.** Hold yourself to working on them each day. The insecurities could inspire your goals, but they don’t have to be related. For example, if you’re trying to lose 15 pounds, make a smaller goal of losing 2 pounds in the first week. When you’ve achieved each step, write a new Post-it for the next one.
  3. (Optional) Post a photo of yourself on social media with your mirror with the hashtags #accountabilitymirror and #canthurtme.
