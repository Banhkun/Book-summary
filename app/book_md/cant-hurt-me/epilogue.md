## Epilogue: Finding Peace

By age 38, Goggins had accomplished some impressive physical feats, but he started suffering health issues. He worked to find a solution, and later, retired from the Navy and pursued a new career.

### Feeling Close to Death

Goggins faced many health issues in the pursuit of new challenges—running on broken legs, a knee injury—yet he always kept pushing himself. Eventually, he couldn’t keep pushing through his pain.

**He felt fatigued all the time, no matter what exercise he tried.** Doctors ran tests but discovered nothing except slightly suboptimal thyroid levels, which is common for elite athletes. They prescribed him medications that hardly improved his condition.

He wondered if he was close to death, having pushed himself past the point of no return. Yet he didn’t feel regretful; he felt content. All those years, he pushed himself to greatness so that he wouldn’t be defined by his negative past experiences. For the first time in recent memory, he recognized that his accomplishments took extreme hard work, which he was proud of, and he didn’t care if he ran again, lived, or died.

Goggins learned two things from reflecting on reaching his goals:

  * He realized he’d always judged himself harshly because he worried he wouldn’t amount to anything or contribute to the world. And he judged people around him and got angry if they didn’t work as hard as he did. It damaged some of his relationships and opportunities. Once he realized this, he stopped judging himself and others.
  * He recognized that all of the people that had harmed him—by being racist or doubting him—shaped him into who he became. This made him feel appreciative and at peace.



### The Stretch Remedy

**In addition to reflecting on his mental health, Goggins realized he’d been missing out on a crucial aspect of physical health: stretching.** He’d heard a presentation about the importance of balancing strength training with flexibility, but he’d ignored the advice, thinking flexibility would somehow undermine his quest for strength. On his deathbed, with no other options, he decided to try it.

He learned that his muscles were so tight that it was limiting his blood flow and his body was shutting down. He started stretching hours every day, including during work, and his energy and health improved.

### New Career, New Challenges

Goggins retired from the Navy in 2015 and started a new career as a wildlands firefighter. He enjoys the physical challenge and being part of a team that enjoys it, too. He’s also continuing distance running and pushing himself to new lengths, though the rage he used to channel for motivation is harder to locate these days.
