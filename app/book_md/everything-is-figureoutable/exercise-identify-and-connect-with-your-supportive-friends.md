## Exercise: Identify and Connect With Your Supportive Friends

According to Forleo, living like things are figureoutable is easier when you have a support system you can call on when times get tough. In this exercise, we’ll help you evaluate whether you’re spending sufficient time with the most supportive people in your life.

* * *

In your life, who are the three people you spend the most time with?

Imagine approaching each of these people with a tough but solvable problem. How would each of them react? Would they be supportive or immediately discouraging?

If any of these people’s reactions is immediately discouraging, who is somebody else in your life that you think would have a more positive and helpful reaction? (If you imagined that everybody had a supportive reaction, skip to the next question.)

What’s one thing you can do to increase both the length and the quality of the time you spend with the people who support you?
