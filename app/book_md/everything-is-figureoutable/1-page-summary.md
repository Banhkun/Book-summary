## 1-Page Summary

What’s the secret to achieving your dreams, overcoming life’s challenges, and living the most fulfilling life possible? In her _New York Times_ best seller, entrepreneur Marie Forleo contends that the secret is to transform your mindset and live your life by the philosophy that “everything is figureoutable.”

Forleo garnered worldwide attention due to her work teaching aspiring entrepreneurs how to build a successful business. In addition to selling online courses on that topic, Forleo shares her own life and business advice and that of other experts on her weekly web show, _MarieTV_.

In this guide, we’ll first explain what “everything is figureoutable” means and why it works. Then, we’ll share how to apply that philosophy to your life so you can achieve your dreams and overcome all obstacles. Along the way, we’ll explore how Forleo’s advice reflects and differs from that of other self-help authors—and even of ancient Stoics’.

### Understanding the “Everything is Figureoutable” Philosophy

Before you can apply the “everything is figureoutable” philosophy to your life, you must first understand what it is. In this section, we’ll explain the philosophy and address some common criticisms.

Forleo explains that “everything is figureoutable” is a mindset with which you can approach every issue in your life. **When you believe that things are figureoutable, you believe that you’re capable of solving any problem you face** —although you may actively choose _not_ to solve an issue if it isn’t a priority.

You can apply this mindset to _all_ problems in life, even big ones like solving climate change: Even if you don’t solve the full issue in your lifetime, you can make huge progress—the same way that Martin Luther King Jr. didn’t solve racism but made huge strides. Forleo says she learned this philosophy from her mother, who had a fix-it attitude toward everything despite having just a high school education and lacking access to the internet. For example, when Forleo’s mother’s beloved radio broke, she took it upon herself to fix it—and succeeded.

(Shortform note: In _The Art of Learning_ , Joshua Waitzkin suggests a way that you too can instill in your children a sense of confidence that they're capable of solving any problem they face—even if you don’t model it the way Forleo’s mother did. When you praise your child for succeeding at a difficult task, emphasize the process they went through rather than their innate talents. By doing so, you’ll encourage your child to attribute their success to effort rather than their inborn abilities—and so they’ll grow more likely to persevere when faced with obstacles.)

Forleo clarifies that this philosophy holds true both when you don’t know what to do (like how to fix a radio) and when you face setbacks that seemingly prevent you from achieving your goal. For example, if you’re laid off during a recession, don’t resign yourself to not making any money because you’re convinced nobody is hiring full-time workers. Follow Forleo’s philosophy and look for other ways to make money—such as by searching for freelance opportunities.

(Shortform note: It’s easy to feel defeated when faced with setbacks. In _Barking Up the Wrong Tree_ , Eric Barker notes that one key to persevering is to tell yourself a good story. Your brain naturally tells stories about the random events in your life because doing so gives you a sense of control. These stories are often objectively untrue, as they lead you to ignore information that doesn’t fit into the narrative you’ve created, but they provide with you a sense of meaning that motivates you to surmount obstacles.)

Forleo addresses two common negative reactions to her philosophy. First, you might protest that you _can’t_ solve some issues. But Forleo counters that if something isn’t solvable, it’s not really an issue but a fact—for example, the reality that you can’t lose 100 pounds in one day.

Second, you might refuse to engage with the philosophy, either because you believe it won’t help you or because you’ve already heard it before. To counter this refusal, **Forleo recommends that you reframe your objections as questions** : Instead of saying, “I’ve heard this before,” or “This can’t help me,” ask yourself, “How can this help me?” Doing so will put you in a more positive, growth-oriented mindset because your brain naturally tries to answer questions.

(Shortform note: You can also counter your objections by adopting a sales technique and asking yourself, “What makes you say that?” In _Exactly What to Say_ , Phil M. Jones explains that this question forces you to justify your objection—which may help you realize that you don’t have a strong argument for your opinion and thus lead you to become more open to Forleo’s philosophy.)

> **How Forleo’s Philosophy Compares to Stoicism**
> 
> In some ways, Forleo’s philosophy reflects the ideas espoused by stoicism, a philosophy that stems from ancient Greece. According to _The Daily Stoic _authors Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman, the Stoics assert that you can control only what you think and not external circumstances. Despite Forleo’s claim that everything is figureoutable, the fact that she recognizes that you can only make progress on some issues rather than fix them—and also recognizes that some problems _aren’t_ solvable because they reflect realities—suggests she would agree with the Stoics’ assertion.
> 
> Moreover, Forleo’s recommendation to _not_ solve issues that you don’t prioritize reflects the Stoics’ recommendation that we be careful how we spend our time because we only have a limited allotment of it.

### Why Forleo’s Philosophy Works

You’ve now learned what Forleo’s philosophy is, but why does it work? In this section, we’ll explore why beliefs matter, how you developed your current beliefs, and how they can harm you. Then, we’ll examine how believing that all issues are solvable can mitigate the harm of what you believe and transform your life.

#### Understanding Your Current Beliefs

Forleo defines a belief as a conviction—something that you _know_ to be correct. **Your beliefs are important because they drive what you do and how you react to the world.** For example, if you believe you’re bad at math, you might not study for your math test because you don’t see the point—leading you to fail, which reinforces your belief that you’re bad at math.

Forleo explains that while you can actively decide what you believe, you likely also have several beliefs that you’ve developed unknowingly. Most of your beliefs stem from five sources: your surroundings, proof, your models, your history, and your dreams.

For example, you might believe you’re bad at math because your family says math is for boys (surroundings) or because your high school teacher said math was your weakest subject (proof). You might believe you can get into Harvard because your cousin did (models). You might believe you can become a professional writer because you won a writing competition (history) or simply because you _want_ to be one (dreams).

> **How Other Authors View Beliefs**
> 
> Like Forleo, _Awaken the Giant Within_ author Tony Robbins asserts that your beliefs drive your actions and how you react to the world. However, he disagrees both on how a belief is formed and what exactly it is.
> 
> Robbins asserts that you form a belief as follows: Each time you experience a positive or negative emotion, your brain links the emotion with other aspects of the experience, creating a “neuro-association.” As a result, your future thoughts about that activity or subject automatically trigger the same emotion. For example, if you once got sad news while listening to a certain song, your brain will associate that song with sadness; each time you hear the song in the future, you’ll likely feel sad.
> 
> Your brain creates neuro-associations because it’s looking for patterns, trying to form generalizations about which experiences are painful or pleasant. These generalizations create your beliefs about life and the world, and they are critical for learning.
> 
> But according to Robbins, a belief is initially just an idea that holds little power over you. It’s only as you develop a sense of certainty in a belief that it can grow into a conviction (the strongest form of belief). Robbins asserts that you develop this sense of certainty based on “references,” or proof. These references come from your personal experiences (or history), information from others (or your surroundings and models), or your imaginings (or your dreams).

Forleo warns that not all beliefs are good for you; some have harmful consequences. Although it’s possible to change these beliefs, it’s difficult due to our human tendency toward confirmation bias: We retain information that reinforces our underlying beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. For example, having abusive parents may instill in you a belief that you’re unworthy of love. So if your boyfriend dumps you, you’ll see it as confirmation that you’re unworthy of love—even though the fact that you’ve had the same best friend for decades suggests otherwise.

(Shortform note: In _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ , Rolf Dobelli notes that confirmation bias reinforces not just your underlying beliefs but things that you want to be true. For example, if you _want_ someone to like you, you’ll pay attention to clues that indicate that they do and ignore ones that don’t. However, your underlying beliefs ultimately overpower these desires—which explains why you’ll find evidence that reinforces your harmful beliefs (for instance that you’re unworthy of love) rather than evidence for your desires (that you’re worthy of love). To combat your confirmation bias and change your harmful beliefs, Dobelli recommends that you write down your beliefs and find evidence that disproves them.)

#### How to Protect Yourself From Harmful Beliefs

Instead of changing your beliefs, Forleo recommends you add a new belief: that you can figure out anything you set your mind to. When you believe in this philosophy, you’re able to combat the negative effects of having harmful beliefs without having to do the work of identifying and dismantling each one. Moreover, repeatedly acting according to this philosophy will make it even more beneficial because biology dictates that the more you repeat something, the stronger it embeds itself into your brain. So the more you tell yourself that all issues are solvable, the stronger your belief becomes.

For example, if you believe that everything is figureoutable, you won’t despair that you’re unworthy of love when your boyfriend dumps you. Instead, if you pinpoint the issue as “I don’t feel loved because my boyfriend dumped me,” you’ll look for ways to maximize feeling loved—whether that’s by dating again or looking for and learning to appreciate the love from others (like your best friend) that you _do_ have in your life.

> **How to Change Harmful Beliefs**
> 
> Adopting a belief that you can figure out anything you set your mind to and repeatedly acting according to it may mitigate the _effects_ of having harmful beliefs, but it doesn’t necessarily _change_ that harmful belief. For example, finding ways to maximize feeling loved may reinforce your belief that all issues are solvable, but you may continue to believe that you’re unworthy of love.
> 
> To _change_ your harmful beliefs, _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck _author Mark Manson recommends that you first question how each belief is helping you, as we only continue to believe things that provide some benefit. Then, write down some alternatives to that belief, and test them out to see how they improve your life. For example, you might discover that the belief that you’re unlovable helps you because it protects you from taking risks in your love life. You may then choose to believe instead that you are brave enough to chase love, then act as if you are—which may lead you to take a risk that ultimately leads to finding the love of your life.

To illustrate the power of believing that all issues are solvable, Forleo describes her own career trajectory. After graduating college, Forleo had several jobs, but none of them felt like the right path. When she learned about life coaching—still a relatively new career option at the time—she realized she wanted to become a life coach, but she had no idea whether she would succeed at it. She started her own life coaching business anyway, bolstered by the belief that she could overcome any issue she faced. This choice led to major success—Forleo built her life coach business into a multimillion-dollar company.

(Shortform note: Forleo may have grown so successful precisely because she struggled to find the right career. In _Range_ , David Epstein suggests that not knowing exactly what you want to do is better than knowing exactly what you want from an early age. Epstein argues that generalists (people who are broadly competent in several fields) are better suited to success than specialists because they have more transferable skills and are thus better able to adapt to the ever-changing realities of the modern world—including new technologies and new careers (like life coaching)—to solve problems.)

### How to Live Forleo’s Philosophy

Now that you know what “everything is figureoutable” means and why it works, how can you live it? Forleo contends that the first step is to **select a single goal to focus on.** In this section, we’ll first discuss why you should select a single goal and how to do so. Then, we’ll share how to combat two major reasons you might not pursue your goals.

#### Why You Should Select One Goal

If you want to live as though all issues are solvable, Forleo recommends that you start by selecting one clear goal for three reasons:

**1) A single goal allows you to practice implementing her philosophy.** If you’re new to living as though all issues are solvable, trying to apply that philosophy to multiple challenging goals will overwhelm you. Instead, **focus your energy on applying the philosophy to _one_ goal**; then, once you achieve it, use what you’ve learned to tackle your next major goal.

(Shortform note: In _The One Thing_ , Gary Keller also recommends focusing on just one goal, or “one thing,” so you can achieve great success. He doesn’t recommend this strategy as a way to live a particular philosophy, but he agrees with Forleo that focusing on one thing will foster a domino effect: Each success will lead to another success.)

**2) The process of selection forces you to stop _thinking_ and start _acting_ (by picking a goal)**, and actions will illuminate your life more than thoughts will. For example, Forleo debated for years whether she could become a dancer—but she knew she _wanted_ to pursue dance only when she took a dance class __ as an adult and realized that it was a passion.

(Shortform note: In _Designing Your Life_ , Bill Burnett and Dave Evans also emphasize the importance of acting rather than just thinking when deciding what you want to do. However, they recommend that you map out three potential directions for your life and then test them to figure out what you like and dislike about each direction. You can test by pursuing exploratory experiences, which give you first-hand knowledge of the path you’re considering—just as Forleo did when she took a dance class to test whether she wanted to pursue dance full-time. They also suggest interviewing experts in your chosen field; for example, Forleo could have interviewed a professional dancer to decide whether the dancer’s life was right for her.)

**3) The more specific you are about what you want to do, the more likely you are to do it.** Forleo explains that when you’re clear about your goals, you make your reticular activating system—a neural structure that sorts through stimuli and helps you decide what to focus on—more sensitive to anything related to those goals. As a result, you start to notice things in your everyday life that can help you achieve your goals, which makes you more likely to achieve them.

(Shortform note: Like Forleo, Keller states in _The One Thing_ that having a specific goal will make you more likely to achieve it. However, this isn’t because narrowing your focus sensitizes your reticular activating system to things that help you achieve your goals. Rather, Keller explains that by narrowing your focus, you stop doing things that don’t matter—and so while you do fewer things, the things you do have greater impact and thus lead you to success. That said, this depends on your having big goals; unlike Forleo, Keller emphasizes the importance of thinking big and focusing small.)

#### How to Select Just One Goal

Now that you’ve learned _why_ selecting a single goal matters, _how_ do you do so? Forleo recommends that you start by writing down several goals for the next year. Then, select a few goals from the list, and rate how much each one matters to you on a scale of one to 10. Ignore any goals that rank below seven, as they’re not important enough to warrant your focus. If a goal _is_ over seven, rate how hard achieving it would be on a scale of one to 10. (Rating the difficulty is not meant to discourage you but to provide clarity on what you’re signing up for and prepare you mentally.) Finally, if you’ve failed at this goal before, briefly describe why you failed and how you could act differently.

Once you have a few options, review your list and write down the single goal you’d like to spend your energy on—as Forleo notes, writing down your goal will increase the chances you’ll achieve it by 42%. This goal should be something you’re passionate about, not something society says you should want. And don’t feel pressured to take on a big goal. Your goals can be as small (or as big) as you want them to be—whether that’s mastering Chinese cuisine or attaining world peace.

(Shortform note: The origins of the statistic that writing down your goals will increase the chances you’ll achieve them by 42% are unclear. Other authors attribute it to a study by Dr. Gail Matthews, but her study doesn’t say that; it found that people who didn’t write their goals down achieved them at a 43% success rate, while people who did had a 60% success rate.)

Forleo says **you’re more likely to stick to your goal through setbacks if you link it to a greater purpose**. So while it’s OK to start pursuing a goal primarily for personal ambition, it’s better if you can link it to a loftier ambition that involves helping others. For example, your goal to master Chinese cooking might be a way to express your larger purpose of providing an environment in which your friends and family can deepen their social connections.

Once you’ve decided on your goal, Forleo recommends converting it into something specific that you can measure and act on. To start, think of three simple 10-minute things that you can do _today_ to pursue your goal—and do them. Focus on things that are action-oriented rather than research-oriented (to avoid getting bogged down by research) and that are within your control (to ensure that success doesn’t depend on outside factors). For example, instead of “master Chinese cooking to impress my foodie friends,” write, “memorize five Chinese dishes.” Then, sign up for a Chinese cooking class instead of purchasing a cookbook.

> **How Forleo’s Ideas on Selecting One Goal Compare to Gary Keller’s _The One Thing_**
> 
> Like Forleo, Keller states in _The One Thing_ that linking your goal to a purpose is essential. However, he recommends starting with this purpose, which he calls your big One Thing, and defines as the thing you want your life to be about more than any other—even if that thing isn’t something that helps others. Moreover, he recommends starting with your purpose not because it helps you persist through setbacks but because it increases your happiness, which he contends occurs in the process of living according to your purpose.
> 
> To discover your purpose, Keller recommends writing down a handful of activities (like a hobby) and outcomes (like bringing joy to others) you’re passionate about. Pick one activity and one outcome most important to you. Then, combine your activity and outcome to answer the question, “What’s the One Thing I can do that would mean the most to me, such that by doing it everything else would be easier or unnecessary?”
> 
> Once you discover your ultimate purpose, Keller recommends that you find the smaller “one thing” at each stage that will help you get there. Working backward from your ultimate goal, figure out what one thing you need to do in the next 10 years, five years, one year, one month, one week, and today—for example, ask yourself, “What’s the One Thing I can do today to be on track to reach my goal for this week?”
> 
> Keller notes that you’ll likely have several possible actions you can select for your One Thing. Rather than focus on short, action-oriented things that are within your control, Keller recommends that you do the thing that is possible but requires going beyond what’s been achieved before. To do this, start by researching ideas and role models to suggest a direction. Then, establish a benchmark—the highest level that’s been achieved so far—and look for the next level that you can achieve.

### How to Overcome What’s Holding You Back

Even if you select a goal, you still might not do anything to pursue it. Forleo writes that there are three reasons for this: You deny your agency, you don’t see the point, or you’re afraid. We’ll discuss each of these barriers in detail.

#### You Deny Your Agency

The first reason you may not go after your dreams is that you believe you’re _unable_ to. However, Forleo argues that in most cases, when you say, “I’m unable to do this,” what you really mean is, “This is not a priority for me.” Using the word _unable_ allows you to deny the agency you have over your own life. She recommends adopting the mindset that you are totally in control of your life—at least over your actions and how you respond to circumstances. Recognizing that you have control forces you to become more proactive and to solve any issues you may face.

(Shortform note: In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck_ , Manson agrees that you must take responsibility for your life, as you can always choose what you think and how to behave in any situation. Further, he points out that denying your agency and refusing to accept the control you have is also a choice you’re responsible for. Therefore, the question isn’t _whether_ you believe you’re in control of your life but rather _what values_ you’ll base your decisions on: Will you choose to be proactive and solve your issues, or will you continue to ignore your agency?)

Forleo notes two common ways we try to deny our agency.

**1) We believe we lack the time to pursue our dreams.** If this is you, spend a week recording how you spend your time, then look for ways to free up two hours each day; you likely can do so by limiting how much time you spend on your cell phone or watching TV.

(Shortform note: In _168 Hours_ , Laura Vanderkam contends that to find the time to pursue your dreams, you must actively schedule your week around your priorities. To do so, she also recommends that you spend a week recording how you use your time. Then, instead of looking for how you can free up bits of time that might eventually add up to two hours, schedule your priorities _first_ —and either eliminate or reduce unimportant tasks (like spending time on your cell phone or watching meaningless TV shows).)

**2) We believe that we lack money.** If this is you, look for free courses that will teach you what you need to know; alternatively, sell your possessions, apply for a scholarship, or get a part-time job to cover your expenses.

(Shortform note: In _The Power_ , Rhonda Byrne suggests that if you have negative feelings about money (like believing that you lack it), you’ll repel it. So even if you find free courses, get a part-time job, sell your possessions, or receive a scholarship, you’ll lose all this money and benefits unless you transform your relationship with money and start having positive feelings about money. To develop these positive feelings, Byrne recommends that you react positively to any situation involving money, such as by only paying bills when you’re in a good mood.)

#### You Don’t See the Point

The second reason **you may not pursue your goal is that you don’t see the point—after all, other people have already done it.** You assume you don’t have anything novel or unique to offer the world, so there’s no point in trying. However, Forleo argues that nobody else has pursued this goal in exactly the way you have: You possess a unique combination of experiences and expertise you can apply to your goal, and **if you don’t pursue it, you’re robbing the world of something valuable**.

(Shortform note: If you’re refusing to pursue a goal because you think you have nothing new to offer the world, you may be operating from a “scarcity mentality,” which _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ author Stephen Covey defines as a belief that there are limited resources, and one person’s success must come at the cost of another’s. Instead, adopt an abundance mentality—a conviction that one person’s success doesn’t come at the expense of another’s. This will allow you to pursue your goal even if other people have done something similar because you know that the world has room for both of you to succeed.)

To illustrate, Forleo describes how, despite her husband’s best efforts, she didn’t start to eat healthily until she encountered the work of wellness activist Kris Carr. Had Carr never pursued her dreams, Forleo might never have changed her diet—even though her husband spent years telling her the same things she learned from Carr.

(Shortform note: Why was Forleo receptive to Carr’s advice but not her husband’s? It may be because Forleo’s husband _advised_ her on healthy behavior while Carr both advised her on and _modeled_ healthy behavior. Psychologists note that we often respond poorly to advice because we resent being told what to do. However, we respond well to modeling; when people exemplify desirable behaviors that have clear benefits, we naturally want to copy them.)

#### You’re Afraid

The third obstacle to believing all issues are solvable and that you can reach your goals is being afraid. Forleo gives guidelines for tackling fear in general as well as four common fears: fear of pursuing your dreams, not being ready, not being good enough, and being an imposter.

##### Understanding Fear and How to Beat It

Forleo argues that while fear can be a warning sign that you’re about to make a mistake, it can also be a _good_ thing: **If you’re afraid to do something, it’s often a sign that you care deeply about it—and so should do** **it**.

To determine what exactly your fear is telling you, try this exercise: First, relax your body by taking several deep breaths. Then, ask yourself whether doing the thing that scares you makes you feel open or closed off—and pay attention to how your _body_ reacts. If you feel enthusiastic and like a weight has been lifted, that’s a good sign. If your muscles tense and you feel nauseated, consider holding off.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree that fear shows up in your body: Tension is a sign to stop and listen to the fear while openness is a sign to act anyway. Another metaphor they use to describe whether to listen to your fear is to see whether it’s “pushing” or “pulling” you. If you feel as though your fear is pushing you _away_ from something, like derision, then you should consider listening to it. But if you feel as though you’re being pulled _toward_ something, then you should act on your goal, even if fear pushes you away.)

Assuming that your fear is a good sign, how can you push past it? Forleo recommends against waiting for your fear to dissipate because it will only fester. Instead, **you must act _despite_ your fear—which is the only way to beat it**. In other words, you must do the thing that scares you despite being afraid. This is the only way to become braver—and the braver you become, the more willing you’ll be to tackle new challenges.

One area in which the power of acting despite your fear is particularly evident is when you learn a new skill. Forleo explains that the skills you're confident in are in your “comfort zone,” or zone of safety, and the skills you don’t yet have are in your “growth zone,” or zone of improvement. Initially, you’ll struggle to tackle skills in your zone of improvement—but as you get better at doing them, your zone of safety will expand to include these skills. The more you expand this zone of safety by learning new skills, the more confidence you’ll gain and the more willing you’ll be to tackle new challenges in your zone of improvement.

> **How Forleo’s Ideas About Fear Compare to _The 10X Rule_**
> 
> Forleo’s ideas regarding fear reflect those in _The 10X Rule_ , in which Grant Cardone recommends pursuing goals that are 10 times bigger than what you might be inclined to pursue. Like Forleo, Cardone suggests that fear is often a sign that you’re moving in the right direction, that repeatedly acting despite your fears is the only way to overcome fear, and that doing so will boost your confidence and thus make you more willing to take risks.
> 
> Unlike Forleo, who contends that waiting for your fear to dissipate will merely prevent you from chasing your dreams, Cardone contends that waiting for your fear to dissipate will increase it: The more time you spend thinking about and imagining what could go wrong in a situation, the more apprehensive you become. Additionally, Cardone emphasizes that you should use fear to motivate yourself, because the actions you fear most will often give you the greatest return.

##### How to Conquer a Fear of Pursuing Your Goals

Now that you know that acting is the key to beating your fear, what specific actions should you take? If you’re too intimidated to pursue your dreams, Forleo recommends that you follow a three-step process.

First, **name your fear** : The less clear you are on what you’re afraid of, the more intimidated you’ll feel. To name your fear, imagine the worst possible outcome of pursuing your goals, and decide how likely this outcome is. Then, brainstorm how you’d respond if this outcome came true. Second, **imagine what would happen if you succeeded** : List all the possible positive outcomes of pursuing your dreams. Third, **review your action steps** and either proceed as is or change them so that you’re more comfortable pursuing your dream.

For example, if your dream is to move to Los Angeles to be an actor, your worst-possible outcome might be that you discover you’re terrible at acting and end up homeless. If so, you could adjust your plan and focus on building an emergency fund before moving to LA. And if you ended up homeless, you could search for shelters or find a way to contact loved ones who could help you.

> **How Other Authors Recommend Dealing With a Fear of Chasing Your Dreams**
> 
> Many authors echo Forleo’s advice on naming your fear. In _Courage Is Calling_ , Ryan Holiday explains that Roman philosopher Seneca suggested that logically deconstructing your fears will take power away from them. This is because humans tend to imagine the worst-case scenario related to our fears, but the truth is often a lot less frightening; for example, by deconstructing your fears, you may realize that the worst-case scenario is unlikely and thus not worth worrying about.
> 
> Logically deconstructing your fears may be useful not just for dealing with the worst-case scenario but also the best-case scenario. In _The War of Art_ , Steven Pressfield argues that people often refuse to pursue their dreams because they fear success: They’re worried that success will change the comfortable life they’re used to and about the level of pressure they’ll feel to maintain that success. So consider what scares you about succeeding, and adjust your action steps to help you deal with that. For example, if you worry that being too successful at your business will take time away from your family, you might emphasize hiring the right people so that you can delegate more work to them.

##### How to Conquer a Fear of Not Being Good Enough

According to Forleo, another common fear that prevents people from pursuing their goals is a fear of not being good enough. Many people never act on their dreams because they’re terrified that they’re not capable of achieving them. This fear manifests itself in two ways. First, you might worry that you’re not ready and try to _prepare_ for rather than _pursue_ your goals. Second, you might not pursue your goals because you want to ensure that everything is _perfect_.

> **How Not Pursuing Your Goals Might Lower Your Self-Esteem**

> Although Forleo focuses on how a fear of not being good enough prevents you from pursuing your goals, _The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem _author Nathaniel Branden warns that this fear may lower your general self-esteem. Branden contends that a belief in your own general capability to deal with life’s challenges is an essential element of self-esteem. Moreover, he asserts that if you _act_ as if you’re capable, you improve your self-esteem; if you act as if you’re not capable, you lower your self-esteem.
> 
> So if you continuously prepare for (rather than pursue) your goals or don’t act because everything’s not perfect yet, you’ll be acting as if you’re not capable of doing the work necessary to achieve your goals, which will lower your self-esteem—and may make you even less likely to pursue those goals.

To combat a fear of not being ready, Forleo suggests two strategies. First, if you’re paralyzed by self-doubt, ask yourself: **Will I be upset in 10 years if I don’t go for this now?** Imagining your potential future sorrow can motivate you to act today. Second, **put something you value at risk** —like your finances or your reputation. Humans experience “loss aversion,” which means we’re affected more strongly by loss than by gain, and thus we prioritize not losing things over gaining things. So, for example, telling someone you’ll give them $100 if you _don’t_ work on your goal is more motivating than learning that someone will give __ you $100 if you _do_ work on it.

> **How We Prioritize Our Present Selves**
> 
> According to _The Willpower Instinct_ author Kelly McGonigal, putting something you value at risk may be more motivating than imagining your future self. McGonigal explains that we struggle to work in the best interests of our future self because our future self’s feelings and emotions aren't as real or as present as what we're feeling right now. So, for example, even if you know that 10-years-in-the-future-you will love that you went to the gym daily, you’re still more likely to spend your gym day on the couch because that’s more immediately rewarding.
> 
> Our tendency to prioritize our present selves may also explain why we experience “loss aversion,” a term coined by the authors of _Thinking, Fast and Slow_. Loss aversion is an evolutionary trait passed on from early humanity, when losing something—like weapons or food—was often fatal. So while prioritizing _not_ losing something (like $100 if you don’t reach your goal) may seem like you’re prioritizing your future self, it may actually be a way you prioritize your present self because your brain sees not losing $100 as essential for survival.

To combat your perfectionism, Forleo suggests that you change your mindset and **prioritize _improving at_ your skills rather than doing them perfectly**. In other words, you must be willing to fail and to recognize that sometimes, things that _feel_ like failures might actually have a positive impact. This is particularly important if you're starting out in a creative field, as you’ll likely have an excellent vision that you’re not able to bring to life because you're not yet skilled enough. However, the only way you’ll improve these skills is by repeatedly practicing them—which necessitates that you continue to create things, even though they don’t meet your high standards.

(Shortform note: In _Steal Like an Artist_ , Austin Kleon says that if you’re an artist, prioritizing improvement rather than perfection can help you. Kleon explains that the only way to become an artist is to create art. So you must be willing to do the work and start creating. To do so, start by copying the work of your creative heroes. You’ll definitely “fail” at doing so because your work won’t measure up to theirs. However, these seeming failures actually have a positive impact: The ways that your copies differ from the original are what make you unique as an artist—so leaning into them will help you discover your creative voice.)

To illustrate the power of pursuing your goals and being willing to fail, Forleo describes the trajectory of her dance career. Initially, Forleo thought that to be a serious dancer, she had to try to go on tour with famous artists, so she auditioned for a music video. Forleo failed this audition.

However, Forleo now views this seeming failure as a blessing in disguise because it forced her to rethink what she _really_ wanted to do with her dance career. Despite her lack of experience, she pivoted to teaching dance classes—a journey that ultimately led her to audition for MTV despite her fears that she wasn’t prepared. Forleo passed this audition, and her MTV career gave her the broadcast experience she would eventually parlay into her successful YouTube show, _MarieTV_.

(Shortform note: If you genuinely fear you're not good enough, you may not find Forleo’s story motivating. After all, with the exception of the audition she bombed at, all the experiences Forleo describes are ones in which she succeeded _despite_ her fear of failing. But what if you’re actually not good enough? It may help to remember that nobody is good enough at first: Researchers have found that both successful and unsuccessful people experience failure. So it’s not _whether_ you fail that predicts success; rather, what matters is how you respond to failure. Successful people learn efficiently from their failures and try again _quickly_ —the longer you wait to try again, the less likely you’ll be to achieve success.)

##### How to Conquer a Fear of Being an Impostor

According to Forleo, you may still face fears as you start to succeed. This phenomenon is known as “impostor syndrome,” a feeling that you’re faking and will be “found out.” It’s particularly common among marginalized groups, who may feel less confident in their abilities—especially when they have few colleagues they can relate to.

Forleo shares two strategies for combating impostor syndrome. First, collect any praise you receive (like good reviews), and revisit this collection whenever you feel unworthy. Second, call some trusted friends, tell them you’re feeling negative about yourself, and ask them for support. Both tactics remind you of your accomplishments and capabilities.

> **What Others Say About Combating Impostor Syndrome**
> 
> Forleo’s strategies for combating impostor syndrome are similar to those of other authors. In _Steal Like an Artist,_ Kleon also suggests that you save every compliment you get in a folder that you can revisit when you need a reminder that people appreciate your work. In a blog post, Kleon clarified that he uses the “labels” function in Gmail to build his own praise file—although you could record praise in a notebook if you prefer a more analog approach.
> 
> Other experts also emphasize the importance of having people in your life who can help you deal with impostor syndrome—especially if you’re part of a marginalized group; Black and Latina women are particularly prone to it. However, having people in your life who can help you deal with impostor syndrome may not take the form of a trusted friend you can call in a weak moment, especially if your friends won’t be able to relate to your issues. Try looking for a community that can understand what you’re going through—for example, if you’re feeling impostor syndrome at work, you might join a women’s group in your industry.

### How to Deal With People Around You

Now that we’ve discussed how to deal with the _inner_ fears that stop you from pursuing your dreams, we’ll discuss how to handle the _outer_ influences on living like all issues are solvable. In this section, we’ll first discuss how to deal with critics. Then, we’ll discuss how you can adjust your environment to make sure it’s as supportive as possible.

#### How to Deal With Critics

As Forleo notes, people are prone to judging others—and so you must accept that you will inevitably face criticism. This criticism may be hurtful, but it’s not _inherently_ a bad thing: Some criticism is constructive and can help you improve if you listen to it well. For example, your boss may suggest that you reply to emails more promptly because your delayed responses make people think you don't care about their requests.

So how should you respond when you encounter criticism? Forleo recommends that you first **determine whether it’s constructive or purely hurtful.** To do so, consider _who_ is criticizing you and your relationship with them. If you care about this person’s opinion, consider adjusting your behavior as they think you should. If not, try not to let their criticism affect you. Consider making a joke and laughing off their comments. Alternatively, since unwanted criticism often comes from people who are discontent in their own lives, choose to be sad for them rather than letting their comments enrage you.

> **Other Ways to Deal With Criticism**
> 
> In _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ , Dale Carnegie points out that you’ll face criticism no matter what—you’ll always find at least one person who’s not on board with your choices.
> 
> To prevent yourself from reacting poorly to your critics, Carnegie suggests that you preempt criticism. First, become your own worst critic. By doing so, you’ll ensure that you won’t be taken by surprise by others' (constructive) criticism. Furthermore, doing so gives you the opportunity to learn how criticism of your work can yield positive results, on your own, less emotionally charged terms. Second, practice responding positively to criticism by _asking_ others for constructive feedback.
> 
> If the criticism isn’t justified, Carnegie suggests you take it as a compliment. Like Forleo, Carnegie implies that someone who criticizes you unfairly is discontent with their own life; they’re only criticizing you to make themselves feel more powerful. So instead of getting upset, view their criticism as a compliment: It signals that you’re accomplished enough to garner criticism, and whatever you’re doing is _worth_ jealousy and attention.

#### How to Garner Support

On the opposite end of the spectrum, Forleo explains that **if you want to live like things are figureoutable, it’s better to have connections** with people **who _also_ believe in this philosophy**. The more support you have, the more likely your network will include people whose expertise you can draw on to overcome challenges—and even if their expertise _isn’t_ helpful in a particular situation, having supportive friends increases your resilience.

(Shortform note: In _Who Will Cry When You Die?_ , Robin Sharma also encourages having a positive, growth-minded network. This is because while you can’t possibly accrue all the experiences you need to pursue your purpose firsthand, you can gain the _learning_ you’d acquire from those experiences second-hand from others. Sharma recommends building an active group of three to four people who offer mutual support in achieving goals and that you meet weekly with this group to talk through current challenges.)

So how can you ensure that your connections remain supportive? Prioritize your relationships so that if you need to call on your loved ones for advice, they’re happy to help you. Tell your friends and colleagues about Forleo’s ideas. And model “figureoutable” behavior at work so that your behavior might rub off on others and inspire them to focus on solutions rather than challenges.

(Shortform note: In _Barking Up the Wrong Tree_ , Barker offers more specific recommendations for ensuring that you prioritize your relationships. He suggests that you first imagine how much time you’d like to spend doing four things: pursuing joy, reaching your goals, connecting with others, and making an impact—all elements of a successful life. Then, review your current schedule to figure out how much you’re spending on each element now, and adjust your schedule to fit your ideal. By doing so, you’ll ensure that you have sufficient time available for your loved ones and won’t neglect them in favor of other priorities (like work).)

To illustrate the power of having a support system of people who also believe that all issues are solvable, Forleo describes a crisis that she faced in her business: She and her team had a promotional campaign planned around several interviews they’d filmed in Europe, but all their equipment—including their footage—was stolen shortly before the deadline. They weren’t able to change the deadline because they already had many partners onboard. Instead, living Forleo’s philosophy, the team banded together to come up with solutions. They returned to Europe to re-film the interviews and successfully met their deadline.

> **Structural Barriers Can Impede Problem-Solving**
> 
> Both Forleo’s recommendation to preach and model “figureoutable” behavior and her story about the crisis she faced reflect a level of privilege that may not be available to others. Notably, some people face structural barriers—like racism—at work, and preaching or modeling “figureoutable” behavior may not help them. For example, in theory, a Black employee subjected to racial slurs by his white manager faces a “figureoutable” problem; in reality, confronting the manager or complaining about his manager to HR may invite retaliation.
> 
> Moreover, Forleo’s crisis was only solvable because she had money: She could fund both the cost of new equipment and the cost of last-minute round-trip flights to and from Europe. If her company had been struggling financially, this would have been a far more difficult problem—and while technically solvable, may not have been solved in time despite their best efforts.
