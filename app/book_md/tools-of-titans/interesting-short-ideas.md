## Interesting Short Ideas

Here is a wide variety of less commonly-repeated ideas from  _Tools of Titans_. There are many more ideas in the original book than we have space to cover here, so as always, read the original book to get all the useful tips.

### How to Raise Your Kids

Titans mentioned various childhood influences that made them who they are today, or practices they use with their kids:

  * LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman played a lot of complex board games, which helped him grasp complexities in different circumstances. This came into use in Paypal when they had to figure out how to make a complex business profitable.
  * Author Seth Godin: Teach your kids how to lead and how to solve interesting problems, by giving them interesting problems. Our nation needs to compete on the international stage through creativity, not through better obedience or physical labor.
  * Girls should be taught to confront their fear, and should be urged no more caution and protection than boys are.
  * Chessplayer Josh Waitzkin: Don’t typify weather as good or bad to your kids—this trains them to tie their mood to an external factor like weather. It’s better to say “it’s a beautiful rainy day” and go outside and play anyway.
  * Entrepreneur Bryan Johnson: Have kids introspect about what they’re doing without following them closely, like when teaching riding a bike. “What were your thought processes when you were doing this? What risks did you take?”



### Miscellaneous Interesting Ideas

Here is a hodgepodge of interesting ideas with no particular organization.

When asked a question, don’t take it directly. **Answer the question you wanted to be asked** , and direct the answer to what you want to focus on (this is a standard PR technique).

  * In response to Tim’s question “who do you think of when you hear the word ‘successful?’”, author Derek Sivers answered that the first person you think of isn’t that interesting, since it’s automatic. More interesting is the third person who comes to mind.
  * In response to a question about his favorite tech trends, investor Peter Thiel replied he doesn’t like thinking in terms of trends since that means lots of people are doing it, and competition is fierce. Instead of trends, he prefers a sense of mission instead.



**Catching cheaters in school:** As a professor, Luis von Ahn made a puzzle and called it something fictional, like Giramacristo’s Puzzle. He then put the solution on his own website where he could track the IP’s of people who Googled the answer. After a few times of doing things like this, his students were afraid there was always a trick, and people stopped cheating.

Tim Ferriss’s writing tip: When writing a draft, **use ‘TK’ as a placeholder for things you need to research later**. Few or no words in the English language have these two letters together. You can then search for ‘TK’ later to find everything you need to fix.

**When getting interviewed by a journalist, record the audio on your side as well** , so you can use the tape for your own purposes. Check that they’re OK with repurposing the audio.

**Personal security** : as Tim Ferriss became more famous, he had to worry more about his safety. He picked up a few tips:

  * Kidnappings are common when being picked up at airports (the kidnappers disguise as drivers and hold up a placard with your name). To avoid this, book a fictitious name for your car reservation, or just use Uber.
  * To protect your data on a computer, use an encryption tool like “You’ll Never Take Me Alive,” which hibernates the laptop when the power is disconnected. This prevents the thief from accessing data through a vulnerability when the laptop is still on.



**Learning the macro from the micro:** chess player Josh Waitzkin learned chess not from starting with the opening moves, but from the end game—just two kings and a pawn. This simple situation taught larger principles, like empty space and opposition.

**Cooking as a bonding exercise:** You might start as strangers, but when you’re cooking, everyone’s united in the same goal of creating a project together and not losing their fingers. Everyone can contribute a different skill set to the project.

**How to get strangers to invite you home to eat and sleep:** while traveling in Europe, journalist Cal Fussman would ask people, “how do you make the perfect goulash?” He’d ask a grandma, and translators would help translate, then each person would want to show him their local speciality.

**Picking the best recipe online:** Andrew Zimmern suggests finding the recipe that is most specific. If someone describes the process in a deep level of detail, like the size of the pan to the quarter inch, you know they’ve gone through it and worked out all the kinks. If they just say “grease the pan,” you know something is wrong.

Don’t obsess about taking notes about everything. The good stuff will stick.

  * Chef Joshua Skenes: He lost all his recipe notes in a flood, but he was able to start from scratch again and built the Three-Michelin star restaurant Saison.
  * Author Paulo Coelho: Don’t take notes. What’s not important will fade away. What’s important will remain. 



**Getting feedback over the phone:** comedian Mike Birbiglia likes getting feedback about bits and jokes over the phone. In person, the listener feels the pressure of laughing or responding. On the phone, the listener is more comfortable staying silent, which tells you enough about how funny the joke is.

**Keep the house lights on when performing on stage.** When speaking, Brené Brown wants to see people’s faces, so it’s a connection, not a performance.

**The uncaged tiger:** A tiger named Mohini was held in a 10-by-10-foot cage for 5 or 10 years. Eventually it was released into a big pasture, but it spent the rest of its life in a corner 10-by-10-foot area. The message: even when you have freedom, you might put artificial barriers for yourself.
