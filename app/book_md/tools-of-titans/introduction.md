## Introduction

In the 707-page  _Tools of Titans_ , Tim Ferriss shares the habits and beliefs of 101 high-performing people, including tech investors, entrepreneurs, athletes, and entertainers. The premise of the book is that if you emulate the habits and beliefs of people who succeed the way _you_ want to succeed, you too can be successful.

The book is very broad, covering a wide range of aspects on how to become healthy, wealthy, and wise. The point of the book is not to absorb everything covered, but rather to identify the points that most resonate with you. The author notes that different readers highlight very different points from the book as their most important lessons.

To get more out of the book, **spend time engaging with the questions that provoke you**. One major theme in the book is an emphasis on action, not information. As Derek Sivers says, “If more information was the answer, then we’d all be billionaires with perfect abs.” Take time to reflect on what you’ve learned. Think on the meta-level—how do you learn to think like the people in the book?

At the same time, be aware of when you skip an area or dismiss it as irrelevant. Does this signal a deep problem you’re afraid to examine?

### Shortform Introduction

The book is organized into 140 short chapters, each devoted to one person or a set of ideas from Tim Ferriss. While this organization suits the author’s purpose—to pay homage to the titan and make it easier to find people you care about—it makes finding the main themes difficult.

Therefore, we’ve restructured the book completely, focusing on the major themes of habits across all 101 people. This lets you see the patterns of what the titans do—how they motivate themselves, how they succeed in work and business, how they stay happy, and how they stay healthy.

As the author notes, there are so many ideas that you’re not supposed to emulate them all. Instead, choose just a handful of your favorite ideas and implement them methodically.
