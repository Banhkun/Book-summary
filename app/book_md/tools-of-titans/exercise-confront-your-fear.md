## Exercise: Confront Your Fear

If you feel afraid of doing something, try this fear exercise.

* * *

What change do you really want to make in your life, but are afraid to?

If you made the change you’re afraid of, what is the absolute worst that could happen? Picture the situation in vividly clear detail.

How permanent would this damage be? If this happened, how could you work your way back and recover?

How likely is this absolute worst case outcome, from 0% to 100%?

Now that you’ve pictured the worst case outcome, what’s the best case outcome? What’s a realistic good outcome? How would your life be better here?
