## Exercise: Discover and Challenge False Beliefs

Beck explains that often we fall out of alignment because we believe things about ourselves and our lives that are simply not true. In this exercise, you'll have a chance to identify and challenge a belief that might be holding you back.

* * *

Beck argues that we can find our mind's “forbidden zones” by looking at the topics that make us most anxious. Are there any topics that make you so anxious you avoid thinking about them? Explain what they are, and what about them makes you so anxious.

Spend some time reflecting on why this topic makes you so anxious. Is there something you _believe_ that is making you anxious? If so, write it down.

Now that you've identified the belief that is making you anxious, ask yourself: Can you be _absolutely sure_ this is true? Explain why or why not.
