## Brief Biography of Sam Walton and Wal-Mart

(Shortform note: Published in 1992, _Made in America_ covers the history of Wal-Mart, from a single store in Arkansas to a worldwide retail titan. The book is written chronologically as a narrative, with Walton reflecting on his management and life principles throughout. 

To create a more useful summary, we’ve reorganized to group all the main themes together, with examples from the narrative. We’ll start here with a brief biography, then dive into the management techniques that made Wal-Mart the giant it is today.) 

###  Sam Walton’s Early Life 

Sam Walton was born in Oklahoma in 1918 and moved to Missouri with his parents. He credited his dad for being a hard worker with high integrity and a great negotiator, and his mother for ambition and drive. 

Sam notes that his parents argued a lot, and they split up after he grew up. He felt like he “took a lot of the brunt of this domestic discord,” and this possibly motivated him to stay busy all the time. 

Walton was competitive throughout his early life: **“It never occurred to me that I might lose...almost as if I had a right to win.”** He led his high school football and basketball teams to championships, and he became president of his college senior class. 

After supporting himself through college, he was tired and wanted a real job. He joined JC Penney in Des Moines, Iowa for 18 months. 

In 1942, he was rejected for overseas combat duty for World War II and instead served limited duty domestically in the United States. Dejected, he quit JC Penney and worked at the Du Pont gunpowder plant. He met future wife Helen Robson in a bowling alley at this time, then entered military service. 

###  Sam Walton’s First Store 

In 1945, after 2 years of Army duty, Sam Walton wanted to go into business for himself. Helen gave him two rules: 1) no big city (population under 10,000) and 2) no partnerships (her family had seen business partnerships go sour, and she wanted him to work for himself). 

This prompted Sam to buy a Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. He funded this with $20,000 as a loan from his father-in-law, plus $5,000 from personal savings. 

The variety store (also known as a “five and dime” store) was a type of retail store that offered a wide range of inexpensive household goods. 

**Walton’s first store was the crucible where he learned the fundamentals of retail** . Here he created a distinct retail strategy that set his store apart from competitors: 

  * Lower pricing—Walton wanted to sell products at lower prices and lower profits, believing that sales volume and customer loyalty would compensate. 
  * Promotion—Walton knew that a spectacle would draw customers from other stores. He served ice cream and had popcorn stands outside the shop. 
  * Suppliers—he found offbeat sources for low-cost goods, which allowed him to undercut his competitors on pricing. 



These principles would continue to underlie Wal-Mart for decades to come. 

In his first year of ownership, sales increased 45%. After 5 years, his Ben Franklin store became the highest selling in 6 states. 

Unfortunately, the lease for Walton’s store expired, and his contract had no option to automatically renew the lease. The landlord, knowing he was in a bind, bought out his store. Sam Walton had to start from scratch again. 

With his $50,000 from his store sale (worth roughly $500,000 in today’s dollars), Sam Walton moved his family to Bentonville, Arkansas, where he bought another struggling shop and turned it into another Ben Franklin franchise. He named the store “Walton’s Five and Dime.” This time they tried to get a 99-year lease. 

###  The Beginning of Wal-Mart 

Now armed with the experience and strategies of his previous store, Walton set his eye on expansion, with the goal of setting up more stores in the local area. In 1954, he opened a store in a suburb in Kansas City, and by 1962 he would own 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas. He also began moving away from the Ben Franklin franchise, naming the new stores “Walton’s Five and Dime.” 

**Critically, he believed the large retail companies (such as Woolworth) underestimated the opportunity available in small towns.** Competitors specialized in metropolitan areas, servicing large populations. Instead, Walton felt that there were thousands of small towns like Bentonville that were being ignored. If Walton’s stores could offer superior pricing and selection locally, he knew customers would prefer to shop there instead of driving into the city. 

###  Wal-Mart Transforms 

By 1960, Walton had built up to 15 stores with $1.4 million in sales, but this wasn’t satisfying enough. He now saw two threats (and potential opportunities): 

  * The rise of massive superstores, with over 100,000 square feet of floor space 
  * The rise of discount stores, which were disrupting traditional department stores. 



Rather than be disrupted by both of these seismic trends, Walton chose to take advantage of them. Where he had previously built five-and-dime variety stores, Walton would now embark on the path that Wal-Mart is now known for today—large discount stores. 

**In 1962, the first Wal-Mart discount store was established in Rogers, Arkansas** , with 18,000 square feet. It started as a moderate success at first (with $1 million in sales per year, compared to Sam’s benchmark competitor at $2 million in sales), but clearly it was doing better than their variety stores. 

  * Walton actually intended to partner with the owner of his former franchise in Newport (Butler Brothers) but they rejected his proposal to be their merchandiser. This put a bit of a chip on Sam’s shoulder and fueled his drive to succeed. 



After two years, Wal-Mart began expanding to nearby towns. Competitors were starting to eye the discount store trend, so Walton needed to move fast. By 1968 they had 13 Wal-Marts; by 1969, they had 18. 

Wal-Mart also continued to operate the business more systematically. They hired managers to set up a warehouse distribution center, formal accounting systems, and company communications. This would help build the economy of scale that would drive Wal-Mart’s relentless growth for decades to come. 

(Shortform note: In the following chapters, we’ll go much deeper into detail on the management strategies that Walton and Wal-Mart used in their rise to retail dominance.) 

###  Wal-Mart Goes Public 

By this point, Walton had taken on a few million dollars in personal debt to finance store growth. They began getting turned down by banks for more loans. To pay off his debts, **Sam Walton wanted to go public.** In 1970, they consolidated the separate store partnerships into a single company, went on a roadshow, and went public, raising around $5 million. 

  * $1 in Wal-Mart shares in 1970 would be worth roughly $5,312 in 2018. 



**Wal-Mart continued its strategy of expansion:**

  * Set up a store within a day’s drive of a distribution center 
  * Fill in the surrounding areas with stores until saturated 
  * Add more distribution centers, and repeat 



The big competitors such as Kmart still weren’t going into towns smaller than 50,000, while Wal-Mart was working in towns smaller than 5,000. While leapfrogging from big city to big city, the big guys spread themselves out and became subject to city politics. 

When serious competition did finally arrive, Wal-Mart stuck to its strategy: “keep our prices as low as possible by keeping our costs as low as possible.” 

To enable the expansion, Sam continued hiring people in operations and distribution to handle things he tended to ignore. 

###  Continued Growth 

**From 1970 to 1980, Wal-Mart relentlessly pursued its strategy and more than doubled every 2 years** : 

**Year** |  **Stores** |  **Sales** |  **Profits**  
---|---|---|---  
1970  |  32  |  $31 million  |  $1.2 million   
1972  |  51  |  $78 million  |   
1974  |  78  |  $168 million  |  $6 million   
1976  |  125  |  $340 million  |   
1978  |  195  |  $678 million  |   
1980  |  276  |  $1200 million  |  $41 million   
1984  |  600  |  $4500 million  |  $200 million   
  
However, the growth didn’t come without turbulence. In 1974, they faced a schism in the company, with one executive vice president (Ferold Arend) representing the old guard in merchandising and store management, and another executive vice president (Ron Mayer) representing the new guard in finance, data, and distribution. 

Ron told Sam Walton he wanted to run his own company, and Sam feared losing him. Sam, CEO at the time, was contemplating taking a back seat to focus on his hobbies (such as quail hunting). To solve both these issues, Walton promoted Ron to CEO. 

But Sam Walton wasn’t suited for retirement, and he wasn’t able to be hands-off on management. He disagreed with some of Ron’s decisions and intervened, and he worried about the company’s schism. 

30 months later, Sam returned as CEO. In response, Ron left with many of his loyal managers. This was called the “Saturday night massacre” and eventually led to a third of senior management leaving. Wal-Mart’s stock value dropped, and Sam admitted he wasn’t sure if Wal-Mart would make it out of this alive. 

Gradually, Sam Walton continued recruiting talent, including David Glass for distribution, who eventually became CEO himself. 

###  Nearing the End of Walton’s Life 

Competition heated up in the 1970s, especially from Kmart, and Wal-Mart tackled them head-on in their territories. 

  * In Springfield, MO, Wal-Mart had 40 stores within 100 miles. When Kmart came in with 3 stores, they had a tough time competing. 
  * Wal-Mart also acquired a few chains in areas where they had little presence, like 100 of Kuhn’s Big K stores in the South. This geographical spread forced them to upgrade their communication and management practices. 



In 1983, Wal-Mart faced competition from ultra-discounters like Price Club, which sold at a meager 6% markup compared to 22% in discount stores. In response, Wal-Mart started Sam’s Club. **Sam felt this was something like a second childhood, a chance to build a company all over again.**

The book was published in 1992, the same year that Sam Walton died. At the end of his life, Sam Walton focused on two things in Wal-Mart’s future: 1) international expansion, and 2) competition in discount retailing. He confidently expresses that no competitor has been able to operate on their volume as efficiently, nor service customers as well. 

As a final record, here is a summary of Wal-Mart’s staggering growth over 30 years. 

**Year** |  **Stores** |  **Sales** |  **Profits**  
---|---|---|---  
1960  |  9  |  $1.4 million  |  $.1 million   
1970  |  32  |  $31 million  |  $1.2 million   
1980  |  276  |  $1200 million  |  $41 million   
1984  |  600  |  $4500 million  |  $200 million   
1990  |  1528  |  $26000 million  |  $1000 million   
  
(Shortform note: Sam Walton passed away before Amazon rose to challenge Wal-Mart for retail supremacy. Given Walton’s successful history of adapting to trends like discount stores and mega-stores, it would have been fascinating to see how Walton would have taken advantage of the Internet.
