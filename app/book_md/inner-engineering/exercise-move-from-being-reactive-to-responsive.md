## Exercise: Move From Being Reactive to Responsive

Sadhguru says you must move from being a passive victim of circumstance to an active master of your own life, which means making a shift from being “reactive” (having an unconscious reaction) to being “responsive” (having a conscious response).

* * *

Can you think of a situation in your life when you were unconsciously “reactive”—for example, when you reacted with anger or another destructive emotion? What happened? Describe how you felt during and after the reaction.

How could you have responded to that situation in a more consciously “responsive” way? For instance, if you had paused and taken ownership of those feelings as coming from _you_ , rather than being caused by the other person, how might that have affected your response?

Is there something or someone in your life that regularly “makes” you angry, frustrated, or stressed? How might you deal with those emotions differently by thinking about them as being something _you’re generating within yourself_ , rather than being caused externally?
