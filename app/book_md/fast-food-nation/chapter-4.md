## Chapter 4: The Rise of Big Agribusiness

Because fast food was so successful, its labor practices have been exported throughout the food service industry and up the supply chain to farmers, ranchers, and meatpackers. So much food in America is no longer a product of artisanal craftsmanship, created by a skilled cook—it is a manufactured, mass-produced commodity.

In this chapter, we’re going further up the supply chain. We’re going to explore how the economics of the fast food industry have reshaped American agriculture, examine where your fries really come from, and why they taste the way they do.

### J.R. Simplot

It’s hard to tell the story of fast food’s meteoric success without telling the story of the french fry. And it’s hard to do that without telling the story of John Richard Simplot, America’s potato king.

Born in 1909, his family moved to Idaho shortly after he was born to establish a farm (made possible thanks to government-funded irrigation projects and free public land). Leaving the family’s homestead at 15, he went into the potato industry. His business grew throughout the 1920s and 1930s as he forged relationships with commodities brokers and farmers all over the country. By 1941, he was the largest shipper of potatoes in the American West, owning dozens of warehouses across multiple states.

That year turned out to be a momentous one for the country and for Simplot, as the US entered World War Two. The swelling ranks of servicemen created a massive demand from the armed forces for food suppliers. He used his massive market share and dehydrating technology to become one of the principal suppliers of foodstuffs to the US Army from 1941-1945.**He used these earnings to buy potato farms, cattle ranches, fertilizer plants, and lumber mills, all of which enabled him to achieve vertical integration up and down the supply chain**. His company could now grow its own potatoes, provide its own fertilizer, process them at their own factories, and ship them from their own warehouses and lumber yards, all without ever interacting with an outside supplier.

#### The Frozen Food Revolution

While this was going on, frozen food was becoming more and more available to ordinary Americans. Although it had been around since the 1920s, most Americans didn’t own freezers at that time, and certainly not when the Great Depression hit just a few years later. But this would all change in the postwar economic boom of the 1950s: now, suddenly, freezers were mass-produced and cheap. Their sales soared, as did those of frozen foods.

**Simplot saw a golden opportunity in the frozen french fry.** They were easy to produce, easy to eat (they didn’t require a knife and fork), and there was a growing demand for them thanks to the exploding popularity of the new fast food restaurants. Indeed, these fast food restaurants (McDonald’s in particular), with their demand for a uniform and standardized product, were the ideal institutional customers for Simplot’s frozen french fries. This made sense from Ray Kroc’s perspective—**they could cut labor costs and achieve enormous economies of scale by purchasing Simplot’s frozen fries in bulk.**

### Effects on US Farmers

**Fast food’s popularization of the french fry has radically reshaped US agriculture.** As of the publication of _Fast Food Nation_ , three major producers controlled 80 percent of the frozen french fry market. With this purchasing power, they wield enormous leverage over the nation’s potato farmers and strive to keep prices for them as low as possible. In economics, this situation is known as an oligopoly. This is when **a handful of powerful buyers have enough market share to dictate prices to suppliers more or less at will**. The farmers have benefited little from the nation’s demand for frozen fries since the 1950s: of every $1.50 spent on an order of fries, perhaps two cents accrue to the actual farmer (a little over 1 percent).

The only way farmers can compete under these economic conditions is to grow enough potatoes to make up in volume what they have lost in value. If you’re getting barely one cent on the dollar for the potatoes you grow, you need to grow _a lot_ of potatoes to make your farm even remotely profitable. But that’s not easy either—growing more potatoes means more capital expenses in land and equipment. Farmers increasingly stretch themselves thin and take on debt to acquire new land, with no guarantee that they will be successful. **Indeed, their fortunes are increasingly tied to world economic forces far beyond their control**. Many formerly small, independent farmers simply don’t make it. They end up selling their land to major agribusiness concerns, who then bring them back as hired hands to work the land they once owned.

### Manufactured Taste

It’s not an accident that a meal purchased at one Taco Bell tastes exactly the same as one purchased at another. As we’ve seen, fast food strives to deliver a uniform product to customers that’s the same everywhere in the world.

They achieve this remarkable homogeneity of taste through the artificial food flavoring industry. **This industry creates chemical compounds that create the scent and flavor of the foods we love** , even if those ingredients are almost entirely absent from the processed food you’re consuming. They can make you taste blueberries without using a single blueberry.

Companies like International Flavors & Fragrances manufacture many of the tastes in the foods we consume every day, including those we experience at fast food restaurants. Everything from potato chips, breads, cakes, cookies, ice cream, teas, malt liquors, and toothpastes have their flavors tested and designed at industrial chemical facilities off the New Jersey Turnpike. The process involves the manipulation of chemicals to produce a desired smell (as most of what we taste actually comes from our sense of smell).

These companies are always innovating, using cutting-edge technology to improve the quality of the flavors they produce. They have even created synthetic mouths that provide detailed information on the textures of different food items. They are a key supplier to the major fast food chains and their additives appear in nearly all items sold there.

**Notably, the Food and Drug Administration does _not_ require flavor companies to disclose what’s in their additives**, leading to euphemistic labeling on food packages like “artificial flavor.”

### The Struggles of American Ranchers

**Much like potato farmers, cattle ranchers have seen their livelihoods and their way of life irrevocably changed by the fast food industry**. Family cattle ranches have given way to corporate-owned factory farms; meanwhile, the rugged, independent rancher of American folklore has become a dying breed. From 1980 to 2000, roughly 500,000 of them quit the business entirely.

The demands of fast food have encouraged consolidation in the meatpacking industry, as it has across nearly all agricultural commodities. **This has created vastly disproportionate power imbalances in the market** —with major meatpackers holding all of it and independent cattle-raisers having virtually no leverage at all. With only a few major meatpacking giants to whom they can sell their cattle, ranchers have little recourse when they’re faced with falling prices.

### An Unfree Market

Ranchers had faced similar oligopolistic conditions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but they were able to fight back against the major meatpackers thanks to legislative and regulatory reforms passed during the Progressive and New Deal Eras. Indeed, for much of the middle of the 20th century, ranchers were able to sell in reasonably competitive markets with far less concentration than today.

But this all changed in the 1980s, when the Republican administration of Ronald Reagan began taking a hands-off approach to antitrust and anti-competitive enforcement in the meatpacking industry. A wave of mergers and consolidations followed, such that **the top four meatpackers controlled a whopping 84 percent of the market by the beginning of the 21st century.**

Naturally, this has led to downward pressure on the prices that independent ranchers can expect to get for their cattle. The major companies are able to set prices more or less at will through their ownership of “captive supplies” of cattle. These are animals that are held in reserve in company-owned pens and feedlots. When the companies conclude that the prices ranchers are demanding for cattle are too high, they simply release their captive supplies of cattle and flood the market, pushing prices back down.

**The major meatpackers also use secrecy and anti-competitive practices to put ranchers at a disadvantage**. Specifically, they acquire cattle from large and wealthy ranchers through secret contacts, in which neither party discloses the amount that was actually paid. This makes it nearly impossible for independent ranchers to know what their products are actually worth, since they have no basis of comparison from comparable trades. The secrecy puts the ranchers in the position of being forced to accept the prices offered by the meatpackers, with little leverage to negotiate.

#### Collusion

The big meatpackers have acted in concert with one another to further gouge the independent ranchers, with **some cases reaching the levels of blatantly illegal collusion**.

(Shortform note: Collusion is when firms that are supposed to be in competition with one another team up in order to raise prices or shut out potential rivals. This is often done through price-fixing schemes, wherein the major players in a market will all agree to raise their prices at the same time—raising _all_ of their profits while leaving the customer with no choice but to pay exorbitant costs. This is illegal under federal trade law.)

This was standard practice at Archer Daniels Midland, one of the meatpacking giants. In 1999, three of their executives were sent to federal prison after being caught conspiring with international rivals to corner the market on a specific additive to cattle feed. Through this scheme, the company had illegally overcharged ranchers to the tune of $180 million.

### The McNugget and the Poultry Industry

A similar dynamic has played out in the poultry industry. **The invention of the McDonald’s Chicken McNugget in the early 1980’s reshaped how American chickens were raised and sold.** It transformed a bulk agricultural commodity into a branded, manufactured, and value-added product. As such, fast food companies began to take a much greater interest in how poultry farmers raised their birds, seeking ever-greater product uniformity.

The idea behind the McNugget was simple: a boneless chicken finger-food no larger than the size of a human thumb. The early tests of the product were so successful that McDonald’s partnered with leading chicken processor Tyson Foods to ensure an adequate supply. The Arkansas-based Tyson Foods even developed a new breed of chicken exclusively to be made into McNuggets.

The success of the McNugget made McDonald’s America’s second-largest purchaser of chicken (KFC, perhaps unsurprisingly, was #1). Their massive buying power (and that of the few major chicken processors from whom McDonald’s buys, like Tyson) wrought major changes for the nation’s chicken farmers. As with beef, consolidation and concentration became the hallmarks of the industry.

**Today, most chicken growers aren’t independent at all—they’re essentially contracted employers of the big chicken processors** , on whose behalf they raise the birds. Companies like Tyson own the chickens themselves and closely supervise every aspect of how they’re raised, including veterinary schedules, feeding schedules, and equipment. The growers exercise almost no independent discretion at all. What the chicken grower _does_ provide is the labor and the major capital expenses like land, fuel, and chicken coops. They often must go deep into debt in order to make the necessary capital investment to become a Tyson contractor.

All of this is deeply distressing for American ranchers and poultry growers. These were once seen as the central icons of the American West, the epitome of American ruggedness and independence. For them to be reduced to the status of hired hands for the big agribusiness firms represents more than a reduction of their livelihood—it is a loss of a way of life and a destruction of one of the most powerful symbols of the American historical experience.
