## Prologue: We Are What We Eat

Most Americans have eaten fast food at some time or another in their lives. As the reach of major fast food chains like McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Burger King, and Taco Bell has extended across the planet, the same can increasingly be said of most people _around the world_. As it has done so, **fast food has come to stand as a hallmark of our civilization and our time**. Just as we ponder the amphorae and marble ruins of the ancient Romans, so may future scholars study the discarded Big Mac wrappers and golden-arched fast food restaurants of our culture.

For indeed, food is one of the defining traits of a culture—it shows how we live, how our economy functions, how our political institutions operate, and what we value and prioritize as a society. Since its rise in the postwar United States, **fast food has worked its way deep into the fabric of America’s social, economic, educational, and political institutions**. In the 30 years between 1970 and 2000, consumer spending on fast food in the US rose from $6 billion to $110 billion.

(Shortform note: Fast Food Nation was originally published in 2001. As such, the statistics cited throughout the book and throughout this summary do not represent the most up-to-date data. Where possible, we have supplemented the numbers in the book with more current figures.)

These numbers give a glimpse of the grip that fast food has obtained over American life, but they can only tell part of the story. Because the story of fast food is about much more than the rise of an industry and the success of a few entrepreneurs—**it is a story about the fundamental transformation of a society.** The sheer size of the fast food giants and the spread of their business practices to other sectors of the economy has wrought enormous changes in:

  * How American food is produced and sold
  * The physical health of the population
  * The conditions under which we work and the wages we are paid for our labor
  * The legal and political system under which we live
  * The appearance of our towns and cities



**In many ways, the story of fast food is the story of the American West—and specifically, the story of Southern California in the postwar boom years of the 1950s**. It was here that the low-density suburban housing sprawl, automobile-driven economy, and youth-centric consumer culture that would come to define so much of the rest of the country (and prove so conducive to the fast food industry’s success) got its start. Underpinned by a political ideology that emphasized low taxes, weak regulation of business, and small government, the Los Angeles suburbs of the 1950s proved to be fertile soil in which the fast food industry could sprout and grow to take over the country. It is there that we begin our story.
