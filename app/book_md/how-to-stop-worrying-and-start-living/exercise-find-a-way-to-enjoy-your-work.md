## Exercise: Find a Way to Enjoy Your Work

Finding a way to enjoy your work can reduce your boredom and worry and increase your energy.

* * *

Describe the work you do that makes you feel bored, frustrated, or anxious.

How can you force yourself to find your work interesting? (For example, creating a personal challenge to increase your data entry speed each day, or setting a goal to get 100% of your copy editing tasks finished at least one day before their deadline.)

What can you gain by finding your work interesting? (For example, your data entry efficiency helps you get accepted for a similar, but much more interesting job or your editor-in-chief promotes you as her personal copyeditor.)

Describe the pep talk you’d like to give yourself before heading into your work. (For example, “Even though data entry isn’t my passion, I can still stand out and show my dedication to hard work. My small daily improvements are setting me up to make a big step into work I love.”)
