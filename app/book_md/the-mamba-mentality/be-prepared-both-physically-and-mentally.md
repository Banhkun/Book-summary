## Be Prepared, Both Physically and Mentally

An NBA game lasts for 48 minutes—but Kobe spent many hours preparing and training for each game. Kobe needed both physical and mental agility on the court, so his pre-game routine worked out his body and mind.

Kobe didn’t rely on a fixed warmup routine before games. Instead, he had a general circuit of drills. He always started by shooting close to the basket. Gradually, he’d move farther back, and, finally, he’d practice a variety of shots that he might need for that night’s game. However, the primary factor that dictated Kobe’s warmup was how his body was feeling—**whether he felt he needed more shooting practice, a longer stretch, a meditation session, or a catnap, Kobe always listened to his body.** This principle also forced Kobe to adjust his warmups as he got older, because his 40-year-old body needed a lot more stretching than his 20-year-old body had.

Kobe started stretching hours before a game. As game time approached, he gradually transitioned to more active movements with a broader range of motion. Kobe paid attention to detail in all areas of his career, and he was well aware that pain and stiffness in certain body parts could be symptomatic of tightness in a different muscle. Because of this, Kobe made sure that his ankles were active and limber, because ankle stiffness could cause pain in his knees, hips, and back.

Besides physical preparation, Kobe also prepared mentally and emotionally for games. When Shaq was on the team, he and Kobe joked around and talked trash in order to get their energy up for the game. This was important not just for their own preparation, but also because it set the tone for the team. As team leaders, Kobe and Shaq initially emanated high energy and levity, then grew more serious and focused as game time approached.

**At the end of each game, when other players rushed off to shower and change, Kobe began his preparation for the _next_ game by dedicating time to recovery. **After every game—and every practice—Kobe spent 20 minutes icing his knees and shoulder in order to reduce the muscle inflammation. In this way, Kobe maintained a never-ending cycle of preparation.

### Train to Master Basic and Advanced Skills

Kobe was strategic about improving his skills in every aspect of the game—and that started with fundamentals. Many other players neglected the fundamentals, to the extent that **Kobe’s focus on the basics actually gave him an edge over his competitors.** While other players practiced dribbling tricks like crossovers, Kobe worked on making his footwork efficient. With the right footwork, Kobe could get where he needed to go on the court quickly while conserving energy. Additionally, as long as his feet were pointed in the direction he was going, Kobe could turn his head and upper body in a different direction to fool his defenders.

In his endless effort to enhance his game, Kobe was never intimidated or discouraged when he noticed areas where he could improve—rather, he welcomed the challenge. In the fifth game of the semifinal series at the end of his rookie season, Kobe shot four airballs that killed the team’s chance of advancing. Despite the disappointment, he never worried that his missed shots would ruin his career. **Kobe was confident that he was destined to be an NBA great—he just needed to put in the work to get there.** Kobe determined that he’d missed those shots because his legs were spent after a long season, so he started a weight training program to strengthen his arms and legs, and he came back stronger for his second season.

He also made a point of having a versatile, well-rounded set of skills. As a child, Kobe wanted his left hand to be as strong and agile as his right, so he practiced writing his name with his left hand. As he got older, he took the same approach with dribbling—he was just as strong at dribbling with his left hand as he was with his right. Similarly, he practiced shooting and passing from all distances in a variety of conditions. His versatility had two primary benefits:

  1. When Kobe faced opponents who had researched his strengths and tendencies, he was able to catch them off-guard by switching up his direction and his pace.
  2. When he had to play through injuries, he could adjust his playing style (for example, by playing with his left hand) and still have a strong game. 



Kobe trained with a focus on staying in control. In other words, **Kobe worked to avoid letting his opponent limit or otherwise dictate how he could play.**

### Maintain Mental and Emotional Control

As in any sport, playing basketball at an elite, professional level requires not just physical ability but also mental and emotional control. Players can get derailed if they get frustrated in the heat of the game, cocky and complacent when the scoreboard favors them, or discouraged and self-pitying when coming back from an injury. **Although Kobe wasn’t immune to emotional highs and lows, he made a point of staying calm and focused.**

While other players listened to music as part of their pre-game routines, Kobe adapted his preparation based on the mindset he would need for the game: If he felt a game would require him to be high-energy, he listened to music that pumped him up. If he felt a game would require him to be calm and focused, he listened to calm music. Sometimes, Kobe sat in total silence and took in the sights and sounds that surrounded him. This was a habit he had had since childhood, but when he started playing under Phil Jackson and learned that it was a form of meditation, he practiced it even more deliberately.

That state of mind also allowed him to be strategic on the court, and to use the insight he’d gained from watching film of opposing players and teams. Two, three, and even four opposing players often guarded Kobe when he drove to shoot a basket. Instead of shying away, Kobe considered defenders’ playing styles—whether they were likely to foul him or jump straight up to try to block his shot. Based on his guards’ tendencies, he then decided whether to pivot and pass to an open shooter or to drive through his opponents to the basket. **Kobe’s thorough preparation and mental clarity enabled him to make these split-second evaluations in the midst of a game.**
