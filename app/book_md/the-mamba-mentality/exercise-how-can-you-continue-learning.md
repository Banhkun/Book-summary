## Exercise: How Can You Continue Learning?

Reflect on resources you can use to continue expanding and refining your skillset.

* * *

Describe one area of your life in which you’re trying to improve your skills.

Name at least one person who excels in the area you’re trying to improve.

Have you worked with that person as a mentor or studied her skills from afar? If so, what did you learn? If not, how could you best learn from her (for example, reach out and ask to pick her brain over coffee, or watch YouTube videos of her using that skill)?

What other resources could you tap to increase your knowledge and skills in this area?
