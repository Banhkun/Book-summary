## Introduction: Be Disciplined

This book pairs brief reflections and commentaries written by Kobe Bryant alongside iconic photos from the Los Angeles Lakers’ official photographer Andrew D. Bernstein to offer a view inside the mind and career of one of the greatest basketball players in NBA history. Kobe was drafted into the league from high school, and he spent his entire 20-year career with the Lakers. During that time, **Kobe became a leader on his team and in the league, and he was admired for his unrelenting drive and commitment to becoming the best basketball player he could be.** That, in essence, was the Mamba Mentality.

(Shortform note: Kobe dubbed himself the Black Mamba after facing sexual assault charges in 2003. The charges were eventually dropped, but the incident still caused backlash and hurt Kobe’s reputation. In order to cope, Kobe created this nickname—inspired by Quentin Tarantino's 2003 movie _Kill Bill_ —to separate his personal life from his alter ego on the court.)

There is no single definition of the Mamba Mentality. At first, Kobe just thought it was a catchy play off of his Black Mamba nickname. But, over time, it came to represent a mindset that encompasses hard work, obsessive preparedness, and dogged persistence on the journey to achieving a goal. **The Mamba Mentality transcends basketball—it applies to anyone who is striving to achieve greatness in her field.**

(Shortform note: For the sake of clarity, we’ve grouped Kobe’s advice and reflections into the themes that represent the Mamba Mentality, including discipline, preparedness, and persistence.)

### Work Harder Than Everyone Else

From a young age, Kobe had an intrinsic motivation to do anything necessary to become a top-notch basketball player. His internal drive was always stronger than any external force. **Kobe wanted to be great, and he knew that to be great, he had to be obsessive: He had to work harder than everyone else and make sacrifices others were unwilling to make.**

At the core of his obsession was Kobe’s mental focus. He deliberately trained himself to improve his focus—through reading, studying the game, and paying close attention to the coach during practice—so that he could be present and aware at all times. **Kobe was also unafraid to fail, because he considered everything a learning opportunity.** When he discovered a new move or technique that he wanted to add to his repertoire, he didn’t shy away from the learning curve—instead, he practiced the skill endlessly until it was embedded in his mind and muscle memory.

Throughout his career, Kobe maintained a grueling schedule, which included both early mornings and late nights. Kobe realized that if he started his day early, he could fit in a third workout, rather than the standard two. What’s more, if he got up early enough, he could get his first workout done and be back home by the time his kids woke up. Kobe also did his last workout of the day after his kids went to bed, so that he didn’t have to sacrifice time with them. Sacrifice was inevitable, but Kobe determined what he was willing to give up, and what he wasn’t—he decided that he wasn’t willing to sacrifice workout time nor family time, so he sacrificed sleep.

**Kobe maintained his rigid routine regardless of the season or circumstances.** While other players eased up on their workouts during the season, in order to avoid wearing themselves out, Kobe carried on. Although his schedule was tiring, it also helped him maintain endurance throughout the season and into the playoffs. Everything Kobe did was purposeful and strategic—starting with his preparation.
