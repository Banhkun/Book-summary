## Exercise: What Does It Take to Be Great?

Reflect on how people who are masters in their fields reach that level.

* * *

Name one person—either well-known or who you know personally—who is a master of her craft.

What are some habits or actions she takes to practice and improve her craft?

Are there other ways that this person exhibits discipline (for example, following a strict diet designed to maximize her performance)? If so, describe one or two.

If you know, name at least one sacrifice this person makes in order to achieve her goals.
