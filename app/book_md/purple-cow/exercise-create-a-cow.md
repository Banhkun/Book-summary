## Exercise: Create a Cow

The first step of creating a Purple Cow is determining where the edges of possibility are.

* * *

Pick one aspect of business: design, marketing, pricing, etc. What would the absolute limits of possibility be for that aspect of _your_ venture (or your dream venture, if you donâ€™t have your own right now)?

For that same business aspect, what are your main competitors doing right now?

How will you set yourself apart from them?
