## Chapter 4: Finding Your Purple Cow

(Shortform note: In this book, Godin uses the word “otaku'' frequently, and somewhat incorrectly, to mean someone who has an interest that is more than a hobby but less than an obsession.

The more common definition of otaku is a person who is deeply interested in something, usually Japanese anime and/or manga, to the point that it interferes with his or her social life. The word often has a negative connotation and is offensive to some. We are substituting the word “passion,” which is more appropriate and closer to Godin’s meaning.)

This chapter discusses how to leverage passion, both your own and your audience’s, in order to create a Purple Cow. If you make something that you’re passionate about, it’s sure to be remarkable; if you create something that others are passionate about, it’s sure to have a market. **Passion is key.**

This chapter also provides the outline of a system for making your own Purple Cows. In short, the system is about pushing some aspect of your business to its absolute limit.

### The Passion, Art, and Science of Purple Cows

Passion is at the very core of Purple Cow theory. The best products are made by people who are passionate about them. For example, Starbucks’s CEO is a huge coffee aficionado. Starbucks makes good coffee because their CEO had them make a product that he—someone passionate about coffee—would want.

Unfortunately, it’s likely—maybe inevitable—that at some point you’ll find yourself working on a project you’re _not_ passionate about. In that case, **you still need to project an air of passion,** even if it’s not real. There are two ways to do this.

The first option is to try to understand people who _are_ passionate about it, and make something that they’d want. You might call this the _art_ of projecting. This is a great skill to have no matter what you’re working on. Master it, and you’ll be able to make Purple Cows out of anything, not just something that you personally love.

The second option is to rely on tracking and measuring your sales and feedback. You can learn what’s working and what isn’t as you keep launching new products. This could be called the _science_ of projecting (more on this in the subsection “The Measure of Success”). While this is a method of faking passion, in practice it’s the exact opposite of passion. If you’re using the science of projection, **you must accept the results without any biases or preformed opinions.**

### A Purple Cow Is a Leader

Birds fly in formation because the leader reduces the wind resistance, giving the others an easier flight. Many businesspeople think they can do the same, getting the benefits of a Purple Cow while letting the industry leader take the risks. However, there are a couple of things wrong with this approach.

First of all, birds actually switch off leaders frequently, but **people using this strategy will never become leaders themselves.** Most will be office drones their whole careers. Strangely enough, this also applies to following your own lead—trying to imitate a previous success, not realizing that the market for it is gone now.

A good example of companies trying to follow their own lead is yoga books. Yoga books were extremely popular for a while. By now, though, most people who want them already have them, and they aren’t necessarily looking for new ones. Publishers who keep cranking out more yoga books will probably find their sales dropping off sharply.

Second, following the wrong “bird” can get you fired, laid off, or caught up in a bad situation professionally or even legally. Working for a bad boss can mean more than a frustrating work environment—it can be a major setback for your career.

The bottom line is: Whether you’re using passion, art, or science, **whatever you create must be _your_ product. **You can’t play follow-the-leader with products and services—the leaders only succeeded _because_ they were the leaders, and once you follow them it’s no longer remarkable (which is to say, not a Purple Cow).

The big question, of course, is what should you create? You want to make something successful, but sometimes it seems hard to figure exactly why things succeed. After all, Four Seasons and Motel 6 both did very well, despite seeming like total opposites.

However, the key is what they have in common: They’re unusual. Four Seasons is expensive and luxurious, while Motel 6 is cheap and practical. They’re opposite extremes in the hotel industry, meaning that both are remarkable in very different ways.

Your product has to be **remarkable enough to attract the left side of Moore’s curve** , but **flexible and accessible enough to appeal to the middle sections** — _unless_ you’re planning to target a niche market (see an example in the subsection “Sell Your Audience What They Want or Need”). Remember that digital cameras didn’t see widespread sales until manufacturers fixed the ease-of-use issues.

It’s not productive just to list all of the specific brainstorming and creativity techniques that companies all over the world use successfully. Instead, the following subsections give some big-picture concepts that you can use to start finding your own Purple Cows. You may find yourself using all of them, or only one.

### Take a Different Approach

Instead of trying to make better technology for how people normally behave, **see if you can encourage people to change how they use your product in a way that makes your product work better.**

This is exactly how Schindler Elevator Corporation shot to the forefront of the elevator market. Elevators aren’t your average product. They’re extremely expensive and have a limited market. Elevator companies used to compete by establishing relationships with agents using dinners and golf outings, but Schindler Elevator Corporation created a Purple Cow for elevators by identifying a problem and coming up with a remarkable solution.

The problem was that elevators were inefficient. They would make many stops on their way up and down a building as people got on and off in a disorganized fashion, wasting time while people in the lobby grew more and more frustrated waiting for their own elevators. Schindler’s solution was to develop a pre-sorting system where everyone keys in their desired floors to a central control panel. A computer then figures out the most efficient way to get everyone where they’re going, and tells the passengers which elevator to take. **Rather than improving the product itself, Schindler improved how people use it.**

Because of their Purple Cow, Schindler is now known by practically all purchasing agents and will always have a leg up on their competitors no matter how much advertising those others do.

### Sell Your Audience What They Want or Need

**Something remarkable will attract the people who are passionate about it.** Passionate customers are the most valuable ones; people who will not only buy your product, but will spread it to others with the same interests.

For example, the US has a subculture of people who are passionate about hot sauce, and always looking for hotter ones. There obviously isn’t a huge market for sauces too spicy for most people to handle, but that hasn’t stopped dozens of such sauces from coming out and turning profits.

Compare that to mustard, which many more people use, yet few companies _only_ make mustard. They can’t sustain themselves on mustard because people aren’t passionate about it.

This second part seems obvious, but **sell people what they are in the mood to buy.** Whether they’re passionate about it or not, people will buy something they need. To use that fact to your advantage, first figure out who your customers are—who’s on the left side of the curve in _your_ market? Figure out a problem those people have, then sell them something that solves it.

For example, Altoids realized that young people who weren’t smoking wanted something to do with their hands and mouths. Altoids advertised specifically to that market by targeting cities with chic slogans and imagery. Then, in a second stroke of brilliance, they designed their tins to encourage sharing: The wide open top and strong smell attracts new customers on its own. The product _is_ the marketing. Thanks to expertly targeted ads and a Purple Cow of a container, Altoids were a huge success and turned major profits.

### Not a Plan, but a System

The bad news is that there’s no foolproof plan to get a Purple Cow every time. The very nature of the Cow prevents that—something created using a predictable formula would, by definition, not be a remarkable Purple Cow. **However, there _is_ a system, and it’s all about pushing boundaries. **There are only two steps:

**1\. Ask yourself and your team where the edges of possibility are.** Go back to your 5 Ps of marketing (whichever 5 you like to use), and figure out what would happen if you took each P to its extreme. Also research what your competitors are doing, and how close to each edge they are.

For example, consider Price. Perhaps you could give away your product for free. That would certainly be extreme and remarkable, though probably not good for your profits. Note that you won’t necessarily _go_ to these edges!**** This is just a brainstorming exercise.

**2\. Next, figure out which edge will give you the results you want.** What will attract people’s attention and get them to purchase your product or service? **Finding the right edge to go to is how you create a remarkable product.**

Could you make your product’s design so exceptional that it markets itself, like the new model of the VW Beetle? Or could you somehow improve your production and shipping processes so that you can significantly undercut your competitors’ prices, like IKEA?

This two-step process is the way people create their Purple Cows, whether they use it accidentally or on purpose.

While it’s not technically part of the system, a helpful tip is to **get marketing people involved in the design process.** Marketers will bring valuable perspectives to your brainstorming sessions, and will naturally be familiar with the Ps of marketing. Plus, a remarkable product will market itself (remember the VW Beetle), and a good marketer on your design team can help turn the product into its own advertisement.
