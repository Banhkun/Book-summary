## Part 8: Starting With the End

Even as the McConaissance unfolded, Matthew’s life continued to be not just about his career, but about his family. Camila and the kids were at the center of his thoughts and plans, and soon he felt the need to make a more formal commitment to them. At the same time, he won the biggest accolade of his acting career (an Oscar), only to find himself soon questioning his future direction as an actor. When he reached the age of 50, his thoughts turned toward both backward and forward, leading him to reflect on where he had been and where he was going.

Insights and lessons from this period include the following:

  * Prayer is a time for taking inventory of yourself while mentally and spiritually embracing other people who need your compassion. It’s a time to see others as they really are and recognize their inner light. And it’s a time to return to yourself and simply be who you are**.**
  * **Learning to deal with the inevitable is the key to success.** Ultimately, this means beginning with the end in mind, because the ultimate inevitability is death. The lives we lead on the way to death represent our relativity. The ultimate fusion of relativity with inevitability is to write your life story with your eventual eulogy in mind.



### The Adventure of Marriage

When Matthew and Camila’s son Levi was three, he asked Matthew why he, his sister Vida, and Matthew all had the last name McConaughey but their mother didn’t. Matthew realized that it was high time he got over his fear of losing himself through marriage.

So he went and talked with his pastor, Dave Haney, who explained marriage as a relationship in which two people don’t lose themselves but become more of themselves. Haney asked Matthew what would be the bigger sacrifice, to continue on his current life adventure or to accept the adventure of marriage. With that thought, **Matthew came to understand marriage not as a final destination but a new journey** , and one that he could take with the very woman he wanted to be with for the rest of his life. He realized that he not only wanted but _needed_ to get married.

He proposed to Camila on Christmas Day 2011. They didn’t set a date, but five months later Camila handed him an invitation to their wedding—just as Kay had done to Jim McConaughey many decades earlier—and told Matthew that she was pregnant with their third child and didn’t want to go through a wedding ceremony with a baby bump. So they planned a three-day weekend wedding and invited 88 of their closest family and friends.

They were married on June 9, 2012, in a large private ceremony at their Texas house. The proceedings involved Brother Christian from the Monastery of Christ in the Desert, pastor Dave Haney, John Mellencamp, and a Candomblé priestess. Afterward, Matthew felt that he now had even more of a real future to live for. His marriage was a greenlight.

Their third child, a son, Livingston Alves McConaughey, was born on December 28, 2012. It was another greenlight. Matthew felt more fulfilled than he ever had before. Whereas ideas had always inspired him before, now he felt inspired by life itself.

### A True Detective and a Real Oscar

It was during this period that HBO’s _True Detective_ came along. Matthew loved playing detective Rustin Cohle, whose striking inner life—Cohle was both a fierce seeker of truth and a thoroughgoing nihilist—excited him. The series aired on HBO during the movie awards season, which worked out well as it raised his profile just as he was seeking attention for his role in _Dallas Buyers Club_.

He went on to do well during that awards season, sweeping the Critics’ Choice, Golden Globes, Independent Spirit, and Screen Actors Guild awards for best actor for his portrayal of Ron Woodroff. The only thing left was the Academy Award. He deliberately didn’t plan a speech, fearing that this would be bad karma.

When he won the Oscar for Best Actor, it seemed a validation of all the risky and difficult career choices that he had made in recent years. **It was also confirmation that, in fulfillment of his father’s and Camila’s orders about his filmmaking career, he most certainly wasn’t half-assing it.**

### Being Matthew McConaughey

In the wake of his Oscar win, Matthew made many more movies, including _Interstellar_ , _Free State of Jones_ , and _Gold_. But even though these fulfilled him creatively, something apparently wasn’t translating to the public, because the movies weren’t financial successes. He didn’t know if the reason lay with him, the stories, the distributors, pure luck, or something else.

The uncertainty over his post-Oscar box office returns made him even more committed to his craft. He began bringing an increasing level of intensity and absorption to the fictional characters whose lives he inhabited on the screen. Then, one day, he realized that these characters had come to feel more vital to him than the story that was his real life. He had become a true actor-artist, finding consequence, danger, and excitement in his art. It was an exhilarating discovery.

But it also made him realize that it was time, yet again, for a change. It was time to turn his _life_ into his favorite movie, to write his own script and direct his own story. It was time to catch the hero that he had always been chasing: his future self. **It was time to live his legacy now, to quit _acting like_ Matthew McConaughey and simply _be_ Matthew McConaughey.**

### Writing Your Life

To do this, he gathered 35 years of his writings, the scraps of reflection and insight that he had been keeping since the age of 15. Re-encountering his former selves, he realized that his first twenty years had been a time of learning to _value values_ such as respect, courage, fairness, good humor, service, and a certain rough love of adventure.

His twenties and thirties were “conservative” decades, during when he cared more about not running red lights than finding green ones. He spent those years getting rid of conditions and truths that felt counter-grain to him, so that he could find his real self.

His forties were a more affirming time when he put the truths he had learned into action. They were a time when he created many new greenlights even as he saw many reds and yellows from his past turn green. **The net result was that he caught more greenlights than he ever had before.**

As he was finishing this book in 2020, both the COVID-19 pandemic and the murder of George Floyd rocked the world. Matthew sees both phenomena playing out according to the principles of inevitability and relativity. For example, the disruption of our collective lives by COVID-19 presented new inevitabilities such as social distancing and quarantining, while the disruption brought on by George Floyd’s murder presented the inevitabilities of outrage, protests, and riots. In both cases, we all had to get relative by persisting, pivoting, and sacrificing. Through the turbulence, we got to know our families and ourselves better. We learned to hear each other in new ways. Matthew is convinced that at some point in the future, the red light of 2020 will turn green and reveal it as one of our greatest years.

He has now taken on the self-designated position of “Minister of Culture” to promote a culture of shared values and competence in cities, institutions, athletics, and education. Drawing from his earliest life lessons, he regards _values_ as intrinsically nondenominational and bipartisan. **In a world where so many people are divided, he says values are what unite us.** This is why promoting value competency, along with competency in general, can bring us together.

Ultimately, in Matthew’s view, the art of living goes back to the concept of _greenlights_ , combined with the concepts of _relativity_ and _inevitability_. To live wisely means to recognize that the ultimate inevitability in your life is death. Therefore, as you make choices and seek to catch greenlights, think about the way these choices will shape your eventual eulogy. In other words, **begin with the end in mind. Living this way represents the ultimate fusion of relativity with inevitability and the surest way to fill your experience with one greenlight after another.**
