## Exercise: Find Your Frequency

As a high school senior and then an exchange student, Matthew found that you can discover your frequency (learn who you are) by learning who you _aren’t_ and getting rid of things that aren’t right for you. This exercise helps you to begin the process of sorting these things out in your own life.

* * *

Recount a situation where you were asked or pressured to do something that you knew was wrong for you.

How did you respond? If you gave in, how did that make you feel? If you successfully resisted, how did _that_ make you feel?

If you weren't happy with your response to the situation, what lessons did you learn that you can apply to a similar situation in the future? If you were happy with your response, why?

How did your response reflect your sense of identity?
