## Part 1: Growing Up McConaughey

Matthew McConaughey’s family line includes cattle thieves, riverboat gamblers, and a bodyguard for Al Capone. He says the McConaughey mode of seeing and being in the world follows a kind of “outlaw logic.”

In relating the story of his boyhood in rural Texas, Matthew draws a number of lessons from his most formative experiences. Chief among these are the following:

  * Like everything in life, the Golden Rule (“Treat others as you want to be treated”) demands moderation. Sometimes other people don’t want what you want.
  * Words are more than just words. Because they create expectations and consequences, words represent _values_. So be careful with what you say, both about other people and about yourself.
  * **You can enjoy freedom by honoring structure. Even more: You can learn to _create your own_ structure.** Without structure, there’s only chaos. So discipline yourself. Learn difficult skills. Create guidelines. Real freedom and creativity need borders, just like real individuality needs the resistance of other people’s identities.



### Jim and Kay McConaughey

Jim McConaughey, Matthew’s father, came from Patterson, Mississippi, and grew up in Louisiana. His three sons—Mike, Pat, and Matthew—saw him as a bastion of common sense and wanted to emulate his work ethic, traditional manners (sir, ma’am), and loyalty. Jim loved drinking beer, telling stories, and hosting parties. He valued hard work over flashy appearances. He had a big, commanding personality and a soft spot for underdogs, and dreamed of “making it big” and “striking it rich”—he’d been an athlete who was briefly drafted to the NFL with the Green Bay Packers. Professionally, he worked in the oil industry.

Kay McConaughey, Matthew’s mother, came from Altoona, Pennsylvania, but always claimed she was from Trenton, New Jersey, on the grounds that nobody would want to be from someplace called “Altoona.” She was tough, aggressive, and opinionated, and she never carried any stress because she always forgave herself immediately. She had a difficult upbringing, and Matthew says this gave her a powerful drive to make up her own reality and deny anything she didn’t like (as in her claim that she was from Trenton). According to Matthew, this power of denial was one of Kay’s strengths. For example, it apparently helped her defeat two different kinds of cancer without receiving professional medical treatment.

Jim and Kay were together as a couple for a very long time before they got married. When they finally did take the plunge, it was because Kay handed Jim an invitation to their own wedding and told him he had 24 hours to decide.

**It was a difficult relationship.** Although they loved each other passionately, over the years they divorced and remarried each other twice. As two equally strong-willed people, when they argued, they did so vigorously and sometimes physically. On four separate occasions, Jim broke Kay’s middle finger when she stuck it in his face.

One night, Jim came home from work and soon got into an enormous fight with Kay when she kept calling him fat. This so enraged him that he upended the kitchen table, after which she went to call the police but instead ended up breaking his nose with the telephone and then brandishing a kitchen knife at him. For his part, Jim, nose still bleeding, kept flinging ketchup on Kay from a bottle as he circled her like a matador calling out, “Touché!” After they had released their rage, Kay started crying, and suddenly they embraced in the middle of the kitchen, fell to the floor, and made love. A red light in their marriage had turned green. It was a cycle of fighting and reuniting that Matthew and his brothers knew well. **Today, Matthew says this tumultuous way of being together, which might seem shocking to other people, was simply the way his parents loved each other**.

### Family of Five

Matthew was born in 1969 in Uvalde, Texas, where he spent his first ten years. He was an “accident.” For the first five months she carried him, Kay thought he was a tumor.

He had two older brothers, Mike and Pat. Mike bore the nickname “Rooster” because he always woke up at the crack of dawn. Pat came into the family by adoption when Mike said he wanted a little brother for his tenth birthday.

Jim and Kay taught their three sons to believe in God, passing along a reverence for both Old Testament sternness and New Testament mercy. They didn’t hesitate to use physical discipline on their boys when they thought it necessary. And while they did mete out “whuppings” for such mundane infractions as cursing, the three McConaughey boys knew **they were only really in trouble whenever they said or did something that, in their parents’ opinion, would ultimately hurt them (the sons) by diminishing them or distorting their identities.** For example, Matthew received his first such punishment in kindergarten when he responded to being called “Matt” on the playground. As Kay punished him, she told him that he wasn’t named after a doormat. Another time, he was punished for saying the words “I can’t.”

The attention to language was especially impactful. Jim and Kay raised their sons to be careful of what they said because words embody values. They taught their boys never to use hateful words, never to claim to be helpless, and never to lie. Matthew later recognized this training as a very early greenlight in his life.

### Little Mr. Texas and a Plagiarized Poem

**With her tendency to “fudge” reality, Kay inadvertently helped to forge the sensibility in Matthew that would make him a good actor.** For example, In 1977, Kay entered Matthew in a contest called “Little Mr. Texas.” He came away with a trophy, and his mother hung a framed photo of him with it on the kitchen wall. From then on, she referred to him as Little Mr. Texas. Decades later, he looked again at the photo and saw that the trophy’s nameplate actually said “runner-up.” When he called his mother to ask about it, she told him that he had been the real Little Mr. Texas because the nominal winner came from a rich family that “cheated” by buying their son a fancy suit for the contest.

When Matthew was in seventh grade and trying to write a poem for a school contest, Kay had him read a poem by Ann Ashford and then told him to submit it to the contest as his own. When he questioned her on this, she said that since he understood the poem and liked it, in a way it really did belong to him. She also said that if he won the contest with it, the worst the school could do if they found out was to take back the medal. So he entered Ashford’s poem as his own. And he did win the contest.

### Longview, Texas, and the Tallest Treehouse in the World

When Matthew was around 10, he experienced a change that taught him the importance of finding freedom by building your own structure. The lesson was literal: It involved the building of an enormous treehouse.

Jim and Kay had moved the family from Uvalde to Longview. Mike was already grown up and living on his own. Pat was away at golf camp. Kay was enjoying an extended “vacation” in Florida. (Matthew didn’t know at the time that she and Jim were actually going through their second divorce.) This meant Matthew and Jim spent several months by themselves in Longview, living in a double-wide trailer.

In a new town with an empty summer ahead of him, Matthew made a project of building a treehouse in a huge white pine. It was a major project involving a month of stealing boards, plywood planks, and nails from a local lumberyard at night and transporting them to the site. Then he spent six weeks building the treehouse, working 12-hour days and making the structure ever higher, until it was a full 13 stories tall, reaching up to the top of that towering pine. When he was finished, he spent the rest of the summer sitting on the top floor, eating bag lunches and daydreaming as he gazed out over the panorama of the forest beneath him. Today, he remembers that summer as the best one of his life. **The treehouse and everything that went with it was a greenlight. He had built a haven for himself that served as a source of peace in a new environment.**

### Rites of Passage

Jim McConaughey valued rites of passage, and he saw that each of his boys received one. For example, when Mike was 22, Jim picked a physical fight and wouldn’t stop coming at him until Mike finally knocked him out with a 2 x 4. When Jim regained consciousness, he expressed heartfelt pride for his son and viewed him as an equal from then on.

#### Failing the Test

Matthew’s first chance at a rite of passage arrived during his senior year of high school, and it didn’t end well. One night he came home at midnight, having skipped out on the bill with a friend at the local Pizza Hut, and found Jim waiting up. Jim had spoken by phone with the father of Matthew’s friend, and now he confronted Matthew and demanded to know if it was true that he had stolen a pizza. Shocked and flustered, Matthew denied it.

He knew his father just wanted him to own up to it.**In McConaughey family logic, the one thing worse than getting caught in some bit of misbehavior was lying about it.** Jim himself had stolen a pizza or two in his lifetime, and Matthew knew that he only needed to admit the truth to his father, which would earn him some yelling and maybe a few lashes from a belt, but nothing more. In fact, it would earn him respect.

But instead of coming clean, for reasons he couldn’t fathom within himself, he doubled down on the lie. The result was predictable. Jim sprang at him and backhanded him across the face, knocking him down. Matthew panicked, cried, wet his pants, and crawled into a corner as Jim continued to rage at him.

Ever since that night, he has regretted his failure to fulfill his passage to manhood that night. He had always been more his mother’s son than his father’s, and that night was his first chance to become Jim’s son as well, to become a man. But he failed the test.

#### Passing the Test

Fortunately, Matthew’s chance came around again a year after he graduated from high school. He and his father stopped for a drink at a pool hall, and as they were leaving, the bouncer asked Jim if he had paid his bill. He put his hand on Jim’s chest to stop him, and Matthew, seeing another man put a hand on his father, exploded in fury. He leaped on the bouncer and beat him savagely. He was so enraged that Jim finally had to pull him off the man.

That night, Jim called all of his buddies and proudly announced what had happened. He told them they didn’t have to worry about Matthew anymore because Matthew was going to be alright. The youngest son had proved himself. **From that night on, Matthew was no longer a child but one of the men. This passage to manhood was a greenlight.**
