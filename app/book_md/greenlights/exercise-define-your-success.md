## Exercise: Define Your Success

Matthew walked away from his successful brand in Hollywood to pursue the creative projects that would mean real success to him. This exercise will help you define what success means to you.

* * *

What are some of the real successes you’ve achieved in life? Focus not on outward acclaim but your inward sense of happiness and accomplishment. What have you done that has made you feel like you really accomplished something worthwhile? (If possible, name several things.)

Think about the general principle behind all of your successes. What do they point toward? Beyond the specifics, what does success mean to you, personally? Write it out directly: “To me, success means..,”

In what ways have other people tried to define success for you? What are some roles, projects, or goals that others have wanted you to pursue, but that didn’t feel meaningful to you?

What can you do this week to act on your principles and make progress toward more success in your life?
