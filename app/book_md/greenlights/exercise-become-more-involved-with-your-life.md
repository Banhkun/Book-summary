## Exercise: Become More Involved With Your Life

The loss of Matthew’s father made him realize that he needed to lose his childhood view of being “impressed” by life and assume the adult responsibility of being more involved with it. This exercise will help you explore this principle in your own experience.

* * *

What are some of the iconic presences in your life, the figures of “mythic” stature? Your parents? Your religion? Your job?

Consider the impact of losing one of these things. How would such a loss affect your thoughts, emotions, and worldview? (If you’ve actually experienced such a loss, how _did_ it affect you?)

What gift might lie on the other side of such a loss for you? How might this lead to your becoming a more fully functional adult? Greater freedom? A new sense of worthy obligations to fulfill?
