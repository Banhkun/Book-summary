## Part 4: Made for the Moment

Matthew had graduated from film school. He had acted in two feature films. He had moved to Hollywood. Now he was ready to begin his career in earnest. In this part, we’ll look at his early years in Hollywood, when he found rapid success followed quickly by full superstardom. He struggled to handle his newfound celebrity, and the quest to maintain his personal center of gravity led him to New Mexico, Peru, the Amazon, and finally, to America’s backroads.

Insights and lessons from this period of his life include the following:

  * Freedom and preparation are not mutually exclusive. Freedom _requires_ preparation.
  * **We’re all perfectly made for whatever moment we find ourselves in.**
  * The truth surrounds us all the time, but we aren’t always able to recognize it or receive it. 
  * To receive the truth, first you have to put yourself in a situation where you’re able to receive it. Then you have to be conscious enough to recognize it. 



### Hollywood Beginnings

When Matthew returned to Hollywood from Europe, he immediately received well-paying roles in two high-profile movies, _Boys on the Side_ and _Angels in the Outfield_. He was off to a promising start, but his early career wasn’t without a few wobbles. **He learned the hard way that you have to balance spontaneous freedom with careful preparation.**

He began taking acting lessons, but he soon discovered that his newly self-aware approach to the craft was getting in his way at auditions, and he stopped getting roles. When he finally landed a part in an indie film, _Scorpion Spring_ , he thought he might improve his performance by returning to his instinctive acting skills, so he decided to take a different tack by not reading the script ahead of time. Instead of preparing, he spent some time mentally forming the drug runner character, and then he planned to give his performance in spontaneous freedom.

The plan blew up when he arrived to shoot his single scene and found that he was expected to speak a several-page monologue in Spanish. Things didn’t go well that day, and he learned his lesson. Going forward, he always prepared carefully for his roles.

### Instant Star

A few months later, Matthew got an opportunity to act in director Joel Schumacher’s screen adaptation of John Grisham’s novel _A Time to Kill_. He came better prepared this time, having read not just the script but the novel. He was under consideration for the role of smalltown Ku Klux Klan leader, but he told Schumacher that he really wanted the lead role of the young attorney Jake Brigance, who defends a black man for killing the men who raped his daughter. Schumacher said it was a great idea but a complete nonstarter because Warner Brothers would never give the lead role to a relatively obscure actor.

But then other events converged to boost Matthew’s case. One of these was the unexpected box office success of Sandra Bullock’s previous film _While You Were Sleeping_. When this happened, she had already been cast as the female lead in _A Time to Kill_. Now her name served as a powerful draw for the film, thus enabling Warner Brothers to consider a less bankable actor for the male lead.

Around the same time, a man and woman who said they had been inspired by the mass murderers Mickey and Mallory in Oliver Stone’s _Natural Born Killers_ murdered a friend of Grisham’s. Woody Harrelson had played Mickey. Presently he was under consideration for the role of Jake Brigance in _A Time to Kill_. After the murder, Grisham, who had casting control over that part, gave a hard “no” to Harrelson’s inclusion. Shortly afterward, Schumacher called Matthew to come in for a private audition.

At the audition, Matthew first performed the scene as written, doing a passable but not especially noteworthy job. Then Schumacher told him to do it again, but without the script, just speaking from his heart. Matthew prepared mentally and emotionally by thinking about the horror of the crime against the young girl in the movie and contrasting this with his own lifelong desire to be a father. Then he performed the scene from that inner state. **Two weeks later, Schumacher called and offered him the role—a career-defining greenlight.**

### The Price of Fame

Immediately after the opening weekend of _A Time to Kill_ , Matthew was a newly minted celebrity who couldn’t go out in public like normal people anymore. The show-business press lauded him as “the next big thing.” Strangers began to approach him like old friends. He immediately began to receive his choice of whatever scripts he wanted.

During this heady period, he enjoyed the fame and money. **But soon it all began to feel out of balance. Life itself began to seem unreal.** He began to sense an increasing need to regain his sense of spiritual grounding. This need eventually led him to a desert monastery in New Mexico.

#### Desert Retreat

Having heard that Thomas Merton, the renowned Trappist monk and writer, had described the Monastery of Christ in the Desert as a good place to have one’s perspectives realigned, Matthew drove from Hollywood to New Mexico and sought permission to stay at the monastery. The monks there welcomed him and gave him a room with a cot and sleeping mat.

The next day he spoke for several hours to one of the monks, a man named Brother Christian. During a long desert walk, Matthew aired his feelings of anguish and guilt over his sense of losing himself in perverse, low, and arrogant thoughts due to his new fame. He said he felt lost. Brother Christian simply looked at Matthew and said, “Me, too.” Matthew recognized this as a greenlight. **He felt deeply affirmed, realizing that sometimes it’s not advice we need but confirmation that someone else shares our feelings.**

### Chasing the Dream: Peru and the Amazon

In the wake of _A Time to Kill_ , Matthew’s new freedom to pick any project he wanted induced a kind of decision paralysis. To find direction and move forward creatively, he felt that he needed to go someplace where he could get in touch with his creative center again—someplace where his fame wouldn’t distort the way people perceived him and reacted to him.

**Right around then, he had a non-sexual wet dream that served as a greenlight.** In the dream, he was floating down the Amazon river, wrapped in snakes, surrounded by crocodiles and piranhas and sharks, while some incongruous African tribesmen—incongruous because the Amazon isn’t in Africa—watched him from the riverbanks. Strangely, he felt peaceful instead of horrified. He had an orgasm, and then he woke up.

Recognizing the dream as something significant, and feeling a strong desire to chase down its meaning, he embarked on a 22-day trip to Peru. His journey involved hiking through the Andes and traveling by bus, boat, and plane to the city of Iquitos, which is inaccessible by car. On the twelfth night of his journey, alone in his tent in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest, he took off his clothing and jewelry, all the symbols of his existing life, and tried to understand who he really was at his root, stripped of all outward identity markers. He began punching himself in the face. He vomited.

The next morning, he woke feeling strangely energized and refreshed. While taking an aimless walk through the forest, he came across a surreally beautiful kaleidoscope of butterflies, thousands of them, pulsing in formation on the jungle floor. Then he noticed the Amazon River just past them—the destination from his dream.

That day, he floated naked in the Amazon on his back, just like he had in his dream (except without the snakes and things). When he arrived back at the camp, his guide said to him in Spanish, “You are light.” **Matthew felt forgiven, cleansed, and entirely present,** and this feeling remained with him through two more weeks of hiking and canoeing. Once, he thought he saw a mermaid’s tail wave at him from the Amazon.

He felt that he had discovered an important truth, or maybe that a truth had found him because he had put himself in the right place. His Amazon experience and its accompanying epiphany, a transmission of wordless significance, were a greenlight that ushered him on to the next phase of his life by helping him reconnect with himself.

### On the Road

After chasing his Amazon dream, Matthew returned to Hollywood, where he took the role of spiritual writer Palmer Joss in the film adaptation of Carl Sagan’s novel _Contact_. He felt a strong connection with the character’s insistence on the reality of spirit in the midst of a culture of science.

After this, he began to feel the need to travel again, not to Peru but around the United States. He bought a GMC van and radically customized it, adding, among other features, a mounted microphone and cassette recorder so that he could record himself talking and musing while he drove. Many of the musings he recorded with it went into this book. He named the van “Cosmo” and took off to travel the US highways.

Several months later, he bought an Airstream RV to pull behind the van, becoming an official full-timer in the world of RV living. He drove everywhere, from east to west coast and across the northern and southern borders, following his own schedule, going where he wanted, attending sporting events, concerts, and more.

He also continued with his movie career, taking meetings with directors while on the road. During this time, he appeared in his old friend Richard Linklater’s _The Newton Boys_. He felt a deep sense of identity with his character in that one, the real-life bank robber Willis Newton, who was one of the progenitors of outlaw logic, and who hailed from Matthew’s hometown of Uvalde, Texas.

Matthew enjoyed making these movies, but he exulted in the life of trailer parks, which he found were home to a wonderful variety of human types. To his pleasure, he discovered that people in such parks lived by an etiquette code that valued privacy, and even though they often knew who he was, they mostly left him alone.

#### A Compass for Life

While shooting a movie in Canada, Matthew lived in the trailer park on the Squamish Nation Indian Reserve in Vancouver, where he ended up becoming good friends with the local residents. He spent many nights cooking beef rib-eye on his outdoor grill to trade with them for salmon. These new friends once escorted a paparazzo off the premises when the man tried to get pictures of Matthew.

When Matthew departed after the movie was over, the chief and his brothers gifted him with a handmade canoe paddle bearing the engraved image of the Squamish Nation’s thunderbird symbol. **They called Matthew their brother and said that just as the paddle gives direction to the Squamish nation on the water, so this paddle could serve as Matthew’s compass during his travels.** He recognized this as another profound greenlight, and their words inspired him to name his RV “the Canoe.”

#### An Accidental Greenlight

Sometime afterward, he encountered another greenlight unexpectedly after driving all day through western Montana. He followed a campground sign in the hope of finding a stopping point so he could watch a college football game on his satellite TV, but instead he stumbled across a tavern with a colorful array of characters inside. These included the Cheyenne barmaid Asha; the grayed and grizzled Ed, who ran the bar; Josie, the tavern’s hotel manager, who had arrived two years earlier, gotten pregnant from a one-night stand, and stayed; and Sam, whose wife had died two weeks into their marriage many years ago, after which he called all the women at the bar names like “honey” and “sugar” because he couldn’t make himself say another woman’s name.

Sam recognized Matthew, bought him a drink, and introduced him to everybody. Matthew recognized the moment as an opportunity to get to know these interesting and very real people. So he chose to spend the night drinking with them and rolling dice with them.**It was an accidental greenlight, and something far more fulfilling than watching football alone in his RV.**
