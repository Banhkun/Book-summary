## Part 5: Turning the Page

After three years on the road, Matthew began to crave a more settled and domestic lifestyle, one with clean sheets and more water pressure. This new period of life led him to a new house, a night in jail, a life of glittering pleasure and ease, and the world of romantic comedy movies. It also led him to take a movie role as a dragon slayer and to chase a dream to Africa, after which he could no longer accept the Hollywood life.

Matthew learned the following insights and lessons from this time:

  * Sometimes the important thing isn’t which choice you make. Sometimes the important thing is just to make a choice and stick with it.
  * **If you feel stuck in a rut, know that you have the power to change. Your life is a book, and you’re the author. Just turn the page.**



### The Art of Bongoing Naked

Matthew ended his RV-days by renting a two-bedroom house in Tarrytown, a sleepy neighborhood in Austin. It was there that one of the most famous (or notorious) incidents in his life-after-fame took place.

One night after partying for 32 hours straight in sheer exuberance over a major win by his beloved football team, the Texas Longhorns, he decided to strip naked, smoke some weed, and play the bongo—an instrument that he cherishes, along with the conga and djembe, as one of the “purest” musical instruments. While he was thus engaged, two Austin police officers barged into his house and wrestled him to the ground. After some preliminary banter, during which he screamed at them for violating his rights, they arrested him for marijuana possession, disturbing the peace, and resisting arrest. When one of them tried to cover him with a blanket, Matthew insisted he would be taken outside naked as proof of his innocence, since a naked man in his own home had clearly been minding his own business.

He spent the night in jail and got out the next morning when the judge proved sympathetic toward him. She said she found it inconceivable that what should have been a police call for disturbing the peace had resulted in Matthew facing two misdemeanor felony charges after two officers forced their way into his home without warning. She dismissed all charges when Matthew agreed to plead guilty to violating a sound ordinance.

He had to fight off an incipient feeling of gloom for the next several hours, because his outlaw logic told him that getting caught was the worst possible outcome. He hadn’t been raised to go to jail. For consolation, he called his mother, who helped his mood with her outrage at what had been done to him. He received her consolation as a greenlight.

**Choosing to make the best of the inevitable, Matthew decided to claim the incident as part of his valid life journey.** He framed his ticket for violating the sound ordinance, and his attorney got his criminal record expunged. Then he watched with amusement as “Bongo Naked” tee shirts became the rage in Austin.

But when the local newspaper published a report about the bongoing incident that contained Matthew’s full address, it brought an influx of attention and visitors that began to ruin the atmosphere of Tarrytown that he had cherished. In what he felt was fairness to the other residents, he decided to move out.

### Hollywood Hedonism

In 2000, Matthew felt it was time to return to the Hollywood hustle anyway, since his last few films— _The Newton Boys_ , _Contact_ , _Amistad_ , and _U-571_ —had underperformed, leaving him with fewer first-class acting offers. He worried that his career might be fading. But when he accepted a high-paying offer to star opposite Jennifer Lopez in _The Wedding Planner_ , this ushered him into the world of romantic comedies and an extended period of white-hot Hollywood excess.

He moved into the legendary Chateau Marmont on Sunset Boulevard, home to a revolving gallery of rising and falling stars, and quickly learned that life at the Chateau and life in the fictional world of romantic comedies are both built around the same principle: all greenlights. They’re all about a sustained string of affirmations as you skip weightlessly through the world. For 18 months, he enjoyed a time of hedonistic indulgence. It was a time filled with late nights, suntanning, the best food and drink, endless parties, and endless friends (many of them female).

### Dragon Slayer

Then the role of dragon slayer Denton Van Zan in _Reign of Fire_ came along. Matthew loved playing this character. He says Van Zan taught him the deep value of duty, along with the value of affirming and owning your personal element of madness.

Amid the endless partying and gratification of his Hollywood life, Matthew had begun to question God’s existence as he placed more emphasis on self-reliance and free will. Playing Van Zan became an instrumental part of this. He realized that he wanted to pull away from his life of hedonism and start earning and deserving some of those easy Saturdays that he had been enjoying. The tough and rugged character of Van Zan, a man whose life revolved around a single, all-consuming purpose, felt important to him.

Playing the role also taught him how to play life by his own rules instead of letting Hollywood culture dictate his actions. To prepare for it, he began by shaving his head. This was partly because his hair had begun falling out anyway, and he had heard that shaving it was one way to make it grow again. But his new look also became part of his new self-determination when his bald head appeared in _People_ magazine and a studio executive with a financial interest in _Reign of Fire_ balked and threatened Matthew with some words about “bad karma.” In response, Matthew spent some time tanning his newly exposed scalp. Then he oiled it up, put on a fancy Gucci suit, and went to a Hollywood industry party, where his bald head was a hit. The studio executive later called him and raved excitedly about it.

Matthew’s preparations for playing Van Zan also involved some considerably more rigorous activities when he spent several weeks at his brother Mike’s West Texas ranch and developed his own brutal daily training regimen for becoming a dragon slayer. This included taking a double shot of tequila every morning, running barefoot in the desert for five miles, keeping his heart rate low as he stood on the edge of the barn’s roof, and going out into the fields at night to tackle cows. One by one, these exercises failed—the tequila made him sick, he couldn’t make himself go to the roof’s edge, his feet blistered so badly that he couldn’t walk, and he got a concussion from a cow’s headbutt. The upside was that he experienced a lot of pain, which was something the character of Van Zan knew all too well.

### Chasing the Dream: Africa and the Dogon

Three days after principal photography on _Reign of Fire_ ended, Matthew had an exact repeat of his wet dream from several years earlier, complete with the same incongruous splicing of the Amazon with African tribesmen. This time, to pursue the dream’s meaning he chose to go to Africa.

#### Be Different, Not Sorry

He started by finding a guide, Issa, to help him navigate the African continent in pursuit of his dream’s meaning. For the first leg of his journey, he decided to track down one of his favorite musicians, the guitarist Ali Farka Touré. From the liner notes to a CD, he learned that the man lived in Niafunké, Mali. So Issa guided him there by boat, traveling up the Niger river, and the two of them spent a day having lunch with Ali and his wife. When Matthew asked Ali why he performed in West Africa and France but not elsewhere, he found the man’s reply striking: Ali said he would be nothing but dried shit—leaving no scent—in other places, whereas in Africa and France he was wet shit, so that his scent stayed with people.

After leaving Ali, Matthew learned from Issa that some people who lived nearby, called the Dogon, were said to have received an extraterrestrial transmission of astronomical knowledge long before the birth of modern astronomy. Matthew took this as a mystical sign in alignment with his dream, and they traveled up the Niger to visit the Dogon.

On the way to see the Dogon, Matthew and Issa stopped at Timbuktu and visited with two of Issa’s friends, Ali and Amadou. The interaction taught Matthew a different way of communication than what Americans are used to, one based not on the attempt to win arguments but on the attempt to understand another person better.

At the hotel, they all noticed a young woman who was a prostitute. Ali and Amadou began to argue over whether she should or should not be living that way. When Matthew interjected that he thought Ali, who disagreed with the prostitution, was right, both Ali and Amadou told him sharply that it wasn’t a matter of “right” or “wrong” but of _understanding_. When Matthew sheepishly said he was sorry, Amadou told him not to be sorry, but to be different.

#### Leave Your Scent

When Matthew and Issa eventually reached the Dogon people, he learned an important lesson about accepting challenges even if you think you’re destined to lose. He and Issa visited several Dogon villages, where Matthew—still bald, bearded, and ruggedly healthy from _Reign of Fire_ —told everyone he met that he was a writer and boxer named David. At the village of Begnemato, the village’s champion wrestler, Michel, challenged Matthew to a wrestling match in a dirt pit. Although a bit apprehensive, Matthew accepted when he reflected that if he refused, he would live the rest of his life wondering if he could have faced such a challenge. The village crowd went wild with excitement.

Surrounded by the cheering villagers, and refereed by the chief, Matthew and Michel fought two brutal rounds in the pit, with Matthew holding his own against Michel’s powerful attacks. Matthew emerged bruised and bloody, far worse for the wear than Michel. But the chief held up both of their hands and declared the match a tie. The villagers chanted enthusiastically, “Daouda! Daouda!” (“David” in Bambara, the local dialect).

When Matthew left the village the next day, Michel met him at its edge and walked with him 15 miles to the next village, holding his hand and saying nothing. That night, Issa told Matthew that everybody had expected Matthew to lose the wrestling match because Michel was actually the champion not just of Begnemato but three other villages. **He said winning was really just about accepting the challenge. When Matthew accepted, he had already won. Matthew took this as another greenlight.** He realized that he had left his “scent” with the Dogon people, just like Ali Farka had talked about.

### Turn the Page

Upon his return to Los Angeles, Matthew felt changed. In Africa he had felt fully at home, relaxed, and settled into his real self with his new friends. Now this left him with no tolerance for the glittering, chattering hedonism of the Chateau.

So he left the Chateau and headed for the beach, where he lived for the next few years, trading fancy suits for shorts and a surfboard. This was the period when the media rebranded him as the shirtless rom-com guy with a surfboard. And he did indeed star in a slew of rom-coms, including _How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days_ , _Sahara_ , and _Failure to Launch_. He found such movies enjoyable to make, regarding each one as a gift of breezy fun to the audience.

However, after a while he began to feel as if he had become an entertainer instead of an actor. The rom-coms felt too easy. They no longer nourished his creative spirit. He felt more enlarged and deepened from his traveling than from his career. This feeling grew so pronounced that he began to consider leaving the acting profession altogether, maybe to become a writer or teacher, or maybe a musician or football coach. Matthew remembered a philosophy he’d learned from the late Darrel Royal, football coach at the University of Texas: Your life is a book, and when you need a change, you can just “turn the page.” It was this kind of page-turning transition that Matthew felt he now needed.

Looking for a change, and laying seeds for a possible new future, he bought a new house in the Hollywood hills, one with a big yard and enough space for a family.
