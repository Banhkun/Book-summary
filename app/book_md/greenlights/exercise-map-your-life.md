## Exercise: Map Your Life

Matthew’s concept of living wisely by beginning with the end (your death) in mind can serve as a focusing tool for planning what you want to accomplish. This exercise guides you through applying it.

* * *

How do you want to be remembered? What do you want your eventual eulogy to say?

Right now, how far is your life from the description in that eulogy? What accomplishments, character qualities, or other things in that eulogy are not present or not fully developed in your current life?

How can you “close the gap”? What things need to happen, and what things do you need to do, for you to become the person described in that eulogy?

Get very specific: What actions can you take this week, this month, _today_ , to begin shaping the story of your life so that when you die, you will have lived well and been successful (in the deepest meaning of that word for you)?
