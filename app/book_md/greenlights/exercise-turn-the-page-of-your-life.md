## Exercise: Turn the Page of Your Life

Matthew writes about the idea of “turning the page” of your life when you need a significant change. This exercise will help you to reflect on this idea and apply it to your life.

* * *

We’ve all gone through page-turning transitions in our lives, times when everything changed dramatically. What was one of yours?

Did you _choose_ to turn the page, or did it feel like it was turned for you, by forces outside your control?

What points of life transition can you see in your experience right now and/or in the future? (What page will you need to turn?)

What can you start doing right now to increase your voluntary participation in these transitions? How can you train yourself and position yourself to choose when and how you’ll turn the pages of your life instead of having them turned for you?
