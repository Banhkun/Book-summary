## Chapter 8: Impacts—Rainforests and Biodiversity

Most people think of global warming primarily as a threat to cold-climate species such as polar bears, penguins, and seals. Their worlds are changing dramatically as polar sea ice declines and gets thinner. And as the ice declines, the larger areas of open water absorb more heat, which melts more ice.

Half of the Arctic’s perennial sea ice has disappeared in the last thirty years and the rest may be gone in thirty more. Perennial sea ice, also known as multiyear ice, is thicker ice that survives the summer season. As the earth warms, the outlook for species that rely on the ice is grim.

But according to researchers, **global warming will have an even greater impact in the tropics because that’s where the most species live**. In Canada’s boreal forest of nearly a billion acres, there are only about twenty species of trees. In the U.S., eastern deciduous forests contain fifty to two hundred species. In contrast, Belize, in Central America, has some 700 native tree species. Manu National Park, in the Andes of Peru, is a forest reserve where researchers have counted more than a thousand species of trees.

The same pattern—fewer species in cold climates and many more in warmer climates—applies to birds, butterflies, frogs, and fungi. Biodiversity is lowest at the poles and increases as you go from the poles to the equator. There are three theories for why more species live in tropical rainforests:

  * Just as farmers produce more in warmer climates because of a longer growing season, species produce more generations. The more they reproduce, the more likely there will be genetic changes and new species.
  * More-stable temperatures in the tropics benefit species with low tolerance for wide swings in temperature.
  * Rainforests have more species because they’ve been around longer (millions of years) with more time for species to develop; ice still covered Canada twenty thousand years ago.



Species in Manu National Park in the Andes are already responding to climate change. The reserve is a biodiversity “hot spot”—for instance, the cloud forest (a higher-elevation rainforest) is home to one in every nine bird species. Researchers have found thirty new tree species and another three hundred species they believe are new but haven’t yet classified.

They’ve divided part of the forest into 17 study areas at different elevations with different temperatures. Their research has shown that some tree species are “moving” to higher elevations as temperatures warm, by dispersing their seeds up the mountain. Researchers calculated that global warming is pushing the average genus (a group of closely related species) eight feet higher per year. However, they found that one species is moving a hundred feet a year.

### Extreme Temperature Swings

Plants and animals everywhere adjust to brief or cyclical temperature changes—for instance, day and night, wet and dry periods, and seasonal changes. They have physiological responses such as panting and growing or shedding fur. They may also migrate or hibernate.

However, over vast amounts of time—a million or more years—species have confronted drastic changes in climate (long-term temperature changes). The earth has been cooling for forty million years, starting in the late Eocene when there wasn’t any ice. Thirty-five million years ago, glaciers began forming in Antarctica. Three million years ago, ice also formed in the Arctic.

A half-million years later, at the beginning of the Pleistocene Epoch, the world experienced a series of ice ages or glaciations, which scientists believe resulted from changes in Earth’s orbit. The amount of sunlight varied depending on the latitude and time of the year. Snow and ice accumulated in the north, carbon dioxide levels dropped, and the ice grew. When Earth’s orbit changed again, the ice began melting, CO2 increased, and further melting occurred.

This cycle recurred twenty times. Plants and animals responded with mass migrations—even insects moved thousands of miles. **Scientists project that the temperature change in the next century will be comparable in magnitude to the temperature fluctuations of the ice ages**. At the current emissions rate, temperatures in the Andes will soar as much as nine degrees.

### Faster Warming Today

While the magnitude of current change is similar to that of the ice ages, the rate of temperature change is much faster. **Today, the planet is warming at ten times the rate at the end of the last ice age. Species will have to migrate ten times as fast.** Only time will tell how many succeed. However, many won’t.

In 2004, scientists used a concept known as the species-area relationship, which is expressed by a formula, to estimate the extinction risk at different levels of global warming. The idea is that the larger your sample area, the more species you’ll find. Researchers compiled data on the ranges of over one thousand species of plants and animals and correlated the ranges with the current climate. Then they considered two climate warming scenarios: one in which species stayed put (and the area habitable for them declined), and one in which they were mobile. Here’s what they determined for each scenario:

Scenario 1—Species stay put:

  * If global warming were minimal, 22% to 31% of species would be “committed to extinction” by 2050. 
  * If global warming reached its projected maximum, 38% to 52% percent of species would be doomed.



Scenario 2—Species are highly mobile:

  * With minimum global warming, 9% to 13% of species would be “committed to extinction.”
  * At the maximum global warming level, 21% to 35% of species would disappear.



When researchers averaged the two scenarios and factored in a mid-range warming projection, they calculated that 24% of all species would be headed for extinction. These findings, featured on the cover of _Nature_ , received wide attention. The BBC boiled the research down with this headline: “Climate Change Could Drive a Million of the World’s Species to Extinction.”

More recent studies have contended the article’s projections are either understated or overstated. Either way, the researchers say, the potential impacts support the notion that we have entered the Anthropocene, in which humans are significantly altering the earth’s geology, atmosphere, and ecosystems.

### A Domino Effect on Species

A cloud forest, like a coral reef, is the backbone of an ecosystem of interdependent species. Specific insects depend on specific tree species. Certain birds eat certain insects and they shelter in trees. Birds and animals also serve the trees by pollinating them and spreading seeds.

Global warming continues to change the ecosystem dynamic. Among plants, some species will benefit from warmer temperatures and higher carbon dioxide levels, but others will languish and disappear.

Forest reserves like Manu National Park can protect biodiversity against mining, logging, and other threats by establishing protective borders. But global warming knows no borders. And when species need to move to survive, reserves won’t be big enough to save them.

In the long, long run, a warmer world may be as diverse or more diverse than today’s world. But for present-day species, the outlook is grim. Aside from the issue of habitat, their ability to deal with a much warmer climate is doubtful. Today’s species descended from ancestors who survived the ice ages—they’re cold-adapted. Since temperatures haven’t gotten that much warmer, they haven’t developed adaptations to additional heat.

**Yet by the end of the century, carbon dioxide could reach levels unprecedented in 50 million years.**
