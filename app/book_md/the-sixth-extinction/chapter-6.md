## Chapter 6: Impacts—Ocean Acidification

Oceans, covering 70% of the earth’s surface, absorb a lot of the carbon we’re pumping into the air—two-and-a-half-billion tons a year when this book was written in 2014—which is changing ocean chemistry.

In the past, there was a fairly even exchange of gases: the ocean absorbed gases from the atmosphere and also released dissolved gases back into the atmosphere. At this point, however, more CO2 is entering the oceans than they can release, resulting in acidification. (Carbon dioxide dissolves in water and forms carbonic acid.)

As a result, **the pH of the oceans’ surface water has decreased, making them 30% more acidic than they were in 1800**. The pH is on track to fall to 7.8 (from today’s average of 8.1) by the end of this century, making the oceans 150 percent more acidic than before the industrial revolution.

Ocean acidification may have played a major role in the most recent mass extinction event—the End Cretaceous. It’s believed to have been a factor in two more of the Big Five—the End Permian and End Triassic and possibly in two lesser extinction events.

### Why Acidification is Dangerous

**In terms of destructive effects, ocean acidification has been called global warming’s “evil twin.”** There are numerous reasons, which add up to a steep loss of biodiversity, including:

  * Acidification affects the internal processes of marine organisms—for instance metabolism and enzyme activity.
  * It changes the composition of microbial communities and thus the availability of key nutrients like iron and nitrogen.
  * It changes the amount of light that passes through water.
  * It stimulates toxic algae growth.
  * It affects photosynthesis. Some species will benefit from higher CO2 levels, but others will be harmed.



**Among the biggest victims will be calcifiers—animals and plants that construct shells or external skeletons.** They include starfish, sea urchins, mollusks (clams and oysters), barnacles, and many coral species (the ones that build reefs). Many kinds of seaweed, some algae, and some plants also are calcifiers.

To build shells and skeletons, they combine calcium ions and carbonate ions to create calcium carbonate. But to do so, they have to change the chemistry of the seawater. Acidification makes this more difficult, in part by decreasing the number of available carbonate ions. In addition, water with too much acid dissolves or eats holes in their shells.

### A Glimpse of the Future

An odd natural phenomenon occurring off the tiny Italian island of Castello Aragonese, west of Naples, provides a preview of ocean acidification’s devastating effects on marine life. For several hundred years, vents in the sea floor along the island have been spewing carbon dioxide. They’re a vestige of past underwater volcanic eruptions caused by two continental plates pressing together. Streams of gas erupt from the seafloor and dissolve in the water.

Scientists have been studying the effects along a natural pH gradient. On the Island’s eastern edge, the water is unaffected, but as you progress toward the vents, the acidity increases. The researchers divided the area into zones to count and track the species—for instance, mussels, barnacles, limpets, fish, sea urchins, and seaweeds—at different pH levels.

In the area farthest from the vents, they found 69 species of animals and 51 plants. In the area closest to the vents, where the pH is 7.8, there are a third fewer species. A pH of 7.8 is considered the tipping point for an ecological system crash, a point we are projected to reach in 2100. Calcifiers make up three-fourths of the species missing near the vents, including a normally ubiquitous barnacle, a robust mussel, sea snail, and seaweed. Limpets near the vents at Castello Aragonese have holes in their shells.

These and other experiments show that some species will thrive as acidification increases—for instance, picoplankton like acidified water but when they multiply, they use up nutrients, to the detriment of larger organisms. At-risk species include clownfish, Pacific oysters, and two organisms that are food sources for other species such as salmon and whales.

### Reversing Geologic History

The oceans have absorbed about a third—150 billion metric tons—of the CO2 we’ve released into the atmosphere. But the pace is as critical as the volume.

It’s similar to drinking alcohol—how fast you drink it (over what period of time), in addition to how much your drink, affects your blood-alcohol content. Whether the oceans absorb large volumes of CO2 over a million years or over a hundred affects their chemistry differently.

CO2 releases of the past, for instance from volcanoes, can’t compare to the pace of man-made emissions from vehicles, power plants, and manufacturing. By burning fossil fuels, we’re releasing carbon into the air that’s been sequestered for hundreds of millions of years. We’re “running geologic history in reverse at warp speed.”

If we continue on this course, according to researchers writing in the journal _Oceanography_ , the Anthropocene’s legacy will be “one of the most notable, if not cataclysmic events in the history of our planet.”
