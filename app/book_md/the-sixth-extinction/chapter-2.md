## Chapter 2: Tracing the Clues to Past Extinctions

Until the eighteenth century, scientists and naturalists had no concept of extinction. **They believed life was a long, unbroken “chain of being”—that the animals and other life forms existing at the time were the only ones that had ever existed or would exist.**

They believed this despite the existence of collections in London, Paris, and Berlin of the remains of creatures such as trilobites, belemnites, and ammonites. In addition, mammoth bones had been uncovered in Siberia, although they were thought to be from elephants.

Finally, in revolutionary France in the mid-1700s, a visionary naturalist, Georges Cuvier, began connecting the dots, starting with a giant molar found in New York state in 1705 and shipped to London, plus a cache of mastodon bones found in a sulfurous marsh along the Ohio River in 1739 by a French expedition. Today the site of the discovery is a state park in Kentucky called Big Bone Lick.

The mastodon bones, which included a three-and-a-half-foot thigh bone, a gigantic tusk, and several teeth, ended up at the Paris Museum of Natural History. A second shipment of bones from the site was sent to London. The bones seemed elephant-like, but naturalists were confused by the teeth, which were different from elephant teeth.

One scientist described it as a new animal, the _American incognitum_. Some naturalists thought the bones were parts of two or three different types of animals, such as an elephant and a hippo. In 1781, Thomas Jefferson also described it as a new animal, which he thought could still be living in unexplored territory—because naturalists believed nature had never allowed a species to become extinct.

### A Lost World

Cuvier went to work at the Paris Museum and began studying the Kentucky bones in 1795. A year later, he presented his findings in a ground-breaking lecture. He contended that because of the different teeth, the Kentucky bones plus others found in Siberia belonged to two new species of animals, which he called “lost species” or extinct species, since no living animals had ever been found.

He continued searching for lost species and soon added others to the list:

  * A skeleton found in Brazil, which he concluded was a sort of giant sloth (he named it _Megatherium_).
  * The so-called Maastricht animal, whose remains with shark-like teeth had been found in a Dutch quarry. This was much later determined to be a marine reptile—a mosasaur.
  * Remains of several species of hoofed animals plus a marsupial found in gypsum quarries north of Paris.



Cuvier believed there had to be other extinct species. His radical assertion was that numerous species had died out over a widespread area, which he said proved that **another world had previously existed and some kind of catastrophe had wiped it out.**

Meanwhile, Cuvier sought specimens from other naturalists around Europe. By 1800, he identified 23 species he believed to be extinct, including a pygmy hippo, an elk with massive antlers, a giant bear, and a giant amphibian. All were similar to present-day animals, but something different was found in Bavaria, which lent momentum to the idea of a lost world—a strange flying reptile, which Cuvier called a _ptero-dactyle_.

The excitement of finding lost-world species extended across the Atlantic. Farmhands in Newburgh, N,Y, found a giant skeleton. Philadelphia naturalist Charles Wilson Peale reconstructed it and unveiled the eleven-foot tall creature (with the tusks incorrectly pointing down instead of up) on Christmas Eve 1801. It was an American mastodon, but they called it an _incognitum_ and also a mammoth. Peale and his sons sent a second one from the same site to Europe for exhibition. Mammoths caught on in the popular imagination. Suddenly, people in the northeastern U.S. started describing large things as “mammoth”—for instance, merchants advertised “mammoth bread” and “mammoth cheese.”

However, Cuvier realized the Newburgh “mammoth” wasn’t really a mammoth—in an 1806 paper, he called it a mastodon and he identified four other mastodon species. Amateur “fossilists,” who hunted fossils for rich collectors, began uncovering other creatures. In 1812, Cuvier published a four-volume series on fossil animals, the number having grown to 49.

### A Theory of Extinction

The big question of what had killed them remained.

The study of different layers of rock formed in different time periods—called stratigraphy—showed a progression of life. Fossils found near the surface of the earth—for instance, mastodons and cave bears—resembled animals still alive. In the next layer down, there were creatures unlike any modern animals and in the layer below that, there were immense reptiles.

Cuvier opposed the concept of evolution—that organisms had to adapt to changes in their environment over time to survive—which had begun gaining currency. He believed animals were designed specifically for their environment and if an animal was born with different features from its forebears, it wouldn’t survive. But, having rejected evolution, Cuvier couldn’t explain how the world ended up with different groups of animals at different times or how new types could appear (speciation).

In any case, he was most interested in extinction. First, he suggested that the mastodon, mammoth, and giant sloth had been wiped out by a one-time catastrophe. As his discoveries of extinct species grew, he theorized there were multiple catastrophes the animals couldn’t handle.

For instance, stratigraphy of rock formations around Paris showed that the region had been submerged at various times. Cuvier theorized there had been sudden “revolutions on the surface of the earth” or massive floods at the point just before human-recorded history.

However, scientists later learned that the Paris stratigraphy reflected slow changes in sea level and the effects of plate tectonics, not a sudden event like a flood. But **Cuvier was right about past catastrophic events having disrupted the earth, causing mass extinctions.** At these times, nature changed course and operated in an entirely different way.

He theorized that the American mastodon had been wiped out by the same catastrophe that killed the mammoth and sloth, which was almost correct. In fact, the American mastodon died off thirteen thousand years ago as part of what we now call the megafauna extinction—corresponding with and likely resulting from the spread of humans. We were the catastrophe.

(Shortform note: Supporting the belief that humans caused the extinction of mammoths is the discovery announced in November 2019 of traps in Mexico into which mammoths were driven and killed.)
