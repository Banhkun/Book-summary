## 1-Page Summary

In _The Sixth Extinction_ , journalist Elizabeth Kolbert argues that humans are rapidly changing the shape of the earth and the composition of the atmosphere, unleashing a mass extinction of most living things, quite possibly including ourselves. Scientists have identified five previous mass extinction events over 500 million years and many believe a Sixth Extinction, set in motion by humans, is underway.

Humans began impacting the world from the start. As modern humans spread from East Africa around the globe, they found archaic humans similar to themselves and gigantic animals (megafauna)—both of which they wiped out.

They—we—started demolishing forests to grow food and spreading animals, plants, and other life forms to new continents, thus changing the face of the earth. With the discovery of energy sources underground, we began our greatest and most deadly transformation—of the composition of the atmosphere and the oceans. Some plants and animals have survived by migrating. But many, perhaps millions, are stranded where they are unable, or lack time, to adapt. **Extinction rates are skyrocketing. No other species has so drastically changed life on earth**.

### The Big Five Mass Extinctions

Until the eighteenth century, scientists and naturalists had no concept of extinction. They believed life was a long, unbroken “chain of being”—that the animals and other life forms existing at the time were the only ones that had ever existed or would exist. Then bones of huge creatures such as mastodons and mammoths began turning up and naturalists puzzled over why they had disappeared.

Some theorized there had been “lost worlds” of fantastic species that were obliterated by catastrophes. Others believed that extinction only happened slowly as part of the process of evolution—animals with non-beneficial traits eventually died out. Eventually, with the discovery in the 1980s of the site of an asteroid strike on the Yucatan Peninsula, the idea of sudden mass extinctions gained adherents.

Today, scientists believe in both gradual and sudden extinctions. They’ve identified five mass extinction events of the distant past—the “Big Five”—plus a number of smaller extinctions. Each of the Big Five suddenly decimated the earth’s diversity of life.

(Shortform note: The Big Five extinctions were:

1) **The End Ordovician period** , 444 million years ago, 86% of species lost. The cause was a sudden cooling of the climate (carbon dioxide levels and temperatures dropped and things froze—glaciation) plus a huge drop in sea levels plus an ocean chemistry change resulting from the drop in CO2.

2) **Late Devonian** , 375 million years ago, 75% of species lost.

3) **End Permian** , 251 million years ago, 96% of species lost. This extinction seems to have been triggered by a sudden warming of the climate. For unknown reasons, an enormous amount of carbon was released into the air. Temperatures shot up and the seas heated up and became acidified. Oxygen levels in the water plummeted, probably suffocating nearly all life.

4) **End Triassic** , 200 million years ago, 80% of species lost.

5) **End Cretaceous** , 66 million years ago, 76% of all species lost when an asteroid traveling at 45,000 miles an hour crashed into the Yucatan Peninsula. A scorching cloud spread across North America, vaporizing everything. Dust blocked much of the sunlight, creating an “impact winter” or prolonged cooling.)

### The Anthropocene Epoch

Each of the Big Five had its own unique causes, but in every case, species faced drastic changes for which they had no time to adapt.

**Scientists believe we’ve entered a new epoch: the Anthropocene or human-dominated geological epoch, characterized by man-made, planet-altering changes**.

Among the first signs that our actions are leading to catastrophe was the disappearance of amphibians beginning in the 1980s. Researchers in Panama first noticed that an iconic local species, the Golden Frog, was dying. Then they realized frogs were disappearing all over the globe.

In 2008, citing the precipitous drop in amphibian populations, an article in the _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_ , asked, “Are We in the Midst of the Sixth Mass Extinction?” The authors concluded that, **based on the extinction rates among amphibians, a sixth catastrophic event is underway**.

Besides amphibians, animals are in trouble everywhere. Among those suffering steep declines are reef-building corals, sharks, rays, fresh-water mollusks, reptiles, mammals, and birds. While different animals are disappearing for seemingly different immediate reasons, in every case you can ultimately trace the cause to humans.

### Global Warming

Most importantly, **we’ve changed the composition of the atmosphere by adding vast amounts of carbon dioxide** —over two hundred years, the level of carbon dioxide in the air has risen by 40%. As a result, the earth’s climate is likely to behave significantly differently for many millennia to come.

By burning fossil fuels, we’ve added 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere. By cutting down forests, we’ve contributed another 180 billion tons and each year we add

9 billion tons more.

**The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere—over four hundred parts per million—is higher than it’s been in more than a million years.** At our current emissions rate, it will exceed five hundred parts per million by 2050, boosting temperatures, which will melt what remains of the glaciers and the Arctic ice cap and flood islands and coastal cities, such as New York and Washington, D.C.

Plant and animal species adjust to both short- (seasonal) and long-term temperature changes by migrating. During the multiple warming-cooling cycles of the ice ages, there were mass migrations—even insects moved thousands of miles. **Scientists project that the temperature change in the next century will be comparable in magnitude to the temperature fluctuations of the ice ages**.

Many species are already responding to climate change by adjusting their ranges. For instance, some tree species in Manu National Park in the Andes are “moving” to higher elevations as temperatures warm by dispersing their seeds up the mountain. The average genus (a group of closely related species) is moving eight feet higher per year. One species is even moving a hundred feet a year.

### Habitat Destruction

Species need to migrate for survival. However, our transformation of the earth by fragmenting forests (dividing them by highways, cities, mining operations, cropland, and other human development) makes it difficult, if not impossible.

In addition, by cutting down forests entirely, we’ve reduced the amount of available habitat, which reduces species diversity by hindering their ability to reproduce and making the smaller populations more vulnerable to extinction.

Big animals like elephants, bears, and rhinos are threatened by both habitat loss and poaching. For example, humans have killed so many rhinos and destroyed so much of their habitat that all five species of rhinos are at risk.

Other large mammals that are also in trouble:

  * Six of eight species of bears are listed as “vulnerable” to extinction or “endangered.”
  * Asian elephants have declined by half; African elephants are under pressure from poachers.
  * Most large cats are decreasing.
  * In a hundred years, pandas, rhinos, and tigers may exist only in zoos or in reserves so small and closely guarded that they constitute zoos.



### Ocean Acidification

Oceans absorb a lot of the carbon we’re pumping into the air—two-and-a-half-billion tons a year when this book was written in 2014—which is changing ocean chemistry.

In the past, there was a fairly even exchange of gases: the ocean absorbed gases from the atmosphere and also released dissolved gases back into the atmosphere. At this point, however, more CO2 is entering the oceans than they can release, resulting in acidification. (Carbon dioxide dissolves in water and forms carbonic acid.)

As a result, the pH of the oceans’ surface water has decreased, making them 30% more acidic than they were in 1800. The pH is on track to fall to 7.8 (from today’s average of 8.1) by the end of this century, making the oceans 150 percent more acidic than before the industrial revolution.

**In terms of destructive effects, ocean acidification has been called global warming’s “evil twin.”** There are numerous reasons, which add up to a steep loss of biodiversity, including:

  * Acidification affects the internal processes of marine organisms—for instance, metabolism and enzyme activity.
  * It changes the composition of microbial communities and thus the availability of key nutrients like iron and nitrogen.
  * It changes the amount of light passing through water.
  * It stimulates toxic algae growth.
  * It affects photosynthesis.



Among the biggest victims are calcifiers—animals and plants that construct shells or external skeletons. They include starfish, sea urchins, mollusks (clams and oysters), barnacles, and many coral species (the ones that build reefs). Many kinds of seaweed, some algae, and some plants also are calcifiers.

To build shells and skeletons, they combine calcium ions and carbonate ions to create calcium carbonate. But to do so, they have to change the chemistry of the seawater. Acidification makes this more difficult, in part by decreasing the number of available carbonate ions. In addition, water with too much acid dissolves or eats holes in their shells.

### Invasive Species

In the past, the range of many species was limited by geographic barriers such as oceans, rivers, and mountains. Today, however, species are being dispersed widely by humans, with disastrous consequences.

In the Anthropocene, there are no barriers to species’ travel when they hitch rides with humans. As a result, in some regions, non-native (invasive) plants have exceeded native species. At any given time, an estimated ten thousand species are traveling around the world in ships’ ballast water. **Our constant reshuffling of species is unraveling millions of years of geographic separation**.

The way we’re moving species around the world is a type of Russian roulette—sometimes nothing much happens; other times, catastrophes result. In the worst-case scenario, the new species thrives, reproduces, and becomes established, decimating local species through predation or by spreading new diseases.

In North America, for instance, bat populations have fallen victims to the dispersal of a European fungus, for which they have no defense. The foreign fungus causes a disease called white-nose syndrome, named after the white powder found on the faces of dead and dying bats. In some areas, as many as 90% of the bats have died—the dire consequence of a seemingly innocuous fungus that was accidentally imported to the U.S.

### The Future

It’s possible that through our transformation of the earth, we’ll destroy ourselves. For a species, past longevity is no guarantee of future longevity. Marine creatures called ammonites lived for hundreds of millions of years before they suddenly disappeared. Regarding human prospects:

  * Anthropologist Richard Leakey suggested, “ _Homo sapiens_ might not only be the agent of the Sixth Extinction, but also risks being one of its victims.”
  * Stanford University ecologist Paul Erlich described the future in even starker terms: “In pushing other species to extinction, humanity is busy sawing off the limb on which it perches.”



It’s also possible that human ingenuity will save us from human-created disaster. For instance, some scientists suggest we could restructure the atmosphere by dispersing sulfates to reflect sunlight into space. Or we could take up residence on other planets.

However, in the scheme of geologic time, saving ourselves isn’t the most important thing. It’s that our actions will set the direction of life long after we and everything we’ve created are gone and other life has inherited the earth.
