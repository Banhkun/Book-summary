## Chapter 11: Last of the Megafauna

A great variety of supersized animals—megafauna—once stalked the earth. Near the end of the Cretaceous period, there were many groups of huge dinosaurs besides _Tyrannosaurus_. Members of the _Saltasaurus_ group weighed around seven tons. A member of the _Therizinosaurus_ group was thirty feet long,

Near the end of the last ice age, there were enormous animals all over the world. In Europe, the roster included woolly rhinos, cave bears, giant elk, and hyenas. North America had mastodons, mammoths, giant camels, grizzly-size beavers, saber-toothed cats, and a giant ground sloth. South America had _glyptodonts_ , which resembled armadillos the size of small cars. Australia’s even weirder animals included _diprotodons_ , a group of huge marsupials called rhinoceros wombats; a marsupial lion, and a ten-foot-tall kangaroo. New Zealand had giant birds—the South Island giant moa was twelve feet tall.

Being very big was an evolutionary advantage—large animals had no predators. So **the question of why the megafauna died out has puzzled scientists** dating back to Cuvier’s day, when the fossils of huge unknown creatures began turning up.

Scientists have debated whether megafauna disappeared due to climate change (possibly multiple events) or were killed by humans. But most researchers today lean toward blaming humans. The big animals’ disappearance in Australia and the Americas coincided with the appearance of humans. There’s also evidence that Maori killed off the giant birds in New Zealand: the remains of outdoor ovens and “middens” containing bones of large birds.

The advantage of being too big to have predators disappeared when humans came on the scene. At that point, **the flipside of being extra-large—being slow to reproduce—became a disadvantage.** If humans killed off large numbers of a species—or even killed small numbers continually for millennia—the rest wouldn’t have been able to reproduce fast enough to avoid extinction.

### Big Animals in Trouble Today

Human pressure plus slow reproduction are also why big animals like elephants, bears, and rhinos are in trouble today. Take rhinos, for example. Humans have killed so many rhinos and destroyed so much of their habitat that, ironically, only extraordinary human efforts can save them.

The double-horned Sumatran rhino is the smallest and oldest of the five species of rhino that still exist. It once ranged from the foothills of the Himalayas through Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and beyond. But by the early 1980s, its population had shrunk to a few hundred and was heading toward extinction due to habitat loss as southeast Asia’s forests were cut down.

In 1984, conservationists started a captive breeding program to try and save the species. They caught forty and sent seven to zoos in the U.S. Only three in the U.S. lived and the two females and a male were consolidated at the Cincinnati Zoo. There, with the help of the zoo’s Center for Conservation and Research of Endangered Wildlife, three offspring eventually were born. Along with one other rhino, they’ve been the only four captive Sumatran rhinos born in the last thirty years. Meanwhile, the number in the wild has declined sharply since the 1980s.

Other rhino species are also at risk:

  * There may be fewer than fifty Javan rhinos left (they once ranged across southeast Asia).
  * The Indian rhino, largest of five species, is down to three thousand in four parks.
  * Black rhinos are down to five thousand.
  * White rhinos are the only species not listed as threatened after rebounding, but they are under renewed pressure from poachers for their horns.



In fact, almost all large mammals are in trouble:

  * Six of eight species of bears are listed as “vulnerable” to extinction or “endangered.”
  * Asian elephants have declined by half.
  * African elephants are under pressure from poachers.
  * Most large cats are decreasing.
  * In a hundred years, pandas, rhinos, and tigers may exist only in zoos or in reserves so small and closely guarded that they constitute zoos.
