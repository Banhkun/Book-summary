## Chapter 3: The Great Auk—an Observable Extinction

In the 19th century, those who believed in sudden mass extinctions were called catastrophists.

But geologist Charles Lyell, who greatly influenced Charles Darwin, believed in a slow process of extinction that accompanied evolution: the landscape changed gradually over millennia due to events and processes like volcanoes, erosion, and sedimentation. Some animals adapted to survive and others didn’t.

Those who believed only in gradual extinction were called uniformitarians. (Today, scientists believe the earth is subject to both gradual (background) extinction and sudden mass extinction.)

Darwin joined the five-year voyage of the _Beagle_ in 1831, which headed for South America to survey the coast and improve existing maps. Through studies during and after the trip, he developed his theory of natural selection, which contends that life, like the physical environment, is always changing. Organisms better adapted to their environment produce more offspring, passing on the successful adaptations. This process of selecting and rejecting traits and variations is continuous and drives evolution.

Darwin believed that over vast amounts of time, new species—fish, birds, animals, humans—developed from old ones. This theory about how species began also accounted for how they vanished. Natural selection gradually rewarded the fit and eliminated the unfit. **Both evolution and extinction were imperceptible processes—sudden catastrophes had nothing to do with species’ disappearances, in Darwin’s view.**

### Contradicting Darwin

However, during Darwin’s time, humans drove one of Europe’s most unusual species, the great auk, to extinction, contradicting his theory that extinction was always slow.

The great auk was a large, black-and-white, penguin-like bird (although it didn’t actually belong to the penguin family). It had a big beak and a white spot under each eye. The great auk inhabited the islands of the North Atlantic, where it bred and raised young in massive colonies. It was a great swimmer but couldn’t fly, which made the two-and-half-foot bird easy prey for passing sailors, who killed large numbers for food.

Auks probably once numbered in the millions. When the first settlers arrived in Iceland from Scandinavia, they regularly killed auks for food. In addition, auks were used as fish bait, burned as fuel, and plucked for mattresses. On islands where they gathered, they were herded into stone pens or onto ships to be killed. By the late 1700s, as a result of mass slaughter, the great auk population was in steep decline. While environmental causes like a volcano on one of the breeding islands contributed to the decline, egg collectors delivered the final blow. The last known pair of auks, incubating an egg, was killed so the egg could be taken for collectors on the island of Eldey, off Iceland, in 1844.

Darwin had to have known of the great auk’s extinction—a colleague, Alfred Newton, was the one who determined the auk was gone for good. Darwin himself also received first-hand reports of the near extinction by humans of Charles Island tortoises on his _Beagle_ voyage. In _On the Origin of Species_ , he also referred to human-caused extermination of animals.

Despite the evidence of sudden, human-caused catastrophes in front of him, Darwin continued to insist that species went extinct only slowly, through competition and natural selection.
