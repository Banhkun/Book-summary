## Exercise: Start to Fear-Set

Once we articulate and define our fears, they’re less frightening.

* * *

Think of something you want to do but are scared to. If you do this thing, what’s the worst possible outcome?

What are the consequences and how permanent are they? How likely is this worst-case scenario?

If the worst-case scenario did happen, how would you recover? Think of ways to fix all the consequences you listed above.

The worst-case scenario is never the most likely scenario. What are some of the other possible scenarios? What are their positive and negative outcomes?
