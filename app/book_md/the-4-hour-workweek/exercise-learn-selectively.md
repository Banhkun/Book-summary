## Exercise: Learn Selectively

Step E (Eliminate) of the DEAL process involves learning to ignore any unimportant or unactionable information.

* * *

Think of the last time you needed to learn something. For example, perhaps you were trying to decide which kind of credit card to sign up for. How did you learn? How long did it take you?

Now, think of something new you’d like to learn. Who do you know who could give you an overview of the topic? If you don’t personally know anyone knowledgeable in the subject, who could you get in touch with? Consider authors of books on the subject, industry experts, and so on.

How long do you think it would take you to learn using this second method?
