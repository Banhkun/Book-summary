## Part I: The Wild West ︱Chapter 1: The Arizona Desert

**Jeannette’s earliest memory is the day she caught on fire when she was three years old.** Her family, which included Rose Mary; her father, Rex; older sister, Lori, and younger brother, Brian, lived in a trailer in southern Arizona. Jeannette was wearing a pink party dress and stirring hot dogs in boiling water. She had to stand on a chair to reach the pot.

Jeannette knew how to cook hot dogs. She did it often as the only means of having something to eat. Her mother was usually consumed with painting, as she was now in the next room. The only other person home was her little brother. The bottom edge of Jeannette’s dress brushed up against the flames and consumed one side of her body. Rose Mary put the flames out with a blanket and calmly asked their neighbor to drive them to the hospital. Rex was out with the car.

### A Luxury Vacation

**Life was so good at the hospital compared to home, Jeannette never wanted to leave.** She loved having her own room and the cleanliness and quiet. She’d also never watched TV before and spent most of her time watching old sitcoms, like _The Lucille Ball Show_. Sometimes, she’d pass the time reading to the nurses. They were impressed with how well she could read.

Mostly, Jeannette loved all the food. She was given three meals a day and ice cream, Jell-O, or fruit cocktail for dessert. One of the nurses even gave Jeannette her first piece of gum. There was always more food and gum. Nothing ever ran out like at home. It was paradise.

Jeannette sustained severe burns on one side of her chest, and the doctors performed skin grafts using skin from her thighs. The hospital staff questioned Jeannette about her injuries. They asked if her parents hurt her, where her other cuts and bruises came from, and why she was cooking by herself. Jeannette wasn’t fazed. She said she was cut and bruised from playing outside and that she always cooked hot dogs. Her mother said she was very mature.

#### Paradise Lost

Whenever Jeannette’s family came to visit, they were loud and unruly. **Her parents would argue, sing, laugh, and make a general ruckus that earned admonishments from the staff.**

Rex was always the more gregarious. He threatened to beat up the nurses and doctors if Jeannette wasn’t being treated right. Her mother wasn’t much better. When she found out about the nurse and the chewing gum, she went into a tirade about what a disgusting habit chewing gum was. She was going to give that nurse the what-for.

Rex thought it would have been better if Jeannette had seen the witch doctor they’d taken her older sister to after she was bitten by a scorpion. He said she’d heal faster than being stuck in here with the quacks they called doctors. In fact, Rex started a fight with one of the doctors. He argued that keeping her in bandages didn’t allow the burns to breathe. The doctor countered that the bandages warded off infections. **Rex pulled his fist back in anticipation for a punch, but the doctor backed away. A security guard escorted the family out of the hospital.**

The next time the family visited Jeannette, Brian’s head was wrapped in a blood-soaked bandage. He’d fallen off the couch and cracked his head open. Despite the significant amount of blood, they’d bandaged Brian up at home. One hospitalized child was enough, said Rose Mary.

#### Checking Out Rex Walls Style

Jeannette had been hospitalized for six weeks when her parents decided it had been long enough. **One day, Rex walked into her room and said they were about to check out Rex Walls style.** Jeanette questioned the decision, but he told her to trust him.

She could smell Rex’s signature scent of stale whiskey, cigarettes, and hair product when he leaned over to pick her up. Rex scurried down the hall with Jeannette in his arms. Outside, the whole family sat waiting in the running blue station wagon, the Blue Goose. Rex placed her in the back seat and told her not to worry. She was finally safe.

**Jeannette was back cooking hotdogs days after returning home. She also had a new obsession with fire.** She started testing how long she could hold her finger over a candle flame and stared in awe at garbage fires in her neighborhood. She played with matches and made small fires with paper, debris, and plastic dolls. Her parents were proud she’d embraced her accident so bravely.

### The Walls Family Origins

Jeannette didn’t know much about her father’s past. He never liked to talk about his upbringing in Welch, West Virginia or his parents. All she knew was that Rex left home when he was seventeen to join the Air Force.

When Rex met Rose Mary, he thought she was the most beautiful woman he’d ever seen. The day he met her, he said they were going to get married. Rose Mary was coy at first, stating that twenty-three men had already tried to marry her, but Rex was persistent. He wore her down until she said yes, and they were married six months later.

Lori was conceived a few months after the wedding. **A year later, their second child, Mary Charlene, was born but died nine months later from sudden infant death syndrome.** Two years after Mary Charlene’s death, Jeannette was born. Rose Mary called her the replacement child. Brian came along a year later. He was born in mid-seizure and couldn’t breathe. Rose Mary said he was likely a “goner,” but Brian lived, and the seizures stopped.

Rose Mary never showed much emotion about Mary Charlene. She said it was God’s decision, and he’d had his reasons for taking her back. But Rex was a different story. Rex was the one who’d found her dead in the crib, and whenever her name came up, he’d leave the room. **After her death, Rex changed. He started drinking, became moody, and started to get fired from every job he got.**

At one point, Rex sold Rose Mary’s diamond wedding ring for cash without telling her. The stone was big, and Rose Mary’s mother, Grandma Smith, had paid for it. After that, Rose Mary brought the stolen ring up whenever she was angry with Rex. But Rex said he would buy her a bigger ring as soon as they were rich.

### The Skedaddle

**The Walls family was never in one place for long.** Every now and then, Rex would wake everyone up and proclaim they had fifteen minutes to grab their stuff. It was time to skedaddle. They never had much to pack, just a few cast-iron pots and pans, Rex’s gun, and Rose Mary’s paintings, art supplies, and archery set.

Rex said there were people after him, which was why they always had to skedaddle. He referred to them as vampires, Nazis, or corporate sharks trying to steal his ideas. There were also FBI agents with some mysterious grievance against him. In reality, as Rose Mary often said when Rex wasn’t around, they were simply running from bill collectors.

The drive was always the same. Their parents sang songs to keep them entertained, and Rex told them about his big plans to strike it rich. **There was never a destination in sight. They would end up wherever they did, which was often one cowpoke mining town or another in the Southwest.** The towns were small and dirty, with ramshackle dwellings, a handful of stores, and always a bar. The more secluded and abandoned a town was, the more appeal it had to her parents.

For a month or two, Rex would find work as an engineer or electrician after lying about degrees and work experience he didn’t have. When he was bored with one job, he’d find a random odd job to keep money coming in. Other times, he’d bet what little money they had playing poker.

This was the pattern. Rex would quit or get fired, bills would pile up, and the “FBI” would close in. Rex would rouse the family, pack up the car, and do it all again in some other town.

### Life as They Knew It

Although the locations always changed, the kind of people they called neighbors rarely did. In each town, they’d find people struggling the same as they did. There’d be former criminals, prostitutes, veterans, and old people who’d lived there so long, they started to look as weathered as their surroundings.

None of the children had many friends. Sometimes, **Jeannette and her siblings went to school, but more often, their parents taught them at home.** Rose Mary taught them to read and challenged them with difficult books for older kids or adults. Rex was knowledgeable in math and science and contributed lessons in those subjects. They also learned survival skills. Rex taught them Morse code and how to shoot a gun and use a bow and arrow. Jeannette was a crack shot by age four, which Rex said would be useful in a shootout with law enforcement.

Both Rex and Rose Mary were at home in the desert. They knew how to work the land, which plants were toxic or medicinal, and where to find water sources. Rose Mary promoted unpurified water over the high-falutin chlorinated water the “namby-pambies” drank in the cities. Toothpaste was baking soda and hydrogen peroxide rubbed on with their fingers.

Food was always a scarcity in the household. The family had no routine surrounding meals. When they had food, they devoured it in great quantities quickly. When they didn’t, it was up to each one to scrounge for sustenance. **They ate whatever they could from whatever source they could find.**

### The Yellow Brick Road

**Rex had big plans for the family’s future. He was going to find gold and turn everything around.** Rex was considered a bit of a genius by those who knew him. He was handy and could fix anything with a little ingenuity, such as the time he fixed a neighbor’s TV with an elbow noodle. He was well-versed in high-level mathematics, physics, and electrical engineering. He studied energy creation and fancied himself an inventor.

Rex was building a machine that would separate gold from dirt and rocks. It was called the Prospector, and it would help the family secure a stockpile of gold nuggets they could use to support themselves. He worked on his machine behind the house and let the kids help.

**Jeannette believed in her father’s wisdom and abilities.** She loved when he told stories about his great feats of bravery in the Air Force, which always ended in him saving a soldier or a whole troop from death and danger. He’d helped save thousands from drowning after fixing a part of the Hoover Dam, and he’d thwarted a terrorist attack on the Air Force base after meeting the guy in a bar. The stories were always told in a way that made Rex the big hero.

These stories were often replaced by the outlandish plans for their futures. **The most significant of Rex’s plans was the Glass Castle, a house made completely out of glass and operated by solar power.** He’d drawn up blueprints and took them everywhere they went. Once the Prospector found gold, he’d begin construction on the house.
