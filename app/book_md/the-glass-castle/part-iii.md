## Part III: Independence︱Chapter 8: New York City

Jeannette woke up in the early morning hours her first night in New York and thought the city was on fire. She was staying with Lori at the women’s hostel. When she asked Lori about the fire the next morning, she learned it was just the city lights reflecting off the smog.

**Jeannette found a job waitressing at a hamburger restaurant that paid her eighty dollars a week.** She loved the crowds, the fast-paced activity of the staff, the discount on meals. Every day, she ate a cheeseburger with a milkshake.

The girls soon found an apartment in a less-expensive part of the Bronx. The whole of their Welch home could fit into the apartment, and for the first time, they had working appliances, like a refrigerator, gas stove, an indoor bathroom, and a bathtub. Although the apartment had nice furnishings, the neighborhood left a little to be desired. But rough neighborhoods were nothing new. Jeannette was mugged several times on her way home, but she always fought back.

### Hitting the Ground Running

To finish her last year of high school, Jeannette enrolled in a public school where the students worked at internships instead of attending classes. **Jeannette took an internship at a low-budget Brooklyn-run paper called _The Phoenix_. **

At first, she worked mostly as an office assistant, but after a number of reporters quit because the owner, Mike, couldn’t pay them, Jeannette was hired as a full-time reporter. She quit her waitressing gig and went to work at eighteen years old. _The Phoenix_ was everything Jeannette had hoped for back in Welch. She was always on the go, always getting calls about stories. She worked ninety-hour weeks and made $125 a week.

**Jeannette was so happy with her job, she no longer thought it necessary to go to college.** She was gaining real-world experience, and if she was asked about or overheard something she didn’t know, like fashion or being Kosher, she would look it up.

One day, someone mentioned something about the Progressive Era during an interview, and Jeannette had to look it up in the encyclopedia when she returned to the office. Mike suggested she might enjoy college so she could learn all the things she didn’t know. He added that a college degree would help her land a better job. He said she was always welcome at _The Phoenix_ if she ever wanted to come back.

### Leave No One Behind

Jeannette and Brian had been corresponding through letters since she left. Although life was moving forward for her and Lori, things in Welch were getting increasingly worse.

Rex was always drunk except when he was thrown in jail for a night. Rose Mary was successful at living for herself and was more or less withdrawn from the family. Maureen was practically living at her friends’ homes. And Brian was sleeping underneath an inflatable raft because the roof in their bedroom had collapsed from water damage.

Jeannette and Lori wondered if Brian would like the city. He was comfortable in the outdoors and never seemed to have a problem with Welch. Also, unlike the girls, Brian had friends. But after Jeannette called and told him about the apartment and the ease of finding work, Brian was convinced.**He took the same bus to New York City the day after his junior year of high school**. He started working at an ice cream parlor close to _The Phoenix_ offices, and at night, he’d wait for Jeannette to finish her work so they could go home together.

Lori wanted Maureen to move to New York, too, but Maureen was only twelve years old. Lori said she would take care of her and make sure she went to school. When Lori told Maureen her plan, Maureen was thrilled. Rose Mary was also thrilled, but Rex accused Lori of stealing his family and said she was no longer his daughter.

One winter day, Maureen walked off the same bus from Welch and moved into Lori’s apartment. Brian was living in Midtown Manhattan by this point, and with his address, they found a good school for Maureen to attend.

**With all the children together again, they organized weekend dinners at Lori and Maureen’s. They’d make big feasts and reminisced about their crazy life in Welch.**

### Higher Education

Jeannette applied to and was accepted by Barnard College, the female equivalent of the all-male Columbia University. She was able to pay most of her tuition with loans and grants, but she had to make up the rest herself. She took a secretarial job on Wall Street.

Without a full-time job, Jeannette couldn’t afford to pay rent at the apartment with Lori and Brian. **She started working as a part-time nanny for a psychologist on the Upper West Side in exchange for housing.** She orchestrated her schedule so she could attend classes two days a week and work at an art gallery on weekends for extra cash.

She’d joined the college’s newspaper, but after getting hired by a large magazine group as an editorial assistant, she quit. The magazine was legitimate and well-known, and she worked with real journalists who’d written books, interviewed presidents, and followed other prestigious stories. Jeannette felt like she’d made it to the big time.

### The Past Catches Up

Three years after moving to New York, Jeannette heard a strange story on the morning radio news. A van had stalled on the New Jersey Turnpike, creating a headache for the morning commute. Clothes and furniture had fallen from the van and were strewn about, and a dog was running wild among the traffic jam. Jeannette thought it was a strange story but forgot about it.

That night, **Rose Mary called Jeannette and said she and Rex had moved to New York**. Jeannette knew right away that the people from the van were none other than her parents. Jeannette didn’t join in Rose Mary’s glee about the news. She was used to being on her own and didn’t want any interference. Even so, she went to Lori’s to see them the following day.

Rex and Rose Mary spoke a mile a minute about their trip to New York and their adventures during the day. All of the kids were there, but none of them joined in the merriment. When Brian asked why they’d moved to New York, Rex thought it was a silly question. Obviously, they’d come to be a family again.

### The Status Quo

Rex and Rose Mary bounced from one cheap room to another their first few months in New York. They either couldn’t pay the rent or caused too much trouble. Brian wouldn’t let them stay with him, believing they needed to figure things out on their own. But Lori, who by now lived in an apartment in Brian’s building, let them move in with her and Maureen.

**The arrangement was supposed to be temporary, but after four months, Rex and Rose Mary were still at Lori’s, and the apartment was starting to look like their house in Welch.** Rose Mary cluttered the apartment with artwork and treasures collected from the street. Despite turning her apartment into a junkyard, Lori’s annoyance was more at her father than her mother.

Rex was still the same Rex he’d always been. He somehow always had money for alcohol, didn’t have a job, and came home late at night drunk and ready to fight. To help ease the burden on Lori, Brian finally took Rex in. Brian locked up all the alcohol in the house in a cabinet, but Rex broke in and consumed everything the first week he was there. When Brian told Rex he couldn’t live with him if he kept drinking, Rex decided to live in the van.

Things got worse in Lori’s apartment. Rose Mary failed to clean the junk out, despite Lori’s repeated requests, and Rex was over all the time. Rex and Rose Mary would argue so aggressively, the neighbors started to complain**.** **Lori couldn’t bring herself to kick her mother out, but Jeannette told her it was for the best if Lori wanted to stay sane.** When Lori offered to help Rose Mary get set up somewhere else, Rose Mary declined.

Rose Mary and Rex lived in the van for a few months, but it was not street legal. When it was towed from an unauthorized parking space, they weren’t able to get it back. That night, they found shelter on a park bench. It was their first night as a homeless couple in New York City.

### Life Goes On

As usual, **Rose Mary saw being homeless as a new adventure. She and Rex had figured out how to successfully live on the streets**. They slept on benches and in bushes, and during the day, they’d stash their gear and wander the city. They became experts about where to get free meals and attended all the free cultural events around the city during the summer months. When the weather grew colder, they went to the public libraries to stay warm.

Once winter came, Rex and Rose Mary slept in churches or sometimes split up. Rex would go to a shelter, and Rose Mary would sleep at Lori’s. These occasions were the only times Rose Mary admitted that being homeless was sometimes hard.

**Jeannette felt trapped between wanting a life free from her parents and the guilt of allowing them to languish on the streets.** She hid her past from everyone in her life. She didn’t defend her parents when a friend said all homeless people were scam artists, and she didn’t defend herself when one of her professors took offense to her claim that sometimes homeless people wanted to be homeless.

Jeannette considered leaving college to help support her parents, but Lori talked her out of it. She said there was no point for Jeannette to jeopardize her future, and besides, Rex would never allow it. He was proud of Jeannette’s achievements. There was also the house in Phoenix and land in Texas. Their parents had options. They were living the way they chose to.

### Crisis Management

After a long winter, Rex contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalized. He didn’t want any visitors, but Jeannette went to see him anyway. Wearing a surgical mask, Rex introduced her to all his friends in the TB ward. Next to his cot were stacks of books. Rex had sobered up since his hospitalization and become interested in mortality and the relationship between physics and the cosmos. His research even made him wonder whether God existed.

Rex was released from the hospital after six weeks. It was the longest he’d been sober since Phoenix. **Rex wanted to stay sober, so instead of going back on the streets, he found a job in Upstate New York as a resort handyman that included housing and meals.** Rex loved being back in the wilderness and stayed at the job for much of the year.

As another winter drew nearer, Rose Mary convinced Rex that two people could survive winter on the streets better than one. **Rex quit his job and moved back to the city. He was drinking again within the first week.**

#### Still the Man of the House

Jeannette had tried to help her parents a few times, including buying Rex a supply of new winter gear. But they would never accept anything from her. Rose Mary blamed the city, saying it was too easy to be homeless in New York. Jeannette accepted that there was nothing she could do, but her inability to help wasn’t just about her parents refusal. She was struggling to save money for school and, in fact, was short a thousand dollars for her final year’s tuition.

Rex had taken a keen interest in Jeannette’s education. He read all the books on her course lists so he could help her with her work if she needed it. When he found out she might have to drop out of school, he told her to meet him at Lori’s place. When she arrived, Rex dumped out a bag full of small bills totaling $950. He also had a mink coat she could sell for the other fifty.

Jeannette didn’t want to accept the money, but he insisted she take it. **Rex said he’d earned the money playing poker because it was his duty to take care of his daughter.** Jeannette took the money and paid her tuition in ones, fives, and twenties.

Rex and Rose Mary found an abandoned building on the Lower West Side to squat in. There were other squatters who lived the same life of a nomad, an adventure around every corner, and shared her parents disdain for rules. Rex hot-wired electricity from a nearby pole so they could all have heat and lights. **The apartment they’d taken up residence in reminded Jeannette of their home in Welch. It was all she could do not to run out.**
