## Chapter 7: A Light at the End of the Tunnel

One day, two filmmakers from New York City arrived in Welch as part of a cultural appreciation tour. Lori showed them some of her drawings, and they said she had real talent. If she wanted to be a serious artist, she should move to New York and go to art school.

The description of New York City as a land of misfits appealed to Lori and Jeannette, who had never truly belonged anywhere. **The girls made a plan. Lori would leave for New York as soon as she graduated and get settled. Jeannette would join her as soon as she could.** They merged whatever money they could save to help Lori get an apartment.

### One Step Forward, Two Steps Back

Jeannette wasn’t working at the jewelry store anymore, but she was babysitting, tutoring kids, and doing their homework for a fee. Lori started commissioning personalized posters for students. She had a knack for artistic writing and design, and she sold them for $1.50 each. Word of mouth spread so fast, she had more orders than she could handle.

The girls told Brian about their plan, and even though he was younger and couldn’t be included, he donated his landscaping earnings to the plastic piggy bank they’d named Oz. They hid Oz in their room and didn’t tell anyone about the money.

As Lori’s graduation date zoomed into view, **Jeannette was consumed with visions of what life would be like for them in New York. Lori, on the other hand, was scared**. She’d made it to the final round of the National Merit Scholarships, but to take the test, she had to hitchhike to a nearby town. A truck driver got fresh, and she was too rattled to perform well. With no scholarship, art school was still just an empty dream.

Then, Lori discovered that a literary group was giving a scholarship to the student who created the best artistic representation of a literary icon. For a full week, Lori created a bust of William Shakespeare that was almost life-like.

The night she was finishing the bust, everyone cheered her on. Rex stumbled in later, drunk and surly. He told Lori that Shakespeare was a phony and hadn’t written any of his plays. He took one look at the bust, then used his thumb to wipe off Shakespeare’s lying mouth. He said he would help her write a paper exposing Shakespeare as a fraud that would set the literary world on fire.

Lori was broken. She didn’t have the heart to fix the bust and smashed it into a blob of clay.

#### The Final Blow

**Lori and Jeannette decided Lori would still move, even if she hadn’t found a school to attend. She’d work and figure it out along the way.**

As usual, Rex didn’t understand why everyone was so bent out of shape about the bust. He said he wasn’t trying to ruin Lori’s plans for New York, but he added that she was a fool for wanting to go. She’d end up living on the streets, becoming a drug addict, and working as a prostitute. When everyone ignored him, he said he didn’t know why he even bothered to come home.

By the time Lori’s graduation came around, the three kids had saved up nine months of earnings. Jeannette came home to add her recent babysitting pay to Oz and found it smashed open. The money was gone. She couldn’t believe Rex would be so low as to steal his children’s money. When Lori found out, she cried, defeated.

Lori waited up all night to confront Rex, but he never came home. It was another three nights before he stumbled in. The children confronted him about the money, but he denied it. He threw a few dollars on the ground and passed out. **Lori was hopeless. There was no way she could leave without money, but Jeannette wasn’t giving up. If Lori never got out, they would all be stuck in Welch forever.**

### Fortitude in the Face of Defeat

One of the families Jeannette babysat for was moving to Iowa over the summer. They offered her two hundred dollars at the end of summer and a bus ticket back to Welch if she came and looked after their children.

Although the kids had started saving again, they only had $37.20 by the time Lori graduated. Jeannette knew the money from babysitting all summer would help, but she knew it would help Lori more emotionally. **She asked the woman if she would take Lori to Iowa, and instead of buying her a ticket back to Welch, she could buy her a ticket to New York City.**

The morning that Lori left, everyone stood outside as she packed one box full of clothes, art supplies, and books into the Iowa-bound station wagon. She hugged everyone goodbye and promised to write. She didn’t say goodbye to Rex, who watched from the porch with a cigarette. She hadn’t spoken to him since the piggy bank incident. As the car pulled away, Lori didn’t look back. **Rex said the family was falling apart, and Jeannette happily agreed.**

### A Career in the Making

Jeannette became the news editor of _The Maroon Wave_ her sophomore year. She borrowed a camera Rose Mary had bought to photograph her artwork and started taking pictures at all the school events. Where once she was an outcast, the popular kids now accepted her and welcomed the opportunity to smile for the camera in the hopes of making it into the paper.

**Working on the _Wave_ gave Jeannette plenty of reasons to stay out of her house. **She stayed after school every day to work on stories, lay out the copy, and finalize each issue. She stayed in the newsroom during lunch, finally finding a legitimate reason for why she wasn’t eating. When everyone was gone after school, she’d sneak into the lunch room and rifle through the cafeteria garbage. She rarely went hungry after that.

By her junior year, Jeannette was editor in chief. She wrote many articles herself and started a campaign to increase circulation.

Rex didn’t believe in much, and there were few people he respected. But one person served as a sort of hero to him: Chuck Yeager, the first man to fly a plane faster than the speed of sound. Chuck was a West Virginia native and was coming to talk at Welch High School.

Rex was floored that Jeannette was going to get to interview Chuck Yeager for the newspaper. He gave her a crash course in aviation history and wrote up more than twenty questions she could ask during the interview. Chuck was impressed with Jeannette’s knowledge and questions. They talked for almost an hour, and afterward, Jeannette was the talk of the school.

**Rex was so excited to hear how the interview had gone, he stayed sober until Jeannette came home.** He offered to help her write her article.

### The Great Escape

Lori had found a hotel for women in the West Village and was loving life. She waitressed at a German restaurant and took art classes. She’d met other artists who were just like her: strange and driven. She wrote home often and told Jeannette she was going to love the city.

**Jeannette had been working on her escape plan all through junior year. She’d graduate, move in with Lori, go to a city college, and work for one of the news wires.** She reached out to the school guidance counselor, Miss Katona, for suggestions on schools to apply to.

Miss Katona was a Welch native and thought the idea of leaving Welch was ridiculous. She advised Jeannette to attend a state school thirty miles away. She said Jeannette wouldn’t want to move away from her family and friends. Besides, she’d have to pay out-of-state tuition if she went to school in New York.

On the walk home, Jeannette wondered if she could get in-state tuition if she moved to New York after junior year instead of graduation. What was there to stay for? Nothing she did made life any better, and things at home had gotten worse over the last year. **By the time she arrived home, it was decided. She was moving at the end of the school year.**

When Jeannette told her parents of her new plan, Rex climbed out the back window, which had become the only way in or out of the house after the front stairs to the porch collapsed. Rose Mary grew despondent, and Jeannette said she’d write all the time. But Rose Mary wasn’t sad about Jeannette leaving, she was jealous. It wasn’t fair that she was stuck in Welch.

Shortly after Jeannette revealed her new plan, Rex walked into the house with the blueprints for the Glass Castle. He’d barely said a word to Jeannette since her announcement. Now, he wanted to show her his new plans for her room. Rex said she could graduate high school, go to the state school nearby, and work at the _Welch Daily News_. They could all live in the Glass Castle together.****

**Jeannette told Rex that he was never going to build the Glass Castle.** Even if he eventually did, she would be in New York. She was leaving home in three months, even if she had to walk. If he wanted to build the Glass Castle, that was fine, but she wouldn’t be living in it.

### Goodbye

Rose Mary gave Jeannette an old suitcase for her trip. She only packed clothes and her portfolio of articles from the _Wave_. **Jeannette didn’t want to bring anything from her old life, including her favorite geode she’d had since Battle Mountain.** She gave it to Maureen.

Jeannette’s bus was leaving at seven in the morning. Neither she nor Brian could sleep the night before. Brian stated an hourly countdown until her departure in the darkness of night, and the two laughed until there were only two hours left.

Rose Mary wasn’t going to the station with Jeannette. She said she didn’t like to get up early. Rex hadn’t come home at all. But when Jeannette climbed out the window with her suitcase, she saw him waiting outside. At the bus station, Rex gave her his favorite knife for protection. Jeannette gave him a hug, the softness of his cheek telling her he’d shaved for the occasion.

As the bus pulled away, Jeannette didn’t want to look back, but she felt the pull of her father. She waved and he waved back. She wondered if watching her leave reminded him of when he’d left home at seventeen. **She wondered if he was hoping she would fail and have to come home or if he was hoping that, unlike him, she’d leave Welch for good.**
