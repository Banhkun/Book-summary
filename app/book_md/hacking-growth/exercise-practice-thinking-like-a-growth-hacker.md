## Exercise: Practice Thinking Like a Growth Hacker

Practice generating growth hacks using a hypothetical scenario, and then think through how to set up your own growth team.

* * *

Imagine you’re a startup founder building a service that aggregates car insurance offerings to find the best deals. Looking at your data, you notice that many potential customers bounce from your sales landing page. What additional information would you need to understand why this is happening? (Think back to the two types of data.)

Say you run a customer survey to get the information you need, and you discover that customers are confused about what your product does. Thinking back to the section on language and market fit, what kinds of tests could you run to improve the customer’s experience?

Now, think about your own place of work. Remembering the authors’ advice about interdisciplinary collaboration, think of specific team members you might want on your new growth team. Who would you include and why?

When setting up a new growth team, the authors recommend holding an initial meeting to brief your team on the process. Practice explaining the basic idea of growth hacking in your own words so that you can share it with your team.
