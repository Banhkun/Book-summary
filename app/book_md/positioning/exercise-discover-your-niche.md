## Exercise: Discover Your Niche

According to Ries and Trout, to position yourself as the leader of a market, you typically have to be the first to take that position, and so the key is to find or create an open niche that you can lead.

* * *

For this exercise, think of something you want to position as a leader, whether itâ€™s a product or service your company sells or yourself as a professional.

Briefly describe the product, service, person, or company that you want to position.

One factor that can open up a new niche is price point, or the balance of price and quality. Where does your product lie on the price spectrum, and how does its quality compare to alternatives?

Another factor that can afford you a unique niche is the setting or context of your product. For example, is it particularly suitable for a certain time of day, season of the year, a certain gender, age group, ethnicity, or subculture? What elements of your product might make it the superior choice in a certain context?

Think about how the customer obtains your product or service in the first place. What is the hardest part of getting it? What could you do to make the purchasing experience stand out in a positive light?
