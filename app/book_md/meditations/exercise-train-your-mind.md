## Exercise: Train Your Mind

All of the goals of Stoicism begin with developing a strong, logical mind. To that end, try out one of Aurelius’s recommended exercises for training the mind to be logical.

* * *

Begin by choosing one thing you can see (this could be an object or a living thing.) Describe what you’ve chosen to observe.

Where did that thing come from? In other words, what is it made of and how was it created?

What might this thing become in the future? After it decays, what will its parts go on to be?
