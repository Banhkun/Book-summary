## Book 1: Dedications

Many scholars consider _Meditations_ ,__ written by the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, to be one of the definitive Stoic texts. Stoicism is a philosophy that originated in ancient Greece—its central idea is that**rational thinking can guide you through any hardship and allow you to endure any pain.**

_Meditations_ covers a wide range of topics, but there are a few key points that it continually returns to and builds upon:

  * Understanding that _logos_ —reason—controls everything that happens in the world and ensures that whatever happens is for the best 
  * Being strict with yourself: Constantly focusing on your business and working to cultivate healthy and logical thoughts 
  * Being patient with others—their thoughts and actions aren’t your responsibility, nor your problem. Therefore, there’s no reason to become angry or upset with other people.
  * Related to the last two points: your insignificance as an individual, and the importance of the larger community
  * Facing hardship, pain, and death with rationality and grace



**The first book of _Meditations_ is devoted to important lessons that Aurelius learned from people in his life.** These lessons are the foundation for the ideas he shares in the rest of the book.

(Shortform note: _Meditations_ refers to its sections as books, rather than chapters.)

### Giving Thanks

**Aurelius begins his dedications by thanking his family for teaching him self-control, honesty, strength, and piety.** Those principles are what will go on to guide the rest of this work.

Aurelius thanks his great-grandfather for encouraging him to hire private tutors instead of attending public schools, and for telling him to consider the costs as a good investment. Also on the topic of education, he thanks his first teacher for teaching him to do his work and mind his own business. He also thanks the teacher for training him to endure discomfort and not to be demanding.

Aurelius credits many of his other tutors as well. He thanks Diognetus for teaching him not to be fooled by charlatans or taken in by fads, as well as for encouraging him to practice philosophy and study hard. He recognizes Apollonius for teaching him independence and stoicism, and Sextus for teaching him kindness and humility. He thanks Fronto for teaching him to recognize that power corrupts the people who hold it. He thanks Alexander, a literary critic, for teaching him to always debate ideas instead of pouncing on people’s phrasing or grammatical errors, and he thanks a different Alexander for encouraging him to be honest and to face his responsibilities.

**Aurelius has lengthier praise for his teacher Rusticus.** He credits Rusticus with training him to remain focused on important matters and not to be distracted by rhetoric or abstract questions. Furthermore, Rusticus taught him to write simple and straightforward letters and to avoid sermons, poetry, and speechifying. Finally, he thanks this teacher for encouraging him to read things thoroughly, rather than being satisfied with a quick skim to get the general ideas.

#### Giving Thanks to Friends and Family

Aurelius next thanks his friend Catulus for teaching him to always take his friends’ anger seriously, even when he (Aurelius) doesn’t think the anger is justified. He thanks another friend, Maximus, for the example he set: Maximus always displayed self-control, optimism, confidence, a sense of humor, and a positive attitude, even during difficult times.

Aurelius thanks his brother Severus for teaching him to love his family and the ideals of truth and justice. He credits Severus for giving him the idea of a society governed by just laws, ruled by people who respect their subjects’ freedom above anything else.

He thanks his adopted father for teaching him to treat everyone fairly. His adopted father taught Aurelius to ignore titles and honors and to listen sincerely to anyone who had a contribution to make. The man was always at ease, and he put those around him at ease. He knew when to push someone on a subject, and when to back off.

**Aurelius also thanks his adoptive father for being a good role model.** He was a faithful friend and a steadfast ruler, neither obsequious nor arrogant. He was only concerned with doing what needed to be done and not with the praise he’d get for doing it—therefore, his public works spending was always reasonable. Finally, he was always sober and in control of himself. The man never overindulged, but he was still able to enjoy the pleasures of life.

#### Giving Thanks to the Gods

**Aurelius’s last dedication is to the gods.** He thanks the gods for giving him such an excellent family and such good role models. He thanks them for the good fortune he’s enjoyed throughout his life (and continues to enjoy) and for not making hard times worse than they were. He also thanks them—in a somewhat tongue-in-cheek manner—for not giving him any great talent at poetry or debate; if he’d been better at these frivolous pastimes, he might have wasted more of his life pursuing them.
