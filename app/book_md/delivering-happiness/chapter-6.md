## Chapter 6: Hsieh’s Theories of Happiness

Now that we’ve covered the main principles that led to Zappos’s success, as well as the life lessons Hsieh used to develop those principles, we’ll cover Hsieh’s final thoughts on happiness. As discussed throughout this guide, Hsieh believes that **if you focus on happiness as your guiding principle, you’ll succeed in the business world.** Happier employees work harder and happier customers become repeat shoppers. For this reason, the same theories that describe how to increase happiness in individuals can help companies succeed by showing them how to make their employees and customers happy.

In this chapter, we’ll examine three theories of happiness and how they relate to business.

### Theory #1: Four Elements of Happiness

The first theory Hsieh covers posits that **happiness revolves around four elements: control, progress, relationships, and purpose.** If you optimize each of these elements, you’ll be happy. Let’s take a look at each element:

**1\. Control.** According to Hsieh, people who feel in control of their lives are happier. At work, this translates to being able to make decisions about your tasks or schedule. Even making minor decisions about your work life gives you a sense of control and makes you happier.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that being in control, whether in business or in life more generally, does more than just make you happy. People who feel like they’re in control achieve more and have better mental and physical health than people who feel a lack of control over their lives.)

**2\. Growth.** Continual personal and professional growth is important for happiness, Hsieh says. Thus, develop goals that you can complete on a regular basis. These goals should be short term and frequently achievable, rather than long-term goals that you achieve less frequently, because having a _constant stream_ of completed goals makes you happier than less regular achievement.

**3\. Relationships.** Hsieh explains that happiness comes from connecting with others. The more connections with others you foster in a particular environment, the more engaged you’ll be in that environment. For example, if you’re friends with your coworkers, you’ll be more engaged and thus happier at work.

**4\. Purpose.** Having a higher purpose or calling makes you happier as well, Hsieh says. In business, this translates to having long-term goals. These goals work together with the constant stream of smaller goals discussed above to provide a sense of growth and meaning to your daily actions.

(Shortform note: Why does having a purpose make you happier? Experts say it's because your brain is wired to find the larger meaning in your actions and situation. Determining your higher purpose fulfills this need, which makes you happier. The need to find a purpose in your actions could be another evolutionary trait: Without the higher purpose of staying alive and passing their genes to the next generation, early humans wouldn’t have had a reason to complete tasks that weren’t immediately rewarding, like collecting wood or storing food for winter. Thus, your survival-oriented brain developed to seek these higher purposes and encourage you to complete these tasks.)

> **Continual Progress: Job Satisfaction and Relationships**
> 
> Hsieh says achieving small goals frequently makes you happier than achieving larger goals further apart, but he doesn’t explain why. According to _The Happiness Hypothesis _by Jonathan Haidt, it’s down to how people process emotions. When you experience a large jump in progress, such as getting a promotion, your happiness levels spike. However, your happiness level soon returns to normal as you grow accustomed to your new position.
> 
> On the other hand, completing small goals regularly creates longer-lasting happiness. When your happiness levels are about to start returning to normal after your post-achievement spike, the next goal comes along, keeping your happiness levels elevated for longer.
> 
> This theory also explains why positive relationships make you happier. Positive relationships are constant streams of pleasant interactions between you and another person. As such, these relationships heighten your happiness levels for the long term, as long as you’re having pleasant interactions.
> 
> This process applies to all relationships but can be especially helpful in the workplace. When you have strong work relationships, your brain connects the act of working with your positive relationships and the constant happiness that these relationships give you. As such, you come to associate _work itself_ with happiness, which makes you more eager to work so you can continue to be happy.

### Theory #2: Three Levels of Happiness

The second theory of happiness, Hsieh explains, is based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Maslow’s hierarchy sorts people’s needs and desires according to urgency. Survival needs such as food and shelter are the most urgent because you need to fulfill them to stay alive. Once you meet these basic requirements for life, Maslow says your desires and needs grow more abstract, such as the need for recognition.

(Shortform note: Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has five layers: physiological needs (such as food), safety needs (such as financial security), social needs (such as friendship), esteem needs (such as being treated with respect), and self-actualization needs, or the ability to fulfill your talents and potential. The first four layers are deficiency needs, where your needs occur because you lack something (such as food). The final layer, however, is a growth need: The need for self-actualization occurs because you want to _grow_ as a person, rather than because you’re lacking something. This final layer is also the most abstract: Self-actualization means different things to different people since everyone has different talents and potential to fulfill.)

Hsieh’s second theory of happiness adjusts Maslow’s hierarchy for businesses. **It posits three levels of happiness that apply both to customers and employees** : The company first meets its customers’ and employees’ expectations, then their desires, and finally their unrecognized needs. Your goal as a company is to meet each level of happiness because the more levels you meet, the happier your employees and customers will be.

Let’s take a closer look at these three levels:

**1\. Fulfilling expectations.** This is the standard of service that your company _must_ meet to retain customers, Hsieh says. For example, customers expect you to ship them the correct item, and employees expect to be paid for their work. If you don’t meet these expectations, customers and employees will take their business and experience to your competitors, losing your company profit.

**2\. Fulfilling desires.** Meeting desires (things your customers and employees _want_ but don’t necessarily _need_) isn’t essential to your company’s survival, but it improves customer and employee relationships and inspires loyalty. However, this second level of the hierarchy does _not_ overpower the first, Hsieh emphasizes. The customer or employee’s happiness is still contingent on you fulfilling their basic expectations, no matter how many of their desires you fulfill.

For example, employees want to be recognized for their work. Your company can meet this desire by hiring encouraging managers who recognize their employees for their hard work. However, you must still meet your employees’ expectations: Encouraging managers can’t retain employees who aren’t being paid.

(Shortform note: Sometimes, customers don’t know their desires, which makes it difficult to fulfill them. For example, when asked what they want, customers may give one answer in a survey while their spending habits indicate another. You must consider both customer feedback and spending habits to effectively meet customers’ desires. For example, if you run a restaurant, 70% of your customers may respond to a survey saying they want more healthy options on your menu. However, their purchasing habits show otherwise: Only 10% of people order those healthier options. If you only listened to the survey, rather than considering purchasing habits too, you’d lose money providing healthier food that your customers don’t really want.)

**3\. Fulfilling unrecognized needs.** Once you’ve met the above requirements, you can focus on going above and beyond for your customers and employees to give them a final boost of happiness. You can do this by giving them things they didn’t even realize they needed.

For example, customers _need_ the item they ordered, which is why they ordered it. While they’d be happy to receive the item within the designated time, they’d be _happier_ if it arrived faster. Thus, their unrecognized need is to receive the correct item _quickly._ Your company can meet this need by upgrading people to faster shipping.

> **Meeting and Exceeding Customer Expectations**
> 
> Hsieh implies that customer and employee expectations are static (for instance, being paid or receiving the correct item), but in _Raving Fans_ , Ken Blanchard and Sheldon Bowles disagree, arguing that these expectations constantly evolve. This makes fulfilling these expectations more difficult, as you must adapt along with your customers and employees.
> 
> Keep abreast of your customers’ or employees’ evolving expectations by regularly requesting their feedback. (We discussed some methods of encouraging feedback in Chapter 1.) Examine their feedback to identify and solve any problems your customers or employees experience that might undermine their current expectations. Once you solve the problems, monitor the situation to ensure they don’t reoccur.
> 
> For example, if customers regularly give feedback that suggests they receive broken items, that violates their expectation of receiving a high-quality product. You can isolate the problem by checking your production and shipping processes. You may realize that customers are receiving broken items because your warehouse doesn’t have enough employees. The employees you _do_ have are overworked and rushing to meet orders, so they aren’t as careful with packages as they should be. To solve this problem, hire more employees for your warehouse so they can refocus on being careful with packages. Monitor the warehouse to ensure your employees aren’t overwhelmed again.
> 
> Once you’ve fulfilled these expectations and your customer’s desires, Hsieh says you must focus on fulfilling your customers’ and employees’ unrecognized needs. Blanchard and Bowles suggest doing so by seeing your customers and employees as people, rather than as data to be analyzed. This lets you develop real, empathetic relationships with the customers or employees. The better you know someone, the easier it is to determine what would make them happy, thus helping you to recognize and fulfill their unrecognized needs.

### Theory #3: Three Kinds of Happiness

The third theory of happiness Hsieh discusses posits that there are three kinds of happiness: pleasure, passion, and purpose.

**1\. Pleasure.** Pleasure is the most fleeting kind of happiness, according to Hsieh. You feel pleasure when experiencing a positive stimulus, and you stop feeling it when that stimulus stops. Thus, to maintain pleasure-based happiness, you must constantly seek positive stimulation.

**2\. Passion.** Passion lasts longer than pleasure and results from the unity of focus and ability, Hsieh says. Focus is important as it allows you to really dive into a project, to the point that time seems to pass more quickly. Competence is also necessary because you can only enter this state of focus if you have the ability to complete the project: otherwise, you’ll lose focus every time you need help to complete a task. Many people look for passion at work: Being in a focused state and doing work tailored to your abilities makes work more enjoyable because time passes quickly and you feel capable and in control.

**3\. Purpose.** Purpose is the longest-lasting kind of happiness. When you have a purpose, you’re involved in something larger than yourself. You care about that larger cause and working to complete it brings you happiness. For example, Hsieh says his purpose is making people happy through his company.

> **Pleasure, Passion, and Purpose: The Seligman Theory**
> 
> Hsieh’s third theory of happiness closely mirrors a theory that’s popular in the positive psychology field and focuses on understanding and maximizing happiness. For clarity, we’ll refer to this theory as the Seligman theory, named after the psychologist who studied it.
> 
> The Seligman theory revolves around three kinds of lives, each of which corresponds to one of Hsieh’s kinds of happiness:
> 
> **1\. A pleasant life.** A pleasant life is akin to Hsieh’s understanding of pleasure. It revolves around enjoyable day-to-day activities—a constant stream of positive stimuli, as Hsieh puts it. While these isolated pleasant experiences improve your daily satisfaction, they don’t improve your overall _life_ satisfaction. Your happiness is limited by needing constant stimulus. For example, a beautiful sunny day is pleasant, but the happiness it brings only lasts until the clouds return.
> 
> **2\. A good life.** A good life is similar to Hsieh’s definition of passion, where your focus and ability unite to make completing tasks more enjoyable. The Seligman theory posits that this type of happiness involves more self-direction: Rather than simply enjoying pleasant experiences that occur in your life, you use your skills and interests to actively _cause_ pleasant experiences. For example, your skill in pottery may direct you toward joining a pottery club. This gives you an activity you’re good at to focus on, providing you with longer-lasting happiness.
> 
> **3\. A meaningful life.** A meaningful life matches Hsieh’s explanation of purpose. The Seligman theory posits that this is the next step in using your skills to direct your life: Rather than merely letting your skills direct you toward pleasant experiences—like the pottery class—you use your skills to _contribute to the greater good_. For example, you might teach a pottery class to impoverished children, or sell your pottery and donate the proceeds to charity.
> 
> While Hsieh implies that each kind of happiness is isolated, the Seligman theory suggests that true happiness lives in the _conjunction_ of these three kinds of lives. Thus, to achieve true happiness, you should pursue all three.
