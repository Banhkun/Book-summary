## Shortform Introduction

**Happiness is good for business,** Tony Hsieh, the former CEO of online clothing retailer Zappos, explains in _Delivering Happiness._ Happy employees work harder and more efficiently, and happy customers spend more money.

So how can you make your customers and employees happier? _Delivering Happiness_ describes three important steps: Encourage a healthy business culture, provide great customer service, and invest in continuing education. Hsieh explores the theory behind each step before describing how he implemented them at Zappos. Hsieh also shares details from his own life, including additional lessons in business management that he learned through trial and error and later applied to Zappos.

### About the Author

Tony Hsieh was an American entrepreneur and former Zappos CEO. Born in Urbana, Illinois in 1973, Hsieh expressed an interest in pursuing entrepreneurship at just nine years old, experimenting with small business ideas such as worm farming, selling buttons, and writing a newsletter. He attended Harvard University and graduated with a degree in computer science in 1995.

Shortly after graduating college, Hsieh founded LinkExchange, an internet-based advertisement company. LinkExchange was very successful, and Hsieh sold the company to Microsoft in 1998 for $265 million. One year later, Hsieh became involved with shoe and clothing retailer Zappos, initially as an investor and then as CEO. Hsieh turned Zappos into a billion-dollar company in a decade, which launched him to business-world fame. From paying employees to quit to embracing “weirdness,” Hsieh gained a reputation for pursuing unconventional ideas and focusing on making his customers and employees happy.

In the 2010s, Hsieh pursued new, non-business ventures. First, in 2010, he wrote _Delivering Happiness._ The book was his first foray into writing and was an instant success, spending 27 consecutive weeks on the NYT Best-seller List. Later in the decade, Hsieh spearheaded a community revitalization project in downtown Las Vegas, focusing on encouraging community connectedness, small businesses, education, and culture.

In 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic shut down the United States, Hsieh struggled with loneliness and drug abuse. These personal issues may have led to his retirement from Zappos that same year. Shortly after his retirement, Hsieh died of smoke inhalation from a house fire.

### The Book’s Publication and Context

_Delivering Happiness_ was published in 2010 by Grand Central Publishing, an imprint of Hachette Book Group, Inc. An e-book version was released in 2013. This guide refers to the 2013 e-book edition.

#### Historical Context

Tony Hsieh published _Delivering Happiness_ shortly after selling Zappos to Amazon in 2009 for $1.2 billion. The deal made headlines as Amazon’s most expensive acquisition to date and was only surpassed in 2013 when Amazon acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. The record-high deal created interest in how Hsieh had turned a tiny, unprofitable internet company that barely survived the dot-com crash of 2000 into a billion-dollar business. _Delivering Happiness_ ’s timing __ capitalized on this interest.

#### Intellectual Context

Many of the basic ideas presented in _Delivering Happiness_ —such as the importance of having a healthy company culture—aren’t unique. In the book, Hsieh references some contemporaries he drew ideas from, such as business expert Jim Collins (_Good to Great_) and psychologist Jonathan Haidt (_The Happiness Hypothesis_).

However, _Delivering Happiness_ stands apart from other business books because it details how Hsieh put these general ideas into practice. The book __ gives a glimpse into Hsieh’s mind as he explains the basis of his success and how other entrepreneurs can apply his ideas at their companies. For example, he explains how to encourage innovation in your employees by relating how Zappos supported its employees’ unconventional idea of instituting “speed interviewing” to make the hiring process easier.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Praiseful readers of _Delivering Happiness_ enjoy Hsieh’s casual and easy-to-read writing style. They believe Hsieh offers a comprehensive overview of how Zappos operated under his leadership and provides good advice on applying Zappos’s principles to other companies.

However, some readers dislike the autobiographical elements of the book. They believe Hsieh focuses too much on his life before Zappos, rather than on how Zappos succeeded. In addition, some readers argue that the book feels more like an advertisement for Zappos than a book of advice.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Hsieh writes casually and passionately, an unconventional choice for a business book. Throughout the book, he not only states facts but also descriptively and emotively relates his perspective on these facts. For example, when Hsieh discusses Zappos’s acquisition by Amazon, he explains both the facts, such as Amazon’s record $1.2 billion payment, and the emotions of the moment, such as the hope he felt for the future.

In another unconventional choice, Hsieh scatters real emails, anecdotes, and employee testimonies from Zappos throughout the book. This allows the reader a close look into the real workings of the company.

Hsieh wrote _Delivering Happiness_ as an autobiography of both himself and Zappos, stretching from his childhood to Zappos being acquired by Amazon in 2009. As a result, the book relies heavily on personal anecdotes to explain Hsieh’s ideas about how to effectively run a business, rather than on research. This arguably reflects Hsieh's goals in writing the book: He wasn't trying to produce a research-backed work about general business practices, he aimed to write about how _Zappos specifically_ succeeded.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_Delivering Happiness_ has three parts, each part covering a period of Hsieh’s life:

  1. Hsieh’s childhood and early adulthood, up to joining Zappos
  2. The growth of Zappos from a struggling shoe store to a $1.2 billion apparel company
  3. Zappos’s acquisition by Amazon and some of Hsieh’s observations about personal growth and happiness



The book is organized chronologically. This is helpful at times, as it demonstrates how Zappos’s success grew over time as the company implemented more of Hsieh's ideas. However, this organization also leads to a lot of repetition: Since Hsieh applied the same principles multiple times during his years as Zappos’s CEO, he mentions them repeatedly throughout the book.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ve divided _Delivering Happiness_ into just two parts. Part 1 focuses on the principles that made Zappos successful and how Hsieh applied them. We’ve split each of Hsieh’s main principles—culture, customer service, and continuing education—into distinct chapters, combining and reorganizing ideas to decrease repetition and increase logical flow. We’ve allotted two chapters to our discussion of culture, as it’s the principle Hsieh discusses at greatest length.

Part 2 explores several life lessons Hsieh learned through trial and error that influenced his management of Zappos. We’ve arranged these lessons by theme and provided examples of how Hsieh learned and implemented these lessons at the company. Part 2 closes with three of Hsieh’s theories about happiness.

Throughout the guide, we explore research that backs up Hsieh’s principles, compare and contrast his ideas with other experts on business, and provide concrete steps for implementing Hsieh’s ideas at your company.
