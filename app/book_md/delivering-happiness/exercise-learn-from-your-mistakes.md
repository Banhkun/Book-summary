## Exercise: Learn From Your Mistakes

Hsieh learned business management through trial and error. Instead of giving up, he learned from his mistakes and gradually improved his business sense. This determination let him develop his unique style of leadership that turned Zappos into a billion-dollar company.

Describe a mistake you made in the past, whether in managing a business or in your personal life. Be specific: What happened? How did the mistake affect you and your company? (For example, you may have lost an important opportunity because you rushed into a decision.)

Now, consider your mistake as objectively as possible. What can you learn from that situation? How might you improve in the future to avoid making the same mistake again? (Continuing our example, if you made a mistake by rushing, you can learn to be more patient and cautious when making decisions.)

Finally, make a plan for putting what you’ve learned into action so you don’t repeat your past mistake. (For example, you might leave yourself reminders to be cautious or use a risk-benefit analysis template when making decisions.)
