## Exercise: Use a Happiness Theory to Improve Your Company and Happiness

Hsieh believes encouraging happiness at your company leads to success. The three theories of happiness he presents look at happiness in different ways, but all of them have applications for both individuals and business owners. In this exercise, use the theories of happiness to help your company succeed and increase your personal happiness.

* * *

Which of Hsieh’s three theories of happiness is your favorite? Why?

Discuss how you can apply that theory of happiness to your workplace and create happy employees and/or customers. Be specific with actionable plans. (For example, you can use the second theory to create a checklist of “levels of customer happiness” and review the checklist during customer interactions to ensure you’re fulfilling all three levels and maximizing their satisfaction.)

Finally, consider how you can apply that theory of happiness to your personal life to maximize _your_ happiness. (For example, you could use the first theory to evaluate what areas of your life lack control, growth, relationships, or purpose. Then, you could put effort into those areas to increase your happiness.)
