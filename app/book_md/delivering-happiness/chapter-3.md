## Chapter 3: Provide Great Customer Service

Now that we've covered culture, we'll move on to the second vital component of a successful business: providing great customer service. According to Hsieh, **great customer service is being so supportive and adaptable in every customer interaction that you have a positive emotional impact on the customer.** This positive emotional impact is the first step toward forming a healthy and profitable long-term relationship with that customer.

(Shortform note: Hsieh sees a positive emotional impact as the root of good customer service, but how do you generate this positive response? It doesn’t necessarily mean going beyond your customer’s expectations with free perks and bonuses: Studies show that most customers are happier with simple, quick solutions to their problems. Prioritize problem-solving before worrying about dazzling your customers.)

In this chapter, we’ll explore the ways good customer service can make your business successful. We’ll also look at how Zappos used good customer service to become a billion-dollar company.

### Why Is Great Customer Service Important?

Hsieh says **providing** **good customer service is important because it increases the “lifetime value” of customers.** This is the total revenue that a customer brings to the company throughout their life. If a customer only uses your service once, then their lifetime value is low. However, if you create an emotional connection through your customer service, your customers are more likely to return to your business and increase their lifetime value.

(Shortform note: Hsieh notes that increasing the lifetime value of customers is important, but he doesn’t explain _how_ important. Studies show that if companies increased the lifetime value of 5% of their customers, they’d increase profits by 100%. This profit increase occurs because you can charge long-term customers more money. By forming relationships with customers, you encourage them to trust you. If customers trust you, they’ll prefer your services over those of a competitor, even if you charge more.)

Moreover, encouraging a customer to return through great service can also improve _another customer’s_ lifetime value, Hsieh adds. **People who experience great service talk about their experience with others, generating word-of-mouth interest in your company.** This interest channels more customers to your company, each of whom has their own lifetime value that you can increase.

(Shortform note: Research supports Hsieh’s explanation that word-of-mouth interest increases customers’ lifetime value. Studies show that customers referred to a company by word-of-mouth are 16 to 24% more loyal than customers who found the company through other means. These referrals are effective because they come from a trusted source, usually family members or friends. Companies can’t generate word-of-mouth directly: The more pressure a company exerts on its customers to generate word-of-mouth, the less likely customers are to provide or believe it, since it’ll feel false or manufactured. Instead, companies must rely on providing great service that inspires customers to recommend the company _without_ external pressure.)

### How to Encourage Great Customer Service

If great customer service is so important to increasing the lifetime value of customers, how can you encourage it in your company? There are two main paths to great customer service that Hsieh discusses: making it a company-wide initiative and maintaining communication with customers.

#### Make Great Customer Service a Company-Wide Initiative

**Hsieh believes that an important step in encouraging great customer service is making it a company-wide initiative:** in other words, making sure that _every department knows_ that offering great customer service is part of your company’s brand. Let’s explore in detail how Hsieh implemented this principle at Zappos and why he believes it’s so important.

Zappos makes customer service a company-wide initiative in two ways. First, **_every_ Zappos employee goes through four weeks of customer service training and two weeks working in its customer service call center,** Hsieh explains. This includes everyone from lawyers to software developers. Most companies would view this as a waste of time and resources—why spend six weeks training and paying employees for a job they’re not being hired for?—but Zappos sees it as essential to the company’s success. If all employees are trained in customer service, they can all embody the principles of good customer service—such as attentiveness and politeness—in their interactions with customers, business partners, and the press.

(Shortform note: Hsieh says training _all_ employees in customer service is important. However, others go further, arguing that training internal departments that don’t usually interact with outsiders is most beneficial. Backend departments often complicate the customer service department’s job. However, if every employee is trained to prioritize customer service, they’ll focus on helping the customer service department succeed. For example, an IT department that hasn’t trained in customer service may delay upgrading customer service’s hardware because they value the marketing department more. After customer service training, the IT department would prioritize upgrading customer service’s hardware so they can contact customers faster.)

Second, **Zappos accepts extra costs across all departments to make its customers happier,** Hsieh says. For example, Zappos surprises many of its customers by upgrading them to free 1-day shipping. This, combined with its 24-hour warehouse that ships any time of night, means that customers receive their packages as soon as possible. Even though paying for faster shipping and maintaining a warehouse 24/7 is expensive for the company, it considers its customers’ happiness as more important than the cost.

(Shortform note: Experts agree that taking on extra costs as Hsieh recommends is one of the best ways to inspire word-of-mouth interest. Specifically, offering surprise bonuses is even more effective than minimizing standard customer costs like shipping because surprise turns happiness into _delight._ This delight leads to higher sustained profits, quickly recouping any losses the surprise bonuses incurred. A particularly powerful way to surprise customers is to offer something for _free_ , rather than merely giving a discount. Whereas discounts can have the negative side effect of devaluing a product in the eyes of customers, offering something for free inspires nothing but sheer delight.)

#### Maintain Communication With Customers

Another vital element of customer service is **maintaining communication with the customer.** Positive communication improves relationships, and the closer the relationships you form with customers, the more likely they’ll be to return and increase their lifetime value. Communication is especially important for online stores, Hsieh emphasizes. When there's no in-person contact between a customer and employee, prompt and helpful communication, over the phone or virtual, is the only way to form a positive relationship.

Thus, **customers should never have to search for your company’s contact information,** Hsieh states. If it’s difficult to contact your company, you’re telling customers that you don’t want to communicate with them or form relationships.

> **Redefining Communication in the Digital Age**
> 
> Experts agree with Hsieh that communication is vital for all businesses, especially online companies. As they’ve become more common in the digital age, these online companies have developed new methods of maintaining communication with their customers, going beyond simply making their company’s contact information easily accessible.
> 
> One of these innovations is live-chatting, where a text-based chatting feature is built into the company’s website. This service connects customers directly to a customer service representative. Live-chats have the versatility of a call center with the added benefit of avoiding excessive hold times. In addition, customers don’t have to search for the company’s contact information, as Hsieh warns against: Connecting is as easy as clicking a button. This method of communication is becoming more ubiquitous and may one day overtake call centers.

##### How Zappos Maintains Communication With Customers

**Zappos believes that the telephone is its greatest asset for providing great customer service.** Most large- and medium-sized companies have call centers, Hsieh explains. However, Zappos sets itself apart from its competitors through its innovative, customer-oriented call center policies.

(Shortform note: Call centers may seem old-fashioned in the modern world, where the internet is ubiquitous and using it is often faster than calling someone. However, research supports Hsieh’s commitment to making his call centers as effective as possible. Studies show that 80% of customer interactions happen over the phone. In addition, 92% of customers base their opinion of a company on their experiences with that company’s call center. Thus, optimizing your call center can be vital to creating long-term customers.)

Hsieh says Zappos has three unusual call center policies that encourage the kind of communication necessary for great customer service:

**1\. Zappos doesn’t time calls.** Most call centers measure employee success through the number of calls they take in a period of time, Hsieh explains. This is an easy way to measure success, but this method also incentivizes employees to rush calls, which degrades the quality of customer service. By refraining from penalizing employees for long conversations, Zappos lets them focus on providing great customer service.

(Shortform note: Research supports Zappos’s abandonment of timed calls. Studies show that customers care less about call speed than they do about having their problems solved with a single call. Thus, call centers should judge employee success on whether they can handle customer needs without having to transfer the customer, rather than on how quickly they make calls.)

**2\. Zappos doesn’t use scripts.** You must be genuine to form a relationship, Hsieh says. Thus, Zappos doesn't give employees scripts. This allows employees to use their own judgment and display their personality when handling customer requests. A lack of scripts requires more intensive training, as new employees must learn to handle any situation on the spot. However, genuine relationships are more likely to inspire return customers, improving company profit.

(Shortform note: As Hsieh says, a lack of scripts helps employees form genuine connections with customers. This is effective because employees that don’t rely on scripts have the freedom to learn about their customers and integrate that knowledge into their service. For example, a customer may mention that they enjoy hiking. The employee can use this information to connect with the customer and direct them to Zappos’s hiking boots. Even if the customer doesn’t buy the boots, they'll be impressed that the employee paid attention to their interests. This customer is then more likely to buy from the company again, offsetting the cost of more intensive training.)

**3\. Zappos doesn’t upsell.** Many companies use their call centers to promote upgrades or additional products to customers, Hsieh explains. The goal of upselling is to maximize the amount customers spend. However, upselling prioritizes revenue over the customer experience, which can drive customers away. Instead of trying to sell a customer more products during their call, Zappos indirectly encourages customers to make further purchases by providing great service.

(Shortform note: Zappos’s _call center_ doesn’t upsell, but its website does by tracking items you’ve previously viewed or purchased and recommending items you might like based on that data. This isn’t hypocritical: Customers’ needs change depending on the situation. When customers call Zappos, they’re rarely interested in hearing about Zappos’s other products: They just want to solve their problem quickly. However, when shopping online, upselling can help customers find the best products to meet their needs. For example, Zappos’ website might register that you’re shopping for Nike sneakers and display several different style and price options so you can quickly find one you like that fits your budget.)

### Provide Great Service to Vendors

**The principle that great service comes first should also apply to your vendors** , Hsieh says. Depending on the kind of company you run, your vendors can be either people you buy goods from or the people who sell products on your behalf. Zappos’s vendors are the shoe brands that Zappos purchases its inventory from, like Nike.

Regardless of what kind of vendor you’re interacting with, Hsieh emphasizes the importance of giving them great service, as this helps form strong and profitable relationships. However, many companies fail to do this, focusing on short-term profits instead of nurturing long-term relationships. Vendors rely on company purchases to survive, and many companies leverage this advantage to take as much money from (or give as little money to) their vendors as possible, ruining their relationships in the process.

There’s no need to abuse your vendors, Hsieh says. Your company and vendors have the same goal: making money. Instead of fighting each other, work together by sharing information on market trends and innovative ideas. **Focus on your mutual goals and how you can fulfill them.**

This has two benefits: First, the vendors will help you reach your goals, making your job easier. Vendors are valuable resources; they know their products best, and working with them means you can use that knowledge for your benefit. For example, your vendors may be familiar with which marketing techniques are best for their products. If you have a healthy relationship with these vendors, they’ll be more inclined to share this information. In turn, you can use this knowledge to improve your marketing and boost your profits.

Second, treating your vendors with respect and collaborating will make them happier, Hsieh points out. **The happier your vendors are, the more likely they are to help you be profitable.** Good relationships with vendors can lead to perks such as exclusive products and deals for your company.

(Shortform note: In _The Art of Thinking Clearly_ , Rolf Dobelli calls this give-and-take relationship “reciprocity.” If someone does something for you, you’re more likely to do something for them in return. Reciprocity can be used to manipulate people—for instance, if you help someone for the sole purpose of putting them in your debt. However, reciprocity is also a vital component of collaboration and community building. Thus, as long as your intention is to build healthy collaborations with vendors, reciprocity can be a valuable tool for your company.)

> **Keiretsu: Healthy Company-Vendor Relationships**
> 
> Hsieh’s focus on creating healthy company-vendor relationships is uncommon in the United States, but such practices have existed in Japan since the 1940s. This method of forming close, mutually beneficial relationships between companies and vendors is called “keiretsu.” Keiretsu was initially popular because it resulted in lower operating costs and better quality goods, raising profits for the companies that used it.
> 
> Keiretsu declined after the 1980s as Western companies started experimenting with more immediate cost-cutting techniques: They pursued partnerships with whichever vendors could offer the most cost-effective goods instead of remaining loyal to the same vendors for decades. As these competing Western companies became more immediately profitable, Japanese companies turned away from their traditional keiretsu roots to these Western methods of operation. However, while these cost-cutting strategies were profitable, they degraded the relationships between company and vendor, as Hsieh warns.
> 
> Keiretsu saw a resurgence in 2000 with Toyota. Like Zappos, Toyota realized the importance of company-vendor cooperation. As such, the company focused on pursuing mutual goals with its vendors and worked out compromises that made both companies happy. For example, Toyota requires its vendors to provide fully-assembled systems (such as engines) rather than individual parts. In exchange, Toyota helps its vendors lower operating costs through educational seminars and factory inspections. Thus, while Toyota and its vendors both spend time and resources helping each other, both ultimately lower their costs.

##### How Zappos Provides Great Service to Its Vendors

Hsieh’s main advice for supporting vendors follows the Golden Rule: **Treat your vendors as you want to be treated.** People think you must be aggressive to negotiate and run a successful business, but mutual respect is much more effective. This includes being polite and respectful, showing appreciation through dinner or gifts, and building relationships through positive experiences.

(Shortform note: Roger Fisher and William Ury explain in _Getting to Yes_ that when negotiating with someone, it’s easy to forget that you’re talking to a person rather than a company. This may cause you to treat vendors poorly as you focus on outwitting a competing company instead of treating the vendor respectfully. Improve your relationships with vendors by constantly evaluating if you’re accommodating their humanity as well as their professional identity.)

Part of being respectful and building these relationships is communication. You and your vendors are collaborators, Hsieh explains, and to effectively collaborate, you must freely share information. To this end, **Zappos practices radical transparency with its vendors.** The company gives its vendors almost complete access to its systems, letting them observe and offer their opinions on everything from profits to inventory and web design.

This information is usually hoarded by other companies, Hsieh adds. However, **sharing information lets Zappos form stronger relationships with its vendors and become more successful.**

> **Practicing Radical Transparency in Modern Business**
> 
> While Hsieh points out that many companies hoard their knowledge, he doesn’t explain why. One possible explanation is that these companies fear the information will get into the hands of competitors. Information regarding policies and products shows how companies become successful and differentiate themselves from their competition. If the wrong competitors had access to this information—for instance, because a shared vendor let it slip—they could replicate a company's unique success.
> 
> However, overcoming this fear and sharing information with vendors may benefit companies for the reasons Hsieh notes above. To that end, here are two tips for instituting transparency between your company and your vendors:
> 
> **1) Be constructive.** As discussed, sharing information can be daunting for many companies, not least because of the administrative burden involved in regularly sending information back and forth. Furthermore, vendors may worry that if they share displeasing information—for instance, information about product delays—they’ll suffer criticism and pushback. If your vendor is resistant to information sharing, emphasize that working together will ultimately be mutually beneficial: Sharing even negative information freely will make it easier to solve problems quickly.
> 
> **2) Apply the information.** When your vendors share information or advice with you, it can be tempting to dismiss it. Since they’re not a part of your company, you may assume your vendors don’t know what they’re talking about, especially if their advice contradicts your own opinions. However, their outsider perspectives means they can notice mistakes and possible advantages you may miss. Carefully consider your vendors’ suggestions and be open to integrating them into your strategy.
