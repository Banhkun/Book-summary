## Part 1: Zappos’s Principles of Success | Chapter 1: Foster a Healthy Culture

According to Tony Hsieh, the former CEO of online clothing retailer Zappos, happiness is good for business. Happy employees work harder and more efficiently, and happy customers spend more money.

So how can you make your customers and employees happier to maximize profits? In _Delivering Happiness,_ Hsieh says the answer lies in implementing three principles: Encourage a healthy business culture, provide great customer service, and invest in continuing education.

In Part 1 of this guide, we’ll cover these three guiding principles that made Zappos a successful company, beginning in this chapter with what company culture is and how to nurture it. In Part 2, we’ll explore the autobiographical elements of _Delivering Happiness_ and how Hsieh’s personal experiences influenced his management of Zappos.

### What Is Company Culture?

According to Hsieh, a healthy company culture is one of the most important elements of a successful business. While he never provides a concrete definition of company culture, we’ve used his discussions on culture to define it as follows: **Culture is the standard behaviors and beliefs that the employees of a company maintain both in business settings and in their personal lives.**

For example, many companies nurture the cultural belief that customer satisfaction is a priority, as well as the belief that employees should behave respectfully toward colleagues and customers. These behaviors become cultural workplace habits, and employees start to apply them in their personal lives too, considering other people’s needs before their own and treating everyone respectfully.

**It’s important to have a culture that reflects your business’s mission** so that your employees will habitually behave appropriately to advance that mission. For example, Google’s mission is to make information universally accessible. Behaviors and beliefs that fit this mission include encouraging curiosity and valuing transparency. Employees with these traits will approach their jobs with open minds and determination to innovate and improve information accessibility, advancing Google’s mission. However, if Google’s culture didn’t reflect its mission, instead prioritizing profit over customer satisfaction or accessibility, employees might suggest and implement policies counter to the mission (such as putting up paywalls).

> **Company Culture’s Disputed Definition**
> 
> It’s not surprising that Hsieh doesn’t provide a concrete definition for culture in _Delivering Happiness_ , despite the importance of culture throughout the book. Culture occupies a nebulous place in the business world: Everyone knows that culture’s important, but no one’s sure how to define it.
> 
> While there’s no consensus on culture’s precise definition, most people agree it has two components: employee behavior and belief. Some argue that employee behavior is the true indicator of culture. As long as employees behave in a way that supports the company's culture and mission, it doesn’t matter what they personally believe about that mission. This perspective also posits that the founders of a company can dictate culture: If employee behavior comprises culture, then changing employee behavior through incentives and penalizations can also change the culture.
> 
> Others focus only on the belief aspect of culture. They argue that as long as employees believe in the company and its mission, they’ll behave in ways that support it. This perspective says belief, and thus culture, stems from the employees of a company and can’t be dictated by the founders. Incentives and penalizations can alter behavior, but the employees’ beliefs will ultimately determine how they act.
> 
> Hsieh’s idea of culture is the most comprehensive, acknowledging both the behavior of employees and their beliefs as important factors in achieving a company’s mission. This is fitting given that people are composed of both their beliefs _and_ behaviors, and the two are interlinked: for instance, certain beliefs encourage certain behaviors. Thus, aiming to influence just one of these factors through company culture is arguably reductive.

#### The Importance of Protecting a Healthy Culture

A company can’t _impose_ culture on its employees, Hsieh says. Instead, a **company’s culture stems organically from employees.** Therefore, Hsieh argues, **you must hire people who improve and uphold the desired culture.** Zappos achieves this through its two-part hiring process: First, Zappos interviews potential employees for their skill and ability to complete their roles. Then, they interview those who passed the first stage to see if they fit Zappos’s culture. Zappos only hires employees who pass both stages, no matter how talented or valuable the potential employee seems.

(Shortform note: An important requirement of Zappos’s two-part hiring process is that candidates must pass _both_ interviews: Zappos won't sacrifice culture for skill or vice versa. Many employers neglect this important balancing act, instead heavily prioritizing a single attribute when hiring: commonly, culture fit. Thus, they hire people who don't fit their company’s skill requirements. Zappos’s two-part hiring method mitigates this problem by forcing the hiring team to thoroughly consider potential employees both personally and professionally.)

Enforcing this two-part hiring policy is important because **employees who don’t uphold the company's culture can change or damage that culture.** Hsieh says most businesses encounter this problem because they hire employees that’ll bring them high profits without considering how these employees will impact the company’s culture. Most of these employees only focus on making money, rather than supporting their coworkers and the company. This influx of money-focused employees degrades the culture from a supportive, enjoyable environment to a miserable one.

(Shortform note: Companies that focus too much on profits rather than developing a healthy culture develop "toxic cultures” that push employees to meet impossible standards of profit and efficiency. To meet these standards, employees take shortcuts and illegal actions, such as lying on balance sheets to make the company seem more profitable than it really is. When these illegal actions are exposed, the company usually blames individual employees instead of the culture. They distance themselves from the issue to save face and refuse to acknowledge the larger, systemic problems: the lack of support and toxic culture that inspired the employees’ actions.)

##### Protect Your Culture From Unhealthy Investors and Board Members

**This policy of considering culture when choosing personnel must also extend to choosing investors and board members** : Hsieh recommends ensuring that all stakeholders will uphold the company’s principles and focus on maintaining a healthy culture. Investors and board members have a lot of sway over a company’s operations because they control the company’s resources. A board comprised of the wrong people can withhold resources, ruining the culture by forcing the company to focus on profits above all else.

(Shortform note: Hsieh suggests finding a board and investors that support your company’s culture. But what if your company already has an established board and investors that _aren’t_ supporting your culture? In _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ , Clayton M. Christensen suggests creating a subsidiary—a company owned and controlled by another company. Subsidiaries have enough distance from investors and board members that they can take risks on less-profitable activities, such as developing culture. If the culture-focused subsidiary succeeds, investors and board members will be more willing to focus on culture throughout the parent company.)

### How to Assess and Nurture a Healthy Culture

How can you assess how healthy your culture currently is? Hsieh suggests asking your employees. **Because _everyone_ involved in a company influences its culture, gaining every perspective on that culture is important.**

(Shortform note: While Hsieh says it’s important to gain every employee’s perspective on culture, he doesn’t say how to ask employees for this feedback. Some HR experts argue that surveys are the most effective method of gaining employee feedback. Use comprehensive yearly surveys and short weekly or monthly surveys to gain perspective on your entire company’s culture. Yearly surveys let you track large-scale problems, and shorter, more frequent surveys let you track smaller issues and catch problems before they escalate.)

This includes gaining negative perspectives, Hsieh adds. **Employee complaints about culture act as an advance warning of more serious problems in the future.** For example, if an employee complains that there’s not enough communication between teams, you should encourage teams to communicate more often. If you don’t solve the problem, it’ll worsen. For instance, imagine your sales team fails to communicate important order details to your production team. Your production team will be unable to quickly create the correct products, and customers will become frustrated with the delays and cancel their orders, costing your company profits.

(Shortform note: When receiving these complaints, look deeper than the surface issue. Sometimes, one issue is actually a symptom of a larger problem. For example, if a manager complains that her employees aren’t meeting their deadlines, you could incentivize the employees to meet said deadlines. However, if the employees are slow because their tasks aren't clearly explained, then incentives won’t help. You must address the bigger problem to fix the symptoms.)

#### Create a List of Cultural Principles

Once you’ve gained an understanding of your culture, you can work to nurture its good qualities. Hsieh recommends **formalizing your culture in a set of principles.** Some common principles include prioritizing customer experience, embracing change, and taking personal responsibility. Making a list concretizes your culture and makes it easier to communicate and enforce the principles that’ll support your company’s mission.

This step should also rely on employee testimony: You’re not establishing a set of principles you think the company _should_ have, you’re discovering those good qualities your employees believe the company _already_ has so you can nurture them.

Hsieh emphasizes the importance of living by your cultural principles once you've formalized them. **For your principles to actually nurture your culture, they must determine which employees you hire and fire** , and you must uphold them in your daily operations. This may seem obvious, but many companies don’t live by their principles.**** Instead, they project a certain cultural image through advertisements but don’t adhere to that culture in reality.

Resist the urge to project this kind of fictional culture, Hsieh warns. Customers will notice this discrepancy between your company’s cultural principles and real practices. They’ll lose trust in your company and take their business to your competitors instead. For example, if your company says customer service is its primary goal, but then provides bad customer service, your customers will stop believing you and go to a more honest company.

> **Principles Are More Complex Than Hsieh Suggests**
> 
> Patrick Lencioni (_The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_) disagrees with Hsieh's assessment that your principles should be solely based on the good qualities your company already has, claiming the matter is more nuanced. He argues that there are four types of principles:
> 
>   * **Core principles:** These are principles selected and enforced by the executives of a company. They form the cultural cornerstones of the company.
> 
>   * **Aspirational principles:** These are currently unattained principles that you want the company to achieve.
> 
>   * **"Permission-to-play" principles:** These are the basic standards of honesty and integrity that every company requires from its employees.
> 
>   * **Accidental principles:** These are principles that stem from employees and spread throughout the company over time. These principles usually form from the shared interests and personality types of coworkers.
> 
> 

> 
> While Lencioni and Hsieh disagree on the definition of principles, they agree that you must enforce them if they’re to have any effect. Lencioni goes further than Hseih, stressing the importance of enforcing even controversial values (for instance, enforcing professionalism in Silicon Valley, which is famous for its laid-back nature). When you enforce less popular principles, your employees know you're serious about those principles and adjust their behavior accordingly. In addition, these controversial principles set you apart from your competitors.
