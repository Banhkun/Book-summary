## Chapter 4: Invest in Continuing Education

The final important element of a successful business is continuing employee education: in other words, constantly providing your employees with training and learning opportunities. This training shouldn’t only apply to the skills the employee was hired for, Hsieh adds. Rather, **employees should learn about a variety of different skills and areas of knowledge so they can more easily innovate and adapt to new situations.**

In this chapter, we’ll explore the importance of continuing education and how Hsieh introduced it at Zappos.

### Why Is Continuing Education Important?

As discussed, Zappos makes it a top priority to keep its employees happy. Hsieh states that **employees are happier and more willing to work when they’re learning and improving themselves** , so helping employees do so is an important part of fulfilling this goal.

(Shortform note: How does learning make you happy? Raph Koster explains in _A Theory of Fun For Game Design _that “fun” is a burst of dopamine you receive when learning something new or mastering a skill. Dopamine generates pleasure and motivation, so learning something new, as Zappos encourages, directly contributes to happiness.)

In addition, **companies are only as good as their employees,** Hsieh explains. Your company can’t grow and improve unless your employees do as well because they’re the ones operating the business. Thus, to keep innovating and maintain your company’s success, support your employees’ innovation and success.

(Shortform note: Hsieh says companies are only as good as their employees and uses this as justification for continual employee education. Others take this idea a step further, saying your company is only as good as your worst employees. Thus, improve the quality of your company by focusing your evaluations and training on your _weakest_ employees specifically. They have more improvements to make, so focusing on them will likely improve your company and profits faster than giving the same amount of training and attention to every employee. In addition, your worst employees are probably also the most unhappy, and focusing on them will increase their morale.)

Finally, **continuing education is important for business succession planning.** Many companies train their employees for a single, specific job, Hsieh says. Then, when those employees must adapt to another role—whether because of a planned promotion or an emergency situation—they aren’t prepared to do so. However, if your company prioritizes continuing education in a variety of skills and areas of knowledge, you’ll create a system where any time a role opens, there’s an employee ready to fill it. Not only does this alleviate employee stress, but it also provides a clear path of career progression for your employees, giving them a constant stream of goals to aim for.

(Shortform note: In _Principles_ , Ray Dalio agrees that succession training is important. He suggests taking three steps to ensure your employees are ready to fill new roles. First, select a replacement for each key person on your staff: Just like you’d have backups for important parts of a machine, make sure someone’s ready to fill the gap if any of your essential personnel are unavailable. Second, give these future successors opportunities to see how their predecessors think and solve problems—usually through shadowing or mentoring. Finally, let future successors handle some of their predecessors’ responsibilities before they take over the position so you can see how prepared they are for the role.)

### How Zappos Encourages Continuing Education

Zappos encourages continuing education through its “educational pipeline” system of training. Hsieh says Zappos’s pipeline operates on a merit badge system: **People who fulfill certain training requirements earn promotions and pay raises.** The first, basic elements of training are mandatory, but after those elements are completed, people can select which merit badges they want to earn and which skills to specialize in.

(Shortform note: This merit badge system works because it offers employees a _choice_ in what to train in, and even minor choices engage intrinsic motivation (as we discussed in Chapter 2). This theory of intrinsic motivation also operates in traditional education: College students who select their own courses turn in better work more consistently because they’re motivated to work harder. By applying these proven theories of educational motivation to its programs of continuing education, Zappos encourages its employees to find fulfillment and happiness in their training.)

The pipeline starts with entry-level workers, Hsieh explains. **Zappos prioritizes finding new talent because it knows its pipeline will give these individuals the experience and training they currently lack.** Most companies without this focus on continuing education can’t trust their training to provide this experience, so they focus on hiring the most experienced individuals they can find.

Everyone starts at an entry-level position on the training pipeline, and Zappos consistently adds new employees to the pipeline. **This results in a long train of hires, each one more trained and experienced than the last.** As discussed, this means Zappos never struggles to fill a role when an employee leaves or is promoted, Hsieh says. Instead, there’s another employee ready to take the next step in their training and take over the missing employee’s role.

While adding employees to the pipeline at the entry-employee level is effective, **Zappos plans to expand its pipeline to reach college students as well.** Hsieh believes that if you start building relationships with freshmen in college, you can offer them internships and determine if they’re a good fit to hire after graduation, thus making the transition to employee easier and the pipeline even more effective.

> **Diversifying Your Hiring Pipeline**
> 
> Zappos’s interest in hiring entry-level employees and college students who may lack experience, rather than hiring candidates with set experience, highlights an important principle in modern hiring practices: hiring people with a diversity of (potentially unconventional) experience _._
> 
> Many businesses hire within a very narrow range of experience—for example, they require employees to have experience with a specific computer program or to have worked for many years in a particular field. These companies likely wouldn’t hire entry-level and college-level workers as Hsieh suggests because they don’t want to invest in training new hires: They want hires to have the required experience _now_ , and they see having this experience as essential to success in the role.
> 
> However, experts argue that focusing on potential is more important than focusing on specific qualities when hiring: They recommend taking a chance on hires who have experience that’s not traditionally associated with the role or have unconventional backgrounds, but have the _potential_ to succeed. This aligns with Hsieh’s argument to hire entry-level and college-level workers, who may lack specific skills in a certain field due to their lack of workplace experience but have great _potential_ to develop and succeed.
> 
> Hiring employees with unconventional backgrounds means they can use their unconventional experience to bring diversity of thinking to your team and solve problems in new and innovative ways. For example, if you hire a psychology major for an HR position, they can use their knowledge of psychology to solve interpersonal disputes and brainstorm ways to better engage employees.
