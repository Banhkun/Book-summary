## Part 1: The Basics of Biology | Chapter 1: Our Similar But Unique Anatomy

According to sex researcher Emily Nagoski, our culture tells women that there’s a standard for female sexuality, and they aren’t living up to it. **What our society considers sexually “normal,”** in terms of everything from anatomical structure to a person’s level of desire for sex, **is based on the experience of the average man**. This is because until relatively recently, research has focused heavily on men and male-centric models of sexuality.

(Shortform note: The issue of gender inequality in research isn’t exclusive to the field of human sexuality. In fact, there’s a widely acknowledged gender gap throughout medical research that has led to a dangerous lack of information regarding women’s health and how it might differ from men’s. For example, although cardiovascular disease affects men and women differently in terms of symptoms, risk factors, and outcomes, only one-third of cardiovascular clinical trial subjects are female, leaving the unique female experience underexplored.)

There are two problems with using an average man as the societal standard. First, it discounts the existence and experience of women, who make up about half of the world’s population. Because of this, **women must view themselves through a scope that wasn’t made for them** , which helps to perpetuate false ideas about what’s normal and healthy. Second, it disregards individual variation, whether among men or women. According to Nagoski, there are as many or even more differences within groups than between them.

(Shortform note: These false ideas about what’s normal with regards to women’s sexual experience stem from a long history of contempt toward female sexuality, even in the medical field. Research examining attitudes toward female sexuality demonstrates that, as recently as the 19th century, doctors were advocating for clitoridectomies to "cure" masturbation and nymphomania. Even within the last 50 years, doctors have regarded women’s low levels of desire and lack of sexual response—which Nagoski later identifies as normal and variable aspects of female sexuality—as disorders that require treatment.)

### Combatting Sexual Misinformation

Nagoski believes that to put an end to these misguided cultural standards and the harm they inflict on women’s understanding and acceptance of themselves, **women must better understand the science behind their sexuality**. She says that by viewing their sexuality from a _scientific_ rather than cultural perspective, women can free themselves from unrealistic standards, learn to appreciate their sexuality for what it is, and ultimately improve their overall well-being.

(Shortform note: Although Nagoski expresses the importance of examining the science behind women’s sexuality, she doesn’t acknowledge how difficult it can be to identify factual scientific information in an environment that allows for the quick and easy spread of misinformation and pseudoscience. For example, in 2017, the popular wellness website _Goop_ sold a product it claimed could improve your sex life and balance your menstrual cycle if inserted into the vagina for hours at a time. After many customers had already purchased the product, a lawsuit ultimately condemned Goop’s claims as counterfactual, and health experts warned that using the product could cause bacterial infections.)

With this in mind, the first part of this guide introduces our sexual biology. Here, we’ll cover the basics of anatomy and the mechanism in our brain that governs our sexual response. In the remaining three parts, we’ll discuss the influence of context on our sexual experience, the concepts of arousal, desire, and orgasm, and how to find true enjoyment in sex by cultivating confidence and joy in ourselves.

Beginning with Chapter 1, we’ll introduce one of the fundamental takeaways that Nagoski wants readers to internalize, which is that **each of us has a unique anatomy made up of similar parts**. In other words, while we all develop from the same tissues, there’s also quite a bit of variation—not only between men and women but also _among_ them. What’s more, it all falls into the realm of what’s normal and healthy.

To understand this idea, we’ll first break down some of the common misconceptions about the appearance and function of female genitalia. Then, we’ll explore the biology of female genitalia, their analogous male counterparts, and the wide variation in their appearance. This will help solidify the idea that what makes you unique doesn’t make you abnormal.

### Misconceptions About Female Anatomy

As we’ve already noted, Nagoski argues that the fact that men are the standard for society’s understanding of sexuality has created a knowledge gap with regards to women’s unique experiences and biology. **This lack of awareness has allowed our society to perpetuate many misconceptions about female anatomy** that directly impact the way women see themselves and their sexuality.

What’s more, these misconceptions come from a variety of different places. Nagoski identifies two primary avenues through which society has developed a skewed perception of female anatomy: culturally driven metaphors and media representation. In addition, she points out some other harmful but common misconceptions perpetuated by society. Let’s explore each in detail.

#### Culturally Driven Metaphors About Female Genitalia

Nagoski explains that our society tends to take biological facts regarding anatomy and transform them into inaccurate metaphors based on cultural values like purity and virginity. She mentions two specific examples of metaphors people have associated with the female genitalia:

##### Metaphor #1: Women’s Hidden Genitals as a Marker of Shame

According to Nagoski, during the medieval period, people called the female genitalia _pudendum_ (from Latin _pudere_ , “to make ashamed”). The reasoning for this was that women’s genitalia (in contrast to men’s) appear hidden inside the body, as if women are trying to conceal something they’re ashamed of.

(Shortform note: Although Nagoski points to the medieval period as the first time people named women’s genitals _pudendum_ , the term itself actually dates back to first-century Roman writers. Originally, the word was used to refer to any person or animal’s genitalia, regardless of sex. It was only later that people narrowed the meaning of _pudendum_ to just women’s genitals.)

In reality, **the female genitalia aren’t “hidden” at all**. Nagoski tells us that instead, the various parts have different sizes and locations from their male counterparts due to biological reasons (which we’ll discuss more in the next section). Assigning such a negative name to women’s genitalia not only points to a lack of biological understanding, but it also perpetuates the idea that there’s something fundamentally wrong with their genitalia. If there wasn’t, why else would women try to hide them?

Nagoski explains that although modern culture doesn’t suggest that women are hiding something disgraceful in a literal sense, **the idea that women’s genitalia is somehow shameful remains prominent** in the way both men and women feel and talk about female sexuality. For example, both sexes shame women when their clothing inadvertently (and often unavoidably) accentuates the shape of their vulva—what is commonly known as a “camel toe.”

> **Shame’s Effect on Women’s Health**
> 
> While Nagoski addresses the fact that (unfair and unwarranted) feelings of shame toward women’s genitalia remain prominent in our modern society, she doesn’t specify how these negative feelings affect the health and well-being of women.
> 
> In many cases, shame prevents women from not only understanding their bodies but also seeking the care they need. For example, according to one 2014 survey, as many as one-third of young women avoided going to the doctor for gynecological issues out of embarrassment. Additionally, less than half of women felt that they were well informed about gynecological health, and many were unable to correctly identify the basic parts of their anatomy using a diagram.
> 
> Overall, these statistics demonstrate that the effects of shame are both psychological and physical, as they have the potential to put women’s gynecological health at risk.

##### Metaphor #2: The Hymen as a Marker of Virginity

Nagoski notes that society has come to view the hymen—a membrane found at the opening of the vaginal canal—as a marker of virginity. Because of its location and potential to change over the course of a woman’s life, there’s a common but incorrect belief that the hymen is a barrier that’s permanently “broken” the first time that a penis penetrates the vagina.

(Shortform note: Nagoski observes that the hymen has evolved into a token of virginity, but she doesn’t speak to how this idea came into existence. The belief stems from an evolutionary theory claiming that, historically, men would have preferred to mate with a woman who could prove—through her “intact” hymen—that she had never had sex with another man. This would guarantee that any offspring produced would be his, so he could avoid wasting time and resources on other men’s children who didn’t carry his genes.)

Nagoski warns that **this misconception is especially dangerous because of the powerful impact it can have on women’s lives**. When an unmarried woman’s hymen is absent or torn, she’s seen as impure or marked as “damaged goods.” In some cultures, this has resulted in women feeling pressured to have surgical reconstruction of their hymen as if it were a medical necessity. Nagoski adds that in some extreme cases, women are even beaten or killed because people have seen anything but a fully intact hymen as proof that she has had sexual intercourse outside of marriage.

On the other hand, Nagoski maintains that people have used the _presence_ of a hymen as proof that a woman couldn’t have been raped, preventing her from seeking justice for the crime committed against her. The logic goes that if the hymen is a barrier and it’s still intact, there was no penetration and thus no rape.

Nagoski concludes that the basis of these real-world consequences is an idea that’s entirely false. In reality, **the hymen serves no biological function** (including being a barrier). Some women are born without them, and when they’re present, they simply stretch with penetration. If they do happen to tear, they heal.

(Shortform note: While Nagoski claims that the hymen is an evolutionary byproduct serving no real function, in reality, biologists don’t agree about why it exists. In addition to the virginity theory mentioned previously, other theories suggest that the hymen’s purpose is to make sex painful—therefore encouraging more caution amongst young women interested in sex—or that it evolved to prevent foreign objects from accidentally entering the vagina.)

> **The Hymen and Virginity Testing**
> 
> Although Nagoski discusses some possible outcomes of evaluating the state of a woman’s hymen, such as shame, the denial of rape, and even death, she doesn’t provide information about how people conduct this evaluation.
> 
> Both historically and cross-culturally, people have subjected women to so-called “virginity testing.” Usually conducted by a doctor—though sometimes carried out by other community members when a medical professional isn’t available—virginity testing is an invasive procedure that involves inspecting a woman’s genitalia to determine whether her hymen is still intact. The World Health Organization (WHO), as well as other global organizations, condemns the practice as a human rights violation and a violent act against women that has the potential to cause both physical and psychological harm.
> 
> Despite having no scientific merit, the practice is still used today in certain cultures around the world. As recently as 2020, for example, virginity testing was being used on rape victims in Pakistan before the Lahore High Court banned it at the beginning of 2021.

#### Media Representation of Female Genitalia

In addition to cultural values driving inaccurate metaphors, Nagoski says **there’s a lack of representation of female genitalia in the media**. What’s more, when it is present it’s often a false portrayal of the real thing. For instance, the vulva is usually presented to fit the “Barbie doll” ideal: neat and hairless.

Nagoski explains that this **poor representation contributes to womens’ negative views of their genitalia and sexuality** because the only examples they have reinforce a false ideal that they were never meant to achieve in the first place.

(Shortform note: Although Nagoski doesn’t provide any specific examples demonstrating the impact of this lack of representation, there’s evidence showing that the cultural ideals presented by the media profoundly influence women, both psychologically and physically. For example, statistics point to a growing global trend of women undergoing genital cosmetic surgery to make their vulva fit the desired standard. In particular, these procedures have increased dramatically in the United States, Australia, and the UK.)

#### Further Anatomical Misconceptions

Beyond the influence of metaphors and media representation, Nagoski mentions a few other misconceptions related to female genitalia that are prevalent in the conceptualization of female sexuality.

**Men get “hard” and women get “wet”** : Nagoski points out that our culture portrays sexual arousal for men and women differently: an aroused man gets “hard” and an aroused woman gets “wet”. She says **the truth, however,** **is that men and women do both**. A man’s penis and a woman’s clitoris both become engorged when blood rushes to the area. Similarly, men and women both release fluid as they become aroused.

(Shortform note: Although Nagoski clarifies that both men and women get “hard” and “wet,” she doesn’t explain _why_ this is the case. In the first instance, the swelling of blood in the penis and clitoris that creates erections also increases sensitivity for the purpose of pleasure. In the second instance, the fluids that men and women release during the process of arousal eliminate acidity, which helps to create the proper environment for sperm to survive.)

**Ejaculation is masculine:** Nagoski adds that many also believe that because it’s uncommon for women to release fluid during orgasm, ejaculation is only for men. This idea creates one of two problematic and conflicting assumptions: 1) female ejaculation is unacceptable and abnormal, or 2) because it’s uncommon, it’s a prize to idealize.**** In reality, Nagoski reassures readers that **whether a woman ejaculates or not, it’s entirely acceptable and healthy**.

(Shortform note: One additional reason for the prevalence of this misconception that Nagoski doesn’t mention is the lack of research on female ejaculation. Because there have been few studies on the subject, scientists still don’t fully understand how female ejaculation happens, what its purpose is, or even how many women experience it. One study, for example, concluded that anywhere between 10–50% of women ejaculate, which is quite a wide estimate.)

### Anatomy From a Biological Perspective

Now that we’ve looked at some of the misconceptions driving the negative perception of women’s sexuality, we can examine a biologically-based account of female genitalia. This includes both how it compares to male genitalia and the completely normal variation we see amongst women.

According to Nagoski, what we find is that **both men’s and women’s genitalia have the same origins, stemming from the same embryonic tissue.** However, these organs ultimately develop in unique ways, take distinct shapes, and serve different functions depending on a person’s sex. The scientific term for these similar-but-different parts is homologues. Let’s explore homologues in detail below.

#### Female Genitalia and Their Male Counterparts

Nagoski asserts that we can better understand the identical origins but different functions of men’s and women’s homologous genitalia by examining some of the female organs and comparing them to their male counterparts. Although she provides various comparisons, we’ll limit our discussion to just two crucial sets of organs.

##### Clitoris vs. Penis

According to Nagoski, the clitoris is the anatomical source of female sexual pleasure. The visible part is right below where the inner labia or “lips” of the vulva (i.e. external parts of the female genitalia) meet, although it extends far inside a woman’s body.

(Shortform note: The fact that Nagoski points out the true size and shape of the clitoris is important, as many people don’t realize just how far it extends into the body. In fact, it took until 1981 for any health body to create an anatomically correct diagram of the clitoris, and many school textbooks don’t even mention this organ, let alone explain its true size and shape. This persistent misinformation and misconception support her argument for the need for a biological understanding of female genitalia.)

**The male equivalent of the clitoris is the penis,** Nagoski notes. Just like the clitoris, the penis is the sexual pleasure center and is positioned front and center on the body. However, whereas only the head of the clitoris is visible outside of a woman’s body, the head and half the length of the entire penis is visible outside of a man’s body. Nagoski argues that their differences in appearance have everything to do with their differences in function. Whereas the clitoris is only responsible for sensation, the penis is responsible for sensation, penetration, ejaculation, and urination.

(Shortform note: Nagoski doesn’t elaborate on why these differences in function lead to differences in appearance. The penis must extend further than the clitoris as it must be long enough to penetrate and ejaculate into the vaginal canal, which is inside a woman’s body.)

##### Outer Labia vs. Scrotum

Nagoski explains that the outer labia, or “lips,'' are fleshy and hairy folds of skin around the vaginal opening. (Shortform note: The function of the outer labia is to protect the vagina—and therefore internal organs connected to the vagina like the ovaries, urethra, and clitoris—from damage.)

**The male counterpart of the outer labia is the scrotum** , which is the fleshy and hairy bag of skin hanging below the penis that holds the testicles. Nagoski notes that upon close inspection, you can see the seam on the scrotum where it would have split into outer labia had the embryo been female. (Shortform note: Just as the outer labia serve to protect some of the most vital sexual organs, the scrotum acts as a layer of protection for the testicles, which are the organs that produce sperm.)

(Shortform note: Why must the scrotum extend further out from the body than the outer labia? Nagoski doesn’t explore this, but it’s because the scrotum must keep the testicles cooler than the internal body temperature to produce sperm. On the other hand, the ovaries—which are the female equivalent of the testicles and produce eggs and hormones—don’t require the same environmental conditions to function. Because of this, they’re located inside the body rather than externally with the outer labia.)

#### The Variation in Female Genitalia

Nagoski tells us that just as men and women have similar parts organized in different ways, **female genitalia, too, can vary a lot from woman to woman**. In particular, she notes that the size, shape, and even color of everything from the clitoris to the labia can differ greatly depending on the person. Understanding this from a biological perspective can help women realize that whatever the unique appearance of their genitalia, they’re normal and healthy.

(Shortform note: While Nagoski specifically mentions women here, men have a lot of genital variation too. For instance, the penis and scrotum can differ in size, shape, and color in much the same way as female genitalia. What’s more, men also face feelings of shame about the appearance of their genitals—for instance, the size of their penis—that stem from a toxic and pervasive standard for what it means to be masculine.)
