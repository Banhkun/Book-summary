## Exercise: Adjust Your Expectations

Improve your sex life by changing your perspective.

* * *

Below, list the different expectations you have surrounding sex. (For example, you may expect that you should enjoy every orgasm you experience.)

Consider how these expectations are reflected in your sexual experience. Which of them are consistently met? Which of them seem to always fall short of reality?

Now, think about where each individual expectation came from. Write down its possible source.

For each of the expectations that fall short, ask yourself these questions: Are they reasonable expectations to have based on what youâ€™ve learned and where they came from? If so, what more could you or your partner be doing to meet them? If not, how could you adjust your expectations of sex to better align with reality?
