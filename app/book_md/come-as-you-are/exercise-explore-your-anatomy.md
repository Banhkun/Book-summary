## Exercise: Explore Your Anatomy

Learn to embrace what makes you unique by getting to know your anatomy.

* * *

Take some time to examine your naked body in the mirror, paying special attention to the size, shape, and color of your genitalia. Describe what you see.

Now, write down how you feel about what you saw. (For example, did you feel pleased with the appearance of your genitals? Did you feel ashamed?)

If you noticed any negative feelings arising as you observed yourself, reflect on why that might be. (For example, have any societal expectations of what genitals should look like impacted how you view your own?)

Now, based on what youâ€™ve learned in this chapter, reflect on how to combat the sources of your negative feelings. (You might consider what, according to the author, is _actually_ true about genitalia and how this differs from the societal expectations you hold yourself to. For instance, is it really true that all vulvas must look a certain way?)

After reflecting on your body, how you feel about it, and why, how do you feel about your body, particularly your genitalia? Do you feel more or less confident in your appearance? Explain your answer.
