## Chapter 2: Your Individual Sexual Personality

In the previous chapter, we discussed Nagoski’s proposition that when it comes to anatomy, everyone has the same basic parts, but they’re configured uniquely from person to person. Now, we’ll extend this idea, applying it not just to anatomy but to a person’s sexuality. As we’ll see, although everyone is born with the same brain mechanism that controls sexual response, certain aspects are distinct to each person. According to Nagoski, these differences produce **unique sexual personalities that determine our individual sexual needs** , such as what it takes to turn us on.

In this chapter, we’ll discuss the two-system mechanism in our brain that determines our sexual personality, including what it is, how it works, and how it varies from person to person. Specifically, we will:

  * Discuss previous models and what led to the proposal of the modern model
  * Define the parts of the mechanism and how they work
  * Explain how the brain determines what turns us on (and what turns us off)
  * Discuss how aspects of the mechanism can vary from person to person
  * Explore how to determine the characteristics of your unique personality



### Contextualizing Our Current Understanding of Sexual Response

Before diving into details about the modern model of the sexual brain, let’s explore how we arrived at our current understanding. Nagoski identifies two previous models that made an impact on our conceptualization of human sexual response: the four-phase model and the triphasic model.

#### The Four-Phase Model

According to Nagoski, a research lab at Washington University in 1964 conducted an experiment to determine how the female body responds during an orgasm. To do this, they asked a woman to masturbate in a lab setting while they observed her body’s physical response.

From the experiment, Nagoski says the researchers identified four different phases of physical arousal, from stimulation to post-orgasm. **This model would become the foundation of scientists’ and therapists’ understanding of human sexual response**.

She goes on to explain that during the first phase, excitement, the body starts reacting to the sexual experience (for example, by lubricating the vaginal wall and increasing the body’s heart rate). Throughout the second phase, plateau, these processes continue, along with the contraction of different muscle groups. During the third phase, orgasm, the vagina and other organs contract, followed by a sudden release of tension throughout the body. Finally, at the fourth phase, resolution, everything returns to baseline.

> **Criticisms of the Four-Phase Model**
> 
> In her discussion of the four-phase model, Nagoski doesn’t address the fact that many experts have criticized it, nor does she highlight its specific shortcomings.
> 
> First, the model had a limited scope. It described only the physical aspects of sexual response, like muscle contraction and lubrication. Psychological and relational factors weren’t considered. In addition, because the researchers’ study only included individuals experienced in having orgasms, the results on which they based the model aren’t representative of the average population (who don’t necessarily experience regular orgasm). Furthermore, they give the impression that orgasm is necessary for pleasure. Finally, the fact that it’s a stable, linear model means that it doesn’t account for individual and situational variation that may not align with what it depicts.
> 
> Despite these criticisms, modern medical professionals—including psychiatric and medical clinicians as well as pharmaceutical companies—still reference the four-phase model to define and treat sexual health problems. Popular healthcare website WebMD, for example, published an article in 2020 that references the four-phase model to explain sexual response to its readers.

#### The Triphasic Model

Nagoski tells us that, by the 1970s, sex therapists were using **the four-phase model** to treat clients with different types of sexual dysfunction. However, they discovered that the model **was ineffective for treating those with a lack of interest in sex**.

Nagoski claims that psychotherapist Helen Singer Kaplan realized that the model was missing a phase of sexual desire. Kaplan observed that within the context of a sexual relationship, a person needs to _want_ to have sex before they can become aroused. To address this omission, Nagoski says Kaplan developed a **triphasic model** , which added a phase for desire and combined the phases of excitement and plateau to produce **three phases: desire, arousal, and orgasm**.

> **Transitioning From a Linear to Circular Model**
> 
> Just as with the four-phase model, Nagoski’s discussion of the triphasic model doesn’t cover many of its criticisms. Like its predecessor, the triphasic model was criticized for presenting sexual response as a linear progression. Further research showed that individuals, and especially women, can skip stages in the process and often experience desire _after_ arousal. In addition, like the four-phase model, the triphasic model failed to capture the psychological, emotional, and contextual aspects involved in sexual response.
> 
> Experts later developed other models in an attempt to address these criticisms. One of these, proposed by Dr. Rosemary Basson, posited a circular model of sexual response that accounted for the non-linear experience of many women. Specifically, the model presented sexual response as a cyclical process where desire can happen in advance of (or in response to) arousal, love, and other emotional factors can influence desire and arousal, and orgasm is not necessary for satisfaction.

### The Two-System Mechanism of Sexual Response

Nagoski tells us that although the triphasic model went on to serve as the basis for diagnostic criteria for the American Psychological Association, it raised many questions about desire—namely, why do different people seem to have different levels of desire? Additionally, neither the triphasic model nor its predecessor contained a description of what was happening in the brain during sexual arousal.

To fill these gaps, Nagoski says researchers at the Kinsey Institute in the late 1990s developed the theoretical model that makes up our modern understanding of human sexual response. Their model describes a **two-system mechanism in the brain that determines our sexual personality**. Nagoski nicknames these two systems our sexual “accelerator” and “brakes,” but moving forward, we’ll refer to them as the Sexual Excitation System (SES) and Sexual Inhibition System (SIS), the model’s original terms.

Nagoski explains that the **Sexual Excitation System (SES) is responsible for the process of arousal**. It constantly scans our environment for potential sexual stimuli. (Common examples could be the scent of cologne or seeing our partner in a bathing suit.) When the SES identifies sex-related stimuli, it sends a signal from our brain to our genitals so that our body can prepare for sex.

In contrast to the SES, Nagoski says that the **Sexual Inhibition System (SIS) controls the process of impeding arousal**. The SIS scans our environment for reasons _not_ to have sex (for example, the risk of unwanted pregnancy) and sends a signal to our brain when we identify something relevant.

> **Further Analysis of the Two-System Mechanism of Sexual Response**
> 
> As Nagoski points out, the two-system mechanism developed by the Kinsey Institute was highly influential in the field of human sexuality. This is evidenced by a variety of factors: First, it’s been widely applied in research across the world, including studies in Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Australia. In addition, it’s impacted pharmaceutical research related to sexual dysfunction, leading to the proposal of new treatment options. Mainstream news outlets such as CNN and Psychology Today have covered it, as well as a variety of online health websites. Finally, it features in the popular human sexuality textbook, _Sexuality Today_.
> 
> However, although the theoretical model was undoubtedly groundbreaking and influential, its development wasn’t flawless. Initially, its foundational research focused solely on men: The model was first proposed as part of a 1999 study on male sexual inhibition. From there, Kinsey researchers continued their exploration of the model by considering its implications for the treatment of erectile dysfunction as well as using it to predict and measure male sexual response. It wasn’t until the 2000s that Kinsey researchers began to consider the experience of women in relation to the model. The lack of female representation in these earlier studies is indicative of the larger, ongoing issue of male-centric medical research we mentioned previously.
> 
> Fortunately, as more researchers work with the model, they will continue to refine it and open up new avenues of investigation. Future directions could include studies that utilize brain imaging to establish a neurophysiological model, studies that aim to improve the existing SIS/SES questionnaires, and studies that continue to explore gender differences and similarities related to the sensitivity levels of the two systems (which we’ll discuss in more detail shortly).

#### Turn Ons and Turn Offs

So if there are two systems in our brain that are scanning our environment for signs that it’s time for sex (or not), how do they know what to consider a turn on and a turn off? Nagoski explains that although we may assume this knowledge is innate, in reality **we learn almost all sexual stimuli through culture**. In other words, society teaches us what to find arousing and off-putting.

(Shortform note: Culture has such a powerful impact on our perception of sexuality that people can view even the same body part through an entirely different scope in different parts of the world. For example, while in many western cultures a woman’s breast is likely to trigger arousal, in other communities, the breast is treated as a neutral body part in comparison to others, such as the buttocks.)

#### Sensitivity’s Role in the Two Systems

Nagoski tells us that **each individual’s SES and SIS have different levels of sensitivity**. How sensitive each of a person’s systems is to stimuli in the environment determines their particular sexual needs. For example, someone with a sensitive SES wouldn’t need nearly as many (or as specific) stimuli to become aroused as someone with an insensitive SES.

(Shortform note: Nagoski tells us that each individual’s level of sensitivity varies, but she doesn’t discuss which factors contribute to those differences. According to the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, which developed the two-system model, each person’s sensitivity levels depend on both genetic and environmental factors, including their unique sexual physiology, history, and personality.)

### Discovering Your Unique Sexual Personality

Nagoski asserts that understanding the two-system mechanism of sexual arousal, especially in a culture that bases its sexual standards on the average man (who often has a more sensitive SES and less sensitive SIS), can reassure women that their experience of sex is completely normal, no matter what combination of sensitivities they have.

(Shortform note: Research, including cross-cultural studies, supports the differences in sensitivity levels between men and women that Nagoski cites. For instance, researchers applied the model to Portuguese men and women, the results aligned with previous research demonstrating higher excitation and lower inhibition in men compared to women.)

But this reassurance doesn’t simply come from knowing what the mechanism is and how it works. Nagoski argues that instead, it arises from developing an understanding of our unique balance—our unique personality. While it isn’t an exact science, **asking ourselves some questions about our individual experiences can help increase our awareness of how we function and what we need**. For brevity, we’ve simplified the questionnaire while retaining its major themes.

(Shortform note: Another potential benefit of understanding the nature of our own SES and SIS is that it can help us determine our sexual compatibility with our partner. Although differences in sexual personality don’t guarantee incompatibility, they may help us predict potential challenges in our sexual relationship that could threaten our overall satisfaction, such as one partner initiating sex significantly more than the other.)

#### Reflecting on Your SES and SIS

Here are some questions to help you think about your SES:

  * Do you become sexually aroused by your partner showing off their strengths?
  * What about when you fantasize about sex?
  * Does boredom often lead to thoughts about sex?
  * Are you aroused by particular scents or tastes?
  * Does the thought of someone or something interrupting sex have little effect on your ability to stay aroused?



**If you answered yes to these questions, you most likely have a sensitive SES**. In particular, Nagoski says this means you’re very sensitive to sexual stimuli, even things like smell and taste. **If you answered no, you most likely have an insensitive SES**. Specifically, Nagoski says this means you don’t easily respond to sexual stimuli and need to devote specific attention to become aroused. **If you couldn’t provide a definitive yes or no answer, then you probably fall somewhere in between**.

Now, here are some questions to help you think about your SIS:

  * Does stress prevent you from getting aroused?
  * Does everything have to feel “right” for sex to be enjoyable?
  * Does worrying about your partner’s attraction to you affect your ability to become aroused?
  * Does fear about your performance in bed inhibit your arousal?



**If you answered yes to these questions, you most likely have a sensitive SIS**. In particular, Nagoski says this means you must feel relaxed and trust your partner to become aroused. **If you answered no, you most likely have an insensitive SIS**. Specifically, Nagoski says this means you’re not worried about your performance, body image, or potential consequences of sex. **If you couldn’t provide a definitive yes or no answer, then Nagoski says you’re most likely somewhere in the middle**.

> **Variations on the SIS/SES Questionnaire**
> 
> Nagoski’s questionnaire is partially based on the original SIS/SES questionnaire (which you can view as part of an online questionnaire on Qualtrics). The Kinsey Institute created this original questionnaire while developing its two-system theoretical model. Overall, Nagoski’s version follows the format of the original relatively closely, though it departs in two specific ways: First, whereas the original asks participants to choose from four options—“strongly agree,” “agree,” “disagree,” and “strongly disagree”—Nagoski’s version utilizes a sliding scale, where 0 indicates “not at all like me” and 4 indicates “exactly like me.” This creates the possibility for a central or neutral option that the original lacks. Second, while the original combines questions targeting both the SIS and SES, Nagoski’s version separates questions into two sections.
> 
> For the questions themselves, Nagoski condensed the questionnaire from 7 questions targeting each system down to only 5. Furthermore, her questions vary significantly from the original’s. While hers focus more on psychological/emotional factors (for example, “sometimes I feel so ‘shy’ or self-conscious that I cannot become fully aroused”), the original’s focus more on situational factors (for example, “If I am having sex in a secluded, outdoor place and I think that someone is nearby, I am not likely to get very aroused”).
> 
> The differences between Nagoski’s questionnaire and the original reflect further research on the applicability of the two-system model that revealed women might need a separate questionnaire from men. This is due to men’s and women’s differing experiences of sexual excitation and inhibition. Because researchers developed the original questionnaire following a study that initially only focused on men, they didn’t take gender differences into account. Ultimately, other researchers developed a questionnaire that is not only made exclusively for women but also expands on the factors considered by the original, including sexual power dynamics and partner characteristics.
> 
> We can see the influence from the new, woman-centered questionnaire in Nagoski’s version, although hers is significantly condensed. Despite the difference in length, both questionnaires focus much more heavily on psychological and emotional factors like self-esteem and relationship dynamics, which research has shown are important aspects of women’s experience of sexual excitation and inhibition.
