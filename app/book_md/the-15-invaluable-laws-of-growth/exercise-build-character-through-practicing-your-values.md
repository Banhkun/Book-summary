## Exercise: Build Character Through Practicing Your Values

Maxwell says that it’s important to build strong character if you want to grow and that you can strengthen your character through practice. In this exercise, you’ll practice acting in accordance with your values.

* * *

What would you say are your most important values?

When did you recently fall short of one of your highest values? What happened, and why do you think you missed the mark?

When might you have an opportunity to embody that value in the coming week? Could there be more than one opportunity?

What can you do to make it easier for yourself to put that value into practice when the opportunity arises?
