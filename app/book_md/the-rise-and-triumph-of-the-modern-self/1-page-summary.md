## 1-Page Summary

Just a few short decades ago, traditional biblical understandings of marriage and gender were considered normal and mainstream throughout Western societies. Most people espoused the view that marriage was a contract between a man and a woman, and that gender was inseparable from biologically determined sex.

In _The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self, _Carl Trueman, a professor of biblical studies and ecclesiastical history, contends that not only has mainstream opinion shifted toward the acceptance of gay marriage and transgender identities, but that traditional Christian views have become stigmatized as _immoral, irrational, and bigoted_. He considers these developments a disaster, as they undermine the traditional Christian morality that formed the foundations of Western culture.

Many consider this to be a sudden shift. However, Trueman asserts that this change wasn't sudden at all. Instead, it was the culmination of a cultural revolution that has been brewing in Western civilization for centuries. He explains that **this revolution began with a changing conception of _the self._** Our guide will explore Trueman's narrative of this transformation, from the Enlightenment philosophers and the Romantic poets to the LGBTQ+ alliance and the rise of leftist campus activism. Finally, we’ll discuss Trueman's recommendations for modern-day Christianity.

Our commentary dives into the historical context of these movements while exploring multiple perspectives on the culture wars of today.

(Shortform note: _The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self_ has received mostly positive reviews since its publication in 2020. Critics have praised its depth of research, analytical insight, and relevance to contemporary issues. However, some reviewers have criticized the work as politically one-sided or lacking nuance around LGBTQ+ issues. It’s worth noting that this book has mostly been reviewed in outlets that share Trueman's socially conservative politics, likely due to its scholarly approach and strong political opinions.)

### Part 1: What Is the “Modern” Self?

Before tracing the history of this cultural transformation, let's establish a foundational understanding of Trueman's definition of modern selfhood and how it differs from traditional Christian understandings of selfhood. Trueman outlines six**** characteristics of contemporary selfhood.

**1\. The modern self is internal.** When someone wants to "find themselves," modern culture encourages them to look inward. Someone finds their "true self" in their deepest feelings and intuitions. This means that selfhood is primarily psychological.

(Shortform note: Popular psychology frequently confirms Trueman's characterization of how modern people understand selfhood. For example, some experts advise that finding your "true" self requires getting away from other people and going into nature. This view suggests that people are unable to find themselves because of peer pressure and groupthink, confirming the view that your “self” is something deeply internal.)

**2\. The modern self is expressive.** Selves express their emotions, thoughts, and opinions. A well-lived life is an "authentic" life—one in which the individual shares their inner life with others by making it public.

**3\. The modern self is malleable and determined by the individual.** A modern identity is defined by individual choices: where you live, who you associate with, which religions or philosophies you follow, your job, and your hobbies—all of this is up to _you_. Who "you" are is largely determined by the choices you make.

**4\. The modern self stands in opposition to social and cultural expectations.** When traditional, religious, or institutional authority places restrictions on someone's behavior or self-expression, this is contrary to their "true self." To be an authentic self and live a good life is to rebel against traditional authority figures and the restrictions they impose, regardless of the restrictions' moral content.

**5\. The modern self is sexual.** Trueman argues that modern culture places sexual desires and preferences at the core of selfhood. To live authentically, a modern self must express sexual preferences and find sexual fulfillment.

**6\. The modern self is free to demand recognition from others.** It's not enough to just express one's feelings and desires. A modern self can demand that others recognize, affirm, and validate the identity they have chosen for themselves, especially their sexual and gender identity.

(Shortform note: Advice from mental health experts somewhat complicates the objections Trueman raises to modern selfhood, as many mental health experts consider the acceptance and openness of your sexual orientation to be important to your overall mental health. They advise that exploring and understanding your sexuality is a normal part of human development. They also contend that being able to express your sexual identity is important to your sense of self-worth and overall mental health.)

Trueman states that each of these aspects stands in contrast to historical views of selfhood. A "self" was largely determined by external forces when most Europeans worked as peasant farmers, lived in the same town their whole lives, were deeply integrated into extended families, and could not choose their own religions.

> **Individualistic and Collectivist Societies**
> 
> Trueman focuses his analysis on the history of the concept of selfhood in Western culture. However, there's an important contrast to be drawn between modern cultures around the world. Self-expression, self-definition, and opposition to cultural expectations are all values of _individualistic cultures as opposed to collectivist cultures_. Individualistic cultures are typically found in Western societies like those in Europe and the US. Collectivist cultures are more common in Asia and Africa. Here are some of the key differences.
> 
>   * Individualistic cultures tend to value independence and prioritize individual happiness over the well-being of larger groups such as family, community, or nation. People tend to define themselves based on individual traits, such as personalities, talents, and preferences.
> 
>   * Collectivist cultures tend to value interdependence over independence. Individuals are expected to sacrifice personal happiness if necessary for the well-being of larger units like family, community, or nation. Furthermore, people in collectivist cultures tend to define themselves based on social roles, such as being a good parent or sibling.
>

#### The Modern Self Stands in Opposition to Christian Teachings

**This modern conception of the self inevitably leads to a culture that casts aside Christian views on sexual morality.** Trueman explains that traditional Christian teachings hold that human nature is universal and not determined by the individual. It also maintains that sex should only take place in a context of a committed, monogamous marriage. Sex performs a sacred moral purpose of procreation rather than the simple gratification of sexual desire.

Furthermore, Trueman asserts that traditional Christian teachings define marriage as a contract between a man and a woman, barring the possibility of same-sex marriage. Lastly, Christianity holds that a person's gender is identical to their biological sex, rejecting the possibility of transgender identities.

As we will see throughout this guide, the modern self undermines all of these teachings. It encourages people to pursue sexual desires and identities as an expression of their authenticity while labeling those who would restrict this behavior as oppressors.

(Shortform note: Research supports Trueman's characterization of Christian sexual morality as in tension with modern views and ideas: US polling data shows declining support for Christian sexual morals that cleaves along religious lines. The last two decades have shown both an unprecedented rise in support for same-sex marriage and an unprecedented decline in religious affiliation. Furthermore, religious affiliation strongly predicts support for both sex outside of marriage and gender identities that differ from sex at birth.)

### Part 2: The Transformation of Selfhood

Trueman states that this modern conception of the self didn't appear overnight. Rather, it's the result of three major developments stretching from the 18th to the 20th centuries: promoting the interior self, undermining the traditional view of human nature, and sexualizing selfhood.

#### Transformation #1: Promoting the Interior Self (18th and Early-19th Centuries)

The transformation into the modern self began with a turn toward focusing on internal experiences rather than external circumstances. Trueman traces two important developments in this history: the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and the poetry of the Romantic movement.

##### 1) Rousseau’s Interior Morality

Trueman’s analysis begins with **the 18th-century Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who elevated the moral status of the _inner_ self. **According to Christian traditions, humans are born sinful but become virtuous by following divine morals that are passed on through institutions. In other words, people must learn to be good.

Rousseau argued the opposite: People's natural moral intuitions are _good_ , but they behave badly because they suppress these intuitions to conform to a corrupt society. For example, he states that vices like envy, pride, and competitiveness are only active in social situations. You need to see what someone else has to envy them. Trueman explains that Rousseau's moral philosophy lays the groundwork for a view that the inner self stands in tension with society, and that, of the two, _the inner self is morally superior_.

(Shortform note: Rousseau's ideas on human nature were controversial in their time. The French philosopher Voltaire (born François-Marie Arouet), rejected the idea that moral intuitions could be superior to reason cultivated through education. He believed that humanity could improve its conditions in life by cultivating intellect and famously joked that Rousseau's celebration of "natural man" made him want to "walk on all fours." The political philosopher Edmund Burke also pushed back on Rousseau's cynical attitude toward institutions and traditions. He argued that society and its traditions were the product of accumulated wisdom and a necessary source of morality and social order.)

##### 2) The Romantic Poets

**Rousseau's conception of the natural, morally superior inner self was popularized by a movement in 19th-century poetry called Romanticism.** The Romantic movement included major poets like William Blake, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Trueman explains that the Romantic poets saw "culture" as something _artificial_ and _mannered_. They believed that uneducated rural people living rustic lives were more "authentic" and "natural" because they hadn't assimilated the corrupting influence of culture like educated people in cities.

Because the Romantics were skeptical of the idea that important truths could be found in "culture" or "society," they elevated emotional and aesthetic experience as a source of higher truth. However, they detached these experiences from any _moral framework_. This further built the moral authority of the individual against cultural institutions like religion.

> **The Broader 19th-Century Romantic Movement**
> 
> While Trueman focuses his analysis exclusively on poetry, 19th-century Romanticism was a much broader cultural movement that also found expression in painting, music, and literature. Each expression of this movement may have helped spread Rousseau’s individualism and interiority with their shared focus on subjective experience and emotional expression.
> 
>   * Painters like Francisco Goya and Caspar David Friedrich adopted harsh diagonal lines and high value contrast to create dramatic scenes of emotional intensity.
> 
>   * Composers like Richard Wagner and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky expanded the size of the orchestras and adopted expressive melodies with looser organization than their classical predecessors.
> 
>   * Literature took a turn away from logic toward the supernatural. Folklore and fairy tales like those of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen grew in popularity alongside works of gothic fiction like Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ and Bram Stoker's _Dracula_.
> 
> 


#### Transformation #2: Undermining the Traditional View of Human Nature (Mid-to-Late 19th Century)

While Rousseau and the Romantic poets laid the foundations for the rise of the "emotional and natural inner self," they still believed in the traditional Christian idea that humans had a fixed and universal nature. The next part of the transformation undermined this view of human nature. Trueman identifies three figures who played a major role in this transition: Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Nietzsche.

##### 1) Charles Darwin’s Theory of Evolution

Trueman argues that **the 19th-century biologist Charles Darwin undermined the Christian view of human nature through his theory of evolution.** This theory states that living organisms are shaped by the natural forces of mutation and natural selection and that, through these processes, humans evolved from early primates like apes and monkeys. This challenges the traditional Christian conception of universal human nature in two distinct ways.

  1. According to Christian tradition, humans are exceptional in nature and created in the image of God. Accepting Darwin's theory requires a complete revision of humanity's place in the world. If humans came to exist through impersonal forces that created other plants and animals, then they’re no longer exceptional or created in God's image.
  2. According to Christian tradition, humans were created for a unique purpose: to find communion with God by upholding a sacred moral contract. The creation of humans through random or natural forces detaches their nature from this sacred moral purpose.



> **The Christian Reaction to Darwin**
> 
> Many atheists and Christians alike agree that Darwin's theory of evolution undermines the Christian doctrines that humans are exceptional and created to fulfill a sacred destiny. However, during the 19th century, Christians were split in their response to his theories and in their attempts to reconcile them with Christian theology.
> 
> The theory was rejected outright by Young Earth Creationists who maintained a literal interpretation of Genesis in which the earth is only around 6,000 years old. In particular, Darwin’s theories were denounced by the Anglican Church.
> 
> However, during the 19th century, many Christians had already adopted the old Earth hypothesis, which maintained that Earth was created several billion years ago and believed this view compatible with Christian faith. The theologian B. B. Warfield argued that, if proven, evolution would pose no threat to scriptural authority. The botanist Asa Gray, a staunch early defender of evolution, was also a devout Christian who maintained that God acted through the laws of nature.

##### 2) Karl Marx’s Political Selfhood

Trueman asserts that **Karl Marx undermined the Christian idea of a universal human nature by placing greater importance on political and economic relationships**. A 19th-century German philosopher, Marx proposed radical economic theories that are known today as the foundations of communism.

Marx believed that the upper and lower economic classes exist in a constant power struggle with each other, one in which the lower classes have the moral high ground because they’re economically oppressed. According to this view, the morality or immorality of any human action is determined by which class's interests are served. This means that the most important thing to understand about a person was neither their inner life nor their moral life, but _where they stood in a socioeconomic hierarchy_.

This view runs contrary to the traditional Christian idea that humans have a universal nature that exists _prior_ to their political and economic relationships with one another. It also downgrades the importance of divine law in evaluating morality.

> **What Do Contemporary Marxists Say About Human Nature?**
> 
> Many modern Marxists agree with Trueman's characterization that Marx overturned the view of a universal human nature. However, not all Marxists share this interpretation. Some argue that a consistent view of human nature can be found in Marx's idea of "alienation." Marx's theory of alienation maintains that workers are "alienated" from their work in factories through the repetitive nature of their jobs and their lack of ownership over the profits. Some modern Marxists extrapolate from this that Marx believed people had an innate drive toward creative, varied, and independent forms of labor—something like human nature.
> 
> Trueman's analysis is largely focused on the greater cultural impact of Marx's ideas rather than his particular views of human nature. However, it's worth noting that the Marxist view of human nature also aligns with Rousseau's: The self is in tension with society because its natural passions and inclinations are thwarted by socioeconomic arrangements.

##### 3) Friedrich Nietzsche’s Individualism

Trueman explains that the 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche also subverted the Christian understanding of a universal human nature with a divine purpose. According to Trueman's analysis, **Nietzsche elevated the authority of the individual by rejecting all external sources of authority for morality or truth.**

Nietzsche proclaimed that individuals had the freedom and the responsibility to create truth and morality for themselves. According to this view, there is no such thing as objective truth or morality: Individuals must determine for themselves what is good and bad. This view holds human nature as something that each individual invents, rather than an objective source of truth that holds authority over humanity. This erodes the Christian view of human nature that people were created by God to follow divine moral laws, not to invent their own laws.

> **How Did Nietzsche Become Influential?**
> 
> While Nietzsche wrote and lived during the 19th century, his work was obscure during his lifetime and became popular because of its influence on other thinkers during the 20th century.
> 
>   * His ideas influenced two important movements of 20th-century European thought. Existentialist philosophers like Martin Heidegger and Albert Camus were drawn to Nietzsche's emphasis on individual freedom, while deconstructionists like Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida were drawn to his suspicion of knowledge and authority.
> 
>   * Nietzsche’s writings also found popularity in the Nazi Party, which saw a potent justification for authoritarian power in Nietzsche's rejection of traditional morality and emphasis on individual will. Adolf Hitler himself actively promoted Nietzsche's work, giving out copies of his books to soldiers and party members.
> 
>   * Finally, Nietzsche also influenced the psychologist Sigmund Freud, who saw many insights into human character in Nietzsche's self-assertive philosophy.
>

#### Transformation #3: Sexualizing Selfhood (20th Century)

Now that we have established the roots of the interior individual and explored the destabilization of human nature, we can turn our attention to a third component of the modern self: sexuality. In this section, we’ll explore Trueman's analysis of two important developments in Western thought: how sexuality came to form the center of human identity, and how this sexualized identity was taken up in radical leftist politics.

##### 1) Sigmund Freud’s Theory of Sexual Psychology

**The theories of prominent 19th-century psychologist Sigmund Freud brought sexuality to the very center of human identity.** Freud posited that sexual impulses form much of the foundation of the unconscious mind. Trueman explains that by placing sexuality at the center of identity, Freud further eroded the authority to restrict sexual behavior. Recall that, according to the modern self, a good life is one where people are able to fulfill their authentic desires. Therefore, if sexuality is at the very center of psychology, then a good life will be one in which sexual desires are fulfilled.

(Shortform note: While he was one of the most famous intellectuals of his time, many of Freud's ideas have since been debunked. Later psychologists have re-evaluated his studies and found his methods unscientific: Freud didn't develop falsifiable hypotheses or gather empirical data to support his theories. Some of Freud's most controversial ideas include his contention that children experience sexual desire toward their parents and that women envy men for their penises, ideas that carry little weight in modern psychology. However, many would agree with Trueman's assessment that Freud’s ideas were nonetheless influential, leaving their mark on public culture.)

Trueman highlights two areas where Freud's theories posit sexuality as the center of identity.

**1) Genital pleasure:** According to Trueman's analysis, Freud placed sexuality at the core of identity by describing genital pleasure as the psychological blueprint on which all other forms of happiness and satisfaction are modeled. The human mind innately understands sexual pleasure, and therefore other activities are only pleasurable if they provide a psychologically similar experience.

This led Freud to argue that sexual repression was the source of most psychological unhappiness. He saw the restriction of sexuality as a defining feature of civilization and reasoned, therefore, that unhappiness stems from participation in society. This fit neatly with Rousseau's moral philosophy that society was a source of moral corruption.

(Shortform note: Mental health practitioners understand sexual repression a bit differently from Freud: They define sexual repression not by whether a sexual desire is fulfilled, but whether it’s accepted internally _._ People repress their sexuality when they grow up with messaging that their sexuality is not acceptable. Some researchers identify internalized discomfort with sexuality as a contributing factor to high rates of suicide among LGBTQ+ teens, which seems to support Freud’s correlation between psychological happiness and sexual repression.)

**2) Sexualizing children:** Trueman also states that Freud placed sexuality at the core of human identity by viewing children as inherently sexual. Freud maintained that problems of sexual repression began in early childhood and stemmed from a child's relationship with their parents. Freudian psychology also sought to reframe childhood masturbation as a medical rather than moral concern. According to this view, children don't become sexual beings as they enter puberty—they’re _always_ sexual.

(Shortform note: Freud's theory of child sexuality is based on his idea of the "Oedipus complex," a theory that holds that children experience sexual attraction to their opposite-sex parent and jealous resentment of their same-sex parent. While most contemporary psychologists dismiss this theory, there is evidence supporting something called "sexual imprinting." This theory posits that, as adults, people are more attracted to someone who resembles their opposite-sex parent. While the evidence is mixed, this has even been documented in rats, suggesting a biological explanation.)

##### 2) Freudian Marxism

Trueman explains that, after Freud made identity sexual, **20th-century academics fused Freudian ideas about sexual repression with Marxist notions of class struggle.** Recall that Marx saw society as a struggle between an economic elite and an exploited working class. Freudian Marxists added another layer, arguing that economic elites also maintained their power through _psychological domination_. Therefore, Freudian Marxists sought to identify and overturn this domination. While previous generations of Marxists had focused their attention on property laws and labor contracts, Freudian Marxists focused on how the oppressed classes _felt_.

Also, recall that Freud posited sexual restriction as a defining feature of civilization. Freudian Marxists began to view sexual restrictions as a form of _class domination._ In particular, they viewed the traditional patriarchal family as a source of oppression. They argued that traditional families taught people to be obedient to their fathers, which led them to be submissive to economic and political elites. Therefore, to overthrow the oppressive elites, you must first overthrow the traditional family.

> **Eros and Freudian Marxism**
> 
> In making sense of how thinkers and activists synthesize Freudian and Marxist ideas, we must understand Freud's concept of _Eros_. Freud posited that all of human behavior was motivated by one of two drives, Eros or Thanatos. Named for the Greek god of love, Eros was a drive that included sexuality, affection, and survival. Eros is the primary motivation of human behavior, and therefore, the primary source of satisfaction in life. He contrasted this with Thanatos, named for the Greek god of death, a drive toward destruction, death, and violence.
> 
> Since Freud posited that maintaining civilization required the suppression of Eros, utopian thinkers like Herbert Marcuse began to argue for a society where people would be free to follow their Eros without inhibition. This led to calls to seek out and overthrow sources of oppression that Trueman highlights as the major contributions of Freudian Marxism.

##### 3) Separating Sex From Gender

Trueman states **the sexual nature of selfhood continued to change as feminists began to separate biological sex from cultural gender.** Trueman explains that the traditional Christian understanding of gender holds that it’s determined by biology rather than culture: Someone is born with male or female anatomical parts, and that determines whether they’re male or female.

However, during the 20th century, feminist philosophers began to suggest that while sex may be determined by biology, _gender_ was a social construct and therefore, created by culture. In particular, the feminist Simone de Beauvoir asserts that "woman" is a cultural category that is imposed on people. She argues that women are expected to assimilate into the role of woman. This role, she explained, was not determined by the natural order of the world, but through socially constructed norms and expectations.

Recall that the modern self is at odds with culture and society that restricts its authenticity. By relocating "womanhood" from the "self" to "culture," Beauvoir places traditional understandings of gender at odds with the interior, authentic self, which is then free to reject the social construct of “womanhood.”

> **Simone de Beauvoir and Hegelian Dialectics**
> 
> In arguing that "woman" exists as a cultural category separate from biology, Simone de Beauvoir drew influence from the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and his ideas about the "other."
> 
> Hegel posited a theory called the "Master/Servant Dialectic." This theory sought to explain the power dynamics of intersubjectivity by highlighting two distinct roles: master and servant. The master demands recognition from the servant, but doesn't offer recognition in return. This reduces the servant to an "_other_ ," someone who doesn't have the power to define themselves, but must accept the definitions placed on them by the master.
> 
> Beauvoir saw a similarity between these roles and the relationship between men and women. She argued that historically women had been "other" to men—that is, placed in a role that men defined for them. This role, she explained, was separable from the experience of being a human with female anatomy, and therefore "woman" can be a cultural category as well as a biological one.

### Part 3: The Modern Self Undermines Christian Morality

Now that we have defined the modern self and traced its development over history, we can explore how this transformation has reshaped culture. Trueman asserts that **by changing people's understanding of "selves," this transformation has impacted society in destructive ways.** In this section, we'll explore two major impacts on modern society: the prioritization of feelings and the rise of the LGBTQ+ movement.

#### Prioritizing Feelings

Trueman explains that modern selfhood encourages people to place a much greater emphasis on feelings over objective truths, morals, or reasoned arguments. He states that this change in priorities has reshaped society in three distinct ways.

##### 1) Oppression Is a Feeling

Trueman contends that **because modern people prioritize feelings, many young people equate feeling discomfort with being oppressed.** Recall that Freudian Marxists redefined oppression as psychological domination. Therefore, feeling bad when hearing speech one disagrees with can be framed as a form of oppression. Trueman explains that this tendency is most prevalent in leftist activism on college campuses, where simply expressing traditional points of view is seen as a form of oppression. He contends that this change has rolled back freedom of speech on campuses while undermining the mission of higher education, which includes challenging students' assumptions.

(Shortform note: In _The Coddling of the American Mind_ , Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt argue that the problem of viewing oppression as a feeling has been compounded by a broadening definition of trauma. While the term once referred to the lingering psychological effects of extremely negative life experiences, Lukianoff and Haidt contend that it has grown to encompass _any_ psychological discomfort. Since encountering challenging ideas can be uncomfortable, this broad definition of trauma equates hearing uncomfortable views with long-term psychological damage. Ultimately, this conflation lends moral credibility to silencing views that students find uncomfortable in the name of protecting their mental health.)

##### 2) Pornography Is Ubiquitous

Trueman contends that **the modern self has paved the way for the widespread acceptance and normalization of pornography.** If sexual desires are simply part of an authentic life, then there is very little moral ground to object to fulfilling those desires by consuming pornography. Furthermore, those who object to pornography may be cast as trying to impose a restrictive puritanism on others.

Trueman maintains that pornography is highly destructive to morality. By prioritizing the gratification of the individual consumer, pornography detaches sexuality from its greater moral context of relationships and procreation.

(Shortform note: A growing body of research is identifying the detrimental impacts of pornography. Many users have found themselves addicted and struggle to control their pornography consumption. Researchers have found that it can also be detrimental to relationships as heavy users may lose sexual interest in their partners. Furthermore, adolescent males may learn distorted expectations about sex that will then impact their future relationships. However, some psychologists maintain that people with pre-existing mental health conditions are at much greater risk for pornography addiction and that the distorted messaging for young males can be counteracted through education.)

##### 3) Normalization of Abortion

**The prioritization of feelings has resulted in a widespread normalization of abortion.** Trueman explains**** this is because the rationale for abortion rests on the well-being of the parents. If a child would make them happy, then they allow it to be born. However, if a child would make the parents unhappy, then it’s acceptable to take the child's life. Trueman holds that abortion destroys the life of a child and that its widespread normalization devalues human life.

(Shortform note: Trueman's analysis here focuses largely on Western history and culture. Outside of this context, individualistic parental goals can play a very different role in moral debates over abortion. For example, countries such as China, Iran, and Vietnam have adopted anti-natalist policies to lower birth rates and prevent overpopulation. In China, these policies have resulted in forced abortions and sterilizations. In these cultural contexts, the individualistic desire of the modern self is _to have children_ —but is subordinated to the economic goals of state authority figures.)

#### The Rise of the LGBTQ+ Movement

Trueman contends that the rise of **the LGBTQ+ movement** —a political alliance organized around the interests of gay, lesbian, and transgender people**—depends on an understanding of the self that is _individually determined, at odds with traditional culture, and highly sexual._** Furthermore, Trueman explains that this movement's aims are opposed to traditional Christian values and destructive to the continuation of Christian culture. In this section, we'll discuss how the modern self shaped the LGBTQ+ movement, transgender identity, and modern understandings of marriage.

##### 1) The Modern Self Shaped the LGBTQ+ Movement

**The modern self played an essential role in forging a political alliance of gays, lesbians, and transgender people.** Trueman asserts that these groups aren't necessarily natural allies. For example, during the 1970s, many lesbian feminists argued that their sexuality was deeply rooted in an embodied experience of femininity, and not simply the female equivalent of male homosexuality.

Furthermore, the identities of gays and lesbians are based on an understanding of gender that contradicts the claims of transgender identity. The defining feature of homosexual identity is an attraction to the same gender. For this to exist, gender needs to be a relatively stable category. Trueman asserts that transgender identity requires the _rejection_ of gender as a stable category. The individual is free to declare themselves a different gender because these categories have no stable or continuous essence.

However, a shared modern understanding of the self brought gays, lesbians, and transgender people together into an alliance. Recall that a modern self places authenticity in tension with society and places sexuality at the core of authenticity. Because each of these groups saw their authentic sexual identities as being in tension with society, this created a shared sense of victimhood that bonded the alliance.

> **Tension and Coalition Building in the Early LGBTQ+ Movements**
> 
> Historians confirm Trueman's analysis that there were tensions across gender lines in the early years of the LGBTQ+ movement. However, some argue for a more complex picture of the alliance’s formation than simply a shared conception of personal victimhood.
> 
> Many of the early gay rights organizations in the US were formed by white, middle-class gay men, and the goals and rhetoric of these organizations reflected the interests of these specific groups. Because recruitment efforts depended heavily on social networks, membership in these organizations would remain lopsided in favor of men, and women in these spaces sometimes faced misogynistic views and behaviors. Furthermore, many lesbian activists identified more strongly with feminist and women's liberation movements in the 1970s.
> 
> That said, several cultural tendencies brought these groups together. Before the HIV/AIDS crisis of the 1980s, many feminist movements were already skeptical of the health care industry's ability to recognize and fulfill their health needs. Therefore, they easily found common cause with the HIV/AIDS treatment activism that took root in the gay movements of the 1980s.

##### 2) The Modern Self Shaped Transgender Identity

**Trueman asserts that transgender identities are the product of modern selfhood.** To claim that someone's real gender is the opposite of their biological sex, the internal, feeling self must take priority over external conditions.

Furthermore, a sense of oppression from persecution fundamentally shapes trans identity. Recall that the modern self places authenticity in opposition to culture. Therefore, those who advocate traditional gender identities can be cast as antagonists to authentic selfhood. And because Freudian Marxists defined oppression as psychological, those who reject transgender identities are now widely seen as "oppressors." Thus, the widespread acceptance of transgender identities in the context of modern selfhood directly leads to the moral stigmatization of traditional Christians.

(Shortform note: While Trueman asserts that transgender identity is an assertion of individual preferences over biology, this picture is complicated by debates over the origins of transgender identity. Scientific research has gathered some evidence that genetics may play a role in being transgender. This has led some researchers to argue that transgender identity has a biological basis. However, these claims are controversial, especially among advocates for transgender acceptance. Some argue that claiming a biological basis for transgender identity would give medical institutions the gatekeeping power to determine who is "really" transgender, and could exclude those who identify as nonbinary.)

##### 3) The Modern Self Redefined Marriage

Lastly, **Trueman maintains that a redefinition of marriage is an inevitable outcome of the modern conception of selfhood.** He makes this case by contrasting traditional Christian marriage with the modern view of marriage.

Traditional Christian marriage fulfills the sacred purpose of creating children and a stable home for them. The modern conception of marriage makes marriage about the emotional fulfillment of the partners getting married. Trueman pushes back on defenders who claim that this is merely an expansion of traditional marriage. Instead, Trueman considers this a _destruction of traditional marriage_ , because this detaches marriage from the sacred moral framework and places it in the framework of the modern, feeling self.

(Shortform note: Though the traditional moral framework of Christian marriage is becoming less popular, it _does_ still divide LGBTQ+ activists on whether they want to participate in the institution of marriage at all. Some argue that marriage has historically oppressed women, both through cultural expectations that they obey their husbands and through legal doctrines that forbid married women from owning their own property. Thus, they reject marriage entirely as a corrupt institution. On the other hand, other LGBTQ+ activists hold that by abstaining from the cultural and legal protections of marriage, same-sex couples become relegated to a status of second-class citizens compared to heterosexual couples.)

### Part 4: Guidelines for Christians Today

Trueman states that his goal is primarily to provide a history of the gradual transformation into modern selfhood rather than a set of guidelines for the present. However, he still offers four recommendations for modern Christians seeking to preserve traditional values.

**1\. Find inspiration in the second-century Christian church.** At this time, Christians were a religious minority living in a powerful empire where Roman authorities viewed Christians with moral suspicion. Nonetheless, Christians thrived as a small community of firm believers who adhered to their religious laws.

(Shortform note: Drawing inspiration from this period provides a challenge in that historical records are scarce. However, one surviving document, the Epistle to Diognetus, paints an instructive picture of early Christian life. It explains that Christians were not recognized by typical markings of a cultural group (such as common dress), but assimilated to the laws and customs of their local cultures. However, they quietly followed their own religious doctrines, such as monogamous marriage and not exposing children (a Roman practice of leaving unwanted children to die in the elements). Christians lived in their societies as if simply "passing through.")

**2.** **Prioritize moral laws over aesthetics.** Trueman contends that many modern Christians have adopted the modern preoccupation with image and aesthetics to attract followers. Trueman considers this too close to the Romantic poets, who prioritized aesthetics over moral law.

(Shortform note: In calling on Christians to prioritize moral laws over aesthetics, Trueman stakes out a position on a longstanding debate in Christianity. During the Reformation, Protestants condemned the use of statues, paintings, and ornamental architecture in Christian worship, considering these superstitious and idolatrous. In response, the Roman Catholic church began investing more heavily in Christian artwork to differentiate themselves and argue against Protestantism.This debate echoed earlier controversies over iconoclasm and the role of art in Christian worship going all the way back to the Byzantine Empire.)

**3\. Create a strong community.** Trueman explains that religions flourish when their members form strong communities. He recommends cultivating stronger ties among religious believers to help Christianity flourish.

(Shortform note: Researchers have found that membership in religious communities correlates to higher levels of happiness, health, and civic engagement. This suggests that not only are communities conducive to continuing religious values and beliefs (as Trueman suggests), but that community and belonging are some of the most important things religions offer their followers.)

**4.** **Recognize the importance of the physical body.** Trueman asserts that Christianity cannot allow itself to become detached from the truth that humans were created in God's image and that Christian commitments require full recognition of the human body's importance to creation.

(Shortform note: Christian doctrines on the body vary by denomination. However, many highlight a core teaching from the apostle Paul in the book of First Corinthians: "Your body is a temple... You are not your own; you were bought for a price." This suggests an obligation to care for your body because you’re your body's steward, not its owner.)
