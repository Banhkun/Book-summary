## Exercise: Reflect on the Ideas of The Rise and Triumph of The Modern Self

This exercise will give you a chance to reflect on the arguments, analysis, and ideas that Trueman presents in _The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self_.

* * *

Trueman identifies three major developments in _The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self_ : promoting the interior self, undermining the traditional view of human nature, and sexualizing selfhood. Of these three, which do you think played the greatest role in shaping contemporary culture and why?

Trueman presents two conflicting ideas of selfhood. The traditional self is determined by its social context, inherited values, universal human nature, and divinely appointed purpose. The modern self is determined by the individual, found in interior emotions, free from traditional restrictions, and highly sexual. Which view of selfhood do you identify with more, and why?

Trueman views a permissive attitude toward sexuality as undermining Christian morality and being destructive for society as a whole. Do you agree with these positions? Why or why not?
