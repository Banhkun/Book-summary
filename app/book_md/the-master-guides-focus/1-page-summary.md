## 1-Page Summary

Do you often feel that there isn’t enough time to finish all the projects you’d like to get done? Does it seem that when you try to concentrate on a task, your attention gets pulled in a thousand directions? Do you often feel like there are so many things on your to-do list that you never have any energy left for the things that matter to you most? Rather than blame the outside world for chipping away at your energy and time, it may be more productive and fulfilling to **improve your ability to focus.**

Many authors have tackled this subject, from psychologists to productivity experts, business consultants, and tech industry gurus. Their consensus is that the ability to focus—to concentrate your attention on an individual task for a sustained period of time—is key to personal success and fulfillment, not just in your career but also in your personal life. They also agree that it doesn’t come naturally. **Focus is a skill you have to learn through practice, deliberate repetition, and strategies to minimize the constant distractions of the modern world.**

In Shortform's Master Guide, we’ll examine and compare what leading experts such as Daniel Goleman, Cal Newport, Stephen Covey, and others have to say about the power and practice of harnessing your attention. We’ll explain their basic definitions of focus, as well as its antitheses: _distraction_. Finally, we’ll describe how to develop a plan to improve your ability to focus, then break down the practical steps to putting your plan into action.

### What Is Focus?

In general, psychologists and productivity experts agree that “focus” is the ability to direct your attention to a single task and maintain it without distraction. In this opening section, we’ll look at:

  * Different authors’ approaches to thinking about focus 
  * The benefits of improving your ability to focus
  * Why focus is preferable to splitting your attention



#### How Experts Think About Focus

**Concept #1: Focus is _selective attention_.** In his book _Focus_ , psychologist Daniel Goleman highlights two mental states, _open awareness and selective attention_. _Open awareness****_ is a state of fluid, passive attention where you’re not focusing on one specific task. _Selective attention****_ is a type of effortful focus you use to filter through the flood of sensory stimuli and narrow your attention to what is relevant. As the name suggests, **selective attention helps your brain select what is relevant and choose where you direct your attention.** Later in this guide, we’ll discuss ways to improve your selective attention.

**Concept #2: Focus is _deep work_. **Computer science professor Cal Newport discusses focus in _Deep Work_ , which he defines as focused, uninterrupted, _undistracted_ work on a task that pushes your cognitive abilities to their limit. Newport explains that skills you need to succeed in the modern economy—like complex problem-solving, data analysis, and computer programming—require deep work to learn and execute. Your ability to do deep work will determine how much you thrive in the information economy, and in this guide we’ll explore several ways to set the stage for doing deep work in your daily life.

**Concept #3: Focus is _singular_.** In _Eat That Frog!_ , business consultant Brian Tracy argues that there’s no such thing as multitasking—you can only focus on one thing at a time. What seems like multitasking is actually “task shifting,” or switching your attention between different things. After being interrupted, it takes 17 minutes to totally refocus on a task and continue. Starting and stopping repeatedly can increase the time needed to complete a task by 500%. In contrast, **when you work without interruption, you can cut the time required to finish by half**.

> **The State of Flow**
> 
> A heightened state of attention and complete focus, commonly referred to as “flow,” was first identified by psychologist Mihali Csikszentmihalyi. When you’re in flow, he discovered,**you become engrossed in an activity, lose track of time, and lose yourself in the process, not pursuing any rewards at the end.** Csikszentmihalyi’s research determined several features of flow: 1) To get into flow, you need to devote yourself to only one task. 2) The task must be intrinsically motivating. 3) The task must be just right—not too easy and not too hard. If it’s too easy, your brain won’t devote all its power to the task. If it’s too hard, you’ll become discouraged, which will prevent you from reaching a flow state.

#### Why Do We Get Distracted?

The enemy of focusing your attention is distraction. Daniel Goleman outlines two main types of distractions: **emotional** , in which feelings take center stage and interrupt our attention, and **sensory** , in which a physical sensation such as pain or a loud noise commands our attention. Modern technology, especially our personal devices, is a relentless source of sensory distraction and can lead to addictive relationships with digital media. Whether the distraction is emotional or sensory, avoiding distraction and maintaining your focus requires a deliberate, conscious act of will.

Whereas experts generally agree on the nature of our ability to focus, there’s debate about what takes our focus away:

**Theory #1:** In _Stolen Focus_ , Johann Hari makes the case that in the digital age, we’re being distracted on purpose. **Tech companies carefully engineer their products to keep your attention for as long as possible,** because the longer your eyeballs are glued to the screen—where advertisements are placed strategically among your friend’s cat videos—the higher the companies’ revenues.**** If your goal is to focus on your screen, tech is your friend; if your goal is to focus on anything else, tech is your enemy.

**Theory #2:** In _Indistractable_ , Nir Eyal provides a different take on distraction—he argues that distressing internal emotional and sensory experiences are the reason why you become distracted. External distractions, such as digital technology, are essentially avenues we _use to escape_ internal physical and emotional discomfort. Without internal triggers, your attention wouldn’t be driven to escape into social media or binge-watching television.

In order to improve your focus, you’ll have to take measures to reduce your distractions, as we’ll cover in upcoming sections.

### How to Focus and Avoid Distractions

Now that we’ve defined focus and distraction, how do you go about sharpening your focus and minimizing distractions?

#### Step 1: Make a Plan

The experts agree that the most essential step is to choose _where_ to focus your attention. But with so many options, how do you decide what to focus on?

**Tip #1: Select one priority per day.** In _Make Time_ , Knapp and Zeratsky suggest that the most important step to being proactive with your attention is to **choose one task to focus on each day**. This won’t be the only thing you do, but it’s the one thing you’ll prioritize over everything else. It might be a project you’ve been putting off at work, or it might be something you’ve always meant to do in your free time. Whatever you choose, it’s the thing you’ll look back on with a feeling of satisfaction, or even joy, at having accomplished.**But be flexible.** Where you focus your attention doesn’t need to be set in stone; you can change it at any point throughout the day.

**Tip #2: List the steps for reaching your goal.** Tracy says that the best way to overcome distraction and make a big job doable is by****breaking it into smaller steps and focusing on one step at a time.**** A list gives you a visual representation of the process for achieving your goal, increasing the chances you’ll achieve it on schedule. Prioritize your tasks, and list things in the order they need to be done. You may want to depict your plan with boxes, circles, and arrows to help show the relationships between tasks. With a written goal and a plan, you’ll be far more productive than if you had only a mental list.

**Tip #3: Ask the Focusing Question.** Gary Keller, author of _The One Thing_ , says that to determine where you should direct your time and energy, ask the Focusing Question:**“What’s the one thing I can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?”** You can apply it to every area of your life—spiritual, health, personal, relationships, job, and finances—to ensure that you’re doing what matters most.

**Tip #4: Don’t confuse “important” with “urgent.”** Stephen Covey’s method of directing your focus, as spelled out in _First Things First_ , emphasizes important tasks, rather than those that are merely urgent. To illustrate this idea, all your daily, weekly, and monthly activities fall into one of the following four categories:

| **Urgent** | **Not Urgent**  
---|---|---  
**Important** | Quadrant I  Urgent and Important  | Quadrant II  Not Urgent, but Important   
**Not Important** | Quadrant III  Urgent, but Not Important  | Quadrant IV  Neither Urgent nor Important   
  
**Quadrant I** is both urgent and important. This quadrant contains emergencies and problems that require your immediate attention. This can include health emergencies, a work deadline, or a broken-down car. **Quadrant II** is important, but not urgent. This is where you do prevention, maintenance, long-term planning, relationship-building, and personal leadership activities like evaluating your thought patterns and assessing progress toward goals. For the highest quality of life, Quadrant II is where you should spend most of your time.

**Tip 5#: Align your priorities with your values.** In _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown suggests stopping regularly to ask yourself, “Am I spending my time and resources on the right things?” Invest your time and energy only in what’s essential in order to make your optimum contribution to activities and projects that really matter. Improving your focus doesn’t help in the long run if you spend your time focusing on the wrong things.

To be clear, what you choose to focus on doesn’t necessarily have to be related to your job. Knapp and Zeratsky argue that it might be more important to focus on a project at home, something to benefit your family, or something done for pleasure or growth. The importance of choosing where you focus your attention is that it lets you set your own priorities instead of responding to external demands.

#### Step 2: Set the Stage

Because distraction is the enemy of focus and many triggers of distraction come from your environment, it’s essential to take control of your environment. Consider these tips from the experts.

**Tip #1: Optimize your physical space.** Tracy recommends that you make sure you have everything you’ll need in front of you before you begin, so you’re not distracted by looking for things later. Clear your desk by setting aside unrelated work so you have only one task in front of you. Assemble all the documents and materials you’ll need and keep them within easy reach. Ensure that your work area is comfortable and as distraction-free as possible. The cleaner and more organized it is, the easier it will be to get started and work efficiently.

**Tip #2: Take advantage of daily rhythms and routines.** In _Hyperfocus_ , Chris Bailey recommends that you choose when to focus based on your schedule, your energy levels, and your tasks. Attention requires both time and energy, so schedule your focus sessions when you have both available. Knapp and Zeratsky also emphasize the importance of determining whether you function better in the morning, afternoon, or evening. For some people, the early morning is when they’re able to concentrate best. For others, late at night is the only time when they’re able to eliminate distractions.

McKeown suggests that after identifying the best time of day to focus, make your daily plan a routine.**** Establishing a routine is a powerful technique for accomplishing essential tasks because **when you follow a routine, you free up mental space**. With a routine, you can act automatically without expending energy figuring out what’s next or fighting the pull of nonessential distractions.

**Tip #3: Make commitments to yourself.** Eyal suggests making _precommitments_ as a way to minimize the power of distraction. He defines “precommitments” as choices you make while in an undistracted state that will help guide your behaviors when you’re tempted by distraction. Some precommitments make it more difficult to do something _undesirable_. This extra bit of difficulty gives you a moment to pause and stop yourself from becoming distracted. Some precommitments use money as an incentive, while others align your behaviors with the identity you want to have—such as that of a person who finishes what they start.

#### Step 3: Create a Schedule

The most basic tool for sticking to a routine is a daily schedule. If used effectively, a schedule can help you prioritize and focus on everything that’s important in your life, not just your duties at work. Productivity experts agree on the benefits of using a schedule to your advantage and offer various strategies as well as ways to use your schedule to make space for your personal life.

**Tip #1: Plan out everything that you need to do throughout the day.** Newport points out that when you set specific goals by planning out what you’ll work on in advance, you’re less likely to switch to other tasks. He recommends breaking your tasks into half-hour blocks, making sure to schedule buffers to handle emergencies or tasks that run over their allotted time.

**Tip #2: Block off time to focus, and protect it.** Knapp and Zeratsky point out that you’re not the only one with the power to schedule your time. Your supervisors, colleagues, customers, family, and friends will frequently make demands on your schedule. Therefore, when organizing your day, the first thing you must do is****block off time to focus on your most important task.**** If your calendar can be viewed by others at your workplace, this lets them know that you’ve set aside time for your specific project.

**Be firm with the time you’ve set aside for yourself,** but also make sure that you use that time constructively. Tracy recommends that you treat it like an appointment, and keep it. Also, your blocked-off time doesn’t have to happen at the office. Some people find it’s productive to get up early and work for several hours at home, where there are fewer interruptions. Mapping out your time in a planner helps you build your time around getting your most important tasks done without interruption.

> **Tools for Managing Your Focus Time**
> 
> Eyal offers Timeboxing as a way of organizing your calendar by dedicating blocks of time to specific activities. For example, you might timebox “read to kids” or “go through emails.” Timeboxing helps you balance your responsibilities and stick to what you’re meant to be doing. You decide what you'll do and when you’ll do it. This can stop small, easy tasks from distracting you, because you know they’ll get done at another time.
> 
> When working with smaller increments of time, Knapp and Zeratsky suggest you use a timer as a cue to stay focused on your task. This is known as the Pomodoro Technique, invented by Francesco Cirillo. Using a tomato-shaped kitchen timer—“pomodoro” is Italian for “tomato”—Cirillo would work for 25 minutes before stopping abruptly for a five-minute break. It’s been shown that a regular, brief break from work can help to maintain long-term attention.

**Tip #3: Include personal time in your schedule.** In addition to blocking off time for work, Eyal argues that you should schedule regular time with your children, your partner, and your friends. In _Indistractable_ , he says that this time is a commitment, not something that can be pushed aside for another activity or interrupted by your email or social media. Without maintenance, your relationships easily dissipate, and so **your plans with friends and family need to be _regular, set events_ in your schedule, not items on a to-do list.**

#### Step 4: Disconnect Digitally

Digital technology clamoring for your attention can interrupt your schedule. To truly focus, you have to learn to control your relationship with technology so that it doesn’t control you. Manage your technology use with the following tips.

**Tip #1: Turn off your email.** Tracy insists that just because someone sends you an email doesn’t mean you owe them your time. As many as **80% of the emails you receive aren’t important,** and most of those remaining can probably be put off. Only around 5% require an immediate response. Newport goes into more explicit detail about how to curb email use. He suggests ways to compose your messages so that they include all the necessary details and don’t result in an email back-and-forth. He also recommends giving yourself the freedom to ignore any communication that isn’t essential.

**Tip #2: Turn off the internet.** Newport says to _schedule in advance_ when you’ll use the internet**** and avoid it completely outside those times.**** Keep a notepad nearby where you record any ideas you need to revisit once you’re online again. If you get stuck by not being able to access the internet, then move on to another task. Knapp and Zeratsky make a similar suggestion: If you often feel distracted by questions you would normally look up on the internet, keep a notebook to write those questions down and look up the answers later.

**Tip #3: Turn off your smartphone.** As tech industry insiders, Knapp and Zeratsky proclaim that the single most pernicious device that impinges on your ability to focus is your smartphone. They recommend deleting all social media apps, games, and even your email from your phone. If that’s too extreme, they suggest you turn off all notifications and remove the apps from your homescreen, forcing you to _choose_ when to use each app. Finally, you can leave your phone at home, in another room, or even in a locker if one’s available. In other words, **turn your phone into a tool that serves _you_ , and not the other way around.**

#### Step 5: Take Breaks

Even if you eliminate all sources of distraction, it’s still impossible to focus _all the time_.__ Take time to recharge, but do so in a productive way that lets you quickly refocus your attention. Fatigue is real, so be kind to yourself when your focus wanes and consider using mindfulness practices to restore yourself.

**Tip #1: Beware of attention fatigue.** Goleman explains that attention fatigue occurs when our brains are exposed to a prolonged or demanding task that requires sustained concentration. Once attention fatigue sets in, it becomes more difficult to maintain focus on a task and to process information effectively. Your attention might need restoration if you notice a decrease in your ability to complete tasks effectively and comprehend what you're learning, an increase in how distractable you are, or an increase in feelings of irritability and impatience.

**Tip #2: Practice self-compassion.** Psychologist Kelly McGonigal believes that instead of beating ourselves up when we experience decreased focus, we should forgive ourselves. In _The Willpower Instinct_ , she says that encouraging words like "don't be so hard on yourself" can stop distraction before it starts.

In _Procrastination_ , Jane Burka and Lenora Yuen concur that self-compassion is a powerful tool. If the step toward your goal that you’re focusing on is more challenging than expected and you find yourself becoming distracted, don’t take it as a sign that you’re inadequate. Instead, take a short break. Knapp and Zeratsky agree that you shouldn’t feel bad about getting stuck, but they encourage you not to give in to distraction. **Sometimes it’s better to wait out your mental blocks and keep your mind in the zone.**

**Tip #3: Refocus by meditating.** A time-tested method of improving your focus while resting is to practice mindfulness meditation. Goleman writes that mindfulness develops the capacity of your selective attention, which helps you monitor your own thoughts and get back on task. McGonigal agrees, saying that **even a five-minute daily practice of focusing on your breathing and quieting your mind can increase your impulse control.** The goal isn’t to eliminate distracting thoughts; the goal is to keep your thoughts from ruling you. The practice involves the simple act of bringing your wandering thoughts back to focus on your breathing.

#### Step 6: Reward Yourself

The most difficult part of increasing your ability to focus is maintaining your efforts over long periods of time. Here’s how to be consistent.

**Tip #1: Use rewards to train yourself.** Burka and Yuen insist on the importance of rewarding yourself when you complete activities you’ve been focused on. They explain that **rewards release the chemical dopamine, which increases pleasure.** Your brain associates this pleasure with the behavior that created it, strengthening the neural pathways linking your work to good feelings. As a result, your brain will encourage you to return time and again to the activity on which you’ve been trying to focus.

**Tip #2: Spend time in nature in order to recharge.** One reward that several authors suggest is to take a walk through a place where you’re surrounded by trees. Knapp and Zeratsky say that if you can’t get out into nature, at least make time for a walk in a park or a tree-shaded street. Any exposure to nature at all has been shown to alleviate stress. Goleman adds that immersing yourself in nature, even for a short time, is a powerful and simple way to enter states of restful open awareness.

**Tip #3: Relax actively, not passively.** Goleman recommends getting fully lost in pleasurable activities, as these focus your attention in a relaxed manner and engage all of your senses. Cooking, martial arts, and dancing could be such activities. In _Digital Minimalism_ , Newport argues that **demanding activities are more rewarding than passive ones.** Dedicating your leisure time to activities such as exercise or creative hobbies energizes you more than idly passing the time. When you learn a new skill or finish a task, it leaves you feeling uniquely proud and accomplished. The more energy you invest in your leisure, the more value you’ll gain.

#### Step 7: Reflect and Refine

Given the various approaches to focus described by the experts, you’ll have to engage in personal reflection and a little trial-and-error to see what works for you. This will involve developing an understanding of how you make use of your time, how you deal with unexpected disruptions, and what changes you need to make to your process in order to best direct your energy and attention.

**Tip #1: Fine-tune your time management.** If you schedule time to focus on different tasks, Newport suggests reviewing the accuracy of your time blocks at the end of each day. In _Deep Work_ , he says this will help you set more accurate goals and expectations in the future.

In _Procrastination_ , Burka and Yuen argue that **you can build your capacity to work within time’s constraints by developing a realistic sense of how time flows.** One strategy for this is estimating tasks’ duration.**** Before you begin a task, predict how long it will take you. After you’re done, reflect on the difference between your prediction and reality. This exercise will develop your ability to set realistic expectations for how long a task will take.

**Tip #2: Assess how well you maintain your focus.** As you move through your week, you’ll face unexpected changes in your schedule and will need to make decisions about how to proceed. Covey advises that at the end of each week, stop and consider how the week went. Did you face challenges? How did you handle spur-of-the-moment decisions? Did you successfully stay focused on your goals, and were your expectations realistic? Keeping a daily log of your progress, as Knapp and Zeratsky suggest, will also give you a clearer picture of any adjustments to make in the future. Record whether you maintained your focus, which tactics you employed, and how you might tweak them to your advantage.

By trying what works and what doesn’t _for you personally_ , you can incrementally rearrange your life in a way that will be transformative over time.
