## Exercise: Start to Improve Your Focus

Authors on the subject of focus and attention agree that you should focus on one thing at a time, use your schedule to your advantage, and eliminate as many distractions as you can. Consider how you can apply these principles in your daily life.

* * *

What overarching project or ambition do you wish you could devote more time and energy to? Does it revolve around your career, your family, or a personal goal? How much time each day would you have to devote in order to achieve it?

If you had complete control over your schedule, when would you focus on this one, special project? Is there a way to tweak your current schedule to open up a window in which to focus on your goal? If so, how?

What is the primary distraction that interrupts your daily activities? During the time in which you focus on your goal, what would be the most effective way to eliminate that distraction?
