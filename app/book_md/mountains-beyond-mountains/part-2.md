## Part 2: Farmer at Work in Haiti

In 2000, Kidder visited Farmer in Haiti to observe the area and his hospital first-hand.

### Péligre Dam

Farmer worked in an area of Haiti where the local farmers had lost farmland due to the construction of a hydroelectric dam, the Péligre Dam. It holds back the waters of Haiti’s largest river, the Artibonite River.

**The US Army Corps of Engineers built the dam in the 1950s to provide water to agricultural businesses downstream—which were owned by the US at the time—as well as electricity to affluent Haitians and foreign-owned factories operating in the capital of Port-au-Prince.**

Before the dam, people lived along the river, which had some of the best farmland in the region. They produced enough to feed their families, and then some. Once the dam was built, they were forced to relocate their farms up the steep mountainsides, where farmland was much less productive and more prone to erosion.

### Zanmi Lasante Hospital

Farmer’s hospital was called Zanmi Lasante, which means “Partners in Health” in Creole. It served a great need for medical care in the local area. Though there were other hospitals and clinics, many required patients to pay more than they could afford for treatment, including for the medical equipment used to treat them, like gloves. And many local hospitals and clinics lacked basic sanitation.

In contrast, though the staff at Zanmi Lasante sometimes made mistakes or botched lab testing, they were able to offer more affordable services. **Farmer insisted that the hospital treat nearly everyone, regardless of their ability to pay.**

Some of Farmer’s accomplishments included:

  * Serving one million people in the local area, including with a staff of community health workers who treated people with tuberculosis in their homes for a fraction of the cost of treatment in the US
  * Reducing transmission of HIV from mothers to babies
  * Funding construction of sanitary water systems and schools



#### Finances

Farmer funded the hospital through a nonprofit organization by the same name: Partners in Health. He earned money from his job at the hospital in Boston—$125,000 per year—as well as from giving lectures and writing books. Whatever money he didn’t need to pay his bills went into funding Partners in Health.

The foundation got most of its funding from grants, including a $220,000 MacArthur Genius Grant, and one generous donor from the Boston area.

**In 1999, Zanmi Lasante spent $1.5 million on treating patients, on-site and in their homes.** In contrast, the author’s local hospital in the US treated roughly the same number of patients, but had an annual budget of $60 million and only treated patients on-site, not in their homes.

### Farmer’s Daily Routine

Each day, Farmer spent the first hour of his time at the hospital simply crossing the courtyard in front of the hospital complex. Hundreds of people gathered each morning seeking treatment, and Farmer took time to interact with anyone that approached him as he crossed. In addition to asking for treatment, people asked Farmer for favors like giving them money or sending a letter to the US on their behalf.

While Farmer crossed, he worked to spot patients that needed immediate medical attention, like a woman with gangrene in her hand. After reaching the building, he’d spend time answering emails in his office, then he’d see patients.

Patients came in with a variety of ailments, from a woman suffering from drug-resistant tuberculosis who needed pain medication, to a man who needed nutritional supplements to fight hunger.

### The Role of Sorcery

In rural Haiti, practitioners of most religions, including Voodooists, Catholics, and Protestants, all tended to believe that illness was caused by sorcery, or magic spells sent by enemies. Sorcery offered a method to explain the world.

Sometimes, due to scarce economic resources, people accused one another of sorcery—they were jealous of what others had that they didn’t. In one case, For example, one woman was convinced that her son had sent an evil spell that resulted in the death of her other son. The accused son lived in a more modern dwelling than his mother. By accusing him of sorcery, she was saying that he didn’t care for her and this was the reason he had sent the spell to kill her other son.

**Farmer had to explain to her that sorcery had not been the cause, but he didn’t attempt to explain that sorcery didn’t exist.** He generally believed he’d be able to treat more people if he showed respect for their culture. It took many meetings, but eventually, Farmer helped the mother and son heal their relationship.

From Farmer’s perspective, it made sense that, due to the general lack of knowledge and access to medicine, people would continue to believe in sorcery, a relic of French colonial history. Yet with exposure, most people accepted both modern medicine and sorcery. Some people thought of Farmer’s role in the community as similar to that of a Voodoo priest—he knew how to heal people. Actual Voodoo priests also believed in Farmer’s healing abilities and brought ill patients to his hospital for treatment.

#### Sorcery and Tuberculosis Study

When a tuberculosis patient died under the care of Zanmi Lasante, Farmer wanted to investigate why. At the time of the death, Farmer had been in the US, recovering from a broken leg. **He became determined to ensure that tuberculosis patients had a chance to survive even if he wasn’t at the hospital.**

He hired the deceased woman’s family as health workers, and along with the other health workers at his clinic, asked them to discuss how the clinic’s treatment of tuberculosis patients fell short. They came up with two primary explanations, but both of them blamed patients and their circumstances:

  * Malnutrition made patients less likely to survive the disease.
  * If a patient thought that tuberculosis was caused by sorcery rather than a microbe, they might stop taking the medicine when they started to show signs of improvement, before they were disease-free. 



Farmer designed a study to test these ideas. Two groups of tuberculosis patients received free treatment for TB, but the second group got extra perks, like visits from the community health workers and money to pay for childcare, food, and transportation. Farmer interviewed each study participant, asking them if they believed that sorcery caused tuberculosis. Most did.

**In the group that got free medicine, but no money, only 48 percent made a complete recovery, whereas everyone in the group that got money made a complete recovery.** This suggested that beliefs in sorcery mattered little in recovery. On the other hand, some extra money for expenses could make a big difference. Farmer started giving all tuberculosis patients monthly stipends they could use toward food and other goods. After that, he didn’t lose a tuberculosis patient in Haiti for 12 years.

### The House Visit

To ensure the effectiveness of tuberculosis treatment, all patients had to agree to take their prescribed antibiotics. One time, a TB patient missed his monthly appointment, and someone needed to go check on him to ensure he was still taking his medicine. Farmer decided to do it himself.

He had to hike 3 hours on mountain trails to get to the patient’s home. It demonstrated the lengths Farmer would go to serve his patients—traversing mountains beyond mountains.

Once there, Farmer asked the patient why he had missed his appointment. It turned out that there had been a mix-up and he hadn’t received his monthly cash. However, he had continued to take his medicine, so he was considered in compliance with the program.

#### Sustainable Approach to Medicine?

Farmer believed that poor patients should receive the treatment they need to thrive, even if it requires more effort from health care professionals. As with the patient who missed his doctor’s visit, this could include house visits or giving patients goods or money for food and services.

**But he worried that most doctors weren’t willing to dedicate themselves to this kind of immersive medicine.** They might work for a few years in a country like Haiti, but return to their home countries later to work in hospitals with better pay and more cushy living.

Instead, Farmer wanted to inspire young doctors to dig into the immersive approach, dedicating themselves to treating the world’s poor and vulnerable for life.
