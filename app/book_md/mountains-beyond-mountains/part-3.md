## Part 3: Farmer’s Early Life, Education, and Initial Time in Haiti

Farmer’s early life greatly shaped his later life and career as a doctor. He grew up as one of six siblings. His family moved from Massachusetts, to Alabama, to Florida. His father worked as a salesman, and later as a teacher, while his mother held sales jobs.

Farmer’s family lived in humble quarters, such as a bus in a trailer park and a sailboat, for most of his childhood. **The unconventional close quarters helped Farmer develop the ability to work and sleep anywhere.**

Farmer was a bright child and was enrolled in his school’s gifted and talented program. He relished reading books like _Lord of the Rings_ and started his own herpetology club. In high school, he was popular with young women, which his mother said was because he was a good listener.

### College

Farmer accepted a full scholarship to Duke University. His first semester, he was extremely busy taking in the college experience. It was his first exposure to wealth, as many of the students there came from wealthy families, and he had access to the theater and other cultural experiences he hadn’t before. He became a critic for the school paper and experienced high culture for the first time. He also joined a fraternity, but he left because it didn’t accept Black men.

Ultimately, Farmer realized that he was more drawn to the values he grew up with, such as helping the underdog and the truly poor, than he was to wealth. **He had been raised Catholic, and in college, he was exposed to liberation theology, a branch of Catholicism that advocates helping the poor first and foremost.**

Farmer observed the farmworkers employed near Duke, many of whom were Haitian and lived in conditions far worse than he had grown up with. He grew fascinated with Haiti and strove to learn all he could. He suspected that Haiti’s long history of being ruled by colonial or imperial interests had hurt its people.

Farmer volunteered at Duke’s Hospital and decided to apply to schools where he could earn a dual degree in medicine and anthropology. He also decided to go to Haiti before starting medical school. He reasoned that spending a year there doing anthropological and medical work would help him decide whether he liked that path.

### Anthropology, Medicine, and Politics

He arrived in Haiti in 1983 and began interviewing people from many walks of life to understand their life circumstances and politics. . He also observed Voodoo rituals, traveled to different towns, and volunteered in hospitals.

While traveling, he came across a woman who was killed when her mango cart overturned. **Farmer felt that to understand incidents like this one—a poor woman going to the market with an overloaded cart to sell food to feed her family—you have to understand how culture, history, and politics have shaped the incident.**

In the case of Haiti, France—Haiti’s former colonial ruler—and later, the US, had done little to help the Haitian people and were more interested in supporting leaders that helped them preserve their own wealth.

By the 1980s, Haiti had been under the rule of the Duvalier dictatorship for decades, a dictatorship that was propped up by the US and did little to fund road improvements or social services that would support regular people like the deceased woman. **Farmer theorized that this incident stood as an example of how elite western powers have worked to create a world that serves their interests at the expense of others’.**

From the perspective of Haitians, God provided for them, but the actions of their leaders and colonial governments had unfairly stripped them of resources.

### From Anthropology to Medicine

Farmer realized that he had a fundamental conflict with only practicing anthropology in Haiti, as he’d been doing. Anthropologists generally observe people without attempting to help them or improve their lives. From Farmer’s perspective, this made little sense when there were practical health services that could greatly improve people’s quality of life.

At the same time, he recognized that anthropology was useful for understanding people’s culture and informing approaches to medical treatment. For example, a doctor who understands the local culture can cultivate good relationships with Voodoo priests and partner with them to help people in need, whereas a doctor without this training might sour relationships with local religious leaders by being insensitive to their beliefs.

**Farmer didn’t anticipate being able to ignore the suffering he saw in Haiti and resume a normal life back in the states.** So, while he decided to go to medical school at Harvard University, his goal was to provide health services where they were most needed in Haiti. He’d also be able to earn a Ph.D. in anthropology at Harvard, and he’d use this training to better understand historical, cultural, and political impacts on health.

During his years at Harvard, Farmer traveled back and forth between the US and Haiti. He selected a town in Haiti’s central plateau called Cange to set up his own hospital. He had visited the region and been shocked at how miserable the local people had seemed. There were no medical services being provided in the area and many people were obviously dealing with pressing physical ailments.

First, he wanted to understand what people’s health needs were. He hired five local people and conducted a census of the households in town. The surveyors asked about the number of people living in a household, if there were recent deaths, and reasons for death.

**Farmer learned that there was a high infant and maternal mortality rate.** One reason for the infant death rate was exposure to stagnant water from the local reservoir. People had to hike down 800 feet to the reservoir to get water in buckets. They’d then leave it out uncovered for days before using it, which gave them diarrhea.

A group of Haitian and American engineers devised a system to transport water from the river that fed the reservoir up the side of the mountain where people could access it when needed through spigots. Once the system was in place, the infant death rate decreased.

This was just the start of Farmer’s reforms in the area. Farmer envisioned a multi-level health system for Cange and the villages surrounding it:

  1. Preventative services: clean drinking water, sanitation, vaccines, and women’s health services
  2. A network of locals who could teach people about health practices and identify illnesses, particularly severe ones like tuberculosis.



For any ailments not addressed at these levels, people could seek treatment at his clinic in Cange, and Farmer planned to build his hospital next door.

Farmer’s thesis for medical school used evidence to show that AIDS had been brought to Haiti by sex tourists, rather than Haitians having brought it to the US, as was popularly believed in the US. He received his Ph.D. in Anthropology and his medical degree in 1990.

### Political Upheaval in Haiti

When the Duvalier dictatorship ended in 1986, and the Haitian Army took power, Haitians began questioning the role of their government. People had hoped that things would change with the end of the dictatorship, but instead, things seemed to stay exactly the same. They started staging demonstrations and were met with harsh crackdowns from the military, who shot demonstrators, hospital patients, and people waiting to vote.

Most demonstrations happened close to the capital, but people in rural areas started to ask questions, too. **For example, people started to recognize that sickness stemming from dirty water had just as much to do with the government refusing to spend money to build clean drinking water infrastructure as it did with pathogens.**

In the late 80s, Farmer befriended a Catholic priest who was a leader of liberation theology in Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Farmer attended Aristide’s church in Port-au-Prince after hearing him preach on the radio. Aristide advocated against oppression and for the betterment of the poor, which resonated throughout Haiti. People wanted Aristide to run for president, and he did.

At first, Farmer felt that Haitian politics was so corrupt, that there was no point. But people were genuinely excited about Aristide running, and Farmer soon thought it was a real chance to reform Haiti. But Farmer’s support came at a cost: He started getting threatening phone calls to Zanmi Lasante’s office in Port-au-Prince where he sometimes worked, possibly because he had been seen spending so much time with Aristide.

**In a 1990 election, Aristide won with 67 percent of the vote and partnered with Zanmi Lasante on AIDS prevention programs. But in September 1991, while Farmer was in Miami traveling to Haiti, he learned that the Haitian army had taken Aristide out of power.**

Because Farmer was a known supporter of Aristide, the Haitian government blacklisted him, barring him from entering the country. A Haitian priest whom he had partnered with in Cange bribed officials to take Farmer’s name off the list, and he returned to Haiti early 1992.

#### Military Violence

With Aristide out of power, the Haitian army resumed making life difficult for the Haitian people, particularly Aristide’s supporters. **Farmer treated one local man who was beaten after commenting on the poor condition of the highway on the way to his village.** His injuries were so bad that he likely wouldn’t have survived even if he’d been treated in a top US hospital. He died soon after.

Farmer shared the story with Amnesty International, and the _Boston Globe_ published it under someone else’s name, with the victim’s name anonymized. Farmer continued to go in between Cange and Boston, even smuggling in money to help fuel the resistance led by Aristide supporters.

But the military was getting bolder in its tactics. One night, soldiers wandered through the Zanmi Lasante grounds. Another time, a soldier approached the hospital with a gun. When Farmer told him he couldn’t bring a gun there, the soldier grew upset with him, asking who he was to give him orders. Farmer responded that he’d be the doctor to treat him or his family members if he ever got ill. The soldier left, but he was disgruntled, and the hospital staff wanted Farmer to keep a lower profile.

### Political Advocacy

Farmer’s political advocacy was just taking flight. In 1994, he published a book called _The Uses of Haiti_ describing the oppressive history of the US toward Haiti, which included:

  * Helping the French quash the Haitian independence movement in the 1790s
  * Financing the Haitian Army up to the point that they deposed Aristide
  * Training army officers—who later violently killed Haitian civilians—at the US Army’s School of the Americas
  * Working with the press to badmouth Aristide and other progressive leaders



After the book’s publication, Farmer wrote an opinion piece in the _Miami Herald_ advocating for a military intervention in Haiti to restore Aristide. He reasoned that over the course of Haiti’s history, US meddling had mostly propped up leaders sympathetic to US interests. **Now, the US needed to wield its power to restore a rightfully elected democratic leader.** In response to Farmer’s advocacy, the Haitian government once again banned him from entering the country.

Farmer used his banishment to talk to different audiences about Haiti’s politics. He testified to a congressional committee about Haiti’s military rule, but many of the representatives didn’t think Farmer really understood the situation. Other reps were so apathetic that they slept during the presentation. Farmer also tried speaking to people in small towns in the south and midwestern US, including on the radio, but he received push-back from people who saw Farmer as an extremist.

But some people listened to Farmer. In October 1994, the Clinton Administration helped reinstate Aristide to power and Farmer returned to his hospital to work.

### Picking Up the Pieces

The United Nations estimated that three years of military rule in Haiti had resulted in the deaths of 8,000 people at the hands of military forces, while more perished trying to escape the island by boat.

It had also affected the health of the Haitian people, amplifying existing public health crises. **Zanmi Lasante had to interrupt its health programs, including vaccinations, clean water initiatives, and women’s health education.** Though the clinic was one of the only clinics to treat victims of military violence, many people in need of general medical attention avoided visiting unless they were extremely sick.

Some of the effects of junta rule visible at Zanmi Lasante included:

  * An increase in diseases like typhoid, measles, and tuberculosis.
  * A 60 percent increase in patients with AIDS, many of whom were Aristide supporters fleeing targeted violence in the capital’s slums.
  * Increased malnutrition.



To pick up the pieces, Farmer and Zanmi Lasante had a long road ahead of them.
