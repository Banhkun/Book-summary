## Part 4: Treating Tuberculosis in Peru

In 1997, Farmer and Partners in Health’s work expanded beyond Haiti to Peru. Father Jack, a priest and member of PIH’s board of advisors, had decided to open a parish in a slum outside of Lima, Peru and thought PIH should open a clinic there.

### Establishing a Clinic in Lima

A long-time colleague of Farmer’s at Partners in Health, Jim Yong Kim, worked to establish the clinic, modeling it after Zanmi Lasante. Farmer advised Kim while working from Haiti.

Just as Farmer had in Haiti, Kim conducted a health census to find out what the community needed. Community members asked for a pharmacy where medicine could be dispensed. Shortly after the pharmacy’s completion, it was bombed by guerrilla leaders who were in a civil war with the government. **The guerrillas thought that the pharmacy offered helpful medicines and services that would pacify locals to the point that they wouldn’t support the guerrilla’s cause to force change from Peru’s government.**

Kim opted to rebuild the pharmacy in another location.

### Drug Resistant Tuberculosis

In Partners in Health’s early days in Lima, Farmer thought it’d be worthwhile to look into treating tuberculosis there. **From his experience in Haiti, he knew that tuberculosis tends to affect the poor, and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB, or just MDR) is especially prevalent when patients receive incomplete treatment.**

One way MDR can develop is if a patient doesn’t complete a course of antibiotics. Some of the tuberculosis bacteria can survive, leading to complications or death. Or, if patients go through one course of antibiotics but still aren’t cured, subsequent treatment with the same antibiotics could cause them to develop MDR.

Farmer’s plans to focus on TB shifted when he learned that Peru’s government had already worked with the World Health Organization (WHO) to address tuberculosis and had succeeded in curbing the spread of the disease. The WHO upheld Peru’s approach to the disease as a model for other developing countries, offering data that supported their success.

Then, Father Jack died from drug-resistant tuberculosis. It made Farmer suspect that there were in fact cases of tuberculosis that were improperly treated and led patients to develop and spread MDR.

One of PIH’s local health workers started trying to uncover cases of improperly treated tuberculosis.**By asking around at local hospitals, he learned that there were at least ten patients that had not been cured of tuberculosis, which pointed to drug-resistant strains in the community.**

#### The Cause

Farmer started investigating how these drug-resistant strains had developed in Lima. There, tuberculosis patients underwent directly observed treatment short-course chemotherapy, or DOTS. This meant a health provider watched patients while they took the antibiotics. Farmer used this same method in Haiti to cure TB patients. If a patient wasn’t cured during the first round of DOTS, then they were treated again with the same antibiotics plus an additional one.

Despite this program, the ten patients who weren’t cured had still become resistant to 4-5 antibiotics. Because the patients were observed taking the medicine, failure to complete the treatment couldn’t be the cause of drug resistance. The quality of the drugs had been certified, too.

The problem was that, after the first round of DOTS failed to cure patients, they underwent a second round of treatment with some of the same antibiotics, and only ended up sicker because the bacteria were resistant to one or more of the drugs. **If the doctors had realized this after the first round and tried treating the patient with different antibiotics, they could have prevented the development of MDR.**

If a patient didn’t get better after two rounds of treatment, Peru’s national treatment program refused to treat them further. They could try to get treatment through private medical practices, but it was so expensive, they’d need to sell most of their possessions to pay for it, and often couldn’t afford enough of the medicine needed to cure themselves.

### Obstacles to Treatment

There were other obstacles, both at the national and international level, that hampered treating patients with MDR.

#### Peru

Farmer started making regular visits to Peru to learn how to improve TB and MDR treatment. In Peru, there were two main obstacles to treating MDR:

  1. Its tuberculosis program was funded by the government’s own money, which meant that patients got free treatment. However, treating drug-resistant patients was more costly than treating patients without drug resistance. **If they expanded the program to treat drug-resistant Peruvians in Lima, they’d need to expand it across the country, which would bankrupt the program.**
  2. The guidelines they followed were endorsed by the WHO, so working around them seemed impossible. At the time, the WHO thought it too costly to treat MDR in poor countries and instead advocated for just treating TB patients.



To address these obstacles, Farmer and his team pursued two main approaches:

  1. They reached an agreement with the Peruvian government to follow the WHO guidelines for treating patients, but if the guidelines failed, they could take over and try their own treatment regimen. They treated over 100 people with MDR in Peru, and after two years, nearly 85 percent were cured.
  2. They sought to change the norms for treatment at the international level.



#### International

Amongst international medical professionals at this time, there were three prevailing ideas about treating MDR:

  1. It was too costly to treat patients in poverty with MDR, so it shouldn’t be done.
  2. MDR wasn’t super contagious, so treatment wasn’t necessary.
  3. Stopping the transmission of the disease was more important than treating individual patients.



In response to these beliefs, Farmer and Kim devised two main ways to effectively treat TB and MDR around the world: pushing to treat patients with MDR and lowering the drug costs.

##### Treat Patients

Farmer gave a talk at a convening of lung specialists, which included WHO personnel, to argue the case for treating MDR. He wanted to dispel the myth that treating MDR was not cost-effective. **He used an example of a patient with MDR in Texas who spread it to 9 family members. It cost $1 million to treat the whole family.** This example demonstrated that patients with MDR aren’t less contagious, and it’s more cost-effective to treat one person than multiple.

He also argued that continuing to rely on the DOTS regimen to treat TB patients and MDR patients would amplify drug resistance. In other words, not only would MDR patients not respond to this regimen, their bacteria would continue to grow in resistance.

Later, Farmer presented these ideas to the WHO directly, convincing the director of its TB program to implement a program that went beyond DOTS to treat both TB and MDR patients. The director called it DOTS-plus.

##### Lower Drug Costs

PIH had succeeded in treating TB in Peru thanks to generous donations from one major donor and others to finance the cost of the drugs. But Kim realized that a more long-term solution was needed to lower the cost of the antibiotics themselves, particularly the ones MDR patients needed.

Drug prices depend on the quantities made and the companies making them. **Big companies often charge more money for a drug than smaller companies that make the same drug.** If they could find smaller drug companies that already made the antibiotics, or convince small companies that didn’t make them to start, they could reduce costs by around 95 percent.

They realized it would be easier to convince smaller drug companies to make the antibiotics if the WHO designated the medicines as “essential.” Despite the prevalence of TB in the world, the drugs weren’t listed as “essential” because they were infrequently used relative to other more common drugs. Members of the WHO considered it dangerous to list the drugs as essential because it would lower the costs and make them widely available, potentially fueling antibiotic resistance.

But Kim argued that as they’d witnessed in Peru, drug resistance was already a phenomenon, and would merely get worse without access to appropriate, inexpensive drugs. Kim also advocated for the creation of a committee to control the distribution of the antibiotics used to treat MDR patients—any project attempting to treat TB or MDR patients had to have an already established plan for treating TB and minimizing drug-resistance.

**The WHO agreed to add the antibiotics to its essential list, which in turn led to more small manufacturers making the drugs and the costs dropping 84-95 percent.**

### The Survival of Partners in Health

Despite the major changes to treatment and drug costs, the continued survival of PIH as a nonprofit was in jeopardy. The organization had largely relied on the wealth of one major donor to finance much of its operations, and the donor had spent most of his wealth.

Now that they had helped advance TB treatment in Lima, Kim envisioned expanding treatment to the rest of the country, with help from larger benefactors like the Gates Foundation. In 2000, PIH received a $45 million, 5-year grant from the Foundation to treat all MDR patients in Peru and reach an 80 percent cure rate, just as they’d done in Lima. Eventually, Kim hoped to expand their TB treatment program to other countries that needed it.
