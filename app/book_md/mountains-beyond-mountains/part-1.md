## Part 1: Meeting Doctor Paul Farmer

In _Mountains Beyond Mountains_ , Tracy Kidder tells the true story of Paul Farmer, a doctor and anthropologist committed to both serving the poor and demonstrating that the health of a nation’s people is the product of its culture and political history. Kidder first met Dr. Paul Farmer in 1994 during a political intervention in Haiti. Kidder was embedded with US Army officials who were attempting to restore a democratic leader, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in Haiti, which had been ruled by a military junta for the previous three years.

Farmer, who operated a hospital in Haiti, came to express his grievances to the US Army officials about their plans. **He considered the US partially responsible for the military junta—one of the junta’s leaders had trained in the US Army’s School of the Americas—and thought that the US cared more about its business interests than helping the Haitian people, the vast majority of whom were very poor.**

(Shortform note: The US Army School of the Americas, now called the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation, was founded in 1946 to train Latin American leaders in US warfare tactics. Since then, it has trained leaders who have gone on to stage coups in their home countries and establish governments sympathetic to US interests.)

Farmer also thought that the US Army should lock up a Haitian leader suspected in the beheading of the mayor of a town near Farmer’s hospital. Overall, Farmer tried to warn the US official that the locals weren’t happy with the US Army, a potentially huge problem—the Army had just 9 soldiers working to control 150,000 locals.

The army captain grew angry at Farmer’s critique of the School of the Americas and his suggestion that he should arrest the beheading suspect without due process. **But Farmer argued that there was no sound legal system in place in Haiti—it didn’t make sense to follow a legal practice like due process in a largely lawless country. And unless the army arrested the Haitian leader, who was almost certainly guilty, he’d go free.** When Farmer couldn’t convince the army captain, he left.

### Connecting With Farmer

Kidder and Farmer happened to be taking the same flight on the way back to the states, and Kidder used the opportunity to learn about Farmer’s life. Farmer was 35 years old, and in addition to his degree in medicine, he had a Ph.D. in anthropology. Part of the year, he worked at a hospital in Boston, and for the rest of the year, he worked at his hospital in rural Haiti.

Later, Kidder had dinner with Farmer in Boston. He wanted to use Farmer’s knowledge of Haiti to inform his reporting on the US’s political intervention there, but he found that it was more complicated than he expected. Kidder thought the soldiers had done their duty—restoring a democratic government. **However, economically, the country was not better off than before the soldiers had come in.**

#### Farmer: A Saint?

Kidder met up with Farmer again five years later, in 1999, to watch him work at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. He now worked as a professor at Harvard Medical School, on top of his work in Boston and Haiti.

Though Farmer appeared dignified and serious, his compassion and sense of humor with patients and coworkers soon shone through. For example, as Farmer treated a patient who was homeless, Joe, he asked him what kind of shelter or additional treatment he wanted. Joe wanted a shelter where he could be treated for his HIV but wouldn’t get penalized for drinking alcohol, which is often forbidden at shelters.

Farmer found Joe a shelter, but it still forbade drinking alcohol. **But for Farmer, sheltering a patient and allowing them some vices was still preferable to them being out on the street.** On Christmas, he visited his patients in the community, including Joe, and brought them presents. For Joe, it was a six-pack of beer, which he gladly received, calling Farmer a saint.

Farmer didn’t think he deserved to be called a saint. He liked the idea, but he thought he’d need to work considerably harder to merit the title.

### Medical Philosophy: Treat Patients

Farmer wrote a book about the relationship between infectious disease, inequality, and access to medical technology around the world. **He expressed discontent with how many diseases around the world would be preventable if people were only given the appropriate treatment.**

During his work in Haiti, Farmer often slept no more than 4 hours a night because he was thinking about patients who needed treatment but weren’t getting it. More broadly, he felt ambivalent about charging for his medical care knowing that many couldn’t afford it. For him, it spoke to a greater need to improve the distribution of medicine and wealth.

Farmer also thought that people in the US, particularly “white liberals,” needed to recognize that big change couldn’t happen without some sacrifice on their part. For example, he hoped that if someone learned about a disease afflicting the poor, they’d give money to help treat it rather than assuming it’d resolve itself.

**In Haiti, there is an expression that says, “beyond mountains, there are mountains.”** Though Farmer faced immense obstacles to bring care to those in need, he felt a sustained and urgent drive to deliver the best care possible.

#### Treating Patients With AIDS

Farmer took some radical approaches to getting treatment to patients in rural Haiti, often breaking with norms in medicine at the time. He started treating patients with AIDS with newly developed antiretroviral drugs, a radical move at a time when virtually no country offered treatment to poor people with AIDS.

To do so, he worked to gather unused antiretroviral medication from people in the US and raise money to buy more. It could cost up to $5,000 per patient to treat AIDS in Haiti, but Farmer thought it was worth it.
