## Part 6: Innovative Treatments for Haitian Patients

Back in Haiti, Farmer and PIH continued to work on finding effective treatments for patients in need. This involved detailed planning and making decisions about how money should be spent.

### Expanding AIDS Treatment

Though antiretroviral drugs provided a proven treatment for AIDS, many world health experts at the time didn’t think it was practical to treat people in poor countries. **They said the treatment was too costly and preferred to focus funding on prevention efforts instead.** But Farmer and PIH believed in treating AIDS regardless of cost or the patient’s ability to pay.

However, Farmer encountered significant obstacles as he tried to treat AIDS patients in Haiti. One pillar of Zanmi Lasante’s AIDS program was trying to prevent the spread of HIV from mothers to babies. This one program alone required massive coordination, including providing educational programs to people in a 400 square-mile area, as well as drugs to pregnant mothers, and later, to their newborn babies.

Another obstacle to treatment came from the US leaders, who were discouraging foreign leaders and international agencies from giving Aristide’s government funding for infrastructure and services. The reasons the US acted this way were unclear, but it might have been due to a distrust of Aristide and waning interest in sending Haiti resources. As a result, many health clinics lacked money to keep operating and shut down. **Zanmi Lasante became the only hospital in the region around Cange, and it had to treat even more patients.**

Farmer wrote about his program in a medical journal, and he started receiving inquiries about how to replicate it. Despite the obstacles, he hoped this model could serve as a blueprint for AIDS treatment throughout Haiti and in other countries.

### Treatment in Boston: John’s Story

Partners in Health occasionally worked to transport patients they couldn’t treat in Cange to Boston. One patient was a twelve-year-old boy named John who was suffering from a rare but treatable type of cancer. **If the cancer hadn’t spread throughout his body, John had a 60 to 70 percent chance of survival.** However, Zanmi Lasante didn’t have the right equipment to evaluate the cancer’s spread.

At first, they thought they could treat the cancer with drugs imported from the US, but they soon realized that even most modern hospitals didn’t have the means to treat it effectively. The two Partners in Health doctors treating John opted to bring him to Massachusetts General Hospital, which agreed to provide free treatment. It took about a month from the time of his diagnosis to arrange a flight for him to Massachusetts General.

**John was not in good condition to make the trip—he had been relying on a breathing tube and needed periodic suctioning to keep his airways clear.** The two PIH doctors had planned to fly with him on a commercial flight to Boston, but he looked so sickly that they worried that he wouldn’t be let on the plane. Instead, they consulted with Farmer, who gave them permission to arrange a private medevac flight to transport him.

To get John to Boston, they first needed some way to transport him from Zanmi Lasante to the capital, where the medevac would depart. They found an ambulance operator with an electric suctioning device to help John make the trip safely, but the ambulance broke down on its way from Port-au-Prince to Cange. Instead, they were able to transfer the electric suctioning device to Zanmi Lasante’s vehicle and made it to Port-au-Prince.

After the medevac flight, they reached Massachusetts General and learned that John’s cancer had spread too much. All they could do was to help him die comfortably. **After John’s death, Farmer met with the head of pediatrics at Massachusetts General to develop a partnership where some of his sickest patients in Haiti could come to the hospital to receive treatment for free.** Ideally, they’d be able to treat patients before they reached John’s stage of decline.

#### John’s Triage

When deciding how to treat John, Farmer had triaged the situation. There are two main definitions of the word “triage,” depending on the circumstances the doctor operates in:

  1. **Under-supplied:** If the doctors are dealing with limited medical supplies or personnel, triage means treating patients based on _how severe their symptoms are and how likely they are to survive._ For example, in a war zone, a doctor might ignore a patient with severe injuries that has no chance of survival in favor of one that has less severe injuries and a chance of survival.
  2. **Well-supplied:** If the doctors have adequate medical supplies, triage means _treating all patients, beginning with those with the severest symptoms_. For example, a typical emergency room in a US hospital would operate this way.



But Farmer held treatment for the poor in the highest regard, and employed a treatment-for-all approach—closer to #2—even though his program was perpetually underfunded and supplies were limited.

Though he strived to provide treatment for all, Farmer admitted that sometimes there were trade-offs. For example, after John’s death, some of the PIH staff complained that the $20,000 spent on John’s medevac flight to Boston could have been put to better use. **But Farmer decided it was worth it to spend the money because there was a 60 to 70 percent chance that John could beat the disease—they didn’t have the equipment to see that John’s cancer had spread.**

Trade-offs and all, Farmer still fought to give every patient the treatment they deserved.

### Treatment in Cange: Alcante’s Story

Back in Cange, a young boy named Alcante showed symptoms similar to John’s, but he didn’t have the same rare cancer and responded to drugs. His condition was diagnosed as scrofula, which usually occurs when a parent transmits TB to their children.

As a precaution, Farmer brought all of Alcante’s family into the hospital to assess their TB exposure. Alcante’s dad and a few of his siblings had it and were put on treatment. Farmer then decided to visit the family’s home in the town of Casse to learn if there were any conditions that made the family vulnerable to TB. He discovered two:

  * The parents and their eight children lived in a small, 10 by 20-foot dwelling with a dirt floor and leaky roof. This could be remedied by building the family a house with a concrete floor and a metal roof.
  * As with other TB patients, improving the diet and nutrition of the family would help them survive TB.



This process sums up Farmer’s general approach to medicine: Treat the patient, then treat the underlying causes or conditions of their illness.
