## Exercise: What Are Your Triggers?

Maltz claims that you’re more likely to achieve success if you make the habit of replacing your negative thoughts with positive thoughts. For this exercise, think about something that triggers you into thinking negatively.

* * *

Describe a situation where you often find yourself reacting negatively.

What specific thoughts and feelings come up when you think about this situation?

Which of Maltz’s suggestions could help you plan ahead and prepare yourself to handle this situation positively? For example, you might reframe your negative thoughts to positive ones, or visualize yourself responding calmly.

Try describing the situation as rationally as possible (focus on being objective, not emotional). Does this process help you to think differently about the situation?
