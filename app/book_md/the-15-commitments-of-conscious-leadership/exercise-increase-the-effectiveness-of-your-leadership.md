## Exercise: Increase the Effectiveness of Your Leadership

The authors suggest that effective leaders must implement many different behaviors. With so many recommendations, it can be difficult to pinpoint where to start. In this exercise, you’ll identify which behaviors you should implement first to make the biggest impact on your leadership as soon as possible.

* * *

Of the behaviors discussed in this guide, which two do you currently struggle to implement the most? Why are these behaviors particular struggles for you? (For example, maybe you struggle to adopt a mindset of abundance because you were raised to have a scarcity mindset. Maybe you struggle to be fully authentic with your team members because you’re conflict-averse, so you don’t address issues honestly and directly.)

For the first behavior you noted in the previous question, what’s one habit you can adopt to help you implement this behavior? Be specific: When, where, and how often will you engage in this habit? (For example, you might schedule time to complete an abundance meditation every morning, just before you start work. You might complete the meditation in your car or your private office.)

Now, for the second behavior you noted in the first question, what’s one habit you can adopt to help you implement this behavior? Be specific: When, where, and how often will you engage in this habit? (For example, at the end of each workday, you might return to your desk and note down any conflicts that arose that day. You might then write a script for addressing each issue honestly and directly with the team member involved, and commit to talking to them the next morning.)
