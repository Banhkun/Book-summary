## Exercise: See Yourself as a Machine

Try to view yourself as a machine in order to unemotionally see what needs improvement.

As a machine, what are your desired outputs? What are the inputs that the machine uses to create the outputs?

What is currently most broken about you as a machine? How can you tell itâ€™s broken?

How can you best fix this machine so that it operates more to your liking?
