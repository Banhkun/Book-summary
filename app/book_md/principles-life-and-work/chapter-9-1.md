## Chapter 9.1: People Management: Understanding People

As mentioned earlier, Dalio says that people are one of the most important components of your organizational machine. He believes that people shape an organization’s culture, and thus **the WHO of your organization is more important than the WHAT driving it**. Rather than focusing on what should be done, you should focus on finding the best person to figure out what should be done in the first place.

(Shortform note: One helpful exercise is to change your line of thinking from, “How can I accomplish this goal?” to “Who can help me accomplish this goal?” In _Who, Not How_ , author Dan Sullivan says that getting the right people to help you accomplish something saves you time and effort because it allows you to make use of skill sets and ideas that you may not have. Once you have the right people in place, you should clearly define your desired outcome, and then step back and allow them to figure out how to achieve it.)

In this section, Dalio details the principles for hiring, training, and evaluating the who.

### First, Understand How People Are Wired

Dalio says that a key part of working with others and being totally receptive is figuring out how you all behave and think differently. These differences are a result of genetics and environment and may lead to people having trouble understanding each other. For example, abstract thinkers may think literal people have no imagination. Literal people may think abstract people are pedantic philosophers.

It’s hard enough to know what type of person everyone else is. Compounding this problem is the fact that people often don’t know which type of person _they_ are themselves. Dalio says that this leads to all sorts of misunderstandings and conflicts.

(Shortform note: Aside from knowing the personality of each person on your team, it’s also useful to know how they relate with other people. Relational skills aren’t just for those in human resources or sales—knowing your team members’ interpersonal strengths can boost your team’s productivity. By determining their ability to influence, connect with, and lead others, you can assign job responsibilities that play to their strengths and have a better idea of how you can help them set career goals.)

#### Figuring Out People Types

To avoid misunderstandings and be productive, Dalio says that you must figure out how people on your team think and behave. To this end, you should keep two things in mind: Be curious, and understand everyone’s strengths and weaknesses.

##### Be Curious

Dalio says you should _want_ to understand how people who see things differently came to see them that way. Instead of getting frustrated with people and the choices they make, realize they aren’t intentionally acting in a counterproductive way—they’re simply making the best decisions based on how their brains work.

(Shortform note: One way to understand where another person is coming from is through a psychotherapeutic technique called role reversal: Two people exchange roles so that they can see things from a different perspective. However, it isn’t practical to use this technique in every situation, so you may borrow a technique from the book _Radical Acceptance_ : Practice compassion and simply put yourself in the other person’s shoes and imagine what they need.)

##### Understand Everyone’s Strengths and Weaknesses

This includes understanding your _own_ strengths and weaknesses. Dalio says that people with complementary strengths do better work together than separately, leading to the best results. For example, a visionary and an executor can accomplish more together than each can individually.

(Shortform note: Not a lot of companies have personality profiles like Bridgewater’s to show people’s strengths and weaknesses, so you might need to be more deliberate about gaining a better understanding of your team members. In _Inspired_ , author Marty Cagan recommends keeping teams together over several projects so that you, and they, can better gauge what each person brings to the table.)

##### Suggestion: Use Personality Assessments

To get an objective picture of what people are like, Bridgewater uses personality assessments like the **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator** , which classifies people into 16 personality types, and the **Workplace Personality Inventory** , which gauges attributes like persistence, stress tolerance, and analytical thinking. The results of the assessments reveal a combination of specific attributes, which then allows Bridgewater to form an archetype about a person. Dalio emphasizes that the archetypes aren’t precise, but they’re helpful for better understanding each individual.

(Shortform note: The archetypes at Bridgewater are divided into: **Leaders** (Commander, Shaper, Quiet Leader), **Advocates** (Inspirer, Campaigner, Coach), **Enthusiasts** (Promoter, Impresario, Entertainer), **Givers** (Peacekeeper, Problem Solver, Helper), **Architects** (Strategist, Planner, Orchestrator), **Producers** (Implementer, Investigator, Technician), **Creators** (Adventurer, Artisan, Inventor), **Seekers** (Explorer, Thinker, Growth Seeker), and **Fighters** (Protector, Enforcer, Critic). Dalio considers himself a Shaper.)

The assessments help give a clear narrative of how someone will behave and fit into a team. For example, a person might have a Myers-Briggs type of S (for Sensing, meaning more concerned with concrete details) and a J (for Judging, meaning more structured and orderly), plus an “executor” archetype, making them best suited for the conscientious execution of detailed plans.

Dalio writes that these assessments have proven to be so useful that he’s been adapting them to better suit Bridgewater’s recruitment and management practices.

(Shortform note: Dalio launched PrinciplesYou, a free personality assessment in 2021. The results of the test give you a glimpse of your archetypes and core traits, which builds your self-awareness—a crucial factor for success. Sharing the results with friends, family, and colleagues can also help you improve your relationships. Alongside this individual assessment, Dalio also launched PrinciplesUs, a people management tool for businesses.)
