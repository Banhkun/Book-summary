## Chapter 9.2: People Management: Hiring the Right People

Having a better understanding of yourself and others helps you form a dream team of people with complementary strengths. In this chapter, Dalio shares his principles for hiring the right people, and how to train and evaluate them.

### How to Hire Right

According to Dalio, the penalties for hiring the wrong person are huge. You can waste years on entertaining a bad hire, and may spend a lot of money on training and retraining. The graver hidden costs are a loss of morale among competent team members and a sense of diminishing standards that will progressively cripple the company. The importance of hiring is even greater when you choose people who operate at the highest levels, who are responsible for designing the machine and goals of the organization.

Dalio stresses that it’s important to hire people who have _both_ great character and great capabilities; one without the other is dangerous. People with great capabilities who do not have great character will not be aligned on the mission, and they’ll work on their own goals, which may conflict with the organization’s. People with great character without great capabilities are pleasant to be around, but they don’t contribute to the organization’s goals. To Dalio, people who have both character and capabilities are rare and valuable.

> **Make the Most of Your Hiring Resources**
> 
> Hiring right can be tricky, but you have two main tools to help you find the person with the right character and capabilities for a role: the interview and references. The interview gives you an idea of an applicant’s fit based on their self-assessment, while references enable you to verify the information you got from the interview.

>   * Assess the candidate’s technical skill level, ability to apply those skills, discrepancy between knowledge and performance, and values.
> 
>   * Allow the candidate to talk 80% of the time, but interrupt when they go off-tangent so that you don’t waste time.
> 
>   * Clarify any jargon that you might be using.
> 
>   * Give the candidate a realistic glimpse into the company—you don’t want them to feel like they were tricked.

> 
> **References**
> 
>   * Try to form a connection with the reference to make them feel more at ease about talking to you before diving into your questions.
> 
>   * Aim to get the same information (skills, application of skills, values) from the reference’s perspective.

#### Design a Great Hiring Machine

As with most things, Dalio recommends designing a hiring _machine_ to increase your chances of getting the best people for the job. He shares his principles for determining your organization’s personnel needs, interviewing people, and evaluating them for fit.

##### Determine Your Needs

Dalio says the first thing you should do is create a clear mental image of the values, abilities, and skills (in that order) required for each person in the role to do their job well. Make a spec sheet with the criteria that you are looking for, encompassing:

  * **Values** —the fundamental beliefs that drive people’s behaviors. People with similar values get along; people with different values will fight constantly.
  * **Abilities** —fundamental ways of thinking and behaving, such as “fast learner” or “high-level visionary.” These are unlikely to change much and are important to select for.
  * **Skills** —learned tools and can be acquired in a finite period of time. These are less important since capable people can learn new skills quickly.



Dalio warns that you shouldn’t design jobs to fit certain people. You may have favorite candidates in your team and be tempted to fit the role for what they’re good at, but this is counter-productive, since the best candidate may come from outside.

​​(Shortform note: Dalio says that you should consider values, abilities, and skills when looking for the right person for the job, but he leaves out one factor that some consider to be the most important: attitude. Some experts even say that you should hire for attitude and train for skill, because someone who’s motivated to keep learning, who knows how to handle feedback and failure, and who works well with others has a greater chance for success than someone who just has technical skills. However, you should keep in mind that hiring for attitude comes with risks—you may not get an accurate picture during the screening process since candidates put their best foot forward, and training in areas like problem-solving and critical thinking may take longer than expected.)

##### Systematize the Interview Process

Once you’re clear about the kind of person you need for a role, it’s time to interview applicants. Dalio says that most organizations hire someone by asking semi-random questions and then choosing based on how much the interviewer liked the person. This is prone to error because it’s based on inconsistent, subjective evaluations. To build a more objective interview process, Dalio thus recommends the following:

**Think through what questions will be asked** , and how different answers differentiate candidates of different qualities. Save candidates’ answers and compare them against successful candidates’ performance data later on so you can tell how predictive questions are of certain behaviors. (Shortform note: Ask out-of-the-box questions to get candidates to veer away from rehearsed answers and get them to reveal their real personality and thought process.)

**Choose interviewers who embody the qualities and abilities you’re hiring for.** People tend to pick those who are similar to themselves. If you’re looking for someone highly detail-oriented who’s good at execution, ask someone on your team who has those qualities to conduct the interview. (Shortform note: This tactic _may_ lead to a biased hiring committee. Reduce the chances of forming a homogeneous team by asking interviewers to assess their unconscious biases, and make sure you have a diverse hiring committee.)

**Consider using personality assessments** to know more about a candidate. (Shortform note: Another way to learn more about a candidate is to assign homework—an essay, proposal, or presentation. This allows you to better gauge the quality of their work.)

**Look for exceptional people.** Dalio says that if you aren’t excited by a candidate, you shouldn’t hire them. Great candidates have demonstrated themselves to be extraordinary in some way, so look at their track records. Also consider the candidate’s potential for growth—you want someone who can evolve with the organization and whom you want to work with for a long time.

(Shortform note: One of the advantages of promoting someone from within, rather than hiring from outside, is that you already know their track record. You’re also assured that they already have a deep understanding of the organization’s culture—especially important if you’re looking to fill a leadership position.

##### Make Compensation Competitive

You can’t attract exceptional talent with an organization’s culture alone—people need to get paid for their work. Dalio provides several pieces of advice on offering competitive compensation:

**Pay north of fair.** People perform better when they don’t have to worry about money. Dalio says you should pay them enough to meet their needs, but not so much that they become complacent. They shouldn’t come to you just for job security; they should also be motivated to earn more money through good work.

(Shortform note: Highly competitive salaries are not just good for the employees, but also for the company, as demonstrated by Gravity Payments. When CEO Dan Price realized that his employees were struggling to make ends meet and therefore under a lot of stress, he increased the minimum wage at his company to $70,000 a year. Interestingly, this increase didn’t eat into the company’s profits, and instead resulted in revenue growth at double the previous rate—an indication that increasing employees’ financial security leads to increased productivity.)

**Determine baseline compensation by knowing the market rate for a person with similar skills (not just the same job title).** Then, build in incentives based on performance metrics so they’re motivated to outperform.

(Shortform note: Some say that an incentive system isn’t the best way to go. In Drive _,_ author Daniel H. Pink argues that rewards can actually increase bad behavior because it promotes cheating, creates addiction, and encourages short-term thinking. However, Pink ignores the vast literature on the benefits of incentives.)

**Be generous, but within reason.** Dalio says that being generous does not necessitate total fairness or entitlement. In general, people should be happy with what they get, and not point to what other people get as justification for getting the same thing.

  * For example, many people commuted from New York City to Bridgewater’s Connecticut headquarters, so Bridgewater funded a shuttle for people who live in New York City. One employee suggested that it’d be fair to compensate drivers for the hundreds of dollars they spend on gas, since bus riders were getting free transit. Dalio felt no obligation to be equal in generosity.



(Shortform note: Not being “totally fair” has led to some compensation issues for Bridgewater. In 2020, Bridgewater co-CEO Eileen Murray left the firm and filed a lawsuit for gender discrimination and unequal pay. Murray and Bridgewater eventually reached an “amicable” agreement. A few months later, the _Wall Street Journal_ reported that Karen Karniol-Tambour, the top-ranked woman at Bridgewater, had filed a formal complaint with top management, claiming that she was paid less than men who had similar or lesser responsibilities. However, Karniol-Tambour later issued a statement to dispute this, saying the report was inaccurate and discussions about her compensation did not involve gender.)

#### Warnings About Hiring

Even if you have a good system, the right interview questions, and competitive compensation, you’ll still run into problems. Dalio says to keep the following in mind during the hiring process:

**Don’t take references for granted.** Candidates tend to exaggerate accomplishments, so talk to someone who can give you a clear picture of the candidate’s previous performance. (Shortform note: When talking to references, describe the candidate’s potential role and its challenges, then ask the reference how the candidate performed in similar situations.)

**Don’t rely on grades and honors.** Dalio says that success in school is a limited gauge of certain attributes: memory and processing speed, determination to succeed, willingness to follow directions. Success in school does not necessarily correlate with common sense, vision, and creativity. (Shortform: Based on a survey, some companies put college GPA near the bottom of the list of important attributes for recent graduates. Instead, they consider internships and work experience during college to be more valuable.)

**Beware the “impractical idealist” type** —Dalio says these people don’t execute practical plans that produce results. (Shortform note: Dalio doesn’t go into great detail about impractical idealists, but in a series of tweets, he describes them as those who have theories about the right course of action without having any realistic idea of what it entails because they’ve never done it.)

**Be careful about outsourcing.** Consultants are helpful for one-time specialized tasks, but beware of outsourcing work your employees should be doing. Dalio also warns that consultants can ultimately cost more and cause greater security risks than employees. (Shortform note: Some of the areas that may require the help of a consultant are process improvements, expertise in a specific field for a project, or the implementation of major changes like cost-cutting.)
