## Introduction

Ray Dalio is the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world’s largest hedge funds. He wrote _Principles_ to pass on his principles for living life and reaching goals, and help other people become successful.

### What Are Principles?

**According to Dalio, principles are the fundamental truths that determine how you behave.** They reflect your inner character and individual values. People who align in principles get along with each other, while people who don’t have constant conflicts and misunderstandings.

Dalio outlines three reasons why having principles is important:

**1) They let people know what you stand for.** When you operate by clear principles, people know what behaviors to expect from you. In contrast, not having clear principles will lead you to behave inconsistently, causing you to lose people’s trust.

(Shortform note: You don’t need grand gestures to convey your principles and build trust. In _Dare to Lead_ , Brené Brown writes that your small, consistent, everyday acts send a strong message about what you stand for and build a sense of trust naturally over time.)

**2) They help you deal with the complexity of life.** Every day, you face new situations that require your response. If you had to consciously decide what to do in each situation, you’d either react impulsively or become exhausted from the constant battle between your thoughts and your feelings. Dalio explains that having fundamental principles helps you quickly—almost _automatically_ —determine the best response to the situation you’re facing.

(Shortform note: Having automatic responses means you already _know_ what to do and don’t have to expend energy deliberating on your course of action. In _Switch_ , authors Chip and Dan Heath explain that you can train yourself into autopilot behaviors by setting up triggers to prompt specific actions.)

**3) They set you up for success.** Dalio says that operating by clear principles that are aligned with your goals and your nature allows you to make the best decisions. These decisions collectively determine the quality of your life.

(Shortform note: Dalio contradicts his ideas surrounding principles throughout the book. On the one hand, he says that you should choose the principles that work best for you; on the other, he says that you must __ use _all_ of his principles in order to be successful. Given that other people—like PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and former Intel CEO Andrew Grove—have found success using their own formulas, it’s safe to assume that Dalio’s wholesale principles aren’t the only key to success.)

> **Two Different Views on Principles**
> 
> Dalio’s definition implies that principles are subjective, meaning that different people believe in and operate by different truths. But author Stephen Covey has a different definition of principles: In _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , he says that principles are universally recognized, self-evident, and enduring truths, and that the idea of following in opposition to them seems ridiculous. He explains that principles are different from practices—actions that you apply to particular situations—and values—subjective beliefs or ideas.

### Ray Dalio’s Principles

Dalio refined his principles in an iterative loop—that is, he set goals, made mistakes, reflected and learned new principles, then set bigger goals. Over time, he collected a set of principles that he believes addresses virtually any life or work situation.

Dalio’s principles center around success as _he_ defines it—being an independent thinker, a successful financial trader, and working with a team that thinks like him. The principles also align with _his_ personality and nature—someone who doesn’t like following other people’s instructions and instead prefers to figure out things himself. He’s adamant that **each person needs to discover their own principles** , depending on their goals and personality. Dalio thus emphasizes that you shouldn’t take his principles on faith. Instead, you should question his ideas, see if they make sense to you, then walk away with the principles that fit your goals best.

(Shortform note: Jim Collins agrees that principles aren’t one-size-fits-all, whether it’s on a personal level or organizational level. In _Built to Last_ , he writes that successful companies may have _some_ guiding principles in common, but there isn’t one set of principles for all of them. What matters when it comes to achieving success isn’t so much what each company’s principles _are_ , but how strongly and consistently an organization—or an individual—adheres to them. Like Dalio, Collins writes that these principles should be authentic: a reflection of what you believe in and not what you think you _should_ believe in.)
