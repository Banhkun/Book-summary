## Exercise: Understand People Types

Understand yourself and other people to form a dream team that can effectively work through disagreements and blind spots.

* * *

Think of someone whom you disagree with often. What are they blind to that you see often?

Imagine that they are actually literally blind to that thing that you notice. Does this help you understand their thinking? Does it make your disagreements less frustrating?

What do _you_ tend to be blind to? What do other people point out that you tend not to see?

If you’re not sure what your blind spots are, who could you ask who would give you an honest, objective opinion?

If you were forming a team, who can complement you based on what you’re blind to?
