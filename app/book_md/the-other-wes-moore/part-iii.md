## Part III: We Are Who We Believe We Are

### Scenes from Prison

Moore couldn’t believe it when Wes said, as he often did during their time together, he wasn’t there the day of the robbery and murder, the crimes for which he was serving this life sentence. No matter how many times he heard it, **Moore was always shocked at Wes’s inability to admit what he’d done**.

More than once, Moore questioned what he was doing at the prison. After three years, he realized that Wes was still just a stranger convicted of murder. **He didn’t really know Wes at all.** Moore wondered whether Wes’s repeated mantra of innocence was an attempt to wash it from his mind. If he said it enough, did Wes think he could make it true?

Moore avoided the topic and asked if Wes thought that people were products of their environments. Wes said he thought people were products of the expectations others had for them. What others expected from you tended to be what you believed about yourself. Moore agreed, but he knew it wasn’t that easy. **Other’s influence was powerful, but at the end of the day, everyone was responsible for their own actions.**
