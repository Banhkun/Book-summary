## Introduction: An Unlikely Relationship

(Shortform note: Because this book surrounds the lives of two men with the same name, differentiating between the two in the summary can be confusing. For this reason, the Wes Moore who is the author of the book will be referred to as “Moore,” and the Wes Moore serving a life sentence will be referred to as “Wes.”)

**In 2000, the _Baltimore Sun_ ran several stories about two young men named Wes Moore.** One story was filled with accolades for Wes Moore, a recent Johns Hopkins University graduate who had received the prestigious honor of becoming the first black Rhodes Scholar—an academic postgraduate award granting fellows the opportunity to study at Oxford University in England—in university history. The others stories were about a jewelry store burglary that resulted in the heinous murder of an undercover police officer. In these stories, Wes Moore was the target of a massive manhunt and eventually one of the suspects charged in the crime.

The commonality in the names sparked the Johns Hopkins graduate and decorated military service member’s interest in the story. Moore felt a strange connection with this other Wes Moore because of their shared histories. Both were originally from West Baltimore, the impoverished and gang-heavy community located in Baltimore City, both grew up during the same era, and both were raised by single mothers.

The glaring disparity in their trajectories caused Moore to wonder where their paths had diverged. **He wondered what had allowed him to succeed and the other Wes Moore to end up serving a life sentence in prison.** He decided to reach out via letter to the prison and was surprised to receive a response shortly after.

**What started was a friendship and a journey into their pasts.** Moore began to visit Wes in prison. He felt there was something to try to understand regarding their life paths. He believed there was a larger meaning to their intersecting origins and diverging futures.

From the stories shared through glass dividers in the prison’s visiting room and interviews with other significant people in both their lives, **Moore wrote this book to seek an answer to the question, “Why him and not me?”** He organizes his book into eight chapters, with each chapter representing a significant year for both men.

Moore is adamant that he is not passing judgement on Wes’s behavior or excusing his participation in the murder of a father of five. His book aims to examine the circumstances that influence decisions and opportunities in a person’s life, both personally and socially. Finally, Moore aims to show that we are not merely a representation of our actions. Wes’s involvement in the book is a testament to the possibility of humanity even in the face of evil.
