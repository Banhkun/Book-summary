## Chapter 1: 1982

### The Origins of Wes Moore

Moore has few memories of his father, Westley Moore, but **he remembers the day his father taught him what it meant to be a man**.

Moore was three years old and living with his parents and two sisters in a house along the border of Maryland and Washington D.C. One day, Moore was playing with his older half-sister, Nikki. They had a routine—Nikki would entertain Moore by blowing air into his face and then elicit a game of chase around the house.

On this particular day, Moore caught up to Nikki and punched her in the face. His action wasn’t an aggressive one. He was simply playing and surprised to have actually caught her. He didn’t know what else to do, so he hit her. Unfortunately, his mother, Joy, walked in right as his fist connected with Nikki’s face. She was livid. She screamed for Moore to go to his room, reminding him that he was never to hit a woman.

Moore didn’t know what he’d done wrong—after all, they’d been playing—but he feared the punishment that was sure to come.

**Moore’s father was often the voice of reason in the house.** Westley was a slender man, standing six foot two with a large mustache and manicured afro. He told Moore that physical violence is never the answer, especially when females were involved. Westley also reminded Joy that Moore was only three and didn’t have the capacity to understand what abuse was or its consequences. For the moment, anyway, Moore was exonerated from punishment.

#### The Influence of the Past

**Joy was so quick to admonish Moore for hitting Nikki because of her own history with abuse**. Joy Thomas was born in a tiny parish called Trelawny in Jamaica. At the age of three, her parents moved the family to one of the roughest boroughs in New York City, the Bronx.

When Joy started college at American University in 1968, the country was in upheaval with the Civil Rights Movement and Vietnam War. She struggled to find the balance between the America that helped her family find better opportunities and the America that made them second-class citizens.

She found solace in the Organization of African and African-American Students at the American University, helping to organize and mobilize black students to join the conversations relating to injustice. Another member of the group, Bill, was two years older than Joy. They met and immediately fell in love. They were engaged after only two months and married two years later.

**Joy’s dream of a wonderful life with Bill soon turned into a nightmare.** She began to see that Bill’s free spirit and fierce rebellion—qualities that excited her in the early days—were not the best qualities for a husband. His dabbling in drugs turned into a full-blown addiction, and Joy desperately wanted to help Bill get through it. She put her energy into making a life that would satisfy Bill, including having a child. But Bill’s addictions to drugs and alcohol grew worse. He became physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive.

The final straw was the night Bill came home and assaulted Joy over dirty dishes. He threw Joy on the ground and began to punch her. Joy had had enough. She grabbed a knife from the butcher’s block and**threatened that if he ever laid a hand on her again, she’d kill him**. A month later, she and her daughter, Nikki, moved out.

#### The Right Man

**Westley Moore was an intelligent, hardworking man with big dreams.** From a young age, he dreamed of working in television as an influential reporter. His voice was deep and resounding, and he was socially conscious. After he graduated from Bard College in 1971, he traveled the country working as a reporter. Eventually, he made his way back home to Maryland and started hosting a public affairs show. He sought the services of a writing assistant and hired a young woman who would become his wife.

Joy thought Westley was everything Bill wasn’t. Westley was smart, driven, patient, kind, and sober. Best of all, he loved Nikki as though she were his own. They were married, and two years later, Joy gave birth to Moore.

**Westley wanted to give his son a middle name with meaning. He chose _Watende_ , a word derived from the Shona tribe in Zimbabwe that meant “revenge will not be sought.”** This ideology was something Westley wanted his son to live by. It also represented who he was as a man, what Moore calls a “gentle spirit.”

#### A Death in the Family

**One of the only other memories Moore has of his father is the night he died.** On April 15, 1982, Westley felt sick. He tossed and turned that evening with a sore throat and fever.

The next morning, Westley drove himself to the hospital. He was weak, disoriented, and had trouble holding his head up. The doctors assumed he was overreacting and diagnosed him with a sore throat and lack of sleep. They merely gave him an anesthetic for the throat pain and questioned Joy about his mental state. The doctors sent Westley home to sleep it off.

Less than two hours later, at 6 p.m., Moore heard his father collapse on the stairs. He saw his father convulsing on the floor, gasping for air, his hands on his throat.

An ambulance arrived and took Westley to the ER. But it was too late. **Westley was pronounced dead shortly after arriving to the ER.** He’d died from a rare condition called acute epiglottitis, a virus that attacks the epiglottis and causes it to enlarge over the airways to the lungs. The condition is treatable, but without treatment, the patient suffocates to death.

The tragedy of Westley’s death is in the mishandling of his case by the previous doctors. He’d come in seeking help, but he was unkempt and from a poor neighborhood. The doctors had written him off. If they’d seen a man deserving of care, they could have saved his life.

### The Origins of the Other Wes Moore

**The lives of six-year-old Wes Moore and his mother changed in different ways one day in 1982.** The two lived alone in West Baltimore. His older brother, Tony, spent most of his time with his maternal grandparents or at a housing project with his father. Wes was for all intents and purposes the man of the house.**** So when his mother, Mary, told him to pack a bag for his grandmother’s house with tears in her eyes, he was concerned and wanted to do something to help.

**Wes had never met his father up to that day.** Despite this, his paternal grandmother spoiled him and loved him. Wes loved going to her house, but he knew something wasn’t right with Mary. It was his job to take care of Mary, so he pressed her about what was wrong.

Mary had found out she would no longer be able to afford to attend college. Her Pell Grant, a federal financial award provided to underserved citizens as part of the government’s Basic Educational Opportunity program, would no longer be funded. Without this funding, the sixteen credits she’d already completed would go to waste.

When Wes learned of his mother’s lost grant, he offered to help earn money so she could still go to school.**** Mary appreciated her six-year-old’s gesture, but she said she would work things out.

#### The Influence of the Past

**Mary grew up in West Baltimore during the turbulent era of Civil Rights.** Although never an affluent neighborhood, conditions worsened following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Riots broke out in the streets, and the atmosphere became so volatile, Mary’s parents wouldn’t let her or her seven siblings go outside. King’s death was the impetus for the street warfare, but the energy behind it was decades of injustice.

By the time the riots ended, the damage to the city totaled nearly $14 million, and close to five thousand people, including children, had become casualties, whether through injury, arrest, or death. The situation sparked a fire in Mary. **She vowed to get an education and leave her neighborhood** **for a chance at a better life.**

#### A Death in the Family

Mary’s parents, Kenneth and Alma, had similar ideas about getting out. Shortly after the turmoil ended, they purchased a three-story row house in a nicer neighborhood close by. However, life had other plans for the family. Alma suffered kidney failure shortly after the move and began dialysis treatments. Also around this time, **Mary became pregnant with Tony when she was sixteen.** Alma was adamant that Mary’s pregnancy not destroy her chances at an education and promised to be there to help Mary raise her child.

For a minute, it looked like Alma would be able to keep her promise. The hospital had found a long-awaited kidney for her. Mary had given birth by the time Alma went in for surgery. Without her mother around to help, Mary struggled. Tony was a fussy baby, and she’d lost all connection with the social world. Tony’s father didn’t want to be involved, and Mary’s father was little help because of his struggle with alcoholism.

Unfortunately, **Alma rejected the new kidney and died at the hospital three days after her surgery**. Alma’s parents moved into the house and helped raised all eight children. Mary was the first to leave, making good on her promise to get an education and change her life.

#### An Eye Toward the Future

**Mary’s dream was to earn a college diploma.** After she graduated from high school, she worked toward an associate’s degree at the Community College of Baltimore. She had her sights set on Johns Hopkins University, which stood only a few miles away geographically. However, psychologically, the school felt a million miles away.

Johns Hopkins was a prestigious university for mostly affluent students from out of town. But Mary tempted fate and applied. Her heart soared when she received her acceptance letter.

Mary had started working as a secretary at Bayview Medical Center. She earned $6.50 an hour, and with the Pell Grant, she was able to cover part-time tuition and support her household, which now included Wes.****

#### Wes and His Father

Mary met Bernard, Wes’s father, at Bayview when he came to visit one of her co-workers. He took an immediate shine to her. The two grew close quickly, and within two months, Mary was pregnant with Wes.

Unlike Mary, Bernard hadn’t graduated from high school and didn’t have a stable employment.**** He was a heavy drinker and abusive. **By the time Wes was born, he was already out of Mary’s life.**

When Mary and Wes arrived at his grandmother’s house six years later, Wes received the surprise of his life. The smell of fried chicken was in the air as Wes ran through the house. He stopped cold once he reached the living room.

Slumped on the couch stinking of booze was a strange man. The two stared at each other for a long time until Mary broke the silence by entering the room. With a cold demeanor, **Mary introduced Wes to his father for the first time.**
