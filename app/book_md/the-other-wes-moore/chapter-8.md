## Chapter 8: 2000

### Wes Moore

**Moore hadn’t been sure what to do with his life after he earned his associate’s degree** from the Valley Forge junior college. His advisor had suggested he meet with a friend of hers who worked as the assistant director of admissions for Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins seemed like a long shot. It didn’t seem like the right place for Moore, but he agreed to meet with his advisor’s friend anyway.

Moore was surprised to meet Paul White, a friendly and animated black man.**** The two talked over a long lunch. Moore told Paul about his history, and Paul told Moore about the university and how it could be a good fit for him. **Moore was sold on Johns Hopkins, but he still never thought he’d get in.**

#### The Advantages of Support

Moore was sure his SAT scores would put him out of the running at such a prestigious school. Even as a military officer with an associate’s degree, his scores were well below the average. Therefore, nothing surprised him more than receiving his acceptance letter and scholarship offer in the mail.

Moore knew that Paul White had played a massive role in his acceptance. **Talking with Paul had made him more than simply demographics and test scores on paper.** Paul had heard his personal journey and gotten to know his disposition. He was a person for which Paul felt he could advocate for, and having that level of support on the inside had meant everything.

Moore experienced a shift in his perspective about the world. He understood more clearly how privilege, such as access to resources, more educational and professional opportunities, and more financial stability, helped people advance in life.**** Kids like Moore from the Bronx and Baltimore never saw an avenue toward a better life. Even if they did find one, resources were scarce and social programs to reduce inequality were often the most expendable at a federal level. How many students had seen their hard work and dreams die after programs like Pell Grants were defunded? **Unless you had someone like Paul to help pull you through the gate, the options for a bright future were dim.**

#### A Man of the World

Moore’s status and successes continued to increase throughout college. He was on the brink of graduating from Johns Hopkins University as a second lieutenant in the Army Reserve and completing his second internship with the mayor of Baltimore City.

Moore had been working for Mayor Schmoke since returning to Baltimore two years earlier. At one of their final meetings, **Mayor Schmoke suggested he apply for a Rhodes Scholarship after graduation.** Some of the most important and influential people had been Rhodes Scholars, including the mayor and Bill Clinton. The mayor also knew that Moore was spending his final semester studying abroad in South Africa. He advised Moore to take in as much as he could about the legacy of apartheid and find a way to bring that experience into his application.

What Moore didn’t understand was that Cecil Rhodes, the founder of the scholarship, was a white racist. Schmoke was telling Moore to immerse himself in the legacy of racism and find his place in the world despite it. **Like Colin Powell, Schmoke was guiding Moore to create meaning out of the oppression blacks had suffered for centuries.**

#### A Fish Out of Water

**Moore was placed with a black family in Langa, one of the oldest townships in South Africa.** During apartheid, the townships were the designated segregated areas in which blacks were allowed to live. Despite the end of apartheid only half a decade earlier, economic inequality was severe between the black and white residents. Segregation was now a social construct, rather than a legal requirement.

Langa reminded Moore of Baltimore and the Bronx. He saw black people suffering and being more or less stuck without a clear path for change. The only difference was that poverty in the townships outdid anything Moore had seen in America.

Moore’s host family was made up of a mother, a son a few years younger than Moore, and an eight-year-old daughter. They welcomed Moore like family. Moore and the mother, whom he called “Mama,” talked for hours about the history of apartheid and South Africa. Moore was horrified by the stories she told. He asked how she could be so full of love and forgiveness instead of rage and resentment. Her simple answer, “Because [Nelson] Mandela asked us to,” blew his mind wide open.

**Moore realized that humanity was more than just a word to represent people living among each other. It was a way of life.** Humanity meant respecting each other’s lives, knowing when to fight and when to come together. His outlook on the world changed, and he felt a stronger connection to the name chosen by his late father.****

#### Enlightenment Abroad, Trouble Back Home

Toward the end of Moore’s time in South Africa, he spoke to Joy on the phone and heard some interesting news. **A man with his name and from his old neighborhood was wanted for the grizzly murder of an off-duty police officer.**

This news wasn’t surprising beyond the similarity in names. Young men from impoverished communities often entered the system for one crime or another. Like his friend Shea, multitudes of young black men fell through the cracks and wound up behind bars. It wasn’t until a conversation with his host-brother, Zinzi, that Moore started thinking about the young men back home differently.****

Zinzi was seventeen and preparing to be exiled for four weeks in the wild for the traditional ceremony of moving from boy to man. In Xhosa tradition, the tribe of Moore’s host family, adolescent boys were circumcised and taught the history of their tribe from tribal elders, including the struggles and perseverance of Xhosa leaders. They were taught to be good men, good fathers, and respectable husbands. They prayed and healed together over the month and returned home as men.

**When these men returned home, they wore white for a month to symbolize their transformation and were celebrated by a feast in their communities.** As Zinzi told Moore about this ritual, Moore saw a man dressed in white. His features were those of a boy, but he carried himself with an air of dignity and wisdom. Moore noticed how confident and sturdy this young man appeared and how Zinzi still lacked that demeanor.

Again, Moore was struck with the similarities and differences between life for young black men in South Africa and those at home. Both groups struggled to survive a life of poverty, crime, oppression, and low expectations. But in South Africa, the young men were supported and guided by their communities toward a better future. The movement from childhood to adulthood was celebrated and respected. In America, when a young black boy comes of age, they are feared and assumed to be more dangerous than before.

For one nation, the legacy of pain was a catalyst for growth. For the other, the legacy of pain was a catalyst for further division. **Moore was on the cusp of this transition, and he wanted to find a way to rewrite the script for young black men in America.** He wanted to take the legacy of those who’d struggled before him and use it to guide his path to manhood.

### The Other Wes Moore

The store was J. Brown Jewelers in Baltimore County. **Two masked gunmen entered on the afternoon of February 7 and forced everyone to the ground.** Two other masked men entered, smashed the glass cases housing the jewels, and put the loot in bags.

One of the people on the ground was the security guard Bruce Prothero. However, people mostly knew him as Sergeant Prothero of the Baltimore County police department. He was thirty-five years old, a thirteen-year veteran of the police force, and the father of five children under the age of six, including baby triplets. It was his day off, but he was covering for a friend.

Sergeant Prothero watched the robbers pillage the store and make their way out with almost a half-million in jewels. The masked men ran to two cars in the lot next door. **Sergeant** **Prothero ran through the entrance, gun in hand, and followed the perpetrators through the lot.** He hid behind cars, peeking up to see where the men had run to. He had no idea that one of the cars he stooped behind was a getaway car. As he raised up to look through the window, a gloved hand aimed a gun at him and fired.

Prothero was shot once in the head and once in the chest. He stood and ran back toward the store, but he didn’t make it far. After ten feet, he collapsed and bled out.

#### The Manhunt Begins

Baltimore City averaged three hundred murders a year, making it one of the deadliest places in the country. But in Baltimore County, murders weren’t as common, especially those involving law enforcement. **The jewelry store crime had hit two nerves at once, and everyone wanted to catch the vicious criminals.**

The day after the burglary, a wiretap of an uninvolved drug dealer led to the capture of one of the burglars when he tried to sell the stolen items to the dealer. From him, they received the names of the other men. This information led to the capture of another suspect. Both claimed they weren’t the shooter.

#### Collateral Damage

Mary Moore sat in front of the television one February night, unable to move and unwilling to answer the phone ringing off the hook. Her eyes were glued to the newscast about the grizzly jewelry store burglary from three days earlier. Her hands shook as she saw two pictures of the suspects and targets of a massive manhunt. The faces were those of Wes and Tony.

**Mary crumbled after seeing her sons’ faces on the screen.** She was sick about the dead officer and desperate to believe her sons had nothing to do with it.**** She couldn’t sleep, couldn’t concentrate on anything except the fact that their lives were going to change forever, regardless of her sons’ guilt or innocence. She hadn’t heard from her sons for days, but she knew the focus would soon turn to her.

At 4 a.m. a few mornings after the shooting, Mary put a robe on and ran to answer the door. When she cracked it open, two detectives stood on her front step and nearly a dozen other officers were in her yard and street. They had a search warrant.

The swarm of police flashed through the house, weapons drawn, in search of Wes and Tony and other evidence. Mary was led outside to the front steps. **One of the officers began grilling her about her sons’ whereabouts,** and Mary said she was also concerned about the location of her sons. She said she wasn’t a criminal and didn’t appreciate being treated like one. The police left, but they said they would keep coming back until they found Wes and Tony.

Mary wasn’t the only family member whose life was disrupted by the robbery. A couple of days after the search of Mary’s home, Nicey’s daughter was getting married. Tony was meant to walk her down the aisle, and her solo procession kept the crime and manhunt hanging like a cloud over the day.

#### Nowhere to Hide

**Twelve days after the robbery, Wes strolled down a Philadelphia street with Tony**. He carried a sandwich and a new pair of jeans. He spotted a police cruiser down the block. When they got closer, he saw two men inside speaking into walkie talkies. This wasn’t the first time Wes had seen the cruiser. Twice earlier in the day, the same car had been parked nearby in different parts of the city.

Wes figured if the men were after him and Tony, they would have picked them up by now. He kept walking without giving it much thought. The two went back to their uncle’s house in a rundown neighborhood on the north side. Wes went up to the room he and Tony shared and started to eat his sandwich. Tony said he needed to run out and went back down the stairs. Wes heard Tony’s footsteps bounding down, but he didn’t hear the door shut behind him.

Wes took another bite, then went to shut the door. **When Wes reached the bottom of the stairs, his eyes landed on Tony face first on the ground**. A cop was cinching handcuffs on his wrists. A pack of officers jumped on Wes before he could move and pointed guns in his face. The manhunt was over.

#### Retribution

A year after the shooting, **Wes sat at a table waiting for the jury’s verdict.** He was the only one of the four who’d gone to trial. The other three had accepted plea deals. In Tony’s case, his confession to being the shooter had saved him from execution. All three men had received life in prison without parole.**** Wes knew his fate would be the same if he was found guilty.

**Wes went to trial because he said he was innocent.** He contended he wasn’t there the day of the shooting. His lawyer defended him by saying Wes had been calm when questioned by the police when they canvassed his neighborhood. He hadn’t been a suspect at the time. The lawyer insisted that Wes’s only error was accompanying Tony to Philadelphia without asking what Tony was running from. The last line of defense was Wes’s conversion to Islam in the year he’d been awaiting trial in prison.

The prosecution fired back with eyewitness testimony that placed Wes at the crime, despite the masks worn. **The police had also found a necklace with Wes’s DNA on it.** The defense claimed Tony had borrowed the necklace.

The jury deliberated for only three hours. When they walked into the courtroom that day, none of them looked at Wes. He knew he was going to jail for the rest of his life.

Wes had never thought much about making plans for the future. His life was one of survival. On the streets, survival sometimes included a few stints in prison for possession and other drug-related crimes. But he’d never imagined this was how things would turn out. Now, **Wes thought about the rest of his life, a life without plans. His path was carved in stone.**
