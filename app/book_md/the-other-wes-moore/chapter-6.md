## Chapter 6: 1994

### Wes Moore

**Military school had grown on Moore.** With the help and support of Captain Hill and other commanding officers, Moore realized that people were rooting for him to do well. Somewhere along the way, he started rooting for himself. He was now a platoon sergeant, a cadet master sergeant, and the youngest officer in the corps. Young men now followed his command, and he commanded well.

He’d done so well, **the academy had offered him both academic and athletic scholarships** after his first year. The strain of the tuition was removed from his family’s life.

#### Homesick

**Despite his success, Moore still longed to be home at times.** These moments were especially hard when he received letters from his friends and family, such as the one he received from Justin one day. Two items of information hit him hard.

His old friend Shea had been charged with “possession with the intent to sell.” More than simply possessing drugs, the intent to sell carried a hefty mandatory sentence. The situation was not good for Moore’s friend.

The other news was more significant.**Justin’s mother was dying from cancer.** Justin was the only person still around his home, and his mother’s care fell to him. He was running back and forth between the hospital, school, and basketball practice. The strain of it was too much, and he’d started to fall behind in school.

The news about Justin’s mother fanned the flames of Moore’s already disrupted heart.**** His mother and Shani had decided to move back to Maryland, and he wanted to be there to help and protect them from the Baltimore he remembered. Now, he wanted to be home for Justin to help during this difficult time. **He hated missing out on the lives of the people he loved.** **He felt sheltered from the real world at Valley Forge** , but that illusion was about to shatter.

#### When the Real World Comes Calling

One Saturday night, Moore and Dalio, another platoon leader, had just put their platoon to bed and were rushing to make it to a pizza place before they closed. Dressed in uniform, they walked into town down a dimly lit street. They’d only been walking for ten minutes when a car pulled up next to them. **The boys peered into the car, ready to assist the driver they assumed was lost. What they found instead was a group of drunk white teenagers.**

The teens teased Moore and Dalio. One of them said he was the son of a colonel at the academy and chided the boys about their conduct and condition of their uniforms. He said he was going to report Moore and his friend, despite the fallacy of his accusations.

The car pulled away, and the two sergeants continued their journey to the restaurant. A minute later, the car returned, heading for them at full speed. Moore and Dalio jumped out of the way. The car stopped, and the boys started running. They were saved from another close call when a different car drove by.

At that moment, **Moore’s military training slid away, and the boy from the Bronx surfaced**. He looked at Dalio’s scared and bewildered face and said they were getting their pizza, no matter what. They moved to the shadowy edges and started speed-walking.

The pizza shop appeared across the street. As the boys crossed to the entrance, **Moore heard someone yell a racial slur at him**. He stopped, turned to confront the voice, and was struck in the face with something hard. Moore was bleeding from the mouth and had a chipped tooth. The car drove off, but he knew they weren’t gone for good.

#### The Turning Point

With Moore’s injured mouth and the danger of a hate crime sitting heavy in the air, Moore and Dalio knew they had to get back to the safety of campus. **Moore was conflicted. He was filled with rage but also embarrassed** to be treated like that in front of his white friend. He also felt shame at running away, instead of staying to fight.

Still, Moore knew going home was the right decision. He was from the Bronx, but he wasn’t from the streets. He knew the street code of “strike back harder” when someone attacked you, but he also knew the likely consequences of confronting a group of drunk racist boys. He might get his payback, but if he didn’t succeed, things could go from bad to worse to the worst.

**He also thought about the middle name his father had chosen, Watende—“revenge will not be sought”—and wanted to live up to it.** Remembering the night with the fake map, Moore told Dalio to follow him. They made their way to the field on the cusp of the forest, hiding behind cars and running through yards along the way.

They hit the forest and ran until the lights of campus came into view. Moore couldn’t help but laugh at the irony. These forests had once been a path to salvation away from the academy. Tonight, **the place he once ran from was now the place he ran toward with all his might**.

### The Other Wes Moore

**Wes was sent to a juvenile detention center for six months for the shooting.** The bullet had hit the boy in his shoulder, and it was a clean shot straight through. Therefore, Wes was only charged with attempted murder. His attorney had persuaded the court to try Wes as a minor. For these reasons, Wes avoided a charge of murder as an adult.

Wes started attending a new high school after his release, but he was two years older than the students in his class. He was behind in the basic educational requirements, and the school was too crowded and the teachers too overworked to provide Wes with the extra assistance he needed to catch up.**Wes eventually dropped out during his sophomore year** after Alicia had her baby.

Wes also moved out of his mother’s house. He was staying with his Aunt Nicey, who had strict rules about his behavior in her home.**** If he wanted to stay with her, he had to either go to school or get a job. **But Wes struggled to find a job with no education and an attempted murder charge on his record.**

To avoid Aunt Nicey, Wes stayed out of the apartment. When she was at work, he would rest and manage his drug business. When she was home, he pretended to be job-hunting. **Wes was now a lieutenant leading a small drug crew** , and he ran his business like an organized CEO. His operation was so successful, his crew was taking in four thousand dollars a day.

#### Lessons Not Learned

Even though Wes’s business acumen was strong, he was still immature and greedy. He was annoyed by the amount of money he had to turn over to the head dealers. He and his crew were taking all the risks, but the guys at the top were raking in the real cash.

One afternoon, Wes was hanging with his crew on their corner. He was about to head into the city to meet a girl when a lanky, clean-shaven man approached the crew. **This man was not someone they’d seen around the streets before. That was the first red flag.**

Another red flag went up when the man asked where he could buy some “rocks.” Wes and his crew knew enough to know that if someone seems like a cop, they probably were. They told the man to go away. But Wes couldn’t shake the thought of pocketing this man’s cash. He ignored the red flags and ran to a phone booth, placing two packets of crack in the change bucket.

Wes, again, tried to parse whether or not the man was a threat. But **the thought of profit shut down the warning signals in his head**. He told the man he’d heard (he didn’t remember where) that if he gave Wes twenty dollars, he’d find what he needed in the phone booth. Wes looked at the man’s hands when he took the money. They were smooth with clean fingernails, not the hands of an addict. Wes tried to play it cool. He pocketed the money and walked off. Then, he heard the dreaded call, “Stop. Get your hands up!”

Two police officers ran at Wes. They told him to get on the ground. Other officers suddenly appeared from other hiding places. Ten officers surrounded Wes. He tried to plead ignorance, but once again, he found himself in handcuffs. This scenario was becoming all too familiar. **He was no longer scared of being arrested, just annoyed that they wouldn’t leave him alone.**
