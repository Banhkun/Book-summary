## Chapter 5: 1991

### Wes Moore

Despite all of Joy’s threats about military school, Moore never took her seriously. Joy may not have taken the idea seriously either, but once she learned about Moore’s behavior at school, things changed.

**The dean of Riverdale phoned the house one night with news of Moore’s academic and disciplinary probation.** His grades were poor, his attendance was worse, and there’d been an incident with a smoke bomb at school. Joy listened to all of it with a stoic face.

Meanwhile, Moore and Shani were upstairs watching television. Moore was bored, so to entertain himself, he started pestering Shani. He punched her lightly in the arm over and over again, but she wouldn’t pay him any attention. He started punching her harder until she finally turned to tell him to stop. Moore was in mid-punch and connected with her face, splitting open her bottom lip.

Before Moore could stop her, Shani turned on the tears and ran to their mother. Moore sat in the bedroom waiting for Joy. On top of everything she’d just learned from the dean, this new situation would add fuel to the already blazing fire. He could hear her dragging up the stairs and prepared to explain everything, but there was no need.

Joy entered the room, but **instead of the tirade Moore was expecting, she slapped him across the face**. They stared at each other, Joy waiting for a reaction and Moore trying hard not to give her one. She pulled her hand back and slapped him again.

Moore had grown significantly with puberty, and he now stood five inches above Joy. She saw his clenched jaw and fists at his sides. He could see the slightest bit of fear in her eyes that he might hit her back, but Moore would never do that. He loved her too much.

Joy left the room, and both retreated to separate corners to cry.

#### For the Sake of the Child

After learning about Valley Forge Military Academy, Joy took her desire to enroll Moore to her parents. **They all agreed it was the best chance they had to save the boy.**

However, Valley Forge was even more expensive than Riverdale, and the family didn’t know how to afford it. Joy reached out to a network of family and friends, explaining the situation and asking for any help they could provide. Likewise, Moore’s grandparents searched for ways to gather the money.

For most of their lives, Joy’s parents had invested their earnings into their house. The plan had been to cash out and use the money to retire back in Jamaica. But with that plan no longer on the table, **Moore’s grandparents decided to take the equity out of the home and used it to pay for the first year’s tuition at Valley Forge**.

#### Get in Line or Get Out

**Military school was the last place Moore thought he would end up, but that’s exactly where he found himself at the age of twelve.** He received a rude awakening his first morning at 5:30 a.m., when he and the rest of the incoming cadets were called to order.

In his typical apathetic manner, Moore ignored the roll call and stayed nuzzled in bed. His supervisory commander came into his room and screamed for him to get up, but Moore could not be persuaded. He gave a flippant reply, and the commander stormed out.

Moore lay in bed, feeling cocky about his commander leaving his room. He assumed his Bronx bravado had intimidated the commander. He thought maybe he could make it through this new ordeal after all. He was drifting back to sleep when his door crashed open again.

**All eight of Moore’s chain of command superiors entered the room and dumped him from his mattress.** This was when Moore realized military school was no joke.

Valley Forge Military Academy was located thirty minutes from Philadelphia in Wayne, Pennsylvania. Moore quickly learned that who he was and where he came from no longer mattered. He and his incoming class were “plebes,” the lowest on the totem pole, and their histories were as meaningless as their birth names.

For days, Moore woke up angry and went to bed angry. He focused his anger toward Joy. He was mad that she’d sent him away, but more so, he felt hurt, betrayed, and alone. **In the first four days of being at Valley Forge, Moore tried to run away four times.**

On the fifth day, his sergeant commander told Moore that no one wanted him there as much as he didn’t want to be there. He gave Moore a map that would lead through the campus and take him to the train station in town.**** Moore was delighted. He made a plan to escape after bedtime.

At midnight, Moore grabbed his bag and headed out. With only a small flashlight to guide his way, he followed the map through a forest on one side of campus. He walked deeper into the woods, becoming increasingly confused and scared. He got lost in the dark and finally sat on a rock and started to cry.

A few moments later, Moore heard a rustling behind him and turned to find his chain of command laughing. It had been a trick, and he now knew there was no escape. When the group got back to campus, his commanders took him straight to their superior’s office.

New cadets were not to have contact with the outside world for a month to help them transition. This meant no television, no radio, no visits, and no phone calls. But when the superior officer saw the state Moore was in, he agreed to let him call home for five minutes.

When Joy answered the phone, Moore immediately began pleading his case. **Moore promised Joy he would go to school, do better, and help out more, but Joy calmly told him he had to give the school a chance.** She said they were all proud of him and hoped he would succeed. She also told him that too many sacrifices had been made to give him this chance.

#### Emotional Growth

The day after Moore’s great escape attempt, he noticed a tall and muscular black man talking with his superior officer while in line for lunch. Moore had seen the same man in the office the night before but didn’t know who he was.

After the two men were finished talking, the man, Cadet Captain Ty Hill, walked over to where the F Company stood. The F Company was the most renowned squad in the academy and made up of college freshmen and sophomores. Moore assumed Hill would fall back in line, but instead, all one hundred twenty members of the squad snapped to attention. Hill took the front of the line as their leader.

**Moore couldn’t help but be impressed by Captain Hill.** He had seen people in his neighborhood, like Shea, command respect because of their association with the gangsters, but he’d never seen anything like this. He now understood how different his new surroundings were to the Bronx. Respect wasn’t a product of fear or intimidation. It was earned through meritorious actions.

### The Other Wes Moore

Although Wes had been participating in adult activities, **his transition from child to man was prompted by another life-altering event when he was fifteen**. Wes had started attending Perry Hall High School in West Baltimore. The bus ride to school was twenty-five minutes. One day, he and his godbrother Red boarded the bus and saw two girls sitting together.

Girls were nothing new for Wes. He’d grown into a muscular young man, and his demeanor was relaxed. He also wore the latest in name-brand fashion and had added to his sneaker collection. **Wes was popular and went out with many girls. But he’d never had a serious relationship before.**

Wes and Red approached the girls, each choosing one to go for. Red’s conversation didn’t go according to plan, but Wes and his chosen girl, Alicia, talked the whole ride to school. She was older and attractive, and Wes asked for her phone number.

#### The End of Innocence

Wes and Alicia came together fast. They were both unsupervised after school, which gave them plenty of time to become acquainted. **After only two months, Alicia was pregnant.**

Wes didn’t know what to do. He didn’t tell anyone for a month, hoping the tests were wrong and the pregnancy would go away. But time moved on, and Alicia started to show. When Wes realized a child was inevitable, he told Tony, who’d recently had his own child.

Tony couldn’t help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. Mary had also given birth to another son only a year before. **Wes would have a baby, a baby brother, and a baby nephew at the same time.**

Tony promised not to say anything to Mary about the baby, but when the family and respective girlfriends gathered to celebrate Wes’s new brother’s first birthday, he wasn’t able to contain his amusement. Tony spilled the news of Alicia’s pregnancy while Mary was cutting the cake. Mary took a moment, seeming to steel herself, then continued cutting the cake without saying a word.

#### Like Father, Like Son

**Wes was bereft over the news of his unborn child.** Teen pregnancy was not uncommon in Baltimore, with one in every ten teenage girls giving birth in 1991. He’d never thought about his future, so he wasn’t worried about losing anything he’d planned for. The problem was that this baby would create a change in his life he was unprepared for.

Wes had only encountered his father three times, and the last time, a few months earlier when Bernard was passed out at Wes’s aunt’s house, Bernard hadn’t recognized him. **With Bernard as his only role model for fatherhood, Wes didn’t put much weight in his own responsibilities as a father.** In his world, Mary had done everything, and he assumed it would be the same with Alicia.

#### A Wanted Man

Despite his situation with Alicia, **Wes still engaged in dalliances with other girls**. Alicia hoped things would change once the baby was born, but she began to understand that Wes would not or could not be the father she wanted for her child.

Wes started seeing a new girl.**** They weren’t in a relationship, but they were sexually involved. She didn’t live in Dundee Village, but she often stayed with her cousin who did.**** The two moved from her cousin’s house to Wes’s house, wherever they could find time alone.

One night, the girl woke up frantic that she’d fallen asleep and hadn’t gone home. She rushed to get dressed, and Wes accompanied her downstairs to make sure his mother didn’t wake up.

When Wes and the girl got outside, a built teenage boy jumped up from the curb and started yelling at her. **The boy and girl argued loudly on Wes’s front lawn.** Wes watched with curiosity, then decided it was none of his business. He only wished they would be quiet so they didn’t wake up Mary and the baby.

Wes turned to go into the house, but the other boy grabbed him, threw him down, and started punching him. Wes wriggled free and ran inside covered in blood, but he had no intention of staying inside for long. **Once again, Wes’s hurt pride turned to tunneled rage.** He ran to his room, grabbed a 9mm gun, and stormed out of the house.

Wes searched for the other boy. By now, most of the neighbors were awake and watching from their windows, including a member of Wes’s drug crew. The boy grabbed his own gun and joined Wes outside. The two patrolled the street, looking for the boy. All of a sudden, the boy jumped up from behind a car and took off. Wes and his partner chased after him, firing as they ran.

**The sound of gunshots reverberated throughout the neighborhood.** Wes and his friend kept firing as the boy lunged forward, hiding behind cars as he made a dash for his house. Then, they heard the boy scream and saw him drop to the ground.

#### The End of Life As You Know It

Wes and his friend ran home and tried to avoid being recognized by the neighbors. Wes was pumped up from the chase, but he was also scared. **The one thing he wasn’t was sorry. He’d had to “send a message” after what the boy had done to him.**

When Wes got home, he discarded his bloody clothes and washed the blood from his face. Then, he went to his bedroom and hid the gun underneath sand at the bottom of his aquarium.

Wes grabbed a clean shirt and threw it on at the same time the sound of frantic footsteps reached him. **Wes waited in his room with his hands in the air ready for the police.** He was handcuffed, led outside, and thrown into the back of the police car.

The cops left Wes to collect statements from neighboring witnesses. Mary had woken up and was hysterical, crying and yelling at Wes through the closed car window. **She asked Wes if he had shot the boy. Wes stared at her without answering.**

As the police started to drive away, Wes asked if he could tell Mary something before they left. The driver stopped, and the window was rolled down. Wes called to his mother. **When Mary came up to the window, he told her he didn’t know the answer to her question.**
