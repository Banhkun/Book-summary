## Chapter 26: Build Resilience

#### September-December 1999: In the Arabian Gulf, then the Pacific

In the Arabian Gulf exercise, _Santa Fe_ was assigned to attack another sub, the USS _Olympia_ , which was playing the role of an enemy diesel boat. They were halfway through the deployment, and were preparing to fire the first submarine-launched torpedo in the Arabian Gulf.

A rear admiral was on board observing the exercise, which would demonstrate not only _Santa Fe’s_ abilities, but also the ability of a U.S. submarine to attack and sink a submarine in shallow water. The exercise was designed to send a message of deterrence to potential U.S. adversaries. It also was a test of the leader-leader model.

_Santa Fe’s_ crew performed flawlessly without Marquet’s involvement. The exercise torpedo scored a hit, which Marquet announced to the cheers of the crew.

Two months later, _Santa Fe_ had returned from deployment and was conducting an exercise with the Navy SEALs. The submarine was to pick up a SEAL team dropped by a helicopter, secretly drop the team near shore, then recover them after their mission. The team left the submarine and would return to it in inflatable rafts.

While maneuvering to pick up the team, _Santa Fe_ got into water that was too shallow. Further, Marquet looked at the controls and thought the ship was going the wrong direction to reach deeper water. He ordered the quartermaster, Sled Dog, to back up and was stunned when Sled Dog responded, “No, you’re wrong.”

Then Marquet remembered that the plan was for the submarine to be turned so it faced away from the shore while awaiting the Seal team, in order to make a quick getaway. _Santa Fe_ moved forward 100 yards into deeper water, and moments later, they spotted the Seals on their rafts. Had the crew followed Marquet’s order, they could have missed the pickup.

### Mechanism: Encourage Questions, Not Blind Obedience

**_Encouraging questions, not unthinking obedience is a mechanism for clarity_. **A culture that encourages questioning builds organizational resilience, or ability to resist errors. The crew had clarity on the mission and therefore the confidence to question the commander—and a mistake was averted.

#### Questions for Leaders

  * Does your organization have a culture that encourages questioning over blind obedience?
  * How can you create a resilient organization where errors are stopped?
  * Would your managers or employees unquestioningly follow a wrong order?
