## Chapter 10: Changing Focus

#### January 20, 1999

##### Pearl Harbor, Hawaii (160 Days to Deployment)

Marquet had been in command for 12 days when _Santa Fe_ headed out to sea after repairs and maintenance, to further prepare for the Commodore’s four-day inspection.

They were doing a practice exercise that involved locating an enemy submarine, monitoring it, and sinking it if they were ordered to do so. But **the crew was still focusing on complying with procedures and avoiding mistakes rather than on combative effectiveness**.

In charting the route out to sea, they focused on the procedures for avoiding buoys, shallows, boats, and other hazards rather than on determining a route that would take them to where the enemy submarine was likely to be. So they charted the wrong course for a successful exercise. No one noticed this because the officers reviewing the proposed route were also focused on ensuring the charts met procedural standards.

Marquet didn’t see the charts until they had moved up the chain of approvals, so he didn't discover the problem until the last minute—and then the charting had to be redone. He decided that in the future, to prevent wasted time, he’d have a quick conversation with the navigator early in the process to ensure planning was focused on the right objective.

### Mechanism: Brief, Early Conversations Prevent Wasted Time

To get the officers and crew thinking about operational goals, Marquet started having frequent, brief conversations at all levels. Once they were focused on the right thing, he could back off.

**_Having brief, early conversations is a mechanism for decentralizing control_**. The key for Marquet was making them useful without disempowering people. He was careful not to tell people what to do, but to just give feedback on what they were doing. The solution was still up to them. However, Marquet gave them clarity on the overall objective, or what they needed to accomplish. A conversation of a few minutes could save hours.

#### Questions for Leaders

  * What can you do to implement quick checks in your organization?
  * How often does your staff waste time and money going in an unproductive direction?
  * What inefficiencies or misunderstandings have you uncovered by checking in with staff while they are working on something?
