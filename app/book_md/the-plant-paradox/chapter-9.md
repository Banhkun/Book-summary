## Chapter 9: Phase 3, Making the PPP Your Lifestyle

Once you’ve restored a healthy holobiome, you can reintroduce some lectin-containing foods in Phase 3. **Phase 3 is meant to implement a lifestyle that you can maintain for the rest of your life.**

Don’t rush to start Phase 3, and if you’re particularly sensitive to lectins, you may not want to reintroduce them at all. You can safely and happily stay in Phase 2.

In Phase 3, you’ll:

  * Continue to eat all PPP-approved foods
  * Continue to avoid most off-limits foods (we’ll go into which ones you can reintroduce next)
  * Increase your ketogenic fats, which are in MCT oil and coconut oil
  * Eat less frequently and less food overall
  * Reduce your animal protein intake to 2 ounces (or fewer) per day 
  * Try intermittent fasting 
  * Maintain your body’s internal clock by aiming to get an hour of daylight each day
  * Avoid blue light in the evenings



One at a time, you can reintroduce the following foods and monitor your tolerance and any adverse reactions.

  * Immature vegetables (with tiny or no seeds), such as zucchini, cucumbers, and Japanese eggplant
  * Peeled, de-seeded nightshade and squash vegetables, such as peppers and heirloom tomatoes
  * Pressure-cooked legumes
  * Indian white basmati rice



### Cutting Animal Protein: Why and How

**Eating lots of animal protein doesn’t help you live a long, healthy life.** However, most popular health information encourages protein—some diets even put it center stage.

This phase of the PPP reduces animal protein consumption from 8 to 2 ounces a day. If that sounds like a challenge, consider this: Studies of Seventh-day Adventists (who are notoriously long living) show that vegans live the longest, followed by vegetarians who eat little dairy, then vegetarians with a regular dairy intake, and finally those who eat some chicken and fish.

Here are a few more reasons to cut the meat.

#### IGF-1: Meat Ages You

Your levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) are a key indicator of longevity—the lower your levels, the longer and healthier your life will be. Studies show that low IGF-1 levels correlate with low-sugar diets that include little animal protein.

When you have lots of food or your body thinks it’s summer (e.g. because of exposure to blue light), a receptor in your body called mammalian target of rapamycin (TOR) senses that energy is available and activates IGF-1 to prompt cellular growth; eating a lot of animal protein correlates with high IGF-1 levels. But if your TOR senses that there isn’t much energy—during winter, or when you’re eating little food—it reduces cellular activity, slowing the rate of aging in the process. In other words, **your food choices control how quickly your body ages.**

#### Fasting

Our ancestors fasted regularly, not by choice but because food wasn’t always available. Our bodies are designed to adapt to varying food availability; when glucose from carbs and protein isn’t available, your body can get energy by burning ketones, a special kind of fat.

If you choose, Phase 3 encourages trying different forms of fasting to cleanse your gut.

  * Go on a calorie-restricted vegan fast for five days each month; those regular spurts of controlled eating offer the same benefits as being on a calorie-restricted diet all month. To do this, you’d just follow the vegan version of the three-day cleanse (Phase 1) for five days. 
  * Try intermittent fasting, which means you’d eat just 500-600 calories per day twice a week, and eat normally (according to the PPP) the rest of the week. This tends to also help weight loss. 
  * Stretch the time between your meals, aiming to go 16 straight hours without eating each day. This improves metabolic flexibility, the ability to adapt to different energy demands.
