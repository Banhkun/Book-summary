## Chapter 4: The Seven Disruptors

There are Seven Deadly Disruptors that disrupt your body’s ability to heal itself and maintain its natural equilibrium; **disruptors alter your holobiome, throw off your body’s internal clock, and make you more susceptible to lectins and LPSs.**

In response, your immune system attacks the lectins and LPSs that have broken through your intestinal wall and goes into heavy fat-storing mode to hold onto as many calories as it can to fuel the fight. You may not know the war that’s being waged inside your body—all you know is the numbers on the scale are rising, or you’re not at 100 percent health.

As we’ll see, these disruptors are all around us, but if you know what they are and what they do, there are ways to avoid them.

We’ve talked about two disruptors already—whole germ agglutinin (WGA) and transglutaminase—which both contribute to LPSs breaching your intestinal wall. Here are seven more common disruptors to avoid.

### Disruptor 1: Broad-Spectrum Antibiotics

Broad-spectrum antibiotics kill your microbiome along with the illness-causing bacteria. **Your microbiome is a complex ecosystem, and when it gets altered or destroyed it affects how everything functions** ; it can take up to two years for your microbes to grow back, and some may never return.

With your natural microbes wiped out, bad microbes—that your holobiome would normally keep in check—can take over and make you sick. In addition, overuse of antibiotics has made certain bacteria resistant to antibiotics, creating superbugs.

Antibiotics don’t just come through the drugs you take; **most chicken and beef are fed antibiotics, and you consume the residue in their meat and milk.** This has two harmful effects:

  1. Exposure to antibiotics in meat can make you immune to similar antibiotics used to treat diseases. If you get sick, the resistance you’ve built up can prevent the drugs from working. 
  2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics make livestock fatter, and have the same effect on your body; the antibiotics change your microbiome, which communicates with your immune system, making your body go into attack mode. Your body then increases fat storage, assuming your cells will need the energy to fight off the invaders. 



### Disruptor 2: Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

As we talked about in the last chapter, NSAIDs—including Advil, Motrin, ibuprofen, Aleve, Naprosyn, Mobic, Celebrex, and aspirin—damage the protective barrier along your intestinal walls, allowing lectins, LPSs, and other objects to pass through to your body.

This creates a vicious cycle: **Your body attacks the invaders, causing inflammation. You feel the inflammation as pain, so you take an NSAID to ease the pain. The NSAID exacerbates the problem in your gut, and the cycle continues.**

Instead of NSAIDs, try boswellia or white willow bark.

### Disruptor 3: Stomach-Acid Blockers

Stomach-acid blockers prevent your stomach acid from performing several critical functions. First, stomach acid is so strong that it kills most of the bad bacteria you ingest before they can get any further into your digestive system. When acid-blocking drugs reduce your stomach acid, the bad bacteria can overgrow, further disrupting the balance of your microbiome and making you more susceptible to diseases like pneumonia.

Second, **stomach acid prevents your microbes from going where they don’t belong** ; as your stomach contents move down the intestine, fluids from your bile and pancreas dilute the acid and by the time it reaches the colon, the acid is diluted enough for your gut bugs to tolerate. But without stomach acid, the microbes in your colon can crawl back up into your intestine, where they can cause leaky gut syndrome or small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).

Third, stomach acid is critical to digesting proteins into amino acids so they can be absorbed into your body. Acid-blocking drugs prevent you from being able to digest and absorb protein, which can lead to sarcopenia, or muscle wasting. Furthermore, since lectins are proteins, **acid blockers inhibit your body from breaking down the lectins, leaving more lectins intact to wreak havoc.**

In addition to altering your stomach acid, most acid-blocking drugs are proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which inhibit your cells from producing the energy they need to function. Studies have shown that this can increase your risk of dementia and chronic kidney disease.

Instead of acid reducers, try Rolaids (a calcium-based antacid) and DGL wafers (chewable wafers made from licorice root, which promotes mucus production in the stomach and esophagus to protect against excess acid).

### Disruptor 4: Artificial Sweeteners

Although you may reach for a diet soda to _avoid_ weight gain, the artificial sweeteners it contains actually _cause_ you to gain weight. These sweeteners include

  * Sucralose (e.g. Splenda)
  * Saccharine (e.g. Sweet’n Low, Sweet Twin, Necta Sweet)
  * Aspartame (e.g. Equal and NutraSweet)
  * Acesulfame K (also in Equal and NutraSweet)
  * Neotame (used in commercial baking and cooking)



Before supermarkets and mass food distribution made sweet fruit available year-round, humans only ate sweet fruit in the summer. **When your tongue detects anything sweet—whether it’s from sugar, fruit, or sweeteners—your brain concludes it must be summer, which cues your body to store fat for the winter.** This has several harmful effects on your body.

  1. Your body not only goes into fat-storing mode, but it also craves _more_ sweets. Humans, like many animals, evolved to stock up on fat during summer to prepare for winter, when food is more scarce, so you’re wired to eat as much sweet stuff—and get as many calories—as possible. This is how **sweeteners make you crave sugar and ultimately gain weight**. 
  2. Your brain feels cheated when it realizes you haven’t gotten the calories from the sugar it expected, so it pushes you to eat even more sweets. 
  3. Your body’s circadian rhythms are thrown off because your food choices indicate you’re living in an endless summer. 



In addition, sweeteners kill some of the good bacteria in your holobiome, which allows for bad bacteria to run rampant. In fact, a study showed that one Splenda packet destroys half of your natural gut microbes. (Shortform note: The study gave rats high doses of Splenda. In order to have substantial negative effects on a human’s microbiome, she would have to consume hundreds of Splenda packets or over 100 cans of diet soda per day.)

There are several alternatives you can use instead of artificial sweeteners. But beware: While these are better for your holobiome, any sweet taste will prompt your body’s fat-storage response:

  * Stevia (e.g. SweetLeaf)
  * Just Like Sugar 
  * Sugar alcohols xylitol or erythritol (e.g. Swerve)
  * Yacón syrup
  * Inulin 



### Disruptor 5: Endocrine Disruptors

**Endocrine disruptors** —also called hormone disruptors—**mimic hormones (mostly estrogen), causing weight gain, early puberty, and a host of other health issues.** Endocrine disruptors include:

  * Butyl hydroxytoluene (BHT) is a preservative used in processed foods (anything with a shelf life that’s whole grain).
  * tert-Butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) is used in processed foods. tBHQ can actually prompt an allergic response to wheat, milk, eggs, nuts, shellfish, and other foods; the additive may be partly to blame for the rise in food allergies. 
  * Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in plaster water bottles, plastic lining in canned goods, and even baby teething rings.
  * Methylparaben is used in multi-use drug containers (e.g. a bottle of novocaine). Methylparaben can cause an allergic reaction that is often mistaken for an allergy to the drug. 
  * Parabens are used in sunscreen and cosmetics.
  * Triclosan is used in hand sanitizers, soaps, deodorants, toothpaste, and other personal care products. Triclosan alters your holobiome, killing off many important microbes, promoting obesity, and even stimulating the growth of precancerous cells.



In addition to the products above, there are endocrine disruptors in:

  * Cash register receipts
  * Insect repellants 
  * Hair sprays
  * Lubricants
  * Mouthwash 
  * Toys 



Disruptors can cause the following problems:

  * Metabolic diseases, including obesity and diabetes
  * Reproductive issues (females and males)
  * Hormone-sensitive cancers in women (e.g. breast and ovarian cancer)
  * Prostate issues
  * Thyroid issues
  * Impaired brain and neuroendocrine system development
  * Vitamin D deficiency, contributing to obesity and osteoporosis



#### Avoiding Endocrine Disruptors

Endocrine disruptors can be hard to avoid because they’re nearly everywhere, but there are alternative options.

  * Instead of Teflon and other nonstick cookware, use ceramic cookware or items that are PTFE- and PFOA-free.
  * Instead of plastic containers with BPA, use glass or stainless steel containers. 
  * Instead of plastic bags and plastic wrap, use reusable cloth bags or wax paper. 
  * Instead of sunscreens with parabens, use sunscreen with titanium oxide. 
  * Instead of hand sanitizers with triclosan, use soap and hot water. 



### Disruptor 6: Roundup Weed Killer

The common weed killer Roundup is widely used on crops that we eat and that become animal feed, so we’re constantly exposed to its chemicals and their harmful health effects.

Normally, your gut bacteria produce three important amino acids: tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine. However, **chemicals in Roundup prevent your gut bacteria from being able to make those essential amino acids, which help make serotonin (the “feel good” hormone) and contribute to thyroid hormone production**.

Additionally, Roundup causes other health issues:

  * Roundup kills many of your good microbes, including those that digest gluten; as a result, you can become gluten-sensitive. 
  * Roundup can bond with gluten to make it antigenic, meaning it induces an immune response. This can cause a negative reaction to gluten even if you _aren’t_ otherwise gluten-sensitive. 
  * Roundup paralyzes liver enzymes that turn vitamin D into a form that helps your body recycle cholesterol; without these enzymes, your cholesterol levels rise. 
  * Roundup contains glyphosate, a chemical that has been linked to cancer, kidney and liver failure, birth defects, digestive issues, infertility, higher risk of allergies, and other chronic illnesses. 



If you use Roundup and other weedkillers in your own garden, instead mix a cup of salt, a gallon of white vinegar, and a tablespoon of liquid dish soap and spray on weeds. You can also substitute Epsom salt for the salt and lemon juice for the white vinegar.

#### Genetically Modified Foods

With the rise of Roundup, farmers needed crops that could withstand the powerful weed killer.

Genetically modified (GMO) foods were created by injecting plants with foreign genes to make the plant more resistant to insects (by producing more lectins) and more resistant to Roundup, so that farmers could easily spray a whole field with Roundup and the crops would be unharmed.

However, farmers also commonly spray non-GMO crops with Roundup as a desiccant, in order to dry them out and make them easier to harvest—and the chemicals are never removed from the plants at any point between the field and your dinner table.

The Roundup-sprayed crops either end up in your grocery store or in corn and grain feed for livestock, meaning **you’re ingesting Roundup from both GMO and non-GMO crops as well as the milk and meat you consume.**

In addition, besides producing higher amounts of lectins to ward off insects, GMO plants produce new proteins that your body isn’t familiar with, so your immune system doesn’t know how to read the barcodes and attacks, causing inflammation.

#### How to Read Food Labels

If non-GMO plants still have Roundup, and organic foods still have lectins, it’s hard to know what food labels really mean. Here’s how to decode some of them.

  * **“All vegetarian feed”** is often used to label poultry products. However, these products still contain (most likely GMO) grains, pseudo-grains, and/or soy. 
  * **“Free-range”** refers to how chickens were raised. However, free-range or cage-free chickens are still legally allowed to be housed in a crowded warehouse, as long as a door is open for at least five minutes a day. These chickens are also likely eating corn and soybean feed. 
  * **“Gluten-free”** products have more lectins and sugar because of the gluten substitutes than the gluten-containing version. 
  * **“All natural”** may be on any kind of food product. This term has no FDA or USDA definition or criteria.
  * **“No artificial ingredients”** is a term as vague as “all natural”; ingredients that aren’t artificial can still be harmful. 
  * **“No cholesterol”** products contain bad omega-6 fats in place of the cholesterol. 
  * **“No trans fats”** products also contain bad omega-6 fats in place of trans fats. 
  * **“Partially hydrogenated”** products also contain bad omega-6 fats. 
  * **“Heart healthy”** products are determined by the FDA (based on fat, sodium, and cholesterol contents as well as the amounts of certain nutrients), but the criteria seem questionable considering that Froot Loops qualify but salmon and nuts don’t. (Shortform note: The FDA has amended its regulation to include avocados and certain other fruits and vegetables on the list of heart-healthy foods.)
  * **“All organic ingredients”** can include GMO crops as well as chickens that ate feed with arsenic in it. 



### Disruptor 7: Blue Light

Biology programmed humans’ hunger cues to respond to daylight—specifically, the blue wavelength spectrum of daylight. Not only are you wired to find and eat food during the day, but longer days also tell your body that it’s summer, which is time to eat as much as possible and store the fat for winter.

**Electronics including TVs, cell phones, computers, and tablets emit this blue light, making your body think that it’s constantly summer, putting it in perpetual fat-storing mode.**

Furthermore, blue light stimulates the hunger hormone ghrelin and the awake hormone cortisol, while suppressing the sleep-inducing hormone melatonin; sleep deprivation is associated with obesity.

#### How to Avoid Overexposure to Blue Light

Limit your exposure to blue light—especially during nighttime hours—with these tips:

  * Download a blue light filter app to make your device switch from blue light to an amber tint after sunset.
  * Use the yellow screen option on your iPhone or Android. 
  * Switch on the Night-Shift setting on your Apple devices. 
  * Wear blue light-blocking glasses when using electronic devices after sunset. 
  * Replace lightbulbs (in your bedroom, if not throughout your house) with blue light-blocking bulbs.
