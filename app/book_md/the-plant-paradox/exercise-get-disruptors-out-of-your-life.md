## Exercise: Get Disruptors Out of Your Life

* * *

Think of the last time you took some form of medical disruptor, such as antibiotics, NSAIDs, or acid reducers. What could you have done to avoid it, either by prevention (not eating food that causes heartburn) or an alternative form of treatment?

What are two or three simple changes you can make to reduce your exposure to endocrine disruptors (e.g. packing your lunch in a glass container or buying a different brand of toothpaste)?

What is one way you can commit to reducing your blue light exposure?
