## Part One | Chapter 1: The Plant Paradox

**The paradox of this program is that it calls for a largely plant-based diet, but hinges on eliminating certain kinds of plants.** Fruits—including vegetables with lots of seeds (e.g. cucumbers, squash, tomatoes, and string beans) which are botanically fruits—are mostly off the table. Shellfish and egg yolks, on the other hand, are just fine.

Again, this program contradicts what most people think they know about which foods are good for you and which aren’t.

### Lectins Are Plants’ Defense Mechanism

About 450 million years ago, plants began growing and thriving on the planet—until, about 90 million years later, insects and other animals showed up and became plants’ predators.

Just as animals developed defenses against their predators (e.g. skunks spray their attackers and gazelles outrun many predators), **plants developed their own methods of protecting their offspring—their seeds—to ensure their species carry on.** These methods include:

  * Colors that blend into the surroundings
  * Unappetizing textures
  * Sticky material such as resin or sap to trap insects
  * Making the sand or soil around them clump to provide a barrier
  * Attracting unappetizing grit 
  * Hard outer shells (e.g. coconuts) or spiky leaves (e.g. artichokes)
  * Toxins—including lectins—that poison, paralyze, or disorient predators or make the plant difficult to digest



While lectins may be powerful enough to knock out bugs, humans have a size advantage—but that doesn’t mean we’re immune. Our massive number of cells simply means that **you might not see the damaging effects until lectins have compounded for years**.

Our ancestors might have gotten the hint that certain foods made them feel ill or prevented them from thriving, and thus stopped eating it. But in modern times, antacids and other medicines allow people to keep eating food that naturally makes them sick.

### Plants Evolved to Spread Their Seeds

Plants produce two types of seeds: Those that the plant wants predators to eat, and those it doesn’t want predators to eat.

(Shortform note: When we talk about plants _wanting_ a certain result, we’re not suggesting they have conscious thought, as people do. However, plants have evolved to encourage the survival and propagation of their species—just like all living things—and react to their environments, as we’ll explore in a later section.)

#### Seeds for Eating are Low in Lectins

Fruit trees want their seeds to be eaten, so the seeds have a hard shell or coating to keep them intact throughout the animal’s digestion process; when the seed comes out in the animal’s excrement—essentially a nutrient-rich compost—it’s ready to grow. When predators eat these seeds (and later _distribute_ them) they’re helping to spread them far and wide, which helps the plant’s chance of survival. If the fruit were to simply drop on the ground below the mother plant, those seeds would have to compete for sun, moisture, and nutrients.

However, plants don’t want predators to eat these seeds until the seeds have fully developed the hard coating to survive digestion—when the fruit is ripe. Consequently, unripe fruit is a different color (usually green) to indicate that it’s not ready yet and contains toxins (including lectins) designed to make predators sick. Once the fruit is ripe, and the seeds are ready for their journey, the levels of lectins drop and the fruit develops its rightful color to alert animals that it’s ready to eat.

At peak ripeness, fruit has high levels of sugar, and the type of sugar is designed to maximize the plant’s chance of propagation: Instead of glucose, which raises insulin levels and lets your body know when you’re full, fruits contain fructose, which doesn’t send that message. As a result, predators keep eating more fruit—and more seeds—raising the plant’s chance of spreading more seeds.

Since fruits are naturally in season for only a portion of the year, this benefits animals by giving them a chance to stock up on calories during those windows of time. The same used to be true for people, but **now that we have access to fruit year-round, we’re eating more fruit and taking in more calories than we need.**

When you buy out-of-season fruit, it’s typically grown in another country, picked unripe, shipped, and then blasted with a gas that changes the fruit’s color to make it look ripe. However, fruit that doesn’t ripen naturally never gets the message from the mother plant to lower lectin levels. As a result, **when you eat fruit out of season, you’re ingesting large amounts of lectins.**

#### Naked Seeds Use Chemical Defenses

In contrast to fruit, plants that grow in open fields _don’t_ want their seeds to be eaten. These plants—including grasses and vines—don’t benefit from their seeds being carried far and wide; instead, they want the seeds to drop and grow in place, so that when the mother plant dies during winter, the new plants will replace it in spring.

In order to deter predators from eating and spreading their seeds, **these plants use toxins to weaken, paralyze, or sicken predators. In addition to lectins, which disrupt communication among cells** (as we’ll explain in upcoming sections), these toxins include:

  * Phytates (or antinutrients), which block the body’s absorption of minerals
  * Trypsin inhibitors, which inhibit digestive enzymes and harm the predator’s growth
  * Tannins, which create a bitter taste
  * Alkaloids, which also create a bitter taste (Shortform note: The author notes that alkaloids are found in nightshades such as tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, and peppers, which he says are all highly inflammatory. However, evidence doesn’t support that nightshades are inflammatory and, in fact, alkaloids have been shown to be anti-inflammatory.)



> **Plants Can’t Think, But They Can React**
> 
> Although plants don’t have thought processes the way humans do, these behaviors show that they can react to their environment and act to encourage their offsprings’ survival.
> 
> When a bug is eating leaves on one side of a plant, that plant will double the production of lectins on the other side of the plant almost immediately to deter the predator from eating even more. Similarly, one study of thale cress showed that the plant could detect when a caterpillar was eating one of its leaves and reacted by increasing production of mildly toxic oils and sending them to its leaves.
> 
> Additionally, researchers have found that plants have a “clock gene” that recognizes the time of day and produces more toxins at times when their predators are more likely to be looking for food.

### Lectins in Livestock

Just as lectins compound in our bodies when we eat certain plants, they do the same to animals—meaning that **grain- and soy-fed chickens, cows, pigs, and seafood contain lectins in their meat, milk, and eggs.** You also must be wary of these meat and protein sources, and opt for pastured (or grass-fed) meat; although grass still contains lectins, they contain anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats as opposed to the inflammatory omega-6 fats in corn and soy.

Labels such as organic and free-range don’t mean that the meat or produce is free of lectins.

  * Organic crops are grown without pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or other unnatural additives, and organic meats were fed organic feed. While organic food does contain more vitamins and minerals, that is completely separate from its lectin content. 
  * Free range animals still eat corn- and soy-based feed. 



**Farmers actually feed livestock corn- and soy-based feed because they’re so effective at fattening up the animals. The downside is that it does the same to humans** , even when we’re getting those grains and soy via meat, milk, and eggs.

Additionally, cows don’t digest corn and soy well (they naturally graze on grass) and suffer such bad heartburn that they stop eating. In response, farmers give cows calcium carbonate (the active ingredient in Tums) to relieve their indigestion and keep them bulking up. So **when you’re eating non-pastured meat, lectins aren’t your only concern.** We’ll talk more about the dangers lurking in your meat later.

### How Do Lectins Work?

**Lectins are large proteins contained in the seeds, grains, skins, rinds, and leaves of most plants**(gluten is a type of lectin)**.** Lectins have several harmful effects in your body, which we’ll explore in more detail in the upcoming sections and chapters.

  1. Lectins can create gaps in your intestinal wall barrier.
  2. Lectins that breach your intestinal wall trigger an attack from your immune system, causing inflammation.
  3. Lectins—sometimes called “sticky proteins”—bind to sugar molecules in your body and interrupt the communication between cells.
  4. Lectins mimic other proteins, fooling the body into taking unnecessary actions like storing fat and attacking certain cells. 
  5. Lectins help viruses and bacteria attach to their intended targets, so that people who are particularly sensitive to lectins are more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections. 



Everyone has different sensitivities to lectins; if your ancestors ate a certain plant, your immune system and microbiome have evolved to better tolerate that lectin.

#### Humans’ Defense Against Lectins

Humans have developed a four-pronged protection from plants’ toxins, including lectins.

  1. Your saliva and the mucus in your nose contain sugars, which lectins naturally bind to. Those sugars are meant to trap the lectins before they reach your digestive system. Plus, your body produces extra mucus to coat your esophagus and catch more lectins as the food moves down (e.g. your nose runs when you eat something spicy because chili peppers and jalapenos are lectin-containing nightshades). 
  2. Your stomach acid also digests certain—but not all—lectin proteins. 
  3. **The natural bacteria in your mouth and gut help consume lectins before they can interfere with your cells and create gaps in your intestinal wall barrier.** As you eat more lectins, your body builds up more of this bacteria; when you stop, the bacteria will disappear, so if you then resume eating lectins your body won’t be able to digest them and you’ll feel uncomfortable or slightly sick (this happens when gluten-free people eat gluten). 
  4. An additional layer of mucus that lines your intestines acts as a final line of defense to trap lectins and prevent them from interfering with your intestinal wall. 



Although this system is designed to protect us from the harmful effects of lectins, **if we consume too many lectins, they can overwhelm our natural defenses.**

#### How Lectins Attack

Lectins have a multifaceted approach to attack your system.

First, they work on breaking through the mucosal wall that lines your intestines. Lectins are relatively large proteins (compared to the vitamins, minerals, fats, sugars, and simple proteins that your intestinal cells regularly absorb), and they have to try to squeeze through tight spaces between cells in the mucosal wall.

However, if your natural defenses are worn thin, the lectins can bind with certain cell receptors to create a chemical compound that opens spaces between the cells to allow the lectins (and other bacteria and toxins) to get through, causing leaky gut syndrome. **Once lectins get through your intestinal wall, they can access your tissues, lymph nodes, glands, and bloodstream.** As a foreign protein, your immune system naturally attacks them—and you’ll feel the effects via inflammation and other symptoms.

Second, lectins are designed to mimic other proteins. This means **your immune system can’t tell the difference between the foreign lectins and the body’s own natural proteins and consequently attacks its own proteins.** Additionally, different proteins instruct cells to do different actions (e.g. store fat, or attack invading organisms) so mistaking the lectins for another protein can cause your body to follow the wrong instructions.

Finally, lectins can bind to certain cell receptors to mimic a hormone or to block a hormone. Hormones are proteins that attach to docking ports on cell walls to instruct the cell on what to do; for example, insulin is a hormone that instructs cells to allow glucose to enter for fuel and store any extra glucose as fat. Hormones naturally leave the dock when they’re done, but lectins bind to these docks and sometimes never leave, meanwhile giving wrong instructions (e.g. chronically storing fat) or blocking the correct instructions. This is one way lectins disrupt communication in the body.
