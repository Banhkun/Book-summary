## Chapter 11: Supplements

The fields where our food crops are being farmed and harvested have lost so much of their vitamins and minerals that **no matter how much healthy food you’re eating, you can’t get all the nutrients you need from food alone.** That’s where supplements come in.

Supplements can’t fix an unhealthy diet, but when paired with healthy, balanced eating—specifically, the PPP—they close nutritional gaps and enhance the positive effects.

These are the most important supplements.

**B vitamins:** Vitamin B helps reduce levels of a particular amino acid that can damage your blood vessel lining. Your gut bacteria produce many B vitamins, so if your gut bacteria have been compromised by any of the disruptors we discussed earlier (e.g. antibiotics and NSAIDs), you’re probably deficient in methylcobalamin (vitamin B12’s active form) and methylfolate (folic acid’s active form); in addition, more than half the people in the world have a gene mutation that inhibits their production of these two vitamins.

**Lectin blockers** : Despite your best efforts, there may be times when you have to—or accidentally—eat lectins. In those cases, lectin-blocking supplements can help tame the negative effects. These include:

  * D-mannose capsules
  * Glucosamine tablets
  * GundryMD Lectin Shield (created by the author)
  * MSM tablets



**Long-Chain Omega-3s** : Omega-3s are fatty acids that are essential to memory and brain health. You get omega-3s from fish, but few people eat enough fish to get a sufficient amount, so supplement with fish oil that contains DHA.

**Phytochemicals** : The phytochemicals in leafy greens nourish your good microbes and ease your cravings for foods that feed bad microbes. Besides eating lots of leafy greens, you can increase your phytochemical intake with:

  * Diindolylmethane (DIM)
  * GundryMD Primal Plants (created by the author)
  * Modified citrus pectin (powder or capsules)
  * Spinach extract



**Polyphenols** : Polyphenols nourish your good microbes, dilate your blood vessels, and prevent an artery-clogging molecule from forming from certain animal proteins. You can get polyphenols from:

  * Berberine
  * Cinnamon
  * Cocoa powder
  * Grape seed extract
  * Green tea extract
  * Mulberry 
  * Pine tree bark extract
  * Pomegranate
  * Resveratrol (the polyphenol found in red wine) 
  * Vital Reds (created by the author)



**Prebiotics** : Prebiotics feed the probiotics—or microbes—in your holobiome, while starving the bad microbes. Recommended prebiotics include:

  * Fructooligosaccharides (FOS)
  * Galactooligosaccharides (GOS)
  * GundryMD PrebioThrive (created by the author) 
  * Inulin powder, a type of FOS
  * Psyllium husks



**Sugar blockers** : Even when you cut out sugar and fruits, you’ll still be consuming sugar in the form of carbs and other foods—there’s no avoiding sugar entirely. To help your body handle the sugar, take a combination of these supplements:

  * Berberine
  * Chromium
  * Cinnamon bark extract
  * Selenium
  * Turmeric extract (with black pepper extract to help absorption)
  * Zinc
  * GundryMD Glucose Defense (created by the author; contains a blend of these.)



**Vitamin D3:** Vitamin D is vital to helping your body absorb calcium, but the standard American diet leaves most people vitamin D deficient.

If you’re on the keto version of the PPP, your potassium and magnesium levels will quickly drop, leading to muscle cramps. To remedy this, take a potassium magnesium aspartate supplement.
