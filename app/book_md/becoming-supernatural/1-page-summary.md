## 1-Page Summary

In _Becoming Supernatural_ , Joe Dispenza outlines a powerful plan for personal transformation. He says our subconscious mind is the most powerful aspect of our being, and we can use it to create the life we desire if we become aware of the power of our own thoughts. Dispenza uses anecdotal case studies and scientific data to explain how **our thoughts and the resulting emotions create our reality** and how we can use this knowledge to change our life to one of abundance and joy. He explains that this involves breaking free from old patterns of thinking by using meditation and visualization techniques to create a new reality and manifest your dreams.

He calls this “becoming supernatural” because you’re using the power of your thoughts alone to transform your physical reality. **It’s a process of recognizing that you are more than your body and tapping into a power beyond what most people are able to access.** This will make you appear to the average person to be achieving something supernatural.

Joe Dispenza is a chiropractor, author, and self-help speaker. His research interests include epigenetics, quantum physics, and neuroscience. Dispenza is also the author of _Breaking The Habit of Being Yourself_ (2012) and _You Are The Placebo_ (2014), both of which discuss the power of your mind for healing and changing your life. He is also featured in the 2004 documentary _What The Bleep Do We Know!?_.

This guide is organized into two parts. In Part 1 we’ll explain Dispenza’s premise that your experience of life is determined by deeply-embedded patterns of thought and emotion that can trap you in a vicious cycle of negativity. Then in Part 2, we’ll turn to an explanation of Dispenza’s methods for overcoming those patterns and creating a new reality for yourself.

Throughout the guide, we’ll compare some of Dispenza’s ideas to concepts and practices in long-established Buddhist and Hindu traditions, as well as their connection to the more historically recent New Thought movement.

### Part 1: Your Thought-Feeling Patterns Create Your Life Experience

Dispenza begins by explaining that our whole experience of life is created by feedback loops between our thoughts and emotions—which we’ll call _thought-feeling patterns_.**** He says **these thought-feeling patterns underlie all of your experiences and behaviors, so if you want to change your life, you must begin by changing your thoughts.** This means you also need to get out of some of your habits and do things differently—which he describes as shifting to the “unknown.”

The thought-feeling pattern works like this:

  1. Your brain processes information and experiences in the form of _thoughts_ which generate an electrical charge.
  2. That electrically-charged thought causes the brain to secrete chemicals.
  3. Those chemicals create the _emotions_ you feel.
  4. The emotions become stored in your memories. 
  5. Those emotionally-laden memories then affect how you’ll perceive, interpret, and respond to every subsequent experience you have.
  6. This means your _thoughts_ will be influenced, and the cycle starts all over again.



(Shortform note: Because every emotion we feel is the result of electrical charges passing between neurons, researchers say that what we call “happiness” (or any other emotion) is just electricity. And in a 2019 study, researchers were able to quite literally “spark joy” by delivering electrical currents to subjects’ brains. By stimulating a brain region called the cingulum, they were able to trigger a spontaneous feeling of calm and happiness in three different patients. What particularly surprised the researchers was that after this procedure, the patients were still able to recall sad events from their lives, but that recall no longer evoked the sad emotional response.)

So, Dispenza argues, when you experience something very negative or traumatic, as many people do, you can get stuck in a pattern where that memory and the bad feelings associated with it continue to influence your _thoughts_ in the future. Your brain will interpret future information and experiences more negatively, resulting in further negative emotions, and so on in an endless loop. So **to make your life better, you must learn to interrupt those negative thought-feeling patterns so you can begin to think and feel more positively**.

(Shortform note: Some of the negative thought-feeling patterns in your brain may be a result of childhood experiences that you don't even consciously remember. Childhood defense mechanisms may help children cope with fearful or uncertain situations in a way that helps them at the time, but which may affect them negatively later in life when that defense mechanism is no longer necessary.)

#### Trauma Keeps You Stuck in the Past

Dispenza says that the stronger an emotion, the stronger the memory associated with it, and this explains why it’s so difficult to overcome thought and feeling patterns connected to trauma.**Traumatic experiences evoke some of the strongest emotions we’ll ever feel, so they become deeply ingrained in our brains.** This means trauma keeps us stuck in the past via our neural circuitry, causing us to get caught in vicious cycles of negative thought and emotion—we’re constantly perceiving the present in light of what happened to us in the past.

Dispenza also explains that our brains don’t necessarily distinguish between an actual experience and a memory of one—in other words, every time you remember an experience, your brain essentially re-lives it as if it were happening all over again. So, **when you have a traumatizing experience, the memory of it can cause your autonomic nervous system to have a stress response, and when your body is frequently in this stress-response mode, it can wreak havoc on your health.** So overcoming these deeply-ingrained thought-emotion patterns is crucial for both your mental and physical health.

One key to overcoming these trauma-induced stress responses is to recognize that your autonomic nervous system operates on a subconscious level. This means that **any technique for interrupting and changing these patterns must act on a subconscious level** as well. As we’ll see in Part 2, that’s what Dispenza’s meditation techniques are designed to do.

> **Chronic Stress Causes Disease**
> 
> In _When the Body Says No_ , Dr. Gabor Maté explores the link between trauma and diseases such as cancer, ALS, MS, and common gastrointestinal conditions. Considering the links that have been observed between these diseases and stressful life experiences, Maté argues that **chronic stress is ultimately to blame—and this is frequently caused by childhood experiences of perceived threat that go unresolved**. This means that your negative thought-feeling patterns may be very deeply ingrained and difficult to break free from.
> 
> He recommends the following to address chronic stress from deeply-ingrained patterns:
> 
>   * **Listen to your body:** Start tuning in more consciously to what your body is telling you. Some signals of underlying stress include rapid heartbeat, frequent urination, excessive sweating, digestive issues, and unexplained pain such as frequent back pain or headaches. If you have these issues, try talking to a therapist or looking for meditation techniques to deal with them.
> 
>   * **Be your authentic self:** Many of the patients Maté treated were living to satisfy others’ expectations at the expense of their own desires and true selves. He says to recognize this in yourself, watch for** _guilt_** —if saying “no” to something makes you feel guilty, but saying “yes” causes resentment, Maté says you are living for other people in an unhealthy way, and you should choose the guilt. The resentment will be much more damaging.
> 
>   * **Connect with others:** Maté says we all need to develop healthy support networks. Copious research shows that lonely, disconnected people are at greater risk for illness, while social support alleviates stress and decreases risk of disease. So seek out stronger social support networks. Especially if you’re suffering, find others to connect and form emotional attachments with.
> 
>   * **Tend to your spirit** : A truly holistic approach to health must involve tending to your body, mind, and _spirit_. Maté says connecting with something beyond yourself could mean anything from prayer to connecting with nature, practicing meditation, or developing your creativity.
>

#### Shift From the Known to the Unknown

Because of this thought-feeling cycle that becomes ingrained in our memories and our neural circuitry, Dispenza says our brains are quite literally living in the past. Whether we have trauma or not, most of us are living in a state wherein our past constantly determines our present and our future. This means nothing in our life can change—the status quo is just reinforced day after day. He says**in order to make any life change, we must shift from the known to the unknown, thereby allowing for new possibilities.**

Think about your daily routines. It may go something like this: you wake up, have coffee, check your email and social media notifications, take a shower, get dressed, and head to work. At your job, you probably have a regular daily routine, and then you’ll go home and have your evening routine. Dispenza says that **by doing things the same way every day, we train our brains to always expect the same things** , so the same things will continue to happen.****

For example, if you expect your commute to work to be stressful, you’ll create that stress by anticipating it. And your whole morning routine may be triggering that expectation in advance. By changing your morning routine, or taking a different route to work, you may be able to avoid some of that stressful experience by allowing for the possibility of something new. In other words, **if you ever want something different to happen in your life, you’ll need to interrupt those habitual patterns so your brain can start expecting something new.**

Dispenza emphasizes, however, that **changing your external circumstances and daily routines is only one step in the process—a deeper internal shift also needs to happen to radically change your life.** This is where meditation comes in.

> **Tackling Fear of the Unknown**
> 
> While it's true that making a life change often involves stepping into the unknown, this can be a source of fear and uncertainty for many. For some people, the fear of the unknown can be so paralyzing that they're unable to make any changes at all—this is called _metathesiophobia. _
> 
> This fear can be so strong that it prevents individuals from making any kind of changes that could potentially improve their lives.
> 
> Someone trying to make positive changes to address anxiety issues may particularly struggle with this step, as these individuals may find comfort in their familiar routines. Some psychologists suggest dealing with these fears through hypnosis, and some of Dispenza’s methods in Part 2 resemble hypnotic techniques. There are also hypnosis methods you can try out on yourself.

#### Think Better Than You Feel to Improve Your Life

Because you can only ever create new possibilities for yourself when you are free from your familiar past and predictable future, Dispenza says you must learn to _elevate_ your thought patterns—meaning,**think more positive thoughts. This will then create more positive emotions, and eventually, a better future will follow.**

Dispenza draws on concepts from the _law of attraction_ to explain that a positive life change requires positive intentions. He says your intentions (thoughts) and emotions generate electrical and magnetic charges in your brain. The combination of these, then, becomes your electromagnetic field.**In order to attract better things into your life, you must raise the vibration of your electromagnetic field.** When you do this, experiences, situations, and people with a similar electromagnetic frequency will gravitate toward you.

Dispenza stresses that just having the intention is not enough. **To turn the unknown (a possibility) into material reality requires intention _and sincerely felt emotion_.** So, if you want to create positive change in your life, you need to generate emotional states that are greater than the ones you typically feel.**** And you need to maintain those elevated emotional states as much as possible as you go through life. This, of course, is easier said than done. Some techniques for how to do this will be discussed in Part 2.

> **The Law of Attraction**
> 
> While science does support the idea that our bodies have an electromagnetic charge, Dispenza’s idea that this energy attracts similar energy is called the _law of attraction,_ which dates back to the New Thought movement of the early 19th century. This concept is central to the book _The Secret_ , by Rhonda Byrne, which says that your thoughts generate a magnetic energy that will pull that same frequency of energy toward you.
> 
> Similar to the Hindu and Buddhist concept of karma, **the law of attraction can affect you negatively or positively, and it happens whether you are conscious of it or not.** Byrne argues that you can use this to re-create your life, by consciously directing your thoughts to generate the energy you want to attract. This process is frequently referred to as _visualization._ If you want to attract a certain kind of partner or friends to your life, for example, you should envision them. Think about every detail of the kinds of qualities they would have, and then believe that they exist and they’ll come to you. Then make space for that person or people in your life, and be open to finding them.

### Part 2: Meditation Creates New Thought-Feeling Patterns

Now that we know that our problems have negative thought-feeling patterns at their foundation, we need to understand what practical steps we can take to remedy these unhealthy feedback loops. Dispenza has developed**specific meditation techniques designed to interrupt those cyclical patterns and generate higher-frequency and more harmonious mental activity.**

In this second half of the guide, we’ll discuss some of Dispenza’s research into brain waves and look at how changing your brain waves taps into your subconscious programming. Then we’ll discuss why the heart is just as important as the brain, and how you can bring more energy into your heart center with breath work. Finally, we’ll look at a unique meditation method Dispenza has developed to prime your brain to expect a brighter future.

#### Changing Your Brain Waves Changes Your Mind

Dispenza’s research includes monitoring the brainwave states of his meditation practitioners. In the book, he shares images from brain scans of his students to illustrate how dramatic the changes can be. He says that **changing your life will mean changing your brain waves so that you have access to your subconscious mind.**

(Shortform note: Although Dispenza’s biographical information**** includes mention that he has research interests in neuroscience and quantum physics, his formal training is as a doctor of chiropractic. The brain research he describes was done in partnership with researchers at universities in the US and Australia.)

Dispenza explains that brainwave frequencies include the following:

  * **Beta waves:** In your regular, waking consciousness your brain tends to be in a beta wave state most of the time. This can include:
    * **Low-range** beta waves: when you’re relaxed and not perceiving any threat in your environment, but you’re still alert—for example, when you’re chatting with a friend or playing with your child.
    * **Mid-range** beta waves: a more alert state when you’re slightly aroused but not terribly stressed—for example, when you’re driving in an unfamiliar city or doing a presentation at work.
    * **High-range** beta waves: when you’re in a high-stress state, such as road rage or in fear because you feel threatened.
  * **Alpha waves:** Your brain is in an alpha wave state when you’re very relaxed, calm, and creative. You may slip into alpha-wave states throughout your day if you engage in meditative or creative practices that allow you to get out of your thoughts and into a calm “flow” state.
  * **Theta waves:** your brain slips into a theta-wave state when you’re in that zone between waking and sleep—or when you’re in deep meditation.
  * **Delta waves:** This is the brainwave state you’re in when you’re asleep, but very adept meditation practitioners can also go into delta-wave states while awake. 
  * **Gamma waves:** Dispenza calls this brainwave state a “superconscious” state. It’s a state associated with intense focus and transcendental and mystical experiences.



Dispenza explains that**** to tap into your subconscious mind, you must train your brain through meditative practices to drop into the lower-frequency brainwave states. This is because those are the states in which you access your deepest subconscious programming. He says **when your brain waves change from beta to alpha, theta, and delta, your autonomic nervous system reacts differently to the world.** Rather than responding to the world with stress and fear, it responds in a healthy way, which will keep you from responding to life through the lens of the past.

Additionally, Dispenza says that meditation improves the _coherence_ of your brain waves, meaning they go from being disorganized and inconsistent to moving in a more smooth and harmonious pattern.

> **Meditation Can Be Transformational**
> 
> In terms of frequency, **gamma brain waves are the highest-frequency wave** , followed by beta, alpha, theta, and delta (the lowest-frequency wave). Most people only ever experience brief fleeting moments of gamma waves, lasting less than a second—for example when you have a momentary experience of blissful surprise, like the first bite of a delicious food. But some very experienced meditators have been shown to stay in gamma-wave patterns throughout their whole day. This indicates that they exist perpetually in a different state of consciousness than the average person.
> 
> In their book _Altered Traits_ , psychologist Daniel Goleman and neuroscientist Richard J. Davidson discuss their experimentation on what they call “Olympic-level meditators,” which shows that**this kind of high-level meditation is fundamentally transformational.** Such meditators show little experience of fear or pain and greatly increased levels of compassion and empathy. However, they also note that the meditative practices of most ordinary people, while still helpful for reducing stress and increasing compassion, have much less profound effects on the brain.

##### Meditation for Changing Your Brain Waves****

To change your brain waves, Dispenza suggests a meditation that has you **focus your attention on the various parts of your body, one at a time**. Even more importantly, though, he says as you focus on each body part, you should also try to **become aware of the _space_ that surrounds those body parts**. As your attention moves throughout your body, and to the space around it, you then start to become more aware of all the space surrounding you—from the space directly around your body, to the space of the whole room, and outward to the whole universe. This puts you in a mindset where you become aware of yourself as a part of the whole, and it will shift your brain waves from beta to alpha and theta-wave patterns. Dispenza offers the more detailed guided meditation on his website.

By practicing this meditation regularly, Dispenza says **you’ll begin to feel all the potential that exists in the universe, and your energy becomes aligned with the universal energy.** This means you’re tapping into and attracting that vast energetic potential in the universe, and you’ll begin to attract everything you desire.

(Shortform note: In his book _Inner Engineering_ , yoga guru Sadhguru says everything in nature has the purpose of reaching its fullest potential, and all other life forms, from algae to spiders to ravens, do everything in their power to become the fullest expression of what they’re meant to be. Humans are the only creature that falls short of its potential. He says when you practice yoga, which is tightly connected to meditation, your body is like an antenna that can connect to the vast energy in the universe and is therefore the mechanism for giving that seed of potential within you the right conditions to grow into what you’re meant to be.)

#### The Heart Is Just as Important as the Brain

In addition to the brain, Dispenza says the heart is an essential piece of the puzzle because your heart is in constant communication with your brain and central nervous system. This means that, like your brain, **your heart is also a source of knowledge and emotion, so it’s important that it’s in a coherent state**.

Like our brain waves, our heartbeat can also be either inconsistent or coherent, Dispenza explains. A coherent heartbeat is more conducive to peaceful and positive emotions and raises your electromagnetic vibration. So your negative thought-feeling patterns are reflected in your heart as well. This means it’s important to**activate your “heart center,” which means resting your attention on your heart in meditation in order to bring positive energy to it.**

Dispenza illustrates the importance of the heart by describing some case studies of heart transplant patients who experienced subtle changes in their personalities after receiving a transplant. In one case, a woman who received a heart transplant from a young man developed cravings for specific foods that she had never craved before, and she later found out they were the favorite foods of the heart donor. According to Dispenza, this means **there is knowledge stored in our hearts as well as our brains.**

> **The Benefits of Heart-Brain Coherence**
> 
> The Heartmath Institute has been leading research related to heart-brain coherence. According to Dr. Rollin McCraty, “Coherence is the state when the heart, mind, and emotions are in energetic alignment and cooperation.” **In this state, there is a harmonious flow of energy and communication between these different aspects of ourselves, leading to a sense of wholeness and well-being.**
> 
> When we experience heart-brain coherence, our thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations are in harmony, which can lead to a number of positive effects. For example, we may feel more centered, focused, and alert, with a greater sense of clarity and purpose. We may also feel more connected to others and the world around us, with a greater sense of empathy and compassion.
> 
> The Heartmath Institute offers resources for helping you attain better heart-brain coherence, including a video with a brief guided meditation, as well as a downloadable e-book with 12 different techniques you can learn.

##### Meditation for Heart Wisdom

To increase the energy in your heart center, Dispenza offers a meditation involving bringing your awareness to your heart as you breathe and set intentions. In this meditation, you’ll pay attention to your chest as it expands and contracts each time you take a breath. As you breathe like this, concentrating on your heart center, you’ll think about a positive intention for your life and try to generate a corresponding heartfelt positive emotion. (Shortform note: Dispenza’s website doesn’t include a guided version of this meditation, but you can find a version of it on the Insight Timer app.)

This exercise can be done for 10 minutes at first, and you can increase the time as you feel comfortable with it. Dispenza says **this will create a more calm and coherent heart rate, relieving stress and anxiety, and conditioning your body and mind to feel love and compassion instead of fear and anxiety.**

(Shortform note: In addition to meditation, another way you might try replacing fear and anxiety with love and compassion is through physical affection. In _The Body Keeps the Score_ , Bessel van der Kolk says that physical touch, such as hugs, rocking, and massage, can create a sense of safety, protection, and trust that can relieve tension in our bodies and therefore create a calmer, more coherent brain and heart.)

#### Understanding Your Energy Centers

A third component to transforming your thought-feeling patterns is what Dispenza calls the body’s “energy centers.” These are what is known in yogic philosophy as “chakras.” He says**the body stores emotions in the form of energy in the chakras, and the way that energy is stored, and in which chakras, will affect your physical and mental health.** He provides a breathing technique designed to move your energy through the chakras, clearing away the negativity and increasing the flow of positive energy. Let's look at how this works.

There are seven major chakras in the body, in a straight line from the base of your spine to the crown of your head:

  * **The lowest three chakras** , which are located in the lower half of your torso, are associated with survival—they contain energy related to sexuality and reproduction, digestion and elimination, and competition for survival. Emotions like anger, frustration, and guilt tend to get stored in these lower centers, particularly the third center, known as the “solar plexus.” This is why you often feel these emotions in your gut. 
  * **The fourth chakra** is located in the middle of your chest and is associated with your heart. This center generates the energy of love, compassion, and selflessness.
  * **The fifth chakra** is located in the area of your throat and is associated with empowerment through language and expressions of truth.
  * **The sixth chakra** is located in the middle of your head, behind the space between your eyebrows, and is sometimes called your “third eye.” This center is associated with higher states of consciousness.
  * **The seventh chakra** is located at the top of your head and is associated with experiences of the divine or supernatural.



Dispenza says**most people tend to hold the majority of their energy in the lower three chakras, and this keeps us mentally in survival mode**. This means we go through life acting more on our instinctual drives than on our higher abilities. He explains that energy moves through your spinal cord via what he calls a “prana tube” and the goal of meditation is to move that energy from the lower chakras to the higher ones. Increasing energy in the higher chakras will shift your perspective from one of ego and survival to one of selflessness and connectedness. And he says breathwork can help you raise that energy, thereby increasing the power of your electromagnetic field and generating elevated emotions.

> **Awaken the Serpent Through Kundalini Yoga**
> 
> In this portion of the book, Dispenza is essentially describing kundalini yoga, though he uses different terminology for some of the concepts. According to kundalini yoga—which has its origins in the ancient Vedic texts of India—there is a powerful energy that lies dormant at the base of the spine, which is characterized as a sleeping serpent (Dispenza refers to it as a dragon). Through yoga practices, the serpent can be awakened and the energy directed upward through the chakras—or, energy centers—to the crown of the head, allowing access to a higher state of consciousness.
> 
> Each chakra is associated with different aspects of our physical, emotional, and spiritual selves and represents a different level of consciousness. When your energy isn’t correctly flowing through the chakras, according to this system, you’ll experience imbalance in these centers, causing the following problems:
> 
>   * **Root chakra** (_Muladhara_): An energy imbalance in the root chakra may cause you to feel a lack of purpose and ambition in life, causing feelings of stagnation and frustration.
> 
>   * **Sacral chakra** (_Svadhisthana_): Too much energy being held in the sacral chakra can lead to emotional explosiveness and an excess of sexual energy, while too little can cause a lack of energy and creativity.
> 
>   * **Solar plexus chakra** (_Manipura_): An imbalance in this area can lead to digestive issues, as well as anger, depression, and low self-worth.
> 
>   * **Heart chakra** (_Anahata_): When your heart chakra is imbalanced you may experience problems relating to others, such as jealousy, insecurity, and trust issues.
> 
>   * **Throat chakra**(Vishuddha): When this chakra is out of balance you’ll have problems with expressing yourself. This might manifest as a lack of confidence or timidness.
> 
>   * **Third eye chakra**(_Ajna_): An imbalance in the third eye can cause you to become overly egocentric, or the opposite—fearful of success. It can also cause headaches and vision problems.
> 
>   * **Crown chakra**(_Sahasrara_): Having an imbalance in the crown chakra can result in self-destructive behavior, thwarting your own progress toward enlightenment.
> 
> 


##### Chakra Meditation

To raise your energy from your lower chakras to your heart and beyond, Dispenza offers an energy center meditation. This involves placing your awareness on your lowest chakra, at the base of your spine, and then feeling the space around that area. You will then send positive thoughts and emotions into that chakra. Then, you’ll move upward, doing the same thing for each of the chakras one by one.

After you’ve focused on each chakra and the energy around them, you’ll visualize all the energy around your whole body. **This meditation should calm down your autonomic nervous system and allow you to raise the vibration of the energy throughout and around your body, moving the lower-chakra energy upward to the higher chakras.** Dispenza offers a more detailed guided version of this meditation on his website.

(Shortform note: Although there’s little scientific evidence to support the existence of chakras, medical research does show that breathwork can have a healing effect on your body by calming your autonomic nervous system (ANS). In _The Body Keeps the Score_ , psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk explains that your breathing pattern directly affects your heart rate variability (HRV), the balance between how your heart rate rises and falls. A healthy HRV indicates a healthy ANS, which allows you to stay calm in the face of challenges and also contributes to better physical health by keeping your stress hormones low.)

#### Kaleidoscopes and Mind Movies

Finally, Dispenza has developed some unique methods for reprogramming the subconscious mind to overwrite the existing patterns of negative thought and emotion, using kaleidoscope imagery and what he calls “mind movies.” He says**these techniques will affect you on a subconscious level by putting you into a trance-like state to make your mind more susceptible to the messaging.**

According to Dispenza, you’re constantly being programmed unconsciously by the messaging around you via television, advertising, social media, and other inputs you encounter throughout the day. This messaging can deeply embed negative thought-feeling patterns into your brain. To undo the damage of that,**his technique involves consciously choosing what messaging to put into your brain.**

(Shortform note: There’s plenty of scientific support for the idea that we’re being unconsciously programmed by the messaging around us all the time. For example, social media algorithms prioritize content that generates strong emotions, such as outrage or fear, as these emotions tend to keep users engaged for longer periods of time. Studies have shown that this creates greater political polarization and more negative emotions that can lead to low self-worth, depression, and anxiety.)

**The first tool in this method involves the use of kaleidoscope imagery.** Dispenza noticed that when he goes into a deep meditative state, he tends to have visions that look like the colorful geometric patterns you see when you look through a kaleidoscope. He theorizes that something about this visual imagery is indicative of moving into a transcendental state. So, using actual kaleidoscopes and a video camera, he made recordings of the imagery for use in meditation. The idea is that**** by watching these videos, the viewer’s mind will be triggered into going into a trance state, which allows for the brain to become more open to suggestion**.**

**Once the trance state is achieved, the viewer will then watch a self-created visualization video—called a “mind movie.”** Participants in his workshops are instructed on how to create their own individual visualization videos beforehand. Using movie editing software, the participant chooses photos representing their dreams and goals. So, for example, if you want to increase wealth in your life, you might use photos of the material objects that represent that wealth to you. Or if you want to find a romantic relationship, you’d choose photos of happy couples or anything else that represents that ideal relationship for you. A video montage of these photos is created, set to music the participant chooses—this would be any song that creates a feeling of elevated emotion for you. This then becomes your visualization video.

The complete meditation method involves pairing the kaleidoscope video, which you watch first to get your mind into a suggestible state, with the visualization video, which will embed that imagery into your brain. This primes you to become more conducive to creating that future, as your brain will begin to behave as though it were already a reality. **By repeating this activity regularly, any pre-existing patterns of trauma, fear, pessimism, and resistance will be gradually replaced with hope, optimism, and openness to a new reality.** (Shortform note: Here is an example of a kaleidoscope meditation combined with a mind movie.)

> **Mandala Meditation as Kaleidoscopic Mind Movies**
> 
> Dispenza’s use of kaleidoscope imagery is similar to the centuries-long Buddhist and Hindu tradition of using _mandalas_ in meditation. A mandala is an intricate, colorful, symmetrical artwork that represents the universe. The word comes from Sanskrit, meaning "circle" or "center."
> 
> Michal Beaucaire, author of _The Art of Mandala Meditation, _says meditating on mandalas affects our brains like this:
> 
>   * The designs and imagery create harmony between the left and right brain hemispheres.
> 
>   * This harmonizing effect on the brain is conducive to entering alpha-wave states.
> 
>   * Being in alpha-wave states can allow us to influence our bodies and minds to make positive changes.
> 
> 

> 
> But the mandalas in Beaucaire’s book, like many modern variations, tend to be composed of only geometric patterns (like this)—very much like kaleidoscope imagery. In addition to geometric patterns, traditional mandalas usually contain imagery of deities and other symbolism representing Buddhist or Hindu beliefs. These kinds of mandalas are used as a tool in meditation and prayer by providing a visual reference for the practitioner’s focus on core spiritual concepts.
> 
> For example, in the Buddhist tradition of tantra, the meditator focuses on each image in the mandala one at a time, envisioning themselves becoming that deity or symbol. In this way, they ideally visualize their own dissolution into the universe by imagining themselves as one with everything. This is a transformative practice geared toward the individual’s enlightenment. Because this practice utilizes geometric patterns to induce the trance-like state, _and_ simultaneously uses specific images to imprint symbolic ideas and concepts into the meditator’s mind, this traditional use of mandala is very much like Dispenza’s combination of the kaleidoscope and the mind movie.
