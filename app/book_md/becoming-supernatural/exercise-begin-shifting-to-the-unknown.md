## Exercise: Begin Shifting to the Unknown

Dispenza says that in order to make any life change, we must shift from the known to the unknown. Start taking some steps in that direction by breaking out of your routines.

* * *

What daily routines or habits do you have that you go through on “auto-pilot?” Describe those parts of your day. Take particular note of any parts of this routine that might trigger stress or unpleasant feelings—for example, your commute to work, or sitting down at your desk.

Now think about some ways you could change those routines to mix things up a bit. What could you do in a different way or different order? Could you make some changes that might avoid triggering negative feelings—for example taking a different route to work, or moving your home desk to a different location?

Reflect: Describe a time in your life when your routine was changed—how did it feel? Was the change your idea or someone else’s? What thoughts and feelings came up as you experienced the change, and did they last or transform?
