## Shortform Introduction

In the opening pages of _Eat Pray Love_ , Elizabeth Gilbert described the structure of her book. She based the chapter organization around the symbol of Hindu and Buddhist prayer beads called _japa malas_. The japa mala is constructed with 108 beads, and each bead represents a repetition of the meditation mantra to help meditators stay focused. Thus, Gilbert provided 108 chapters in the book.

In addition, the number 108 held other significance for Gilbert. Her year-long spiritual journey took her to three locations: Italy, India, and Indonesia. The number “108” is thought to be positively symbolic because of its relationship with the divine number “3.” There are three digits in “108,” it is a multiple of “3,” and the individual digits add up to a multiple of “3.” Specifically, though, dividing the book into three sections provided 36 beads, or stories, per section. Gilbert was 36 when she wrote this book.

Despite Gilbert’s mystical reasons for organizing her book in this way, the summary is organized differently:

  * _Part 1_ details Gilbert’s life before her journey.
  * _Part 2_ discusses Gilbert’s trip to Italy.
  * _Part 3_ describes Gilbert’s time in India.
  * _Part 4_ details Gilbert’s time in Indonesia.
