## Chapter 5: Learning to Walk With God

The meditation hurdle was a big one for Gilbert, but it wasn’t the biggest. There was an ancient Yoga scripture called the _Gurugita_ , or “Geet,” as Richard called it. The chant was 182 verses long and took an hour and a half to recite. It’s a conversation between Parvati, a divine goddess of creativity, and Shiva, a god and embodiment of consciousness. Their conversation revolves around the universe and its divine manifestation.

**This Geet was Gilbert’s true nemesis.** She’d hated it in New York and thought reciting it in India would help, but it didn’t. A moderate dislike of the words, tune, and length of the chant turned into a dreadful disgust. The residents were meant to sing the Geet each morning following the morning prayer and meditation. That it came before breakfast didn’t help matters. Gilbert often skipped the Geet. Instead, she meditated, wrote, or called her sister.

One of the main issues for Gilbert was that the Geet was considered a vital practice by her Guru. Everyone understood its power and significance. But she didn’t know how to get on board, so she asked for help from a resident monk. This monk was from New York and had been a professor of theater at NYU. He’d been a monk for 30 years and told things like they were. Gilbert asked to be let off the hook from reciting the Geet. The monk told her she was not required to participate. She had free will and could decide for herself. But he also said her Guru believed it was the most important Yoga text. There was the expectation that she would do it.

The monk reminded her that the Geet was not meant to be easy. It was a powerful scripture that dug deep within and burned your ego and demons down to ash. **The fact that she was so uncomfortable meant something beneficial was happening.** He challenged her to sing the Geet every morning of her last days at the Ashram.

For the next two days, Gilbert showed up for the Geet. Each day, she felt like she’d been run over by a truck. She was angry and uncomfortable and spewed her disdain to Swamiji, her Guru’s master, who was responsible for this ritual. She’d seen his picture and found him too powerful and intimidating. She tried to avoid looking at him or thinking about him, but she soon started to understand that his power was exactly what she needed. His presence challenged her to work harder, and she felt closest to him when she was brooding during the Geet. This realization is what caused her to risk injury the next morning to make it to the Geet.

Gilbert’s roommate had inadvertently locked her in their room. The Geet was about to start. For a second, Gilbert realized she had the perfect excuse to skip it. But a second later, she was dangling from her two-story window. She jumped, scraping her leg on the way down, and ran to the Geet. She took her seat, still bleeding, and tried to focus. A thought hit her. **The Geet was a chant of love, and maybe she struggled because she didn’t have a direction to point that love.**

When she reached the 20th verse, she decided to focus the words and meaning on her nephew Nick. Nick was eight years old and very bright and sensitive. He didn’t sleep well because he couldn’t shut down his mind. She loved him dearly, and that morning, she sang the Geet as a lullaby to help him sleep halfway around the world.

**Gilbert put all her love and wishes for her nephew in life into the verses.** Then, she started to weep. Gilbert reached up to wipe away her tears at the same moment the Geet ended. She’d made it through, and it had seemed like minutes. After that experience, Gilbert attended the Geet every day. She called her sister and learned that Nick was now sleeping without issues. No one knew what had changed, but Gilbert knew.

The next time Gilbert saw her roommate, she told her what had happened with the lock. The roommate was astonished that she’d done such a thing, especially because she’d had a dream about Gilbert that night. Gilbert was on fire in her bed. The roommate tried to help, but before she could, she saw that there was nothing left but ashes.

### No More Running

The breakthrough with the Geet caused Gilbert to wonder whether her plans for India needed to change. She was coming to the end of her six weeks at the Ashram and had big plans for her journey. She wanted to discover other temples, other holy guides, and other ways of finding God. She wanted to do touristy things like visit the Ganges, the Himalayas, Calcutta, and Mumbai. She wanted to visit the Dali Lama and ask him for help finding God. But all of that changed.

She remembered what she’d learned from the Zen teachings—it’s harder to catch sight of yourself in moving water than still water. Was she really going to find God jumping from one train car to the next and one location to another? Everything at the Ashram was designed to support her spiritual transformation. Richard said she’d been invited by God to jump on her personal train of awakening in a beautiful and safe place. Could she really pass that invitation up by stopping the trip halfway? After that, she made the decision to stay.

Gilbert understood the truth in Richard’s words. **Even though she’d had some breakthroughs in her ability to communicate with God, she still hadn’t mastered the art of intentional thought.**

Not long after, Gilbert caught herself thinking about her future during mediation. Where would she live after her trip? New York? Somewhere else? If she lived somewhere cheaper, she could afford a two-bedroom apartment. The second room could be dedicated to meditation. What color should it be?

This thought brought her up short. She wasn’t present in the moment. She was meditating on where she would be meditating eight months from now. She tried to bring her focus back to the present, but it was no use. So she decided to try a different type of meditative practice she heard about from another resident—Vipassana.

#### Vipassana Lessons

Vipassana is the practice of silent meditation for two to three hours at a time. You’re not permitted to move, not even to shift position. The point is to sit with the discomfort, assess it, and let it go. This practice aims to help you sit with discomfort in real life. Gilbert wondered how it might serve her life to be able to sit unmoving for more than a few minutes. She was the type of person who was constantly bouncing from here to there, making quick and rash decisions to avoid pain and discomfort. Was she even capable of being still?

She found a bench in the Ashram’s garden and decided she would practice her own version of Vipassana for one hour. Unfortunately, she chose the time of night when the mosquitoes came out of hiding. They started to assault her, and she questioned whether she shouldn’t try another time. But then it hit her—**the buzzing and discomfort of being stung emulated the constant disruptions of daily life. If she could make it through this hour, what else could she make it through?**

Rather than focus on the pain, she merely acknowledged it and let it go. She slipped into a meditative state for two hours. When she was finished, she counted 20 bites. They itched, but she just rode with it. After another 30 minutes, she didn’t feel any discomfort at all. For once, she hadn’t rushed to react. It was a small moment of fortitude, but one she’d never experienced before. And she was thrilled.

#### The Power of Intention

Gilbert continued to grow stronger in her practice. She’d often prayed in a vague way to God, sometimes even putting the ball in His court to figure out what she needed. But now, she was being more intentional in her prayers. She tried to be as specific as possible in what she asked.

She had grown to see that prayer was a two-way street. God knows what you need, but you must also know. That’s the point. If you don’t know what you want or need, how can you ever hope to achieve it?

Gilbert started to realize that destiny and fate were partly under her purview of responsibility. There were things she couldn’t control in life. But she could control certain things—what she ate, who she let into her life, how she spent her time, and how she used her words. But it was Richard who added her thoughts to the list. He told her that choosing her thoughts was the same as choosing what to have for breakfast.

With this new understanding, Gilbert saw that negative thoughts were part of reality, but what she did with them was her free will. **If she was willing to let go of emotional attachments to negative events, she could receive the negative thoughts and send them on their way.**

She now saw her mind as a safe harbor and started a new mantra. She would no longer give refuge to unhealthy thoughts. She sent a call out to the universe that the rules surrounding which thoughts would be pulled ashore had changed. There was a new sheriff in town, and he didn’t stand for mayhem.

### Deciding to Be Free

The topic of Gilbert’s marriage and divorce came up again during her second month at the Ashram. Richard had also been married and spoke of his ex-wife with affection, which made Gilbert jealous. Her relationship with her ex-husband was the antithesis of affection. Then, she learned that Richard’s relationship with his ex wasn’t friendly. In fact, his ex-wife hated him. So how could he be so content?

**Gilbert felt her ex-husband’s hatred like an anvil around her neck. The guilt and feeling of confinement because of his hatred was constantly broadcast in her soul.** She told this much to her friends at the Ashram, which now included a plumber/poet from New Zealand. Ever her sharp mirror, Richard asked how long she was going to let her ex-husband control her happiness. Gilbert didn’t know what to say except she wanted his forgiveness so she could be free to move forward with peace.

That night, the New Zealand poet took her to the top of one of the buildings. He gave her a note and told her to climb to the highest part of the building. At the top, there would be nothing standing between her and God. He told her not to come down until her feelings were resolved.

When Gilbert got to the top, she looked at the note. It was a list of 10 recommendations for how to let go and forgive herself and her husband. Gilbert lay on her back and stared up at the stars. She whispered a prayer and asked God to show her what she needed to see.

What Gilbert had always wanted was closure. If she and her husband could talk, they could come to real truths about their marriage and why it ended. They could both forgive and move on with their lives. But Gilbert knew that conversation was never going to happen in this world. Could she make it happen another way? She asked God to help her talk to her husband.

Gilbert fell into a meditative state and waited for a message. The message she received was to do what she wanted to do to find closure. If she wanted to talk to her husband, she should talk to him. If she wanted forgiveness, she should offer up her own. She could find closure within. At that moment, Gilbert asked her husband to join her on the roof. And he did.

She watched herself and her husband communicate as two blue souls of energy. Without the attachment to the body or the world, they each understood the other completely. Gilbert didn’t try to interfere but merely observed. Her soul was doing the work, and her physical body was not necessary. **The two souls circled each other and parted. Forgiveness was granted, and when she opened her eyes, she was released.**

### Who Am I Now?

Richard’s stay at the Ashram ended, and Gilbert accompanied him to the airport. They were both sorry to say goodbye. He said he could tell she was having a good experience. She looked different, lighter. But he reminded her that all of her pain and suffering would be packed and ready to go at the gates when she left. Then, he gave her one last piece of advice—fall in love again. **When she was done healing, she needed to find a way to open her heart up again to someone else. Gilbert said she would, and she knew she meant it.**

With Richard gone, Gilbert thought about what she was losing. She was losing a friend and the person she shared her feelings with. Then, she realized she’d been sharing her feelings with everyone. She suddenly became aware of how much talking about herself she’d done at the Ashram. She’d become a “Chatty Cathy,” even going to extremes of scheduling her social time like a New York socialite.

None of this surprised her. She’d always been a talker. And often, she was the kind of talker who interrupted people. When she thought about why that was, she saw the unhappy truth. She thought her life was more important than that of others. **She made a decision to stop the attention- and affection-seeking behaviors and spend her final two months at the Ashram in silence.**

The next morning, she scrubbed the floors of the temple in silence. Her mission was to be the best silent person there was. People would marvel at her silence. She’d become known as the “Quiet Girl.” But her best-laid plans were waylaid when she was called to the administration office. The administrator told her she would have a new job. This job required a personable, bubbly character who always smiled. Her new role was that of Key Hostess.

Gilbert laughed. Of course, as soon as she made this grand plan to become something she wasn’t, God stepped in. She remembered her teachings that God lived inside you. Renouncing behaviors or material items in the physical world didn’t change how God saw you. The only thing you needed to do was let go of the barriers and feel your union with God. Who you were would be divine.

**Gilbert saw that who she was as a person was not the problem. Knowing how to be her best self was.** She could still be a talker. She could just be a more conscientious and patient talker. She shook the administrator’s hand and happily accepted her new position.

### Finding Transcendence

The Key Hostess was the shepherd and support system for the attendees of a week-long silent retreat at the Ashram. One hundred people descended from around the world to immerse themselves in meditative practice. Gilbert was the one who greeted them, answered their questions, and addressed their concerns. She was the only person they were allowed to speak to. She likened it to being an activity director on a cruise ship.

**Gilbert loved her new role. Everything in her life seemed to have culminated in her ability to do this job perfectly.** She was intuitive and sensitive from her childhood. She was a good listener from days of bartending and working as a journalist. She was a good caretaker after years of twisting herself in knots to care for the men she’d loved. And she understood where these people were coming from emotionally and spiritually. Many of them were likely afraid of the journey they were about to take. Having just traversed this unknown territory herself, Gilbert could be empathetic and patient with them.

This intuition into their fears helped her see how brave the attendees were for making themselves so vulnerable. She found love for them and watched over them with care each day when they sat in silent meditation, seeking to achieve _turiya_.

Turiya is considered the fourth level of consciousness. The other three levels—waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep—are experienced by everyone. But this fourth level is the purest form of awareness. In this state, you are present with God and full of bliss. Many people have experienced this state at fleeting moments. They may not have recognized it, but for one second, everything in life seemed beautiful and perfect. The goal of life, according to the Yoga tradition, is to learn to live within this state contentedly.

Gilbert wasn’t meant to meditate with the attendees. But one day, while watching over their silent meditation, she accidentally fell into a meditative state. **Without even trying, she’d slipped into turiya.**

Gilbert had a difficult time describing what this state felt like. It wasn’t a hallucination. It wasn’t a major event replete with fanfare and bells and whistles. She described it as a simple occurrence in which she felt the deepest sensation of love in her life. She wasn’t thinking or acting. She was just feeling.

In this state, her heart was wide open and filled with compassion. She felt bonded to everyone and everything. Her thoughts were still there, but she heard them as background noise from a radio. They now seemed inconsequential, as did all of her previous ideas of who she was. Her whole life had been designed around the search for happiness. But here it was all along, inside her.

Then, Gilbert vocalized her desire to stay in this state forever, and as soon as she did, she felt herself being pulled out of it. She started to scramble, not wanting to lose the sensation. But each thought of “I want” or “I don’t want” brought her closer to reality until she was fully back. Her ego had returned, and she looked around and saw the regular world and her regular self.

Gilbert felt sad and anxious about losing that state of grace. But she also felt a different feeling. There was a new presence next to her. This presence was her witness, or the transcended form of herself. She understood that **her belief that the state of turiya could disappear meant she wasn’t ready to exist there yet. Her journey wasn’t over. She still had more to learn.**

### Finding Her Word and the Way Forward

Other retreat groups came and went during Gilbert’s last weeks at the Ashram. She continued her duties diligently and experienced turiya a few more times. These experiences changed her to the point that the retreat attendants said she was a stabilizing, peaceful, and spiritual force for them. She had to laugh. In accepting herself as a talker, she’d become the quiet girl.

The scorching summer months were approaching quickly, and the Ashram would soon empty out. Each day, Gilbert said goodbye to friends she’d made during her months there. There was a melancholy feeling in the air, but it was also bittersweet.

During her last week, she found more time to be alone. **She was okay with being alone now and could sit in silence for many hours.** Her meditative sessions swung between the overwhelming energy of the blue light and quiet calm. Either was fine. She no longer fought the sensations. Now, when thoughts came, she accepted them and moved on. She was so used to the ways of her mind now, there was no need to be confused or affected by it.

On one of her last nights, Gilbert couldn’t sleep. She crawled out of bed and went for a walk. In the garden, she could smell the sweetness of nature. She felt the warm breeze on her skin. It hit her so completely in that moment where she was—India! Like a fledgling learning to fly, she took off through the meadow and frolicked in the moonlight. She hugged a eucalyptus tree and kissed it with love. She saw God in everything around her and knew her prayers had been answered. She was pure joy.

It was likely no coincidence, then, that Gilbert found her word shortly before she left the Ashram. She was reading a Yoga text and came across the word _antevasin_. Translated, this word means “someone who lives on the border of two worlds.”

In ancient times, it was a literal translation regarding someone leaving the city to dwell at the boundary of the unknown forest. In modern times, it describes the figurative border between your old self and your new self. You never fully cross-over into the new self. You stay at the boundary, learning and moving forward. But there is always more to learn, so the new self keeps moving too. The journey never ends.

As soon as Gilbert saw this word, she knew it was hers. She’d always questioned who she was or who she was supposed to be. What was her role? A wife? A lover? An overeater of pasta? A lost soul? **Now she knew she was all of those things and none of them completely. She was a student of life.** And she would remain at the boundary of learning as she moved forward through the unknown.
