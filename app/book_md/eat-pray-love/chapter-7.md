## Chapter 7: A Future Comes Into View

Gilbert was given a reprieve from her dismal thoughts when she arrived at Wayan’s shop the morning after the party. Wayan had received word that her lease was up in a few months and the rent would be raised. She’d have to move again, but she didn’t have any money or anywhere to go. And she’d have to take Tutti out of school again. Each move jeopardized the little girl’s chances of going to university to study veterinary medicine like she wanted.

What made matters worse were two orphans Wayan had taken in not long before. The two girls, both barely adolescents, had been trafficked street hustlers. They’d been under the thumb of an adult who made them beg and then took the money. Wayan found them starving and brought them home. She took care of them like they were her own. **This act of compassion by a poor single mother was more than Gilbert could believe. She was in awe.**

Gilbert noticed Tutti walking around the store with a small piece of blue tile in her hand. She chanted over it and sat on it in a corner for a long time. Wayan explained that Tutti had found the tile outside a hotel construction site. She brought it home and prayed that she and her family could have a beautiful tiled floor like that someday.

An electric current ran through Gilbert’s body. It was the same energy she’d felt the first time she met Wayan. She realized she’d wanted to help this magical woman but hadn’t known how then. Now, she did. All frivolous thoughts about men disappeared. She had a new mission.

#### A Little Help From Her Friends

Gilbert left the shop and went to the Internet cafe. She composed a message to her friends and family at home. Her birthday was coming up, and she told them that if she were home, she would have thrown some expensive party. They would have bought her expensive gifts. It would have been quite the scene. This year, she asked them to spend their money a different way.

In her letter, Gilbert explained about Wayan, her past, her children, and her current situation. She also told them that she was happier than she’d ever been and owed much of that to her friendship with Wayan.**For her birthday that year, she asked everyone to help her buy Wayan a house.** She promised to match whatever donations people could offer.

The next day, she found that her friends had already donated $700. The day after, the donations outgrew what she could match. Everyone chipped in, even if only $15. A friend’s boyfriend, who worked on Wall Street, offered to match the final sum. Then, people started to forward the email, and soon Gilbert was receiving donations from strangers.

At the end of the week, she’d raised $18,000, which was more than enough to build a house for Wayan’s family. A friend pointed out to Gilbert that Tutti meant “everybody” in Italian. Gilbert couldn’t believe she’d missed it. She’d set out into the world to help herself and wound up helping everybody.

### A Beautiful Friendship

During the week of fundraising, Gilbert kept her actions a secret. She didn’t want to get Wayan’s hopes up. She continued her meetings with Ketut and Wayan, but she also distracted herself with her new friend Felipe. **She finally admitted she had a small crush on him after seeing that he was more than what he appeared to be.** When Armenia said Felipe had come to Bali to get over a divorce, Gilbert knew she’d found another kindred spirit.

Felipe wasn’t a real prospect for a relationship, though. He was 52 and had silver hair. But Gilbert was enchanted by this grown man. It was like encountering a new species. He’d been in a committed marriage for 20 years, had grown children who adored him, had traveled the world, and spoke four languages. He also said what was on his mind and didn’t play games.

One night, Felipe told Gilbert she should take a lover. With all sincerity, he said there were plenty of men on the island who’d be happy to show her a good time. But Gilbert wasn’t ready for romance yet. She didn’t feel like reshaping her life or body to fit a man. And the “getting to know you” part was exhausting. Then, there was birth control to consider. It was a lot to take on. Plus, her heart was still broken.

Felipe didn’t make her feel stupid about her feelings. Instead, he shared his own stories of love, marriage, and divorce. They talked about the depression that followed the ending of a marriage. They ate and drank well together and became good friends.

Twice, Felipe tried to give her a friendly kiss when he dropped her off. Each time, Gilbert turned her head away and nuzzled against his chest. **She wasn’t ready for kissing, but she hadn’t been held in a long time. She could handle being held.**

As Gilbert became more comfortable with Felipe, she started inviting him to meet her friends. Ketut read his palm and was less than sly when he told her that Felipe was a _very good man_. She also introduced him to Wayan, who gave her approval as well. Gilbert still wasn’t interested in him romantically. But she was able to stop thinking about other men, and that was everything.

### Letting Fate Be Your Guide

After two months in Bali, Gilbert finally made it to the beach. She and Felipe drove to the coast one Sunday and spent the whole day talking, playing in the waves, napping, and reading to each other. They drank beers and filled in the gaps of their life stories. Ten hours passed and the sun went down. But neither was ready to leave.

Gilbert linked her arm through Felipe’s as they walked through a nearby fishing village. During this walk, Felipe finally asked if they should have an affair. He asked it as casually as if he’d asked for the time. Gilbert liked the way he asked this question. There was no awkward attempt at intimacy or drama. Still, she didn’t know how to answer.

**She told Felipe that she was interested but had promised to stay celibate and focused on improving her life.** She didn’t want to thwart her progress and transformation by getting involved with someone. And she didn’t want to lose herself again. Felipe listened and understood. He said they would remain friends, but he still wanted a chance to convince her.

Felipe told her that he was not a man she had to fear. He already knew her life story, and he didn’t want anything from her that she didn’t want to give. He also had experienced broken hearts, and he wasn’t interested in putting either of them through that again. He wasn’t looking for long-term promises or planning on coming back to the States with her. But he had to admit that he’d never enjoyed being with someone as much as he enjoyed being with her. Gilbert thought his declaration was incredibly romantic. But she still said no.

That night, Gilbert went to bed alone and thought about her history with men. She’d always made fast decisions and tried to see the best in the men she was with. She assumed they wanted to become their best selves, so she waited around for it. But she never asked what they really wanted from life or what their intentions were for their relationship with her. She had to start acting like her own overprotective brother or father. She had to question whether a suitor was worthwhile. She felt that Felipe was a worthwhile suitor, but she knew she wasn’t ready.

In the morning, **Gilbert chanted the entire Gurugita and meditated. Her sense of dissatisfaction and imbalance faded away.** Happiness came into her heart again, and she felt full of God’s love. At that moment, she knew she’d made the right decision to turn Felipe down.

### No More Fear

The next night, Gilbert went to Felipe’s for dinner. They relaxed afterwards and talked for hours. Then, Felipe moved close and said there’d been enough talking. He again asked her to come to his bed. This time, Gilbert didn’t argue.

Before making love, Felipe said he didn’t want anything from her except to shower her with affection for as long as he could. Gilbert nodded, suddenly unable to speak. She had no more words to persuade either of them away from this moment. **She’d been alone for a long time. It was time to feel something else.**

Gilbert’s memory of that night is a bit hazy. What she remembers most is the mosquito net around the bed. She imagined that it was a parachute carrying her safely through the air after jumping out of her private jet of solitude. She felt like she was free-floating between her past and future, and she landed safely in the arms of her Brazilian lover.

Felipe was sorry to learn that Gilbert had to leave early the next morning. She’d promised to go on a road trip with Yudhi, a sort of American-style cross-country journey. Of course, the small island of Bali didn’t afford such adventures, but they would do their best.

Gilbert felt a pang of regret that she had to leave Felipe’s inviting bed, but she was also slightly relieved. She needed to step back and look at what had occurred. **She’d broken her vow of celibacy, and she wanted time to adjust her perspective on life.** A week away was the perfect thing.

She and Yudhi stuck to the coastal roads and bounced from beach to beach. They ate junk food and spoke American. This was a nice break for Gilbert. She’d been speaking a lot of English, but she missed the vernacular and nuance of American English. They spent hours on the beach, forgetting for a minute where they were. They drove, listened to American music, and ate pizza wherever they found it. In the evenings, they wandered into towns and became immersed in whatever local ceremony was occurring.

Gilbert called Felipe daily from the road. He told her he was falling in love with her, something he hadn’t felt for almost 30 years. Gilbert was apprehensive. She wasn’t ready for love yet. But he assured her, his love came with no strings. He was prepared to be destroyed by her. He only wanted to enjoy her while she was still there.

This heady place of romance filled her head along the road trip. But she came back down to earth when she and Yudhi talked about New York. They spent the last day on a beach talking about the city and their memories there. **Yudhi’s longing was so intense, it made Gilbert homesick for the first time.** She had to remind herself that she could go back whenever she wanted, something Yudhi was not free to do.

### New Awakenings

Gilbert didn’t leave Felipe’s for almost a month after her trip. She’d never experienced love and affection like that before. She’d never felt so free during the act of lovemaking. Their bodies fit perfectly together, like magnets. He whispered intimate statements in her ears, which helped her pick up a little Portuguese.

Gilbert enjoyed this new sense of timeless drifting, which was so different from her usual organized mind. Still, she made time to meditate every morning. She was in such a state of calm and contentment, she was able to slip into meditation within seconds. **She no longer could remember why she thought life was such a struggle.**

She also finally went back to visit Ketut after a lengthy absence. Ketut took one look at her and understood what she’d experienced. He was happy for her but warned her not to get pregnant.

She also visited Wayan again. Wayan was happy for her friend. The beginning of a love story was so exciting. She said part of a balanced existence required losing yourself to love every now and then. She also warned Gilbert not to get pregnant. Gilbert assured her it was impossible. Felipe had had a vasectomy.

To change the conversation, Gilbert asked Wayan about the new house. When Gilbert had finally told Wayan about her fundraiser, Wayan had seemed pained. The shock of the gesture and the sum of money seemed to cause her grief. And when the news finally sunk in, Wayan’s first response was to offer her new home to everyone. She made Gilbert promise that each one of the people who helped her knew they'd be welcomed in her home.

Wayan became caught in fantasizing about her new home. She would have a place for her medical texts, a garden, a real restaurant, and an address that guide books could finally list for tourists. There was a piece of land in a nearby village picked out in her mind, and there was a good school close to it.

That day, Wayan had wondered what she would have done if Gilbert had never come there. **Gilbert knew she was always going to be there. Their story was all already written by God.** But this fateful gesture became tainted when Wayan told Gilbert she hadn’t bought the land yet. The one she wanted was too expensive, but she wasn’t worried. There was no rush.

When Gilbert told Felipe about the land, he told her to be careful. In Bali, sometimes the truth is not as truthful as it seems. It had already been a month, and the money she’d raised was just sitting in Wayan’s account. He said to make sure the money was spent before she left.

### Growing Older and Wiser

Gilbert celebrated her 35th birthday in mid-July with a party thrown by Wayan. Balinese parties are not like American parties. Mostly, people get dressed in their finest clothes, then sit quietly admiring each other. Wayan wrapped Gilbert in a purple sarong, bustier, and a gold sheath. The children helped Wayan decorate and make a birthday cake. Wayan’s nieces and nephews were ceremony dancers and performed a ritual dance for Gilbert. The orphan girls gave her gold barrettes. There were also some of her international friends in attendance. **It was the weirdest but happiest birthday party Gilbert had ever experienced.**

As time continued to tick by, Gilbert became more anxious about Wayan and the house. She wanted everything to be secured for her own peace of mind and that of the expectant donors back home. But whenever she asked Wayan about it, Wayan brushed her off with excuses. It wasn’t easy to buy a house. It took time to find the right one. When Gilbert tried to dig deeper, Wayan merely shrugged.

As the weeks grew closer to September, when Gilbert would be leaving and Wayan would be evicted, she and Felipe threw themselves into locating potential properties. But Wayan dragged her feet. The right land needed to have good _taksu_ , or “a positive spirit,” she said. She dismissed two potential properties because of their negative taksu.

Wayan also said she had to meet with a priest to find an auspicious day for making a purchase. But to meet with the priest, she had to decide she actually wanted a property. And to decide that, she had to have an auspicious dream. And to have that dream, she had to make an offering at a major temple. The situation seemed impossible to settle.

Despite these frustrations, Gilbert was having fun. **The property search brought her and Felipe closer, and she was falling more in love with him.** Felipe joked about enjoying his mundane life before he met Gilbert. But he threw himself into the mission of finding Wayan a house as though it was his own.

There were so many things about Felipe that Gilbert loved. He was a nurturer and had this way of making her feel like the center of his universe. She could tell he enjoyed having someone to care for, which was different than her previous relationships. He often recounted how as soon as he saw her that night at the dinner party, he knew he wanted to take care of her.

But Gilbert didn’t know if she could handle being the center of someone’s universe—or if she wanted to be. When she told him this, he reminded her that he’d never asked her to be his purpose for living. Gilbert felt ashamed of her arrogance, but then he said she wasn’t completely wrong.

At 52, Felipe felt no need to look at the world through rose-colored glasses. He knew she didn’t love him the way he loved her, but it didn’t matter. He would continue to love her even after she left because she had filled him with life again. He would love to be with her always, but their lives didn’t allow for that. He was in Bali, and she would soon be back in the States. He didn’t need to dwell on it.

Gilbert wondered about life in Bali full time. The other expats seemed to have run away from something in the “real” world. They were content to have no ambitions and live a life of leisure. But Gilbert still had ambitions. She didn’t want to turn away from a serious life, but she also didn’t want to turn away from Felipe. Then, she realized there was no need to worry. **Worrying was part of her past. She could just be present in their love and watch the rest happen.**

### Love and Betrayal

**The more Wayan refused the properties Gilbert and Felipe found, the more Gilbert started to wonder if she was receiving the full story from her friend.** Again, she tried to infuse a sense of urgency about buying a house. She had less than two weeks left on the island. Again, Wayan said the process couldn’t be rushed.

However, a few days later, Wayan found a piece of land she liked. It had good taksu, was close to town, and was surrounded by rice fields. The owner was a friend of her father’s and needed money quickly. The land was the Balinese equivalent of 7 acres, and he was willing to sell her two of them. Gilbert told her to buy it immediately.

Another few days passed, and Wayan still hadn’t bought the land. Gilbert pressed her about it, and Wayan became evasive. She said the farmer’s wife wouldn’t let him sell part of the land. He had to sell the whole property. Wayan then said if she had a little more money, she could buy the whole thing, as a mystic had advised her to do. It was her destiny to own the land and start a healing center, and someday, maybe she could build a fancy hotel.

**Gilbert couldn’t believe what she was hearing. She told Wayan she didn’t have more money to give.** And after she heard the words “fancy hotel,” she suspected that she was getting played. Gilbert felt hurt and betrayed. She asked Felipe what he thought. Up to this point, Felipe had merely been a facilitator. He’d kept his opinions to himself. Now, he stated outright that Wayan was playing her.

Felipe told her not to be angry with Wayan. He’d lived on Bali long enough to realize that this type of behavior wasn’t intentional. It was a way of life. Everyone is so poor and tourists are so wealthy, it is second nature for the locals to try to squeeze every cent they can out of tourists before they leave. When Gilbert raised the $18,000, Wayan couldn’t help but become obsessed with the idea that more could be attained. It was her only understanding of how to survive. He said the best course of action would be to do something to snap Wayan’s thinking back to reality. It would be a great service to do so.

The next day, Gilbert told Wayan she was upset because her American friends were demanding answers. **She said she was getting daily messages from angry friends who accused Wayan of stealing. Gilbert knew this would do the trick. The worst insult in Bali was to call someone a thief.** They all hustled to make a living, but no one was ever called out for it.

Wayan grew emotional and apologized for putting Gilbert in a terrible position. Gilbert said she understood but would have to take the money back if Wayan didn’t find something that week. Of course, there was no legal way Gilbert could get the money back, but Wayan didn’t know that. It only took four hours for Wayan to call and say she bought the 2 acres from the farmer. The wife had apparently changed her mind.

The women exchanged affections, and Gilbert reassured her that all was well between them. After she hung up, she and Felipe opened a bottle of wine and celebrated. They could finally go on vacation.

### Finding Her Voice

Gilbert took Felipe to Gili Meno, a small island off the coast of Bali. The island was so small, you could walk the perimeter within an hour. Gilbert chose this island for their vacation because she’d been there before. When she visited Bali two years ago, she took a 10-day trip by herself to the island for a silent retreat.

Gilbert was in the middle of her divorce at the time. The years of suffering and guilt leading up to the separation, the trauma of separating, and the heartbreak from David had left her scraping the bottom of her life. She wanted to be alone and in complete silence so she could find a way to manage the demons that lived inside.

During those 10 days, she walked the island twice each day and sat on the beach with her thoughts. She knew enough about Yogic tradition to know that thoughts are what bring emotions, both good and bad. **Her thoughts were all bad, so she always felt pain.** She figured if she kept silent and let the thoughts run their course, she could reduce their power.

It took three days for her mind to quiet down enough for her to examine each thought separately. She invited the sorrowful thoughts to enter one at a time. She examined each one, blessed it, and let it settle peacefully in her heart. Then, she examined each angry thought. Finally, she examined all her shame. After she was done, her mind was empty of all the negativity, but her heart was not full. She realized she had more room in her heart than she thought. **This meant her ability for love was never-ending. At that moment, she understood God.**

Although that moment was life-changing, she knew it was temporary. There would be other thoughts to contend with. And she knew her journey to true healing was just beginning. So that night, Gilbert went to her cabin and opened a new notebook. She spoke for the first time on the island and wrote the words down. She wrote that she was loved, would never be alone, and would always be taken care of.

Those words became the mantra she heard whenever the voice showed up to help her. Over the next two years, that conversation continued in that same notebook. She knew it had saved her life so many times, and she finally understood who the voice belonged to. **It was the voice of the balanced version of herself calling her forward to become who she now was.**

Bringing Felipe to that island now was her way of acknowledging the origin of the person he loved. She had not been saved by a man. She had saved herself through self-love and spiritual devotion. She was happy and balanced because she fought for it. And she was ready to share her new life with someone else.

Before they landed on the island, Felipe suggested they build a specific brand of life that suited them. He had to be in Bali for business, Australia for his children, and Brazil for his family. She had to be in America for her work and family. Why didn’t they simply exist together among those four locations? The writer in Gilbert didn’t miss the AABB connection with poetry (Australia, America, Bali, Brazil). Of course, that was how they’d move through life together, in measured couplets of beauty. She looked at him and said, “Attraversiamo.” It was time to cross over.
