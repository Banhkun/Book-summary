## Part 2: Development as Freedom in Practice | Chapter 6: Democracy’s Role

Now that we’ve explained Sen’s philosophical case for freedom-centered development, we’ll analyze some of the most urgent issues plaguing underdeveloped nations and discuss how a development as freedom model would mitigate them.

First, we’ll look at how democracy influences development and how authoritarianism holds economies back. Next, we’ll look at gender bias and how empowering women can spur growth. Finally, we’ll discuss food scarcity and how to ensure that there’s enough to eat in a world of 7 billion people.

### Does Democracy Help Development More Than Authoritarianism?

The role that democracy plays in development has divided policymakers around the globe. First, we’ll examine the arguments _against_ establishing democracy in nations that are comparatively underdeveloped. Then, we’ll explain Sen’s argument for why democracy is a fundamental freedom that ought to be pursued by all nations.

Sen identifies**two common arguments against democracy in poor nations** , which he considers to be **misconceptions** :

  1. Democracy gets in the way of economic development.
  2. People in poor nations don’t desire a democratic form of government.



#### The Lee Thesis

Some opponents of democracy in developing countries echo the “Lee thesis,” named for former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, which states**** that**** authoritarian regimes are better at enriching poor nations than democracies.

Proponents of the Lee thesis attribute this to an authoritarian focus on economic development rather than on freedom, which is seen as unnecessary to eradicating poverty.**** For example, Singapore, South Korea, and China achieved higher growth while under authoritarian governments than did democracies like India, Costa Rica, and Jamaica.

However, Sen states that the Lee thesis is based on faulty evidence. **Empirical studies reveal little relationship between authoritarianism and economic growth.** By contrast, democratically-oriented policies are proven growth drivers.

Examination of the “East Asian Miracle” economies (such as Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea), which achieved rapid economic growth in the 20th century, suggests the following policies are most helpful:

  * Openness to competition
  * Use of global markets
  * High literacy rates
  * Land reforms
  * Incentives for industrialization, research and development, and exports



Sen argues all of these helpful policies are compatible with democratic rights. Additionally, many authoritarian regimes that have failed to adopt these policies have remained poor. Therefore, **the assertion that authoritarianism is either necessary or sufficient to achieve economic growth is false**.

> **The Benefits and Drawbacks of the Reign of Lee Kuan Lew**
> 
> The “Lee Kuan Yew Conundrum,” or the ability of Singapore’s authoritarian regime to govern effectively, provides a rebuttal to Sen’s view that democracy is an essential part of development.
> 
> Since 1965, Singapore’s per capita income has grown from $500 to $55,000. Bloomberg ranks Singapore as the healthiest nation in the world. It’s also considered one of the least corrupt, and its crime rates are substantially lower than those in the US.
> 
> Singapore has managed to accomplish these advances despite its poor record on democratic rights and civil liberties. While some contend that Singapore shows that democratic rights and civil liberties are overrated, Sen argues that the policies Singapore adopted to prosper are consistent with freedom and democracy, and that the people of Singapore would be even better off if democracy were established.

#### Do the Poor Value Democracy?

**Another argument made against democracy is that most people in underdeveloped nations don’t want it:** They’re too concerned with putting food on the table to worry about voting rights or other tenets of democracy.

However, Sen contends that it’s hard to tell what average people in authoritarian regimes desire, since they lack the means of expressing their honest opinions without the freedom of speech and a free press. When people in poor countries do have the means to give their opinions honestly, Sen contends they opt for democracy.

In India in the 1970s, this is exactly what happened. Voters rejected Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s emergency declaration, which would have suspended basic political and civil rights in response to widespread anti-government protests. Sen concludes that **although they’re among the poorest on Earth, the people of India demonstrated that they value democratic rights.**

(Shortform note: Afrobarometer, a pan-African research network that conducts public polling in Africa, revealed that 69% of Africans pick democracy as their preferred form of government. Higher percentages reject other forms of government, such as dictatorships or military juntas. Africans also support democratic institutions such as elections (73%), legislative oversight of the executive branch (67%), and presidential compliance with court decisions (77%).)

### Virtues of Democracy

As Sen has explained, democracy has both _intrinsic_ value and _instrumental_ value. **As social creatures, humans place value on the ability to express their views and participate in the social and political activities of the community**.

We also value democracy as a means to economic and social development as well as an instrument to improve national welfare. For example, democratic leaders must respond accordingly to public opinion or risk electoral defeat, while authoritarians are insulated from the pressures of public opinion. In other words, democracy aligns the interests of government decision-makers with the majority of the population.

This dynamic, according to Sen, explains a historical fact:**No democracy has suffered a famine.** Famines have happened in tribal communities, monarchies, technocratic regimes, imperial colonies, and under many other forms of government—but not in any place with free and fair elections and a free press.

(Shortform note: Frances D’Souza, writing in the _Journal of Peace Research_ , argues that preventing famines has more to do with freedom of the press than democratic elections. Since there are nations that hold democratic elections but control the media, they may still be susceptible to famine. On the other hand, there are countries where regime change is rare, but where a free press still plays the role of watchdog.)
