## Part 3: Criticisms and Obstacles | Chapter 9: Western Bias

In the final chapters, Sen rebuts some common criticisms of his freedom-centered approach to development; among them, the claim that freedom and human rights are Western ideas that don’t translate to other cultures. He also tries to refute the idea that devising social policy to promote freedom and achieve progress is impractical.

Sen's critics take issue with his emphasis on the importance of human rights, saying it’s biased toward Western cultures.

### The Western Bias Critique

This critique argues that the concept of human rights is a quintessentially Western idea, and that it doesn’t apply to non-Western (especially Asian) cultures. Therefore, “human rights” are simply an invention of Western civilization, which has its roots in ancient Greece and Rome, and they were devised more specifically during the Enlightenment in Western Europe.

In contrast, Eastern cultures have their own ethical frameworks, which prioritize honor and obedience above liberty and individuality.**** These cultures are better off adhering to their own traditions, and they don’t need Western values foisted upon them.

> **The United Nations and Human Rights**
> 
> In 1948, the United Nations adopted the Declaration of Human Rights. The agreement established a set of fundamental rights and freedoms belonging to all people of all nations. Like Sen, the declaration also takes a “positive rights” view, including economic entitlements to their list. The rights include, among others:
> 
>   * Freedom of speech
> 
>   * The right to own property
> 
>   * The right to privacy
> 
>   * The right to due process
> 
>   * Freedom from slavery and torture
> 
>   * Protection against unemployment
> 
>   * The right to leisure and paid holidays
> 
>   * Provision of social security in the event of unemployment or disability
> 
> 

> 
> While Sen champions these kinds of economic rights, critics argue these aren’t human rights at all, and that governments can’t enforce them with any degree of consistency. For example, a paid holiday, however desirable, is not an inalienable right granted to all people at birth—it’s a perk that private businesses or governments offer to workers.
> 
> Despite such qualms, the vote in favor of the declaration was unanimous, with a handful of countries abstaining. It was regarded as a global commitment to a set of rights that transcend ideology and offered a blueprint for national laws to protect individual freedom.

### Examining “Asian Values”

**In response to the Western bias critique, Sen contends that many “Asian values” _are_ compatible with freedom and human rights.**

First, Sen cites the tremendous diversity of Asia. **Asia comprises approximately 60% of the world's population, so claims of a monolithic set of values for the region or its people are misguided.** Various religious, cultural, and literary traditions have been practiced across China, Japan, India, and many other regions.

Sen acknowledges **there are aspects of Asian cultural traditions that are hostile toward freedom and individuality**. He also says many Western traditions are similarly hostile. For example, Aristotle’s defense of slavery and aristocracy reveals aspects of the Western tradition that have been replaced by freedom and democracy. To Sen, the question is whether or not pro-freedom aspects are present in Asian heritage _in addition to_ authoritarian ones.

> **Confucius on Obedience and Collectivism**
> 
> Sen takes issue with the notion that “Asian values,” especially as articulated by Confucius, downplay human rights and personal freedoms.
> 
> However, many scholars trace the East’s apparent elevation of obedience and collectivism to the writings of Confucius. They argue these teachings are the bedrock of Chinese culture and permeate every aspect of Chinese society.
> 
> On obedience, many scholars point to the five relationships delineated by Confucius. The first relationship is that between ruler and subject. Confucius says that subjects must show loyalty to the guidance of the ruler and pay deference to his judgments. In return, the ruler must set a proper moral example.
> 
> On collectivism, they point to the set of Confucian virtues: Ren, Yi, Li, Zhi, Xin, and Xiao. These translate to benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, fidelity, and filial piety. More specifically, Confucius explained propriety to mean respect for traditional customs and mores and filial piety to reflect the importance of accepting one’s position in the social hierarchy.
> 
> While some argue this shows a disregard for individual rights in the name of the greater good, others underscore the similarities between Confucian virtues and the classical Western virtues of prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. Also, many modern “Western values” have changed. Aristotle endorsed slavery and criticized democracy, for example, and yet liberty and representative government are regarded as pillars of modern Western values.
> 
> Sen argues it’s wrong to view the Confucian tradition as incompatible with human rights and liberal democracy and says the East is a diverse region whose intellectual influences are too varied and nuanced to be pigeonholed.

#### Examples of “Western Values” in Asian Traditions

##### The Priority of Truth

**Confucius said the proper way to serve a prince was to be honest, even if it would offend him.** He also recognized that some values, like family loyalty, could supplant the notion of total obedience to the state.

##### Tolerance

The Indian Emperor Ashoka, who ruled in the 3rd century BC, wrote extensively on the importance of tolerance. According to Ashoka, all sects deserved respect, and criticizing them unduly only hurt one’s own sect.

### Western Influence on Traditional Cultures

Sen argues that cultural exchange has been happening for more than 2,000 years, and that this kind of cross-pollination enriches, rather than harms, humanity. **Many critics, however, see this as a major threat to the preservation of traditional cultures.**

Sen notes that in a globalized world, Western culture dominates. For example, American fast food chains can be found on each inhabited continent, and television stations from the US are viewed in nearly every nation around the globe.

**In response to the fear of culture erosion, Sen makes two points:**

  1. Traditional cultures are valuable, and **it’s up to the people in those cultures to _decide for themselves_ how much of it warrants preserving**, and at what cost.
  2. It’s possible, and admirable, for people to appreciate the contributions of other cultures. Science, literature, art, music, and other fields have all benefited from the influence of mixing cultures. 



> **China Cracks Down on Western Cultural Influences**
> 
> In recent years, the Chinese government has been cracking down on Western-inspired cultural trends that it considers to be harmful to public order. Some experts say the government has renewed the narrative of “China vs. the West,” and nationalism is on the rise. China has restricted social media, e-commerce, and private education.
> 
> China is increasingly concerned with the influence of private enterprises like Tencent, a tech company, and Alibaba, a giant of e-commerce.
> 
> The government is also cracking down on celebrity culture, which often focuses on idolizing individuals rather than on the common good. Social media accounts have been closed, celebrities have been chastised for vulgarity, and video game access to minors has been restricted.
