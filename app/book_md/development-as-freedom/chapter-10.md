## Chapter 10: Obstacles to Development as Freedom

Aside from cultural criticisms, Sen acknowledges that his freedom-centered approach presents several challenges because of the nature of democracy and capitalism:

  1. **Difficulty of consensus:** Because of the varied preferences and priorities of factions in a democracy, it’s hard to reach agreements on public policy.
  2. **Unintended consequences:** Governments often adopt well-intentioned policies that result in more harm than good.
  3. **Issues of self-Interest:** The profit motive can encourage behavior at odds with the public interest.



We’ll discuss each criticism in detail.

### 1\. Difficulty of Consensus

Sen advocates a coherent, strategic approach to social policy. However, critics argue that, in a democratic system, one approach isn’t feasible because people have so many different values and preferences.

Because of this variety, they contend that devising a single socially just framework will necessarily violate some people’s versions of justice.

Sen makes two counterarguments:

  1. **Democracy requires some compromise.** Sen says that partial agreements achieved through the democratic process are still valuable and can greatly advance progress.
  2. **More social interaction leads to better results.** Empowering more people to engage in public discussion fosters new values and preferences, which can improve all of society.



> **Social Choice Theory**
> 
> In _Development as Freedom_ , Sen criticizes fellow Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow’s work on social choice theory, which pertains to the way societies make collective decisions based on individual preferences.
> 
> Arrow’s theorem shows mathematically how consensus can’t be reached when decisions are based on majority rule and there are at least three options to choose from. He calls this “social intransitivity.”
> 
> While Sen doesn’t dispute Arrow’s findings, he argues that majority rule requires compromise, and while consensus may not arise, people can still be made better off through collective decision-making.

### 2\. Unintended Consequences of Public Policy

Some critics also oppose Sen’s advocacy of a government role in crafting social policy because governments’ attempts are often counter-productive.

Many policies that tried to help people directly have backfired. As noted earlier, China’s “one-child policy” was supposed to address the problem of overpopulation by reducing fertility rates. In practice, however, it led to increased mortality rates for women and girls, sex-selective abortion, and an imbalance in the ratio of males to females.**** Despite these criticisms, Sen believes**policymakers can craft policies that work as intended**. Sen cites a national focus on literacy and health care systems that have worked in many East Asian countries, as well as programs to eradicate infectious diseases.

Sen makes a distinction between _unintended_ consequences and _predictable_ consequences.**While many policies may have unintended results, if these results are _predictable_ , they can guide policymakers in the right direction. **For example, while governments can’t determine the exact benefits of investing in health care, they can determine more generally that the benefits are usually worth the investment.

> **Unintended Consequences: The Great Leap Forward**
> 
> Some of Sen’s critics argue that governments are not nearly as adept at predicting the outcomes of public policy as Sen says they are. One famous case of unintended consequences is the “Great Leap Forward,” the initiative that the Chinese Communist Party undertook as part of its second five-year plan in the late 1950s and early 1960s. While it was meant to modernize China’s economy and allow it to compete with or exceed those of Western capitalist countries, the results were catastrophic for the Chinese people. The communal ownership of farmland and rigid central planning of economic activities led to tens of millions of deaths from starvation and related illnesses.
> 
> When evidence showed the unfolding crisis, the political leaders blamed it on a failure to properly implement their dictates, indicating the inability of the government to predict the consequences of its actions and/or an unwillingness to rectify its mistakes by changing strategies.

### 3\. Self-Interest and Capitalist Values

A third challenge to Sen’s approach is balancing self-interest with collective interests in a democracy.**** Sen explains how the pursuit of individual interests can promote economic development.

#### The Benefits of Self-Interest

In market economies, Sen (agreeing with Adam Smith) **** says**most people, whether producers or consumers, seek to satisfy their own desires.** However,**this pursuit of personal gain often leads to unintended _positive_ results for the economy**, because the interests of producers and consumers are often complementary.

##### The Butcher, the Brewer, and the Baker

Sen invokes Smith’s famous “butcher, brewer, and baker” example. All three provide their services to customers out of their personal desire to make a profit, not as an act of charity. Yet, when a customer decides to buy a product, the customer becomes better off, as do the producers. **It’s this process of mutual benefit that drives economic progress in the capitalist system.**

> **Examining the Butcher, the Brewer, and the Baker**
> 
> There are generally two ways to interpret the butcher, brewer, and baker example. Some see it as evidence that free enterprise promotes greed above benevolence, and is therefore a fundamentally immoral system.
> 
> Others interpret it as evidence that free enterprise encourages people to sympathize with others, by trying to understand how we can satisfy _their_ needs and wants. Entrepreneurs get what they want (more wealth) by designing goods or services that best suit the desires of consumers. Although their goal may be profit, their means of attaining it is by better understanding the people around them.

#### Capitalist Values

Sen also makes a broader point:**To flourish, capitalism requires a set of values and norms.** A combination of legal institutions and social mores is crucial to economic functioning.**** We’ll refer to these values as capitalist values,**** which are part of the ethical guardrails Sen refers to throughout the book, and they help combat greed and corruption.

##### Trust

The first value, trust, is crucial to economic exchange. **Only in a system where mutual trust is routine can trade occur**. Part of this trust can be provided by institutional measures, such as contract law, which give confidence to all parties that their agreements will be respected. Another part, however, is more implicit, and has to do with the natural cultivation of social norms that give people confidence in the commitments of others.

##### Sympathy

Sympathy, too, is a capitalist value. Sen agrees with Adam Smith’s view that there are many situations where self-interest compels a person to help others. If we suffer when someone else suffers, this is sympathy. This natural human drive persists even in a capitalist system dominated by self-interest.****

##### Commitment

Sen contrasts sympathy with another capitalist ethic: commitment. Sen defines commitment as a person’s desire to help others, not to alleviate their own “sympathetic suffering,” but from a larger commitment to justice.

These values, Sen believes, allow capitalism to flourish, and they provide a means of achieving even more progress.**** Sen believes these values help explain the sustained success of Western economies, and that cultivating these values in developing nations is crucial to development.

> **Imposing Capitalist Values**
> 
> In _The White Man’s Burden_ , economist William Easterly agrees with Sen that there is a set of capitalist values that makes free enterprise work. Easterly specifically highlights the importance of trust in enabling capitalism to flourish.
> 
> However, Easterly also argues that these capitalist ethics must develop organically, and they can’t be imposed on a nation or culture unfamiliar with them. This is why, Easterly argues, attempts to bring capitalism to countries with long histories of other economic systems usually fail.
> 
> For example, the effort to rapidly turn former Soviet satellites into capitalist systems following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 was largely a failure. This “shock therapy” was meant to bring to the region the economic success of the West, but it had the opposite effect. Easterly argues this was because these nations had yet to develop the capitalist values that he and Sen deem vital to capitalism’s success.
