## Chapter 5: The Role of the Market in Development

Markets are integral to Sen's theory of development because they afford basic freedoms and spur economic growth. Sen argues that markets have both intrinsic and instrumental value, but also shortcomings. He explores both benefits and flaws in this chapter.

Sen identifies two reasons why free markets are integral to his view of development:

**1\. As a means to economic growth and progress:** Sen acknowledges that free markets can increase economic growth and overall economic progress. However, Sen says free markets are much more than just a means to improve prosperity.

**2\. As a fundamental freedom that people have reason to value:** Independent of its impact on economic growth, the freedom to exchange goods and services is a basic part of social interaction and is valuable as its own kind of freedom.

Nonetheless, Sen takes care to enter into his calculus the aspects of free markets, such as income and gender inequality, that may contribute to the systematic exclusion of some marginalized groups. He also favors government intervention like social support and regulation when they can improve overall welfare.

> **Adam Smith on the Role of the Market**
> 
> Sen relies heavily on the work of Adam Smith to support his philosophical and practical case for freedom. Some scholars call this Adam Smith’s “presumption of liberty.”
> 
> Smith generally thought that an undisturbed market was the best engine for progress and liberty. However, he did acknowledge that there are circumstances when the market fails to provide socially preferable results. In such cases, he believed it was just to prioritize the public good. He specifically mentioned the government’s role in national defense, in enforcing the rule of law, and in providing public works like roads and bridges. Smith also advocated imposing restrictions on the levels of interest rates banks can charge, although many economists disagree with his reasoning.
> 
> In _Development as Freedom_ , Sen follows a similar line of reasoning. He views freedom as important and useful to the public good but identifies some areas where the government can improve general welfare.

### Markets and Freedom

Sen notes that the liberal, “laissez-faire” bent of classical economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo was first and foremost about freedom, and only secondarily about the efficiency of markets.

However,**in modern economics, there’s been a shift away from a freedom-focused defense of markets toward a utilitarian one** , which focuses on doing the greatest good for the most people.

The utilitarian approach focuses on results—however, Sen advocates focusing equally on results and process. By “process” Sen refers to a person’s ability to exercise freedom. He presents two examples to show why thinking about markets in this way addresses well-being to a greater extent than does the utilitarian approach.

#### Example #1

First, Sen offers a hypothetical to show the importance of process: Consider two economies, one that is decentralized, with resources allocated by market mechanisms; the other, a centrally planned economy in which resources are allocated by the decisions of a dictator.

If both economies achieve the same economic results, despite their differing processes, both are equally valid from a utilitarian perspective. However, in Sen's view, the market economy would clearly be superior because of its process—allowing people the freedom to make economic choices enhances individual and societal well-being. In contrast, the centralized economy's process inflicts a social cost.

#### Example #2

The second example demonstrates why it’s necessary to focus on process as well as results by **comparing forced labor and free labor.**

Sen cites empirical evidence showing that the compensation of American slaves (measured in terms of the goods they consumed) was similar to that of free laborers. Additionally, American slaves had life expectancies that were higher than those of industrial workers in the United States, and on par with the nations of France and Holland.

From a utilitarian perspective, focusing only on the outcomes of compensation and life expectancy, forced labor has a higher utility than free labor and is therefore the better option. But, **this utilitarian perspective, which analyzes only the _results_ of slavery, overlooks entirely its deprivation of freedom, which every person has reason to value.**

By emphasizing its processes, the true cost of forced labor—whether slavery or other forms of bondage—can be fully considered.

> **East Berlin vs. West Berlin**
> 
> A comparison of East and West Berlin provides a practical example of Sen’s dual values of economic freedom: its intrinsic and instrumental values. In 1960, Indian economist Bellikoth Shenoy published an article detailing his travels to the two Berlins. West Berlin, which was controlled by Western allies during the Cold War, bore the hallmarks of a free society, while the Soviet Union controlled communist East Berlin.
> 
> First, Shenoy details how East Berlin felt like “a prison camp.” There was a heavy police and military presence on the streets, and natives were reluctant to interact with foreigners. On the other hand, West Berliners were eager to converse, and the city was full of art and culture rather than communist propaganda. The fact that nearly all immigration (done underground and at the risk of persecution) was from East to West Berlin highlights Sen’s argument that people value freedom in itself.
> 
> Additionally, the West Berlin economy outperformed that of the centrally planned city of East Berlin. GDP in West Berlin grew at an annual rate of 17% during the 1950s, and wages grew by 90%.

### The Limitations of Markets

Sen advocates a return to a freedom-focused understanding of markets, rather than a strictly utilitarian one. However, he believes that achieving this requires government intervention because of several market shortcomings.

Specifically, he focuses on unequal opportunities and the issue of “public goods,” both of which inhibit development, if the government fails to intervene.

#### Unequal Opportunities

While praising the efficiency of markets, Sen also expresses concerns about the distribution of opportunities. Sen explains that everyone doesn't have the same freedoms or same ability to make use of them.

Sen makes a distinction between _income-earning ability_ and _income-using ability_.**** For example, some people (such as those with disabilities) have more difficulty converting income into well-being.

For example, if a blind man earns the same income as his seeing neighbor, the blind man’s income likely won’t go as far, since he has to incur extra expenses to accommodate his disability. This results in a practical disadvantage that both the income approach and the market ignore.

Additionally, while a seeing person has the freedom to choose between driving a car or taking public transportation, for example, the blind person is deprived of this choice. This limits opportunities, potentially skewing the relationship between income and welfare.

(Shortform note: Organizations like the Inclusive Policy Center share Sen’s concerns about the effect of disability on income, arguing that disabilities put people at a unique economic disadvantage. Some researchers believe the cost of disability amounts to about one-third of income.)

#### Neglected “Public Goods”

The second reason Sen advocates intervention is that free markets neglect "public goods.”**** Sen believes that government intervention is the proper way to address this market shortcoming.

**Environmental protection and public health are two prime examples of public goods the market neglects.** When the air is polluted, everyone pays the price—not just the person whose actions led to the pollution. Sen believes that the government has a role to play in rectifying these “market failures.” A carbon tax, for instance, could address air pollution by imposing a price on carbon that equals its social cost to the environment.

> **Public Goods Have Both Individual and Collective Benefits**
> 
> Public goods in economics refers to products or services that are consumed collectively rather than individually. For example, military defense spending is a public good because one person’s “share” of defense doesn’t leave less defense for others, and because a person who doesn’t pay for their share can’t be deprived of the benefits of defense.
> 
> Public goods usually have social costs or benefits not included in their market price, thus obscuring their true costs and benefits.
> 
> Education is also a “semi-public good.” Even though the primary beneficiary of an education is the person being educated, there are social benefits as well. Countries in North America, Europe, and East Asia have all benefited by adopting public education programs even prior to widespread affluence, which Sen considers a productive use of government.
