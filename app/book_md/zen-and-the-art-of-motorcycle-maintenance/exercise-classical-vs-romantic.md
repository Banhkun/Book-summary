## Exercise: Classical vs. Romantic

Figure out how you view the world.

* * *

Are you a classical or romantic thinker? Why? Write down an example or two that illustrates what kind of thinker you are.

What are the advantages to being your kind of thinker? Looking at your examples above, how did your particular mode of thinking help you accomplish your goals?

Now consider the _disadvantages_ to your mode of thinking. Describe an example of when your mode of thinking failed to deliver. Why didnâ€™t it?
