## Chapter 4: Who Was Phaedrus?

The riders stop in a town called Baker. Pirsig’s motorcycle is piping hot—it’s 108 degrees out—and there are some mechanical issues. He tends to them as best as he can. As they eat lunch, Pirsig recommends that neither he nor John drive faster than 55 mph—given the air temperature, the motorcycles are in danger of overheating and the tires might blow out.

Back on the road, John speeds ahead while Pirsig slows to 55. Pirsig, resigned to whatever may happen, returns to Phaedrus.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus the Individual**
> 
> Although Pirsig believes Phaedrus’s ideas are the most important thing about him—more important than his personal history or physical appearance—there are some aspects of him as an individual that are essential.
> 
>   * _He had an exceptionally high IQ_. On the Stanford-Binet IQ test, which evaluates a person’s analytic ability, he scored a 170. Only 1 person in every 50,000 scores this highly.
> 
>   * _He was focused_. Phaedrus’s intellect was like a laser beam: intense, far-reaching, and highly precise.
> 
>   * _He was isolated_. He had no close friends and traveled alone; and, although he had a wife and children, they couldn’t get through to him.
> 
>   * _He was courageous_. Although he was systematic in his thinking, he was also dogged. He was willing to sacrifice his physical and mental well-being in the pursuit of truth.
> 
> 

> 
> Acknowledging that his account of Phaedrus has, up to this point, been abstract and otherworldly, Pirsig finally decides to come clean about his relationship with Phaedrus. He does this obliquely, by telling a story.
> 
> One evening many years ago, after a productive Friday at work, Pirsig went to a party. He had too much to drink and lay down in a back room to recover. He ended up falling asleep, and when he woke up, he was in a hospital.
> 
> The party, it turned out, was a dream. Pirsig had been committed to an institution, and, by court order, subjected to electroshock treatment. He was told that he now had a new personality—which immediately prompted questions about the _old_ one the treatment had eradicated.
> 
> That old personality, about which Pirsig continues to learn as he lives his new life, Pirsig has dubbed Phaedrus.

The riders pull over at a roadside stop in a canyon. The Sutherlands are angry at Pirsig’s slowness, but he shrugs them off. He tends to the progressing mechanical issues on his bike and they get on the road again. It’s still dangerously hot out.

But soon enough the road begins to slope upward and switch back, and the riders rise out of the barren landscape into green meadows with trees. A cloud appears above them, and a cool wind begins blowing. Suddenly there’s rain. It passes quickly, leaving its coolness behind. The riders reach the top of the climb and look out over a valley and river. After a trying ride, they’ve finally arrived in Montana.

The travelers check into a hotel in Miles City, Montana. While Sylvia and Chris do the group’s laundry, and John seeks a duckbill for his motorcycle helmet, Pirsig looks over his cycle to see if anything needs tuning up—he’d heard what he thought was a tappet noise when they rolled into town.

> **Chautauqua: Hierarchy: The Basis of Rationality**
> 
> As Pirsig begins his review of his cycle, he notes that a motorcyclist doesn’t need any special talent to maintain the machine. A motorcycle adheres to the laws of reason, and so any person, if he or she can think rationally, can recognize, diagnose, and repair mechanical problems.
> 
> **The basis of rational thinking is the structuring of concepts and objects into _hierarchies_**. When Pirsig used his analytical knife to subdivide his motorcycle into different assemblies, he was creating a hierarchy. We find hierarchies everywhere: in businesses, governments, armies, computers, and scientific disciplines, among many others. Each of these entities features numerous interrelated hierarchies—for example, in government, there are hierarchies within different branches and agencies. A term for an interrelated set of hierarchies is a _system_.
> 
> So, when the Sutherlands express their distaste for the “system,” they’re speaking accurately—society, as an interlocking set of hierarchies, is indeed a system. But where they go wrong is thinking of that system as something alien to or outside of themselves. **Systems are simply the real-world manifestations of the way we think: they’re reflections of our rationality.** Thus to “overthrow the system,” as the Sutherlands might wish to, is futile. No real revolution is possible unless human beings radically reorder their patterns of thought.
> 
> This helps explain Pirsig’s ghost story (see __ Chapter 1). Our world is entirely a product of our minds. Even a motorcycle—which, to John, appears like an alien and unknowable system—is composed of human concepts, only these concepts are expressed in steel and rubber rather than language.

As Pirsig progresses through his diagnostic checklist, he discovers a loose tappet and tightens it. There are still some issues, however, that Pirsig can’t address without additional parts, so he mounts the cycle and heads in the direction of a local cycle shop.

The shop’s proprietor isn’t present, but the shop is open, and Pirsig takes a look around. The shop is a mess, but Pirsig thinks the mechanic might have a “photographic mind”—that is, _he_ knows where everything is, even if a stranger doesn’t.

Presently the owner arrives and sells Pirsig some, but not all, of the parts he needs. He heads back to the hotel, where the rest of the group is just beginning to load out. They pack up the motorcycles and head to a restaurant for lunch before they leave town.

At the restaurant, John relates a conversation he overhead about Bozeman, their final destination. Apparently some years ago Montana’s governor decided to fire 50 radical professors teaching at the college there, but he died in a plane crash before he could do it. Pirsig replies that that was a long time ago, then says that if there were 50 names on the list, his was surely one. The Sutherlands are surprised, but Pirsig calms them down by explaining that a “radical” in Gallatin County, Montana, might not be considered a radical anywhere else. (Shortform note: Pirsig leaves it ambiguous here whether the Sutherlands are surprised at Pirsig’s radicalism or the fact he was a college professor.)

As the group rides out of town, Pirsig suddenly recognizes a city park. He remembers that Phaedrus slept on a bench there on his way to Bozeman.

The travelers move west across Montana. The scenery changes rapidly, from brush to fields and back again. Pirsig returns to his Chautauquas, picking up where he left off: with rationality.

> **Chautauqua: Logic: The Path Through Hierarchies**
> 
> Once a hierarchy is established, we navigate its levels by virtue of logic. Pirsig notes that logic comes in two forms: **inductive and deductive**.
> 
>   * **Inductive Reasoning**
> 
>     * Example: If every time you hit a bump on your motorcycle the engine misfires, but the engine never misfires on level ground, you’re likely to conclude that the bumps are causing the misfires.
> 

>   * Definition: Induction proceeds from specific instances to general conclusions.
> 

>   * **Deductive Reasoning**
> 
>     * Example: A mechanic, having read a motorcycle’s manual, knows that the cycle’s horn is powered by the motorcycle’s battery. If the horn isn’t functioning, he can infer that there’s something wrong with the battery.
> 

>   * Definition: Deduction proceeds from general knowledge to a particular conclusion.
> 

> 
> **The scientific method—that is, the procedure for designing experiments to test hypotheses—comprises a mix of inductive and deductive reasoning**. Although few motorcycle malfunctions require the full-scale scientific method, some do, and so it pays to be familiar with each of its steps.
> 
>   1. _Statement of the Problem_
> 
>      * The key here is to approach the problem as specifically as possible _without assuming too much in advance_. For example, beginning with a question like _Why is my cycle malfunctioning?_ is better than beginning with _Why are the valves causing my cycle to malfunction?_ because, at least at the outset, you may not be sure the valves are the problem.
>   2. _Statement of the Hypothesis_
> 
>      * _Here_ is where you can home in on a specific culprit for the malfunction: “Hypothesis: Valves are causing the malfunction.” You may also include any other hypotheses you want to test.
>   3. _Design of Experiment_
> 
>      * In this step, you design a particular experiment (or experiments) that will determine whether the valves are responsible for the malfunction. It’s important to note that the only “failed experiment” is one that doesn’t provide information about a hypothesis. If your experiment proves your hypothesis incorrect—i.e., that the valves _aren’t_ the problem—that’s a successful experiment. If your experiment proves that the valves _or several other components_ could be the cause of the malfunction, then that’s a poorly designed experiment.
>   4. _Predicted Results of Experiment_
> 
>      * Your experiment’s predicted results are a kind of check on the design of your experiment. If your predicted results involve valve function, but your experiment produces feedback from the pistons or some other component, then that’s a clue your experimental design was flawed.
>   5. _Observed Results of Experiment_
> 
>      * This step is fairly self-explanatory, but make sure to _record_ the results of your experiment, as well as the experiment’s design. If you need to tinker with the experiment to produce further results, you’ll want to have that record to refresh your memory of what you’ve already done.
> 

> 
> 6 _Conclusions from the Results of the Experiment_
> 
>   * As with Step #1, the key here is not to draw conclusions unsupported by the experiment’s results. For example, if your original problem was that your motorcycle was malfunctioning, your hypothesis was that the valves were the culprit, and your experiment showed that the valves are indeed faulty, _you haven’t necessarily solved your problem_. Why not? Because your motorcycle’s malfunction could be caused by multiple factors, only one of which is valve trouble.
> 

> 
> As we move through these steps, we’re constantly combining deductive and inductive reasoning. When we design our experiment to test the valves, we might be thinking about the valvetrain system (deductive) or a malfunction in the past when the valves proved to be the issue (induction). When we execute our experiment, we’re using observed results to draw a conclusion (induction); and when we tinker with the experiment to produce new results, we’re drawing on our conceptual knowledge of related components’ functions (deduction).

The story picks up just as Pirsig nearly crashes head-on into a car passing in the opposite lane. The riders stop in a town shortly thereafter for lunch; Sylvia is still shaken up by the incident. Back on the road, Pirsig tells us we’re at the point where he can speak about Phaedrus’s abandonment of rationality in pursuit of the core of rationality itself.
