## Exercise: Recognizing Quality

Quality can be a difficult concept to grasp. Try these exercises to train yourself to recognize Quality.

* * *

Think of the last time you were “stuck,” whether at work or in your personal life. What strategies did you use to get “unstuck”? Or, if you’re still stuck, list some reasons why you think you might still be stuck.

Write down a problem you’re currently stuck on (it can be anything). Take a fifteen-minute break—get up from the chair; take a walk; grab a cup of coffee; watch something on TV—and then sit down and think about the problem again. Write down any possible solutions that come to your head, even if they seem silly or outlandish (don’t censor yourself).

Take a look at the most unexpected solution you listed. List 3–5 further ideas based on that one. (Again, don’t censor yourself—you’re just thinking out loud.)
