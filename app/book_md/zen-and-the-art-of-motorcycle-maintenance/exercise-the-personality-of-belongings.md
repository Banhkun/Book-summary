## Exercise: The Personality of Belongings

Think about the objects that mean something to you.

* * *

Write down a possession of yours that you’ve held onto longer than you probably should. What about it keeps you coming back to it? What kind of “personality” does it have?

Now think about a possession that you threw away but wish you hadn’t. Why do you regret discarding it? What are some strategies you can use to avoid the same mishap in the future?
