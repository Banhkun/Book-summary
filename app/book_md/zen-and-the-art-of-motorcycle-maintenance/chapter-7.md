## Chapter 7: Up the Mountain of Quality

The morning after Pirsig’s flashback, he and Chris pack their backpacks and hike into the mountains behind the DeWeeses’. Pirsig notes that mountains appear in every major religion as metaphors, especially for a spiritual obstacle that prevents the soul from reaching its highest goal.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus’s Inquiry into Quality**
> 
> Phaedrus saw his inquiry into Quality as an attempt to find a new path up the mountain of existential meaning. His ascent can be divided into two phases: a creative, unsystematic phase, which Phaedrus found enjoyable; and a rigorous, hierarchical phase, which Phaedrus thought resulted in a new conception of human existence but came at the cost of his family and freedom.
> 
> **Pirsig believes that a new theory of the meaning of existence—a new path up the mountain—is needed now more than ever**. Many modern people still follow the precepts of Jesus and Moses, but if those figures were to appear today and start spreading their message, they wouldn’t be taken seriously. This isn’t because their ideas aren’t wise or true, but rather because the historical context has changed—a reference to “Heaven above,” in an age when we can see into distant space, prompts questions about _where exactly_ Heaven is located.
> 
> Although Phaedrus believed he’d found a new route up the mountain, Pirsig is less certain, primarily because his knowledge of Phaedrus’s system is incomplete. Pirsig admits that, at first, he hesitated to research Phaedrus’s ideas for fear he would descend into madness as Phaedrus had. But even when he convinced himself he wasn’t in danger, he had to reconstruct Phaedrus’s ideas from scattered notes and fragments of memory. He acknowledges there are errors and ambiguities in his account of Phaedrus’s thought, but he affirms that these are likely a product of Pirsig’s reconstruction rather than the thought itself.
> 
> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus and Quality: The First Phase**
> 
> Phaedrus’s initial ideas about Quality emerged from his teaching of rhetoric. One of his students, a dutiful but not especially bright young woman, was having tremendous difficulty writing an essay. She initially wanted to write on the US, but Phaedrus recommended she narrow her focus to Bozeman, then the main street of Bozeman, and finally the front of the Bozeman Opera House, starting with a single brick. It wasn’t until she wrote about the front of the Opera House that she discovered she had something to say, and she produced 10x the words she was required to.
> 
> **The student was blocked because she was trying to repeat things she’d been taught**. When the topic was too broad—the US, or even Bozeman’s main street—she assumed there was something she’d learned already that could guide her, and when she couldn’t identify it she became paralyzed. When she was forced to focus on something miniscule, however, she knew nothing she’d been taught would be useful and thus resorted to her own intellectual resources.
> 
> Imitation, Phaedrus decided, was the enemy. And grades, which signified how well a student had learned to imitate what he or she had been taught, were imitation’s enabler.
> 
> So Phaedrus decided to eliminate grades.

Pirsig and Chris see the snowline—their destination—in the distance. It’s three to four days’ hike away. They stop for a rest, and Pirsig asks Chris to cut down two Aspens with Pirsig’s machete to make walking sticks. Chris declines. Pirsig does the cutting himself, thinking that Chris’s attitude could become an issue later given the demands of the terrain.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus and Quality: The First Phase (cont’d)**
> 
> Inspired by a student’s paper on the viability of a gradeless-degreeless system, Phaedrus developed his own “demonstrator”—a piece of persuasive writing that he drafted in real time with his students as commentators—that argued for the abolition of grades.
> 
> His central point was that the grading system had produced a “mule mentality” in students. Grades were both carrot and stick, and if neither was in play, the typical student wouldn’t work. This situation wasn’t only distressing to teachers; it was detrimental to society. **A civilization can’t be pulled along by mules—it can only advance by the original thought of free people.**
> 
> Phaedrus’s theory was that the abolition of grades would result in students’ attending class and working hard _for the sake of learning itself_ rather than a stamp of approval. It would also encourage students to think originally rather than imitatively.
> 
> In the same quarter that he drafted his “demonstrator,” he told his students that he would not be grading any of their assignments (he _did_ grade them, only he kept the grades to himself). What he found heartened him: The students, though resistant and wary at first, ended up flourishing in the gradeless environment, participating more in class and relating to each other collegially rather than competitively. He also discovered that the better the student, _the less the student cared about the grade_ : His “A” students voted 2 to 1 in favor of keeping the gradeless system, whereas the poorer students unanimously wanted the grade system back.

The hikers are in deep wilderness. Pirsig notes that the route he’s chosen will take them near a road on the second day in case anything goes wrong. Soon, the trail they’re following just about disappears.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus and Quality: The First Phase (cont’d)**
> 
> Phaedrus’s aim in abolishing grades was to force his students to think creatively and originally rather than imitatively. He wanted to them to discover what good writing was by looking within themselves, without his having to _unilaterally tell_ them. But, the experiment over, Phaedrus realized there was a glaring contradiction in his thought: If the students _already_ _knew_ what good writing was, they wouldn’t be in the class in the first place!
> 
> Thus Phaedrus was stumped. The students couldn’t figure out what good writing was on their own, and Phaedrus was both unable and unwilling to tell them. Despondently, he returned to graded, unilateral teaching and retreated further into himself.

The hikers are stopped. Chris, exhausted and surly, is resting under a tree. Pirsig intuits that Chris is afraid he doesn’t have the strength or willpower to make it up the mountain. To distract him, Pirsig tells a story about encountering a bull moose while on a hike with Chris’s mother. It cheers Chris up enough to make him communicative. Pirsig urges him to take it slower from here on out because the slope is getting steeper. **To climb a mountain, Pirsig tells us, one must live in the present and take it one step at a time**.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus and Quality: The First Phase (cont’d)**
> 
> After his colleague Sarah had started Pirsig’s gears turning about Quality, he’d assigned his class an essay: “What is quality in thought and statement?” The topic met with fierce resistance and frustration. When the students asked him for the answer, he confessed he didn’t know and was assigning the essay in the hope someone could help him. This, too, caused an outcry.
> 
> A few classes later he put an internally contradictory definition of Quality—really, no definition at all—on the board. He then asserted that even if no one in the room could define Quality, everyone knew what it was. To prove it, he presented the class with two student compositions, one poorly realized, the other exceptional. All but two students found the exceptional composition better.
> 
> In subsequent classes he went further, presenting the students with four papers and asking them to rank them. Invariably their rankings would match, or nearly match, his own.
> 
> So the students could recognize Quality when they encountered it. But how could they produce it themselves?
> 
> Phaedrus found himself returning to the rules of rhetoric he’d discarded. Suddenly he saw them in a new light. **They were no longer rules to be memorized for their own sake; rather they were a means to an end: Quality.**
> 
> And, by virtue of his ranking exercises, he was able to deflect questions about _how_ to accomplish a particular assignment. He could just point to the fact that the students _already knew_ what a quality essay was, and thus they had the tools to decide on their own whether their work was satisfactory.
> 
> **Thus, through the concept of Quality, Phaedrus was able simultaneously to escape rote instruction and encourage student creativity**. His lessons on specific writing techniques became suggestions for increasing Quality; and, as they wrote, his students were using their own judgment to decide if what they were creating was indeed Quality.
> 
> What continued to bother Phaedrus, however, was his solution’s _irrationality_ (he was still a classical thinker at heart). It was irrational because no one could say for certain what Quality was, and yet everyone could recognize it and many could achieve it.
> 
> He suspected that the indefinability of Quality linked up somehow with his earlier questions about rationality. This is what led him to the second phase of his inquiry.

Chris is really struggling—rather than push branches to the side he stumbles through them. Pirsig blames the YMCA summer camp Chris attended before they set out on their road trip. The camp portrayed outdoors skills as an indicator of manhood, which Pirsig believes, in the mountain-climbing context, to be utterly counterproductive. **To summit a mountain, a climber must leave ego behind**. An ego-climber is always unhappy and constantly looking ahead, never stopping to appreciate what’s around him in the present. This, unfortunately, is Chris’s approach at the moment.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus and Quality: The Second Phase**
> 
> Phaedrus’s second phase began with his considering Quality outside the discipline of rhetoric. One casualty of his ideas about Quality was the entire branch of philosophy known as _aesthetics_ —the study of beauty. **Because, if Quality—which Phaedrus equated with beauty—was by definition indefinable, then defining beauty was impossible, too.**
> 
> But if Quality was indefinable, how could Phaedrus be sure it existed? To answer this question, he used an approach that originated in the philosophical school of _realism_. Philosophical realists argued that an entity exists if, when that entity is subtracted from the world, the world can no longer function normally.
> 
> Phaedrus discovered that a world without Quality was a severely diminished one. There were no fine arts (because street noise was just as good as a symphony), no comedy (because humor depends on Quality), no sports (because the scores would be meaningless), no flavorful foods (because anything would taste like anything else), and no entertainment at all (because no one would be able to tell the difference between fun and boredom).
> 
> (Shortform note: Some of Phaedrus’s examples show circular reasoning. For example, ”the difference between humor and no humor is pure Quality.”)
> 
> Phaedrus’s conclusion was that a world could _function_ without Quality, but it would certainly not function _normally_. **Thus** **Phaedrus had proved, at least as far as the philosophical realists were concerned, that Quality existed.**
> 
> In the course of his thought experiment, Phaedrus discovered that there were historical analogues to the Qualityless world he’d imagined: ancient Sparta and the totalitarian states of communist China and Russia. A Qualityless world was a utilitarian one, organized exclusively according to the laws of reason.
> 
> **A Qualityless world, Phaedrus realized, was a _square_ one.**
> 
> Phaedrus decided that Quality was a powerful analytical instrument. It cleaved the world cleanly in half: on one side, the terms defined by an inability to recognize Quality unless its meaning was already clear (square, classical, technological); on the other, the terms defined by their ability to __ recognize Quality whether its meaning was clear or not (hip, romantic, humanistic). Pirsig calls this Phaedrus’s “first wave of crystallization.”

Pirsig turns to find Chris lagging far behind. When Pirsig yells for him to catch up, he collapses in a heap. He claims he’s turned his ankle, but Pirsig knows he’s just making an excuse to cover his exhaustion. Pirsig decides to relay his and Chris’s packs to lighten Chris’s load.

The going is slow, but they advance. They come to a small stream, and Pirsig sends Chris to gather water for cooking. When he returns, he and Pirsig have an argument—Chris doesn’t seem to understand that Pirsig is exerting himself more than necessary carrying both packs—and Chris refuses lunch, saying his stomach hurts. Chris moves off a short distance to cry, and Pirsig eats and falls asleep. When he wakes, Chris is still crying.

Pirsig attempts to make amends, but Chris remains upset. Pirsig decides to shift all the heavy items they’ve brought into his backpack and pack the light ones in Chris’s. This solution lifts Chris’s spirits.

They reach an extremely steep stretch and move even more slowly than before. The Aspen staves Pirsig cut earlier help keep them on their feet.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus and Quality: The Second Phase (cont’d)**
> 
> The classical—or “square”—mode of understanding analyzes the world by slicing it up into pieces and then organizing those pieces into hierarchical structures. **Quality, by virtue of its indefinability, eludes this procedure—it cannot be satisfactorily placed in any hierarchy.**
> 
> Phaedrus believed that this aspect of Quality would lead him to a better understanding of the ghost that continued to haunt him: the ghost of rationality. It was his work in this vein that eventually caused him to lose his mind.
> 
> Pirsig, however, has his own philosophical goals in his Chautauquas. Although Phaedrus was aware of the classical and romantic divide, he didn’t pay much attention to it, whereas Pirsig believes this division to be of utmost importance. And he believes Quality, as the term that splits the modes of understanding, also has the ability to unite them.

The hikers are high up on one side of a canyon. Chris’s mood has improved, enough so that Pirsig is afraid he’s getting overconfident. Once they reach a level spot, around three in the afternoon, Pirsig calls a halt for the day (he’s feeling fatigued). Clouds begin to form, and they barely pitch their tents and take cover before the rain starts. Pirsig takes out _Walden_ , but he and Chris realize Thoreau’s writing doesn’t quite fit with the surroundings, and they end up just watching the rain.

Presently Pirsig cooks their dinner, and as they eat, Chris asks what Pirsig is thinking about all the time. Pirsig replies that he’s thinking about what the world will be like when Chris grows up.

As Pirsig awakens the following morning, he recalls the dream he was having. He was in a white room with a glass door, and on the other side of the door was Chris, Chris’s brother, and Pirsig’s wife. His wife was visibly upset; Chris was smiling and waving, but Pirsig could tell Chris was fearful and only pretending to be happy. As Pirsig approached the door, Chris became enthusiastic for real, but when Pirsig failed to open the door, Chris’s fear returned. Pirsig has had the dream before, and now he knows what it means: Chris is trying to become closer with Pirsig and he’s afraid he won’t be able to.

When Chris wakes, he accuses Pirsig of keeping him up all night. He says that Pirsig, sounding drunk, was talking until all hours about the top of the mountain. He’d told Chris that he’d meet Chris there. Pirsig deduces Chris has been dreaming as well.

They pack their bags and continue their trek up the ridge. The terrain isn’t as steep, and the going is easier.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus and Quality: The Second Phase (cont’d)**
> 
> Phaedrus’s _second_ wave of crystallization took him into the metaphysical realm. The impetus for the second wave was his colleagues in the English department, who asked him whether Quality was an objective aspect of the things we observe or a subjective aspect existing in the observer.
> 
> Phaedrus recognized this question as a _dilemma_ (Greek for “two premises”). If Quality inhered in the object, then it should be detectable by some sort of scientific instrument. If Quality inhered in the observer, then it could be whatever anyone wanted it to be.
> 
> Phaedrus’s training in logic and philosophy provided him with a variety of responses to the dilemma, the best of which, in Pirsig’s estimation, was simply to refuse to accept the premises of the question: **If Quality is undefinable, it’s impossible to classify as either objective or subjective.** Pirsig sees this as the _mystical_ option.
> 
> But this wasn’t the option Phaedrus chose, at least not initially. Instead, he decided to try to counter his colleagues through _logic_. Pirsig attributes this choice—which would prove disastrous—to two factors: one, Phaedrus’s enduring commitment to the Church of Reason, whose foundations lay not in mysticism but rational argument; and two, Phaedrus’s ego.
> 
> Phaedrus’s first move was to try to beat the dilemma on the objective side. But he quickly ran aground: Quality wasn’t a physical property and could not be measured by scientific instruments. So he tried the subjective—and found himself getting angry.
> 
> What bothered him was the way his colleagues had framed the question. They’d said that if Quality was subjective, it was “just what you like.” Phaedrus’s problem was with the “just”—it made the thing you liked seem petty or unserious. Phaedrus decided to cut out that “just,” and suddenly he had a simple truism: “Quality is what you like.”
> 
> He wasn’t quite finished with “just,” however. He realized that when people tell you “don’t do just what you like,” what they’re really saying is**, “do just what _I_ like.” **The prohibition on doing just what you like is intended to make you do what _others_ like. And these others, usually, are authority figures—parents, bosses, teachers, policemen.
> 
> So, by not doing “just what we like,” we’re bowing to authority and conforming to its view of society. But Phaedrus realized that conformity isn’t the only effect of the prohibition. **It also diminishes the importance of our subjective emotions and tastes.**
> 
> The argument against valuing our emotions and preferences—which are often deemed “irrational” or “personal”—stems from two different but related philosophical traditions: _Scientific Materialism_ and _Classic Formalism._
> 
>   * _According to Scientific Materialism_ , things are real only if they’re made from matter and energy and can be measured by scientific instruments. Because our preferences can’t be measured by any known device, they’re “unreal” (or, at least, _unimportant_).
> 

>   * _According to Classic Formalism_ , a thing which can’t be understood intellectually—i.e., logically or rationally—can’t be understood at all. Thus “what we like,” because it’s emotional and often inexplicable, isn’t worth wasting time on.
> 

> 
> Phaedrus was able to refute the Scientific Materialist position by employing a _reductio ad absurdum_ , a form of argument that proves propositions wrong by showing that they produce absurd conclusions. Phaedrus’s first example was the number zero, which has neither matter nor energy and, by definition, can’t be measured, but is nevertheless taken for granted in science.
> 
> The Classic Formalist objection, however, proved more difficult to refute. A Classic Formalist would say that immediate emotional response (“just what you like”) should be subordinated to rational consideration (“what this _means/entails_ ”). **The Classic Formalist position, like Phaedrus himself, favors underlying form over romantic appearance.**
> 
> Phaedrus was unable to refute this objection because Classic Formalists _were indeed_ recognizing Quality, though a Quality different in kind from the one his students recognized. **Thus Phaedrus was left with the unacceptable conclusion that there were (at least) two different types of Quality: classic Quality, to which classical thinkers respond; and romantic Quality, to which romantics do**.
> 
> But Phaedrus still believed that Quality was a means to _unifying_ classic and romantic thinking. In fact, he believed Quality transcended the classical/romantic binary and thus couldn’t be analyzed using _either_ mode of understanding.
> 
> So he opted for a third way: Quality was neither objective nor subjective. It was its own irreducible entity. The world, he decided, was composed of subjects (people), objects (things), and Quality.
> 
> Although trinities in metaphysics aren’t entirely original, they are uncommon, and they raise the question of the relationship among the three terms. Phaedrus quickly realized that Quality couldn’t be related to the other two terms in isolation from each other. Rather, Quality could only be found in the relationship between subject and object. That’s when he had his breakthrough: Quality didn’t spring from subject and object—no, subject and object spring from _it_! Quality, Phaedrus realized, is an _event_ rather than an entity, and subjects and objects—people and things—are _effects_ of the Quality event. **In other words, Quality _creates_ our existence**.

The deep forest through which Chris and Pirsig have been hiking begins to thin, and they see they’re near the top of the canyon. They race to the top, and even though Chris is behind at first, he wins. Exhilarated, they ditch their gear and lie against some rocks to rest. The view is magnificent.

They fall asleep, and when Pirsig wakes, he thinks about the dream Chris had. He starts to get a bad feeling.

Chris wakes up, and the two have lunch. When Chris asks what Pirsig is thinking about, Pirsig admits he’s wondering why he told Chris he’d meet him at the top of the mountain. Chris then clarifies something he said earlier: Pirsig didn’t sound drunk when he was talking to him; rather, he sounded like he “used to,” when they lived in Bozeman.

They pack up and move off to find water. As they near a ravine they hear the sound of a rockslide. Pirsig explains that rock slides are a sign that the mountain is wearing down, and that there are forces beneath the surface of a mountain that can tear it apart. He recalls for Chris a horrible accident, when 19 hikers were buried in a rockslide.

After they hear another rockslide as they continue to search for water, Pirsig suggests that they delay their attempt to summit the mountain until next year. Chris is disappointed, so Pirsig says they’ll think about it and when they get water they can decide. It’s not just the rockslides that are bothering Pirsig, however. He’s spooked; he’s afraid of seeing Phaedrus at the top of the mountain. He starts sprinting down the ridge without realizing it, until Chris screams to wait up.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus and Quality: The Second Phase (cont’d)**
> 
> As Pirsig descends from the ridge, he also abruptly says he’s going to put Phaedrus’s story to bed to concentrate on his own ideas.
> 
> Phaedrus’s epiphany about Quality—that it was an event that preceded the distinction between subject and object—led him to his third wave of crystallization: the mystical.
> 
> Before he reached the mystical, however, he explored further what he meant by the _Quality event_. He saw the event as comprising a _preconscious awareness_ of a given object. For example, between the moment you _see_ a tree and register that it actually _is_ a tree, there’s a time lag in which you’re simply aware of _something_ —that time lag, which lasts only an instant, is when you see Quality.
> 
> Different types of people have different attunements to Quality. Intellectuals, unsurprisingly, have the most difficulty apprehending Quality, because they’re so quick to classify every experience according to hierarchical structures of knowledge. Young children, on the other hand, are the most sensitive to Quality, because their structures of knowledge are far more limited than intellectuals’. **In other words, the more experience we have, the less able we are to see Quality**.
> 
> Now Phaedrus had his answer to why people saw Quality differently—why, for example, classical thinkers saw Quality in underlying form while romantic thinkers saw it in immediate experience. **Each person brings to Quality a unique breadth of experience, which provides _analogues_ for the Quality event**. Thus the more alike people’s experience is, the more likely they are to see the same kind of Quality. This explained why Phaedrus’s composition class (mostly) agreed on which papers were Quality—they all had similar backgrounds to each other.
> 
> He was finally ready to respond formally to the objections of his colleagues. He sat down and wrote out his conclusions, which went as follows:
> 
>   * Quality cannot be explained by virtue of philosophy, for philosophical explanation, which distinguishes between subjects and objects, **comes after the immediate, preconscious awareness of Quality**.
> 

>   * **The simplest way to think about Quality is as an organism’s response to its environment**. We respond to our environment is all sorts of ways, by attempting to master it through technology and industry or represent it through the arts. But prior to these material responses, and what causes them, is our sense of Quality.
> 

>   * Quality cannot be defined because it transcends and gives rise to any possible definition itself. **To define Quality is to mistake it.**
> 

> 
> When he finished, he realized that he’d changed his position yet again: it wasn’t a _trinity_ he was describing, but a _monism_ (that is, a single entity, like God, that gives rise to everything there is).
> 
> He remembered that Hegel, a German philosopher, dealt with a monism called Absolute Mind. Then he recalled that Hegel was sometimes treated as a bridge between the Western and Eastern philosophical traditions. He went to his bookshelf and picked up a book he’d hand-copied years before: Lao Tzu’s _Tao Te Ching_. Almost as soon as he began reading he knew: **The _Tao_(Chinese for “Way”)—the mystical generating force for all there is in the universe _—_ was exactly what he meant by Quality!**
> 
> But this new awareness came at a cost. As he read, his thoughts came like a rockslide and he found himself losing control.
> 
> His discovery was too much for his mind to bear.
