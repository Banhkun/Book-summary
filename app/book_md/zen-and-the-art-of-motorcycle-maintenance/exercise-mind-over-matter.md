## Exercise: Mind Over Matter

Apply the concepts of “Making _Good_ Time” and the “spectator attitude” with these exercises.

* * *

Think about the last trip you took. Were you more concerned with arriving at your destination or enjoying the act of traveling itself? Considering Pirsig’s ideas about “making _good_ time” and overcoming discomfort, what are some ways that you can make your _next_ travel experience more fulfilling?

Pirsig blames the “spectator attitude” for the mechanics’ malpractice on his motorcycle. Describe the “spectator attitude” in your own words, and jot down some ways you can avoid the “spectator attitude” in your own work.
