## Chapter 5: Phaedrus Adrift

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus’s Discovery**
> 
> Phaedrus was fond of a particular speech Einstein gave in 1918. In the speech, Einstein described “science” as a temple with many mansions and many inhabitants. Some take to science because they’re smart and ambitious, others for practical, problem-solving reasons. If you remove these two types of inhabitants from the temple, you’ll nearly clear it out. But only nearly—there will remain those who pursue science as an **escape from the everyday world, who pursue science for its own sake.** Phaedrus was this kind of scientist.
> 
> He completed his first year of college-level science at age 15. He was already a biochemist, specializing in molecular biology. But his rare devotion to science for its own sake led him to question the very foundations of science, _in particular the development of hypotheses._
> 
> Over and over in the lab, as Phaedrus ran experiments to test hypotheses, new hypotheses would occur to him; in fact, as he ticked off hypotheses proven or disproven by his experiments, the number of possible hypotheses would _grow_ rather than _shrink_. At first he found this phenomenon comforting—given a particular problem, there was always something new to test. But soon enough he realized what this phenomenon signified: that the scientific method could **never account for every hypothesis, meaning the knowledge it produced was _always inconclusive_.**
> 
> Einstein had recognized this problem as well, and his answer was that, at any particular time, one hypothesis always seems a cut above the rest. Phaedrus found this “answer” insufficient, for it meant that **what we understand as “true” isn’t true for all time.**
> 
> As Phaedrus thought further about the history of science, he realized that the more people “did science,” the more quickly scientific truths were proven untrue—that is, the more widespread the scientific method became, the less stable were the truths it uncovered. And the reason these “truths” were proven untrue was the proliferation of hypotheses caused by the scientific method. He concluded that**, rather than moving us toward final, everlasting truths, the scientific method was actually _moving us away from them_.**
> 
> Although this discovery is firmly rooted in classical thinking, its general features are also recognized by romantics like John and Sylvia Sutherland. The rapid changes scientific advance causes in our lives—through new technology, medicines, and products—can seem chaotic and bewildering. That’s because, according to Phaedrus, they _are_ chaotic. They _must_ be, **because the scientific method doesn’t produce static truth but provisional and relative truths**.
> 
> Thus Phaedrus and the Sutherlands—the classic and the romantics—are reacting to the same problem from different ends. They both recognize the endlessness and ultimate meaninglessness of classical thinking. But while the Sutherlands simply resist it, Phaedrus attempted to find a structuring principle different from it. In doing so, he alienated his peers and retreated into himself. Two years after completing his first year of college-level science, he flunked out of school.

The riders stop overnight in Laurel, within sight of the Rockies. In the morning, Pirsig thrills to the crisp mountain air and brilliant sunshine. Sylvia joins Pirsig and Chris for breakfast even though she’s eaten already (John is out walking). As they dine, Sylvia reports that a townsperson has suggested a particular route to Bozeman. Pirsig knows the road and warns that, because it lies above the timberline, it’ll be cold but magnificent. When they meet John they decide to take the road.

Riding up into the mountains, Pirsig recognizes the route as one Phaedrus would take regularly. Phaedrus used the road for backpacking trips; he would ride into the country, then hike into the woods for days on end. Phaedrus needed absolute stillness to conduct his mental investigations. As he isolated himself, he began to consider his expulsion from college earlier a blessing; he’d decided that the institutions that guide our behavior—schools, religions, governments—all trafficked in the kind of classical thinking he was trying to avoid.

> **Chautauqua: Phaedrus’s Drift**
> 
> One way Phaedrus attempted to escape the classical mode of understanding was to think _laterally_. When we identify a problem and propose a hypothesis, we’re thinking _directly_ —that is, we’re homing in on a specific answer to a specific question using a specific method. **Lateral thinking tries to escape this sequence by avoiding known procedures and looking in unexpected directions**.
> 
> Lateral thinking, from the outside, can look a lot like drifting. And Phaedrus did drift. He went into the Army, which sent him to Korea. Pirsig still recalls some fragments from this time:
> 
>   * There’s an image of a wall seen from the prow of a ship across a harbor. The wall shines brilliantly. The memory is intense, and although Pirsig doesn’t know what it means, he believes it must symbolize something important for Phaedrus, perhaps a turning point.
> 

>   * Phaedrus befriends some Korean laborers who speak a little English and want to learn more. At a picnic lunch overlooking the sea, Phaedrus marvels that with the mere 26 letters in the English alphabet one can express anything in the universe. His Korean compatriots politely nod “Yes” while saying “No.”
> 

>   * In the final fragment, Phaedrus is in a bunk on an Army ship, heading home. The ship is rising and falling with the waves; Pirsig’s stomach is rising and falling also. He’s reading the hardest book he’s ever read, a work of Far Eastern philosophy. (Shortform note: Pirsig here uses the now offensive term “Oriental.”) The book, _The Meeting of East and West_ by F.S.C. Northrop, argues that man’s existence has two components: a Western theoretical component and a Far Eastern aesthetic component. These would seem to correspond to the classical and romantic modes of understanding, but there’s a difference: Whereas the division between the classical and romantic modes is absolute, the division between the theoretic and aesthetic is porous. That is, the theoretic and aesthetic lie at opposite ends of a _continuum_ , and each is present in the other.
> 

> 
> Phaedrus lands in Seattle, the book still on his mind. He locks himself in a hotel room for two weeks, eating apples and thinking. When he emerges, he returns to the university he failed out of—to study philosophy. He’s realized that **science can’t answer questions about its own procedures**. Only philosophy can.

As the travelers approach the town of Red Lodge, which is located at the base of the mountains they’re about to traverse, the air turns noticeably colder. They stop in Red Lodge and put on warm clothing. Then they’re riding up the mountain, enjoying the switchback turns of the route.

Soon they’re way above the timberline, in the High Country. The landscape is defined by meadows dotted with wildflowers. Once the road turns inward, away from the mountain edge, they find snowfields. The farther they go, the more snow they find; snow plows have pushed the snow into high banks along the road. At the summit Pirsig tunes up his cycle: It has been backfiring from the altitude. After taking some pictures for posterity, they begin their descent.

> **Chautauqua: The High Country of the Mind**
> 
> When Phaedrus turned to philosophy, he did so because he was at pains to answer the most fundamental questions of human existence: What is truth? What is knowledge? Why are we here? These questions lie at the very top of the hierarchy of knowledge—in the high country of the mind.
> 
> To answer these questions, Phaedrus read widely, including in his studies lesser known thinkers alongside people like Aristotle and Einstein. By academic standards he was doing subpar work, but he was making original discoveries, even if he didn’t know it yet. The problem, however, was his approach: **He read each thinker he encountered brutally, trying to find the flaws and inconsistencies in their thought.**
> 
> Pirsig recalls Phaedrus’s study of Immanuel Kant’s _Critique of Pure Reason_. Although Phaedrus didn’t agree with Kant, he respected the care with which Kant formulated his arguments, and his thought was integral to Phaedrus’s later resolution of the classical/romantic divide.
> 
> To understand Kant, however, one must begin with the 18th-century Scottish philosopher David Hume. Hume is an _empiricist_ —that is, one who believes knowledge depends on the senses. Imagine a human being born without any of the five senses and nourished intravenously for the first ten years of its life: Does this person _think_? Has this person ever _had_ a thought? Hume would say no.
> 
> Empiricism is not very different from what we think of as “common sense.” For our entire lives, the sun has risen every morning, so it’s common sense to expect it to rise tomorrow as well. We base this assumption on our empirical—sensory—knowledge of the world.
> 
> There are problems with empiricism, however, that show its shortcomings as a philosophical approach:
> 
>   * _The question of “substance_.” If all knowledge is derived from sensory data, how can we know what is producing (or “giving off”) that data? Consider a motorcycle. If we’re asked what it’s made of, we can answer steel (among other metals and materials). But what’s steel? Using our senses, we can tell that steel is hard, cold, and a host of other things, but all we’ve done is describe the data our senses are giving to us—we haven’t actually said what steel _is_.
> 

>   * _The question of causation._ Sensory knowledge also doesn’t explain causality. For example, when the sun rises, nothing in our senses tells us _why_ or _how_ it rises. Because of this fact, based purely on our sensory knowledge, we can never be _absolutely certain_ the sun will indeed rise tomorrow.
> 

> 
> **The consequence of empiricism is that it yields a world whose existence is entirely in the mind** : Since we can’t know anything beyond what we sense, it’s always possible that our senses are being tricked. This result wouldn’t do for Kant, but he also couldn’t dismiss Hume altogether—empirical knowledge was too valuable. _The Critique of Pure Reason_ was his attempt to reconcile Hume’s empiricism with the certainty that a world outside the mind existed.
> 
> Kant’s solution was to suggest that there is knowledge of reality _not dependent on the senses_. He called this **_a priori knowledge_**. An example is our sense of time: How do we know what time _is_ if we can’t feel or see it (much less taste or smell it)? Kant believed the _mind itself_ provides our sense of time as we encounter other sense data.
> 
> Consider a motorcycle again. If we accept Hume’s position—that our knowledge of the motorcycle is entirely dependent on sense data—we would have to accept a number of clear absurdities, including, for example, that any time we changed our physical position in relation to the motorcycle, the motorcycle would _also_ change. Kant solves this problem by saying we have an _a priori motorcycle in our minds_ , one constructed from sense data accumulated over a life of experience. This motorcycle is consistent no matter what our sense data tells us.
> 
> Although Phaedrus was initially thrilled by this revolution in philosophical thought, he later became disenchanted with it. One reason was his experience in Korea, which had shown him a mode of understanding different from the classical. To Phaedrus, Kant’s philosophy—in fact, _all_ of Western philosophy—was too staid and technical. He found it ugly.

In Cooke City, the riders stop for lunch, and Pirsig discovers that the Sutherlands are as happy as he’s seen them. He acknowledges that he must seem distant to them, given the Chautauquas he’s been conducting while they all ride together. Chris, naturally, understands Pirsig’s introversion better, but even he worries sometimes.

The Sutherlands ask Pirsig how he met the family they’ll be staying with in Bozeman, the DeWeeses. Pirsig has to admit that he doesn’t remember. The DeWeeses are friends of Phaedrus’s friends—the husband, Bob, whom Pirsig refers to as DeWeese, is an abstract painter who teaches at the college in Bozeman—and Pirsig tells us that he hasn’t seen them since Phaedrus was erased.

Pirsig’s memories of Phaedrus’s relationship with DeWeese are fragmentary, but he knows that Phaedrus was fond of DeWeese. His fondness stemmed from the fact that DeWeese continuously surprised Phaedrus: When Phaedrus expected one reaction from DeWeese, DeWeese would often produce the exact _opposite_ reaction.

DeWeese’s curious responses led Phaedrus to believe DeWeese possessed some deep knowledge that could help Phaedrus. And DeWeese, Phaedrus later discovered, felt a similar curiosity about _him_.
