## Exercise: Shift Your Perspective

Tutu and the Dalai Lama outline eight core values that offer a pathway to a more joyful life. The first of these is **a well-rounded perspective** —a wider and more holistic view of the world. This allows us to appreciate the shared experience of being human and more easily empathize and connect with other people.

Think about something that someone recently said or did that made you feel angry, frustrated, or sad. Describe the interaction and how it made you feel.

What are a few words you’d use to describe the other person in the interaction?

Now put yourself in the other person's shoes. Try describing the same interaction from their perspective. What might have happened before your interaction? What was the other person likely thinking or feeling during your interaction? How were they possibly affected by the interaction?

After taking on the other person’s perspective, describe the person again. How did the words you use change or not after shifting your perspective?
