## Biography 5: Amazon Regains Footing

**March 2001: Amazon considers whether distribution is a commodity or a core competency.**

  * If the former, then it could outsource distribution to a third party. If the latter, it could develop a key competitive advantage, and eventually build a platform to dropship items from manufacturers and distributors.
  * They visit a Reno fulfillment center, where they realize their shipping happens in large batches. Workers retrieve items ordered by customers, dump their items to a sorting machine, which rearranges products into customer orders. These pickers work in waves, with the entire shift dumping their orders. The problem is that a slow worker could hold up the entire team.
  * Over the following years, Amazon moves away from wave-based picking, allowing individual workers to be controlled by algorithms and shipping orders in small batches. This allows Amazon to make accurate promises on when purchases will arrive.



Spring 2001: Bezos meets **Costco founder Jim Sinegal** , who changes Bezos’s mind on pricing.

  * The Costco model is all about customer loyalty. It doesn’t advertise and earns most gross profit from annual membership fees. “**The membership fee is a one-time pain, but it’s reinforced every time customers walk in** and see forty-seven-inch televisions that are two hundred dollars less than anyplace else. **Customers know they will find really cheap stuff at Costco.** ”
  * **Costco then uses its heavy sales volume to negotiate better deals from suppliers.** It marks up everything at a standard 14%, not taking excess profits.
  * Learning this makes Bezos articulate a clearer strategy: “**everyday low prices** ” aiming to be lower than competitors at all times. If Amazon could stay competitive on price, it could win on unlimited selection and convenience.
  * In July 2001, Amazon announces it’s cutting prices of books, music, and videos by 20-30%. Bezos on conference call: “There are two kinds of retailers: those who work to figure how to charge more, and those who work to figure how to charge less, and we’re going to be the second, full stop.”



Later 2001: Amazon senior management has a breakthrough in understanding their business strategy. Jim Collins (author of Good to Great) meets with the exec team offsite and prompts them to consider their **flywheel effect:**

  * **Lower prices leads to more customer visits**
  * **More customers increase the volume of sales and attract more third-party sellers**
  * **More third-party sellers increases diversity which increases customers**
  * **More sales means higher return on fixed costs like fulfillment centers and servers**
  * **Higher return means further lower prices**
  * This makes executives feel like “they finally understand their own business.”



January 2002: Amazon announces Free Super Saver Shipping, for orders above $99.

  * This is prompted by free shipping promotions during the 2000 and 2001 holidays, and by surveys showing shipping costs were a major hurdle to ordering online.
  * **They consider how free shipping can segment customers who are willing to wait a few more days for their order,** much like how airlines segment businesspeople from recreational travelers by reducing prices for those willing to stay at destination through Saturday night.
  * The slower expectation of shipping lets them pack boxes into spare room in trucks when it happens to be available, reducing expenses.
  * Amazon notices that Super Saver makes people order more than they would otherwise.
  * They quickly lower the minimum price for Super Saver shipping from $99 to $49, then $25.



**January 2002: Amazon reports its first profitable quarter, with net income of $5 million. The stock jumps 25%.**

2002-03: As an employer, Amazon has high levels of attrition. Few believe Amazon will become a $600 billion company. Many are tired of Bezos’s insistence on work ethic.

  * The editorial team is made obsolete by the automated personalization team (team name: P13N, for PersonalizatioN’s 13 letters).
    * The personalization team (P13N) battled the human curation team for product recommendations. They have on their wall: “People forget that John Henry died in the end,” an allusion to the fable of the person who won the contest against a steam-powered machine but died in the end.
  * The engineering team has to deal with an aging infrastructure, moving to a service-oriented architecture (Shortform note: see former engineer Steve Yegge’s famous post about platforms).



This is a good point to talk about the general situation of Amazon relative to the tech world. The points below extend back and forward a few years.

  * Google’s rise signals a shift toward favoring tech companies, not clever business models and experienced CEOs. 
  * Google IPOs in August 2004. At this time, the market cap of Amazon is around $18 billion; Google is $35 billion; eBay is $47 billion.
  * **Despite Bezos’s claims that Amazon is a tech company, it looks merely like an old-fashioned retailer, with no profits.**
  * **Google threatens to disintermediate Amazon - customers might start their shopping trips on Google, not on Amazon.** Google is very competent at indexing the Web, and users might search Amazon better through Google than through Amazon itself.
  * Also, Google creates a comparative shopping engine, Froogle. And Amazon and eBay now compete for Google search ads, effectively paying a tax to Google.
  * Google also competes with Amazon for talent, offering lavish perks and stock options. In comparison, Amazon is still frugal, has a combative culture, and anemic stock growth. Bezos loses two lieutenants:
    * Jeff Holden, SVP of worldwide discovery, runs a secret search engine effort competing against A9. Bezos chooses A9, and Holden leaves, feeling betrayed. (Shortform note: as of this writing, Holden is now CPO at Uber.)
    * Then Head of A9 Udi Manber leaves for Google in early 2006, getting a very generous offer and joining a world-class team on the world’s largest search problem. Bezos is very upset.
  * In this environment, Bezos continues to push for taking risks outside of Amazon’s core business. **“There’s only one way out of this predicament, and that is to invent our way out.”**



2002: Amazon’s contract with UPS is up for renewal. Amazon has low negotiating leverage - it does little business with competitor Fedex, and the USPS can’t negotiate rates.

  * Over 6 months, Amazon integrates with FedEx and increases the volume of packages. It also increases shipment injections with USPS.
  * When Wilke threatens to walk from a UPS negotiation, UPS calls his bluff. Wilke makes a call to “turn them off.” **Amazon gives UPS zero packages to ship for 72 hours.**
  * UPS partially calls the bluff, saying they know FedEx is overwhelmed and Amazon can’t keep it up. But they cave and settle on discounted rates.
