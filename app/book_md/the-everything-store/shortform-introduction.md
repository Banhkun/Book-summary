## Shortform Introduction

_The Everything Store_ is the story of Amazon, from its founding as an online bookstore to its rise as a commerce giant.

The book covers the book roughly chronologically, going out of sequence to group themes together into chapters, such as its culture and innovation problems in the early 2000s and its acquisitions in mid-2000s. We’ve chosen to discuss the book strictly chronologically, which allows you to see its relentless pace of progress and the number of parallel high-potential projects living at any time. For instance, AWS, Kindle, Prime, A9 search engine, and competition with Zappos all were developed at around the same time. It also gives a better sense of how quickly Amazon needed to fend off other tech giants like Google, who are executing equally as fast.

The book also covers a number of Amazon and Bezos’s management techniques and idiosyncrasies. We’ve grouped them into dedicated chapters after the biography.
