## Chapter 7: Building a Productive Team

So far, the concepts we’ve explored have related to increasing your personal productivity. Now we’ll shift the focus to organizational productivity. In particular, we’ll discuss how you can build productive teams in the workplace.

At some point in your working life, it’s almost guaranteed that you’ll need to work in a team. In this situation, maintaining your personal productivity isn’t always enough for you to meet your goals. Instead, the team as a whole must be productive. How can you ensure that this is the case? What are the secrets to building an effective team?

### The Hallmarks of an Effective Team

Creating a productive team isn’t necessarily about who is part of the team. Research has shown that the personal attributes of team members are not that important when it comes to making a team effective. For example, one study found that having a team filled with people with high intellect didn’t necessarily mean that the team would be more productive. In fact, the opposite often proved to be true. These teams were often less effective than teams made up of people with lower intellect.

Instead, the key to building an effective team is creating the right norms within the team environment. **Norms are the unwritten and unspoken rules about behavior that exist within a particular group.** These rules control factors such as how people communicate, how members treat each other, and how decisions are made.

Norms can have a negative impact on a team’s effectiveness; for example, if there are norms of giving unconstructive or overly harsh criticism, placing personal gain over the aims of the team, or constant competition between members to become the team leader.

Similarly, generating the right norms can hugely improve a team’s effectiveness and thus its productivity. Research suggests that the norm that is most crucial in creating an effective team is **psychological safety.**

### Psychological Safety

**When a team is psychologically safe, the members of the team believe that they can share their views and take risks without having to fear retaliation or rejection.**

Psychologically safe teams have a culture that encourages participation from every member and discourages needless or overly harsh criticism or judgment. People don’t face punishment or humiliation for sharing their views, even if these views go against the general group consensus. Debate is encouraged rather than avoided. Such a culture requires respect and trust between the members of the team.

To create a culture of psychological safety in a team, two key ingredients are required.

#### Ingredient #1: Equal Participation

During meetings and other group situations, **each team member should speak for around the same amount of time.** Domination by one person or just a handful of people should be avoided. This equal participation helps team members to feel that they have an equal voice and affirms that their opinions are of equal importance to those of their team members. In turn, this will help team members to feel secure, valued, and psychologically safe within the group.

There is one caveat to this ingredient: equal participation won’t create psychological safety if nobody listens to their fellow team members. The person speaking needs to feel like everyone wants to hear their contribution. They shouldn’t be made to feel that people are listening begrudgingly or out of mere politeness. Team members need to be fully committed to both sharing their own thoughts and listening to everyone else’s.

#### Ingredient #2: Social Sensitivity

**“Social sensitivity” is the ability to read others’ emotions using cues such as tone of voice and body language.**

In a team setting, social sensitivity is an important way of monitoring people’s emotional reactions to discussions, proposals, and each other. It enables teams to detect whether any members are feeling frustrated or are having misgivings about the direction of the team’s work.

These members can then be encouraged to voice how they’re feeling. They will feel that their opinions are valued and their emotions respected, thus increasing their psychological safety.

Social sensitivity can also help team members to monitor each other’s general emotional wellbeing. If someone seems upset or preoccupied, the other members of the team will know that they need to check in with this person. This will make the upset person feel seen, valued, and cared for, again increasing their psychological safety within the group.

### The Role of Leaders in Creating Psychological Safety

**The most important player in creating psychological safety is the team leader.** If you’re in this position, you need to quite literally lead by example. You need to encourage others to engage in behaviors that promote psychological safety by modeling these behaviors yourself.

Firstly, you need to ensure that every team member has had an equal opportunity to participate in discussions. If certain members have been quieter during a meeting, you should directly ask them what their perspective is. Refrain from simply allowing the loudest team members to dominate the discussion. This will prevent equal engagement.

Secondly, you should make sure that team members feel listened to by discussing their ideas and answering their questions. A simple technique that demonstrates that you’ve been listening is to summarize what members have said after they’ve finished speaking.

Thirdly, you must encourage social sensitivity by monitoring and acknowledging all team members’ emotions. You also need to react respectfully and sensitively to these emotions. Don’t brush off team members’ emotions or ignore them outright.

Finally, you should prevent damaging norms from developing by refusing to engage in these norms yourself. For example, never interrupt others when they’re speaking. This may create an interruption norm that leads to team members feeling disrespected and not listened to.

By modeling these behaviors, you will encourage your team to follow suit. This will enable a psychologically safe culture to flourish. **Your team will work together more effectively and will become more productive.**

### Example: Google’s Mission to Build the Perfect Team

In the early 2010s, Google began to research how to construct the most effective team. They codenamed their efforts Project Aristotle.

Before the study began, Google’s researchers defined the criteria of what made a successful team. These criteria included whether the team met their targets or goals, and the feelings of the members of the team. Did they feel productive? Were they happy in the team?

The first phase of the study focused on who was in each team. What were their personality types and backgrounds? Did they have certain skills or characteristics? How did the team members interact with each other? Did they socialize outside of work?

Ultimately, the researchers found no evidence that the makeup of a team made any difference to the team’s productivity. Most strikingly, teams that had almost the exact same membership could vary wildly in their effectiveness.

Next, the project examined each group’s norms. Did the team encourage debate or lean towards groupthink? Did they interrupt each other or take turns to make their points?

After analyzing each team and their differing norms, the researchers found that some norms are frequently linked to effective teamwork. They specifically found that many of the norms that correlated with effective teamwork were linked to psychological safety.

Eventually, Google’s researchers outlined the key norms that effective teams should have:

  * Team members should possess the conviction that the work they are doing is both important and meaningful.
  * The team needs to clearly define both their goals and each member’s role in the team.
  * Team members should see each other as dependable - they should feel that they can rely on each other.
  * Most crucially, the team members should feel psychologically safe. 



### Checklist: Creating Psychological Safety

What steps should leaders take to create psychological safety in their team?

  * Make sure that every team member has had the chance to participate equally in group work—and try to redress any balance issues as they emerge. 
  * Ensure that every member of the team feels they’ve been listened to by discussing their ideas and answering their questions. 
  * Model social sensitivity by monitoring and acknowledging the emotions of your team members.
  * Prevent damaging norms from developing by refusing to engage in these norms yourself—lead by example.
