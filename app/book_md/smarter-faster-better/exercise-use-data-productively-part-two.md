## Exercise: Use Data Productively, Part Two

Learn how to use data to help you solve a problem.

* * *

Think of a problem that you’re currently facing. Describe this problem in detail. What area(s) of your life is it affecting? How did the problem originate?

Outline any relevant data you have that could help you to further understand and solve this problem. For example, how is the situation affecting you now, and how could it affect you in the future? How did you or others approach a similar issue in the past, and what were the consequences of this approach?

Using the data you’ve considered, formulate some possible approaches to solving the problem. Outline the steps you’d need to take to put these approaches into action, and consider what the consequences of each approach might be.

Now that you’ve come up with some approaches to solving your problem, consider how you feel about the situation. Has your way forward become any clearer? Which approach—if any—do you think would be the best to take?
