## Chapter 6: Using Data Productively

The final method you can use to boost your personal productivity is learning how to use data productively.

Thanks to improvements in technology and the omnipresence of the Internet, we have access to vast amounts of data, both about ourselves and about the world at large. We can measure and track everything from our spending habits, to our calorie intake, to the number of steps we take every day.

If we make the most of this data, it can be a powerful force for change. We can track patterns, identify areas for improvement, and use the data to drive personal growth. We can even use data to help us solve problems and make better decisions. However, the idea of “making the most of the data” is easier said than done. While having access to lots of data can be very useful, it can cause problems.

Studies have shown that if we’re presented with too much data at once, we can enter a state called “information blindness.” Our minds simply cannot cope with the huge amount of data they’re being asked to process—so, we stop trying. We either start to ignore some of the data, misinterpret the data, or become so overwhelmed that we refuse to engage with it at all.

If you want to avoid information blindness and effectively absorb the data that’s necessary for your work, you can’t passively allow that data to wash over you. If you do, the brain won’t process it thoroughly. **Instead, you have to interact with the data in a meaningful and effective way.**

### How Can We Interact With Data Effectively?

To interact with data effectively, you have to do more than just look at it:**you have to do something with it, too.** It almost doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you do something.

This “doing something” can take many forms, including:

  * Writing the data out by hand 
  * Plotting the data on a graph
  * Explaining the data to another person
  * Incorporating the information into your daily life—for instance, if you learn a new word, forcing yourself to use it in a sentence
  * Asking yourself questions about the data and making choices based on your answers. For example, if the data is a long and complicated wine list, you could ask yourself, “do I want red or white? What is my price range?” and then choose a wine accordingly. Breaking large amounts of data down into smaller chunks like this makes it easier to digest. 



The process of interacting with data in this way is sometimes referred to as “creating disfluency.” **“Creating disfluency” means adding extra effort to the process of absorbing information, thus making this process a little more difficult.**

Adding this element of effort and difficulty forces you to pay extra attention to the data as you take it in. To fully absorb the data, you have to look at it closely and think about it deeply. This ultimately helps the information to stick in your brain; you become so engrossed in it that you automatically process it in a more thorough way.

#### Example: South Avondale School, Cincinnati

In the mid-2000s, South Avondale was one of the worst-performing elementary schools in Ohio. Its test scores were very low. For years, the city of Cincinnati had flooded the school with resources to try to improve it. This included giving teachers software that used huge amounts of data to track the performance of each student. The software collected data on everything from participation levels in class, to test scores, to each child’s attendance record. Teachers were encouraged to use this data to ascertain each student’s specific needs and the assistance they required.

The city felt that if this data were harnessed correctly, it could help to turn the school around.

Unfortunately, this simply wasn’t happening. The vast majority of South Avondale’s teachers confessed that they hardly ever looked at the data, let alone used it. So, in 2008, the city decided it was time for a new approach. They devised a program called the Elementary Initiative (EI.)

##### What Was the Elementary Initiative?

The EI focused on helping teachers to effectively use the data at their disposal. It tried to encourage them to actually interact with the data. Surprisingly, this didn’t involve looking at the online data dashboards that the city and the school had spent so much time creating. Instead, the EI introduced a new approach to data analysis. Each school had to have a “data room,” a room where teachers could go to interact with data on their students.

Teachers were encouraged to visit the room to write down data such as test scores and attendance on index cards. Then, they had to sort those index cards – and thus the data – into different groups. For instance, they could group cards based on which students were excelling and which were struggling.

The teachers were also encouraged to use the data to draw graphs charting student progress. They were also told to run experiments based on what the data showed – for example, investigating whether placing students in smaller reading groups could boost their test results.

##### Using the EI to Create Disfluency

At first, teachers were reluctant to use the data room; it seemed like a waste of time, especially considering they already had all of the data on their easier-to-use computer systems.

However, they eventually realized that visiting the room and interacting with the data was helping them to spot patterns they’d otherwise have missed. They could then take steps to change these patterns.

For example, one teacher found that some of his students struggled with learning fractions, but had easily got the hang of pronoun use. Another teacher found that his students were in the exact opposite situation: struggling with pronouns, but excelling at fractions. The teachers swapped lesson plans, and in both classes, students’ test results improved.

Over time, it became clear that the EI was highly effective. By the 2010 to 2011 school year, South Avondale was transformed. Student performance had increased drastically; test scores had shot up.

This success was down to the fact that the EI harnessed the power of disfluency. The process of working with the data in such a hands-on way had helped it stick in the teachers’ minds. They were now able to recall the data effectively, analyze it much more thoroughly, and spot areas of strength and weakness in their students. They could then act on the data to help their students to progress.

### Using Data to Solve Problems and Make Better Decisions

Another important way in which you can use data productively is by incorporating it into your problem-solving and decision-making processes. You can do this using the engineering design process.

**The engineering design process is a data-driven framework for solving problems and making choices.** While this process originated in the engineering industry, we can apply it to decision making in our everyday lives.

The engineering design process is made up of five defined steps:

**Step 1:** Clearly outline the problem you need to solve or the decision you need to make.

**Step 2:** Collect data related to this decision or problem. In this context, “data” means any information that could help you to come up with a solution to the problem, or help you to decide the best way forward. This could include:

  * Information that you’ve collected through your past experiences—for example, what you’ve learned when making similar decisions in the past, or how similar situations have played out for other people you know
  * Information about how the situation and its possible solutions may affect you in the future—for example, will the situation impact your time, your money, or your relationships with others? How could different approaches to the situation change its potential impact on your life?



**Step 3:** Use this collected data to brainstorm all of the possible approaches you could take to solving the decision or problem. What are all of the different choices you could make, and the different paths forward that you could tread?

**Step 4:** Conduct experiments to test the possible approaches to your problem or decision. For example, imagine what might happen if you pursued a certain choice. Think about what might go well, and what might go wrong. If you’re in a group situation, you can discuss and evaluate these different approaches together.

**Step 5:** Repeat steps 1 to 4 until an appropriate solution is found.

#### The Benefits of the Engineering Design Process

Using the engineering design process provides several benefits. Firstly, it can help you to make decisions and solve problems more objectively. The process is based on objective raw data, rather than your subjective emotions and biases or the expectations of others.

Secondly, the process may help you to view your past experiences in a different, more positive way. Even bad things that have happened to you and mistakes you’ve made become useful sources of data that you can use in the future.

Thirdly, the process breaks down what can seem like a huge decision or an overwhelming problem into smaller, more manageable steps. It can make your dilemmas feel like much easier hurdles to overcome.

Finally, and most importantly, **the engineering design process can help you to overcome the brain’s unhelpful default reaction when we face a difficult decision or problem.**

The brain often wants to find resolutions to such situations quickly and easily. It loves to make things simple. So, it streamlines the process of finding a solution as much as possible. It finds a limited frame of reference in which to view the situation. Rather than considering every possible variable that could affect your approach to the situation, it focuses on two or three. It ignores a lot of the data that could help you to make your choice, entering a version of the “information blindness” state.

This unhelpful process can be illustrated through the example of deciding which car to buy. This can be a complicated process: there are many different cars out there, and many variables to consider. The most sensible course of action is to consider all of these variables before making your choice. After all, a car is a big investment: you want to make sure you buy the right one.

However, your brain may choose to focus on only a few variables to try to make the decision easier. For instance, it may reduce the choice to the simple binary of “do I want a car with a built-in GPS or heated seats?” This may make your choice easier in the moment, but it also ignores other, important factors in the choice, such as “can I actually afford this car?”

By using the engineering design process, you can prevent this unhelpful thought process from taking hold. **You can break free of an unhelpful, limited frame of reference, and use one that’s more thorough.** The process forces you to consider every possible variable involved in a decision and problem as you examine all of the relevant data that’s available to you. Likewise, the process requires you to come up with multiple solutions to a problem, rather than just jumping to the quickest and easiest resolution. You’re more likely to make good decisions and solve problems effectively if you’ve taken this thorough approach.

#### Example: The Engineering Design Process in Action

Following the success of the Elementary Initiative, the city of Cincinnati tried to replicate the program in struggling high schools. While this did lead to some improvements, teachers felt that the approach wasn’t quite right. High school students have a much shorter window of intervention compared to elementary school students; it can be hard to change their habits and attitudes. Unfortunately, analyzing data in the style of the EI wasn’t necessarily a quick process, so it was easy for this window to be missed.

The teachers felt that what these students needed was a way to get better at making the difficult, life-changing decisions that many of them faced. For example, should they go to college or get a job? Which of their many struggling family members should they help?

To address these issues, the school district set up a new program for high school students. This program aimed to help students to make choices based on objective data, not their emotions or the expectations of their loved ones. It taught the students how to use the engineering design process.

##### The Engineering Design Process at Western Hills High

At Western Hills High, one of the schools that implemented this new program, a student named Delia Morris signed up for the classes.

Delia was a very gifted student, and her teachers felt she definitely had the potential to go to college. However, many gifted students at Western Hills High were prevented from reaching their full potential due to poverty, and Delia was at risk of this—she had a tough home life.

During Delia’s sophomore year of high school, her older sister had a baby. She asked Delia if she could babysit each afternoon. Delia was under pressure from her father to agree; after all, family helped each other out, right? Delia found herself needing to make a tough decision.

Delia decided to use the engineering design process to work out what to do. She collected data about how babysitting would impact her and her schoolwork; for example, the time it would eat up, and the time she would have left behind to study. She also collected data from the past experiences of people she knew. For instance, when Delia’s sister had agreed to take on a job to help her family, she’d had to put her aspirations – including college – on hold.

Delia analyzed all of the data she’d collected and tested all of the different approaches she could take to the problem. Eventually, she decided that she couldn’t babysit. It was too much of a commitment and would threaten her future. She would be too tired at the end of each day to complete her schoolwork. Her grades would suffer. Likewise, she might start to resent her family. When she explained her reasoning to her father, he agreed with her conclusion. Delia was able to harness the power of data to make the decision that was best for her.
