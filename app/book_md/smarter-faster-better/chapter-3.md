## Chapter 3: Setting Effective Goals

We’ve considered the methods you can use to stay focused on your goals and boost your productivity. But how can you set effective goals in the first place?

Having the right goals is crucial in maintaining productivity for a number of reasons. Firstly, to be productive, you need to know exactly what you’re striving towards. Secondly, you need to be sure that you’re aiming for the right results. Finally, whether or not you meet your goals is often used as a measure of how productive you are. That measure will be inaccurate if your goals were flawed from the start.

This chapter considers two types of goals that you can use in tandem to enhance your productivity:

  * Type #1: **stretch goals.** These are ambitious and far-reaching goals that will often take a lot of planning and effort to accomplish. 
  * Type #2: **SMART goals.** These are smaller, more focused objectives. They are often the smaller steps you’ll need to take to fulfill your stretch goal.



### Stretch Goals

**A stretch goal is an aim so audacious that at first glance, it might not seem possible.** Examples of stretch goals include running a marathon, starting a successful company, or writing a book.

Setting and pursuing such ambitious goals can transform your perspective and your way of working in three ways:

  1. These goals are inspirational. They challenge you to be more productive so that you can achieve things you’d never dreamed could be possible.
  2. The challenging nature of stretch goals prevents complacency. You know that to fulfill such an ambitious goal, you’ll need to work hard and push yourself. 
  3. In your quest to make the seemingly impossible possible, you become more imaginative, innovative, and willing to pursue new avenues of thinking.



Research has demonstrated a strong link between setting stretch goals and increased productivity. For example, a 1997 study found that Motorola ordering its employees to set stretch goals led to a tenfold decrease in the time it took engineers to develop new products.

(Shortform note: To learn more about setting stretch goals, read our summary of Measure What Matters _.)_

#### Example: The Japanese Bullet Train

In the 1950s, the 320-mile train journey between the Japanese cities of Tokyo and Osaka could take up to 20 hours. This long journey time was problematic; this was a high-demand route, in terms of transporting both people and raw materials. So, in 1955, Japan’s top engineers were challenged to invent a faster train.

Within six months, the engineers had created a prototype of a train that could go 65 miles per hour. This was an impressive feat: they’d created one of the fastest trains of its kind in the world. However, when the engineers presented their design to the head of the railway system, he wanted something faster. He set them a new, audacious stretch goal: building a train capable of traveling at 120 miles per hour.

The engineers protested that this task was impossible. They named all sorts of issues that would prevent them from meeting the goal. For example, trains traveling that fast would derail if they turned corners too sharply. To get rid of the need for trains to turn, they would need to tunnel through mountains, which would be an incredibly expensive process. It just didn’t seem feasible. However, the head of Japan’s railways was insistent: they were going to do whatever it took to meet their stretch goal.

The engineers realized that the only way to meet their seemingly impossible stretch goal was to completely transform every element of the Japanese railway system. Over years, they innovated everything from new train cars to stronger tracks. They even drilled tunnels through the mountains! With each innovation, the train’s maximum possible speed would increase.

Eventually, the engineers achieved their goal. The new bullet train traveled at an average speed of 120 miles per hour. This reduced the journey time between Tokyo and Osaka from 20 hours to just under four hours. The stretch goal gave the engineers the push they needed to challenge their perceived limitations, innovate, and produce the seemingly impossible.

### SMART Goals

SMART goals are objectives that follow certain criteria. They must be:

  * **Specific:** You must outline a targeted objective, not a vague aspiration.
  * **Measurable:** You must be able to measure the goal’s success.
  * **Achievable and Realistic:** You must actually have the time, resources, and capabilities to complete this goal; doing so has to be possible.
  * **Timely:** You must have an expected timeline for accomplishing the goal.



These goals often have a much smaller scope than stretch goals. For the stretch goal of writing a book, a SMART goal might be writing one chapter, or even one section of a chapter.

There are various benefits to setting SMART goals. **Because SMART goals are by design detailed and have been extensively thought through, the path to achieving them is often very clear.** This can have a motivating effect. It’s easier to motivate yourself to work towards a goal when you have a clear plan to follow.

Likewise, by forcing you to set a timeline for the completion of your goal, SMART goals can encourage discipline. You can no longer procrastinate your task: you’ve got a deadline to meet.

#### Example: The Typist Experiment

In 1975, two psychologists conducted a study on how setting goals could boost productivity. For their experiment, they recruited 45 typists from a large corporation. These typists were already considered very productive; on average, their output was 95 typewritten lines per hour. Each typist was given the goal of increasing their output by a certain number of lines per hour.

The psychologists made sure that the typists’ goals were SMART. Each typist received a specific output level to aim for that was realistic and achievable based on their capabilities and situation. They were given a timeline of when they should achieve this increased output, and they were shown how to measure their hourly output so that they could measure their progress towards the goal.

Within a week of starting the experiment, the typists’ average output rate had increased to 103 lines per hour. After another week, the average rose again to 112 lines per hour. When the researchers checked on the typists in three months, they were all still typing at their new faster rate. In fact, some were typing even faster than before. Having a SMART goal had boosted the typists’ productivity to unprecedented levels.

### How to Use Stretch and SMART Goals Productively

When used alone, stretch and SMART goals both have pitfalls. For instance, if used alone, stretch goals can become too overwhelming. You’ve come up with big ideas, but have no idea how to act on them. Because you’re unsure how to move forward, you just do nothing.

Likewise, if you simply give yourself a list of snappy SMART goals without any overarching goal to tie them together, you can lose sight of your higher purpose and the objectives you should prioritize to achieve that purpose. You risk becoming too focused on achieving cognitive closure.

**Cognitive closure is a thought process that’s rooted in a preference for decisiveness over ambiguity.** In general, your brain is drawn to making quick, clear choices, rather than remaining in a state of uncertainty or confusion. You find yourself wanting to get things done and meet your goals because it makes you feel productive. It brings you a feeling of closure that is satisfying.

Chasing cognitive closure can sometimes be useful. It can help you to move forward efficiently, rather than spending a long time going back and forth over what to do. However, it becomes problematic when feeling the closure and satisfaction that comes with completing a goal becomes more important to you than the actual productivity of the goal. If you fall into this trap, you may be tempted to set SMART goals that are quick and easy to complete so that you can feel closure swiftly, rather than goals that will help you to move forward and achieve your higher aims.

#### Use Stretch and SMART Goals Together

**To overcome these pitfalls and achieve maximum productivity, you should use stretch and SMART goals together.** You should start with an ambitious stretch goal and then flesh out the process of achieving that goal using targeted SMART goals.

Doing this makes the goal-setting process smoother in two ways. Firstly, if you break down your ambitious stretch goal into smaller, easily actionable SMART goals, you can avoid becoming overwhelmed. Creating concrete steps towards meeting the stretch goal makes it much more manageable. You’ve created a framework you can follow to move closer to achieving your dreams.

Secondly, pairing your SMART goals with a stretch goal helps you to avoid the trap of cognitive closure. The stretch goal provides you with the focal point that you need to ensure that your SMART goals are truly productive, and not just fast-track routes to closure. If you create your SMART goals keeping your stretch goal in mind, you’re less likely to veer off course.

### The Importance of Flexibility

One final element of successfully using SMART and stretch goals is **a willingness to be flexible with your goals.**

In our pursuit of cognitive closure, we can become unwilling to revisit our goals once we’ve set them. We want to chase the satisfaction of meeting those goals, and not risk losing our closure if we revisit our goals and find that they’re no longer appropriate for our situation. Because of this, we slip into a state of rigidity of thought. We become unwilling to consider any other possibilities than our current goals.

If we become too rigid and refuse to revisit our goals, we could spend large amounts of time focusing on a goal that’s no longer productive. Instead, we need to be open to constantly evaluating and reconsidering our goals, and deciding whether they’re still the best way forward. Do we have new information that affects the relevance of our goals? Have our priorities changed? If so, we need to set new goals accordingly.

#### Example: The Yom Kippur War

In 1972, Eli Zeira was appointed head of Israel’s Directorate of Military Intelligence, a body with the responsibility of updating the Israeli people on the likelihood of war with their old adversaries, Egypt and Syria. When he was appointed, Zeira had two clear goals:

  1. He wanted to reduce the Israeli people’s anxiety over the possibility of war.
  2. He wanted to prevent the alarm from being raised unless there was a definite threat of war. In the past, the Directorate had raised the alarm needlessly, causing unnecessary anxiety. 



Zeira introduced a new formula to assess the likelihood of war, known as “the concept.” He theorized that Egypt and Syria wouldn’t attack again until they had long-range missiles and stronger air forces. They had lacked these capabilities in the last war—unlike Israel—and had been defeated. He was sure they wouldn’t risk the same fate again.

Zeira also enforced a new mindset in the Directorate which prioritized efficiency and decisiveness. Once a risk estimate was made, everyone was committed to it. Dissenting views weren’t tolerated, and rigidity of thought was encouraged.

##### Zeira’s Lack of Flexibility Puts Israelis in Danger

In early October 1973, worrying signs suggested war was coming. Egypt and Syria were increasing military activity at their borders with Israel. Likewise, the Soviets had evacuated all of their advisers from Syria and Egypt, suggesting imminent danger.

Despite these signs, Zeira was adamant that war was not likely since neither Syria nor Egypt had met the criteria of “the concept.” He felt that there was no need to raise the alert or begin to prepare for a war that would not come. The Israeli Prime Minister and her other senior military personnel heeded Zeira’s advice.

On the morning of October 6th, the Israelis gained credible intelligence stating that the Egyptians would invade later that day. They could no longer deny that war was imminent and finally began to prepare. However, they had left it too late to be fully ready for the invasion. It was hard to mobilize the army and the reserves effectively in such a short time frame. The fact that it was Yom Kippur, a religious holiday, made the process even slower.

When Egypt and Syria invaded, Israel was unprepared and struggled to respond effectively. While the Israelis eventually staved off the invasion, it was a close call. Thousands of Israelis lost their lives or were injured.

Zeira and his colleagues had become overly focused on their original goals of reducing Israeli anxiety and only raising the alert when necessary. They hadn’t been willing to re-examine and amend their goals, even when evidence suggested that they were no longer appropriate. They should have adopted a new goal: keeping the Israeli people safe. Their refusal to do so had devastating consequences.
