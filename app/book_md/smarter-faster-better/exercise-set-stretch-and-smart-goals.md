## Exercise: Set Stretch and SMART Goals

Learn how to make a stretch goal more manageable by setting a SMART goal.

* * *

Describe a stretch goal that you’d like to work towards. Remember, this goal can be as audacious and ambitious as you want.

Do you feel confident about this stretch goal? At this point, can you see a clear path you can take to achieve it, or does it feel overwhelmingly ambitious?

Next, identify an initial SMART goal that will help you move closer to completing your stretch goal. Try to include as much of the SMART criteria as possible: make your goal specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely.

Now that you’ve set this SMART goal, how do you feel about your stretch goal? Does it feel more achievable? Do you have a clearer idea of your way forward?
