## Exercise: Use Frustration to Fuel Innovation

Learn how you can use your frustrations to inspire innovation.

* * *

What’s something that’s frustrated you, a family member, or a friend recently? Describe the situation, its causes, and its effects.

In a perfect world, how would you solve the frustrating issue? Are there any existing ideas or solutions to other problems that you could rework to solve your issue?

What elements of your ideal solution might work in the real world? In what ways might it fall short?

Consider how you feel about the frustrating situation now. Do you feel any closer to resolving it?
