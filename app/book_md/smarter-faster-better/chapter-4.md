## Chapter 4: Making Productive Decisions

Now that you’re motivated, focused, and have stretch and SMART goals to aspire to, what else do you need to do to maximize your productivity? The next step is **ensuring that you’re making productive decisions** ; decisions that will move you further towards meeting your goals. Making bad decisions can lead to mistakes, wasted energy, and unproductive actions.

But how can you make sure that your decisions are productive? In short, making good, productive decisions is arguably all about being able to predict the future with some degree of accuracy. You need to be able to discern the consequences of your decisions, whether these consequences will be positive or negative, and whether they’ll help or hinder your productivity. Once you’ve got an idea of what the consequences of your decision will be, you can decide whether or not to proceed with it. If the likely consequences are positive, great! If not, it might be time to rethink your course of action.

Admittedly, accurately predicting the consequences of your decisions can be a difficult and imprecise art. Nobody can fully foresee what’s going to happen in the future, and nobody is going to get it right all of the time. However, to increase the accuracy of your predictions, you can engage in**probabilistic thinking.** This is a cognitive process that involves identifying all of the possible futures that your decision could lead to, and then calculating the probability of each possible future coming true.

### Probabilistic Thinking

Probabilistic thinking works on the assumption that the future isn’t one set path that’s definitely going to occur. **Instead, it’s a series of possible outcomes, some of which are more likely to occur than others.**

When thinking probabilistically, you must first thoroughly outline all of the possible futures that your choices could lead to, including futures that seem contradictory. Then, you need to accurately estimate the odds of each scenario coming to pass. To do this, you need to consider all of the different variables that could affect the odds of an outcome coming to pass, and decide on a probability accordingly.

Once you know the odds of each possible future occurring, you can decide whether to proceed with your decision or not. You know the relative odds of the decision having a positive or negative outcome, and can use this information to make a wise choice.

Research has demonstrated that probabilistic thinking helps us to generate accurate predictions about the consequences of our decisions. A study conducted by psychologists from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California-Berkeley found that training people to think probabilistically increased the accuracy of their predictions by as much as 50%. **By basing your decisions on accurate predictions, you can vastly increase the chances that your choice works out well.**

#### What Are the Benefits of Probabilistic Thinking?

Using probabilistic thinking can have a range of benefits. For one, it adds rigor to the decision-making process. It requires you to consider your decision and its possible consequences from numerous vantage points. It also forces you to be honest with yourself about the consequences of your choices, even if that involves confronting harsh truths—for instance, discovering that a decision that you desperately want to make has low odds of success and should probably be avoided.

Secondly, approaching decisions in a probabilistic way stops you from rushing into choices that are based solely on what you want in a given moment, and not on the actual benefits or risks of that decision. Ultimately, you’re able to make wiser choices.

Finally, probabilistic thinking forces you to consider all of the possible negative outcomes of your decision and their odds of occurring—an often distressing process that you may otherwise avoid. By making sure you identify these possible negative outcomes, you can prepare for them and, if possible, make decisions that prevent them from coming to pass.

##### Example: Getting Lunch With Your Spouse

Midway through the working day, your spouse asks you out to lunch. This lunch could go one of two ways:

  * Outcome #1: Go have lunch, have a lovely time, and come back feeling relaxed and happy.
  * Outcome #2: Go have lunch, end up discussing stressful topics such as issues with childcare, and return to work feeling on edge.



Because you know that number two is a possibility, you can actively reduce the likelihood of it happening. If your spouse tries to bring up the childcare issues, you can ask them to wait until the evening to discuss the subject. You can steer the situation towards Outcome #1. By contemplating the possible negative outcomes ahead of time, you’ve helped yourself to make a wiser decision.

#### What Are the Limitations of Probabilistic Thinking?

No method of predicting the future is infallible, and probabilistic thinking is no exception to this. Ultimately, the whole process falls apart if we aren’t honest with ourselves about the odds of each possible outcome coming true.

When we really want a particular outcome to come true, we might be tempted to assign it very high odds of doing so—not based on the actual likelihood of it happening, but based on our emotions. We’re likely to ignore or downplay any signs that the odds are low and overestimate the significance of signs that the odds are high. We may then end up making a poor decision based on this inaccurate assessment of the odds. We’ve set ourselves up for potential disappointment or difficulties further down the line, when the consequences of our decision prove to be quite different from what we’d hoped.

To avoid this, it’s important that we estimate the odds of each outcome realistically. Doing so may feel hard or disappointing when the odds don’t end up reflecting our preferences. But it’s a necessary step if we want our probabilistic thinking to actually benefit us and lead us towards the wisest decision.

Even if you approach calculating odds with an honest mindset, it can still be a difficult process.

You may struggle to find the information you need to calculate accurate odds. Sometimes, there’s simply no way of knowing how a decision will pan out. In other cases, you may find some information that indicates the possible consequences of a choice, but not enough to be certain.

### Bayesian Cognition

Luckily, you don’t have to use probabilistic thinking in isolation. You can pair it with **Bayesian cognition.** This involves using assumptions based on your experience of the world to accurately predict outcomes.

Proponents of Bayesian cognition believe that **we can predict the future fairly accurately if we make assumptions based on previously observed patterns and information.** For example, if you’re asked to predict how much longer a 50-year-old person will live, you can make an assumption based on life expectancy patterns.

You may already be using Bayesian cognition without even realizing it. The brain constantly gathers data about patterns that exist in the world around you. It uses this data to form assumptions about how the world works. It then instinctively applies these assumptions when it’s time for you to make a prediction.

Forming accurate assumptions about the world and how it operates can help to make your probabilistic thinking more reliable. You may be able to instinctively tell how likely a particular outcome is based on situations and patterns you’ve observed in the past. However, the crucial word here is “accurate.” **You need to make sure that your assumptions are correct.** If they’re not, issues with Bayesian thinking can arise. If you start out with faulty assumptions about the world, any predictions you make based on these assumptions will be inaccurate.

(Shortform note: To learn more about Bayesian cognition, probabilistic thinking, and making smart decisions, read our summary of Thinking, Fast and Slow.)

##### Example: An Experiment on Bayesian Cognition

In the 1990s, professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology conducted a study on how people are able to make predictions when they have limited data on a topic. They asked students to make predictions based on one small piece of information—for instance, asking how much longer a U.S. congressman will serve if he’s already served for 15 years. The situations that the students were asked to predict predominantly followed strict patterns. However, the students weren’t given information about these patterns in advance.

The study found that a lot of the time, the students’ predictions were spookily accurate. In some cases, they made predictions that were within 10% of what the data indicated was the “correct” answer. The students couldn’t always explain why they’d made these accurate predictions; they often claimed that their answer had just “felt” right. They’d intuitively used their prior assumptions and knowledge to come to the right conclusion. This was strong Bayesian cognition in action.

However, there was one situation in which the students failed to predict the answer accurately.

They were asked to predict the total reign of a pharaoh in Ancient Egypt if he’d already ruled for 11 years. The students predicted that the pharaoh would rule for on average another 23 years. However, the data suggested that the pharaoh would only rule for another 12 years.

The students were unable to predict this answer correctly because they’d begun with a faulty assumption. They’d based their predictions on the assumption that a pharaoh’s lifespan—and therefore his total time on the throne—would follow the same pattern as the lifespan of a European king from a later period. These kings tended to survive until they were elderly if they made it past middle age, leading to a lengthy reign.

However, the students were missing a key piece of information. They didn’t realize that in the time of the pharaohs, people generally had much lower life expectancies compared to the kings of later eras. For this reason, the average length of time a pharaoh spent as a ruler was significantly shorter than that of European kings. Because they didn’t have this information, the students were unable to make an accurate prediction. They were unable to apply Bayesian cognition effectively.

#### How Can We Ensure Our Assumptions Are Accurate?

**To ensure that your assumptions are accurate, you need to take in as much information about the world as possible.** You should seek out experiences and perspectives that will widen your knowledge of the patterns that surround you.

Easy, right? Unfortunately, not quite. To make sure you take in the right kind of information, you need to be aware of certain biases that the brain has when it comes to the information it seeks out.

A major example of such a cognitive bias is the way we internalize success and failure. Our minds tend to place greater importance on times we’ve succeeded than on times we’ve failed. Sometimes, we omit failures from our memory entirely. For this reason, we tend to have an inflated view of the odds of success and forget to factor in the likelihood of failure. As a result, our assumptions become inaccurate. We end up predicting success too often.

To counteract this, we need to actively search for information on times we and others have failed. We should build up a picture of the factors that can increase the likelihood of failure, where we and others have gone wrong in the past, and why these failures occurred. It’s not fun to contemplate why you’ve failed, or to ask others why they’ve failed. But, it’s necessary in order to improve your likelihood of making good decisions in the future.

Another way to strengthen your assumptions is to consider situations in which you were certain things would turn out one way but were ultimately proved wrong. Why were your Bayesian instincts so incorrect? Did you work on a faulty assumption? What information do you need to seek out to stop this from happening again?

### Example: Probabilistic Thinking and Bayesian Cognition in Poker

Poker is all about making predictions; predicting what cards are going to come up, and what your opponents are going to do. Players can strengthen these predictions by using probabilistic thinking and Bayesian cognition.

##### Probabilistic Thinking

In the 2004 Tournament of Champions, former psychology student Annie Duke was up against some of the world’s best poker players, including Greg “the FossilMan” Rayner. In a crucial turn, Rayner pushed all of his chips into the pot. This suggested he had a very strong hand. Duke needed to decide whether she should match this bet, or fold.

Duke thought of all of the possible futures that could come from this hand and the variables that affected these futures’ odds. Duke had a fairly strong hand. If this hand turned out to be stronger than Rayner’s, she could end up winning big and becoming the frontrunner of the tournament.

However, Rayner could have a stronger hand than she did. If Duke matched Rayner’s bet in this scenario, she would end up losing everything and being knocked out of the tournament. If Duke folded, she would lose a lot of the progress she’d made in this game, but would be able to carry on in the tournament.

Ultimately, Duke needed to figure out how likely it was that Rayner had a strong hand. Rayner could be bluffing and actually have a terrible hand. He could have gone all-in simply to scare Duke off and encourage her to fold, knowing that this was the only way he’d emerge from the round victorious. Or, Rayner could genuinely have a strong hand. He could have gone all-in because he’d confidently predicted that he would beat Duke.

Throughout the tournament, Rayner had proven to be a very rational player. He’d never gone all-in without having a good reason to do so. Based on this, Duke theorized that it was most likely that he’d bet as if he had a strong hand because he actually did have a strong hand. He wasn’t bluffing or taking a massive risk; he was acting rationally based on the hand he’d been dealt.

Duke folded. Later, Rayner told her that she’d made the right choice; he’d had a stronger hand than she did.

##### Bayesian Cognition

Probabilistic thinking isn’t the only cognitive approach that can help you in poker. Bayesian cognition can come in handy, too.

According to Annie Duke, observing certain traits about your opponent can help you to make Bayesian assumptions about how they’ll play. For instance, Duke’s experience has taught her that 40-year-old businessmen usually only care about the prestige that comes with playing poker against experts; they don’t actually care about winning. Because of this, they’re likely to take a lot of risks. Using this assumption, Duke can make strong predictions about how a game against someone in this demographic will pan out and play in a way that maximizes her chances of winning.

However, for Duke, coming up with these initial assumptions isn’t enough. She updates her assumptions as she begins to observe how her opponents actually play. For instance, she may find that a 40-year-old businessman is able to make excellent bluffs. This would suggest that he is a cautious and skilled player after all, and that she shouldn’t underestimate him. Duke wants to keep her assumptions as accurate as possible so that her predictions regarding her opponents’ actions remain accurate, too.
