## Exercise: Generate Motivation

Learn how to become more motivated by linking your task to a higher goal.

* * *

What's a task you're not looking forward to tackling, or one that you frequently have trouble motivating yourself to complete?

What is one small action you could take to feel in control of the situation? For example, you could choose which part of the task you’re going to focus on first.

What higher purpose could you link the task to in order to generate motivation? What overarching goals could completing the task help you to achieve? Think about the bigger picture that this task slots into.

Now that you’ve tried to give yourself control and thought about the higher purpose, how do you feel about the task?
