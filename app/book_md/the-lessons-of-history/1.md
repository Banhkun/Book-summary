## 1: History and the Earth

Geography is the physical structure that holds history.

Civilization habitually develops along waterways - rivers, lakes, oceans - to provide life and offering inexpensive routes of transport and trade.

  * Egypt and Nile, India and Ganges, Italy and the Tiber/Arno/Po, France and the Rhone.
  * For 2000 years the Mediterranean hosted the battles of the “white man’s ascendancy.”



The airplane neutralizes some advantage of waterways, allowing inland countries (Russia, China, Brazil) to develop.

Outside forces like climate no longer control humans, but they limit us. And we are still at the mercy of these larger forces - an earthquake can destroy a city that took two centuries to build.

But, at the end of the day, despite the influence of earth, man is the one that makes civilization by transforming the possibilities into fact.
