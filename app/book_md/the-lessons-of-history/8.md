## 8: Socialism and History

Nothing instills the spirit of competition and inventiveness and exhaustive labor like capitalism and self-interest do.

Yet elements of socialism have recurred throughout history. These include state control of commerce, wide government employment, price controls, welfare, progressive taxation, redistribution of wealth, and large public works to reduce unemployment.

  * Examples include Sumeria in 2100BC; Egypt under the Ptolemies (300BC); Rome under Diocletian (301AD); China in 140BC and in 1068 (Wang An-shih); the Incas until the 1500s.



Socialism is especially palatable under threat of security. When external danger mounts, people are willing to forsake internal liberty.

  * In Diocletian Rome, the threat of barbarians spurred the society to subsume individual liberty to collective liberty.
  * In Communist Russia, the fall of the disgraced Czarist government led to internal disorder and threat of external attack, allowing a socialist system to take hold.



**Socialist institutions are commonly overturned when:**

  * the authorities become corrupt, no longer returning taxes to benefit the populace
  * high taxation causes indolence, resentment, and escape of high earners to lower-tax societies
  * revolt is spurred by those whose profits are cut short (often the rich, who mobilize the masses on their behalf)
  * disasters (natural and manmade) cause upheaval and discontent



In the modern day, communism has taken on capitalist flair to stimulate productivity. Inversely, capitalist societies have taken on socialist programs to curb discontent with inequality. And so capitalism and communism look more like each other than they did decades past.
