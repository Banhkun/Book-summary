## 12: Is Progress Real?

If history repeats itself endlessly, then is humanity actually making progress?

It depends on how you define progress.

  * Cultural: Is Shakespeare better than Aeschylus? Nietzsche over Confucius?
  * Religion: As we become more secular, have we developed a natural ethic strong enough to keep us from our baser instincts? Or will chaos and confusion prod us back to the order of religion?



The authors have no strong conclusion. History has so many examples and counterexamples that almost any conclusion can be drawn, depending on what lens you look through.

If progress is defined as humanity’s control over the environment, there is certainly progress.

  * Quality of life for the average person is way up compared to primitive times. “If undertakers are miserable, progress is real.”



If progress is defined as increase in happiness, then there has been little progress.

  * Humans will always find a way to be miserable. There is a perverse pleasure in rejecting the universe as unsatisfying and incomplete.
  * We romanticize our ancestors who had to worry only about their local village. As the world’s complexity increases, our perceived troubles rise in kind.



Yet human nature has seemed largely fixed. Science and technology are new means of achieving the same old ends - acquisition of goods, sex, and power.

  * Science is neutral - it can kill us as readily as it will heal.
  * We are “the same trousered apes at two thousand miles an hour.”



#### An Optimistic Note

The achievements of civilization (fire, wheel, language, agriculture) have passed from one to the next. They connect eras to each other, back to the beginnings of biology.

The amount of achievement in human history is staggering. Interrupt this transmission for 100 years and we return to being savages.

Education is the transmission of a multifactorial heritage - our modes of thought, morals, technology, and culture. This heritage is richer than ever before, including all of Greek thinking and the Italian Renaissance.

History is the creation and recording of this heritage. Progress is its increasing abundance, preservation, transmission, and use.
