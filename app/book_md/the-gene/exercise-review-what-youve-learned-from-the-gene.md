## Exercise: Review What You’ve Learned From The Gene

 _The Gene_ contains a lot of information about both the history and science of genetics. Take a moment now to think about what you’ve read, and consider what you know now that you didn’t know before.

* * *

What’s something you’ve learned about the _history_ of genetics? This could be an important scientist whose name you didn’t know, or a surprising discovery you weren’t aware of.

What’s something you’ve learned about the _science_ of genetics? This might be something about how genes are made, what they do, or how scientists can manipulate them,

What’s something in your own genetics that influences how you see yourself? Some examples might be your gender, your skin color, or an exceptional trait like being very tall.

If scientists could safely change something about your genetics, would you want them to? Why or why not? What would you change about yourself, if anything?
