## Exercise: Reflect on The Bitcoin Standard

In this exercise, you’ll reflect on the viability of Ammous’s vision for a global monetary standard based on bitcoin and how this standard could affect you.

* * *

Do you currently own any bitcoins? Why or why not?

Do you think Ammous’s vision for the majority of currencies throughout the world to be pegged to bitcoin the way they were once pegged to gold could ever become a reality? Why or why not?

What do you think are currently the biggest obstacles to the world adopting a bitcoin standard? What can you personally do to contribute to overcoming these obstacles?
