## Exercise: Get Started With Your Sprint

You now have all the tools you need to run sprints. Consider how you can use sprints to expedite your current projects.

* * *

Think about the projects you’re working on right now. Describe the most important or pressing one here. (An example of a project could be working on a new software update for a planner app, or designing an educational toy for young children.)

What is the long-term goal of this project? List your goal here. (For example, the long-term goal for the planning app project could be to become the number one productivity app in the App Store. The long-term goal of the toy design project could be to make learning fun for kids.)

How could you use a sprint to help move this project toward your goal? What shorter-term step could your sprint work toward, and how would that align with your goal? (For example, maybe the app’s long-awaited new update is supposed to roll out in a month, and a sprint will help the engineers fast-track their progress. Alternatively, maybe the toy designers know their fun new educational design will cost a lot of money to make, and they want to use a sprint to get quick feedback from customers to see if it’s popular enough to pursue.)

Before you start, you have to put together a team for your sprint. Who would you choose for your sprint team and why? What role would _you_ play in your sprint? Remember: Every sprint team needs a leader and a coordinator, as well as members with expertise relevant to your project. (For example, the app’s team would need programmers to code the update’s new features and a marketing professional to advise on the update’s advertising plan. The toy’s team would need designers who’ve worked in the toy industry before and a finance professional to advise on the costs associated with the product.)
