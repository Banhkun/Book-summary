## Exercise: Debunk the Passion Hypothesis

Following your passion isn’t going to make you happy—the three factors that most contribute to workplace satisfaction are independence, capability, and connection.

* * *

Think back on all the jobs you’ve had in your life. Describe two or three jobs that you’ve enjoyed.

Of the jobs you’ve enjoyed, what characteristics did they have in common? Did they offer independence, capability, or connection?

Of the jobs you’ve enjoyed, did any of them match a pre-existing passion? Why or why not?

List two or three jobs that you _didn’t_ enjoy. What characteristics did they have in common? Did they discourage independence, capability, or connection?

Of the jobs you didn’t enjoy, did any of them match a pre-existing passion? Why or why not?
