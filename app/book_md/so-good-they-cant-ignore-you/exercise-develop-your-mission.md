## Exercise: Develop Your Mission

The mission-development strategy uses a pyramid exercise to explore possible missions.

* * *

The bottom level of your pyramid is researching your field to identify possible areas of innovation. How could you research? (For example, what lectures could you attend or experts could you talk to?)

The middle level of your pyramid is to create little bets—small experiments that provide feedback about possible directions for future projects. What little bets could you undertake? (Remember that little bets should take less than 30 days and encourage you to learn or create something new.)

The top level of your pyramid is a tentative mission statement. What’s yours?
