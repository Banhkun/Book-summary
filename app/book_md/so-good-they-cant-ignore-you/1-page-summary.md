## 1-Page Summary

In 2010, as author Cal Newport wrapped up his postdoctoral associate at MIT and started looking for a professorship, he began to wonder: What makes people love their work? As he waited to hear back about his job applications, he studied performance science, interviewed people about their professional successes and failures, and tested out his hypotheses on his own career and life.

Interestingly, he discovered that the best way to find or create work you love is _not_ to follow your passion, as so many career counselors, books, and well-meaning mentors advise. In fact, **the best way to love what you do is to become highly skilled—so good no one can ignore you. Then, you can offer your skills in exchange for work that allows you autonomy and the opportunity to change the world** , two of the most significant contributors to workplace satisfaction.

_So Good They Can’t Ignore You_ describes four rules to loving your work:

  1. Don’t concern yourself with passion.
  2. Instead, improve your skills.
  3. Cash in your skills for autonomy.
  4. Cash in your skills for the opportunity to change the world.



### Rule #1: Don’t Concern Yourself With Passion

In this rule, we’ll debunk the “passion hypothesis”—the idea that a job that lets you exercise a pre-existing passion is guaranteed to make you happy. While the passion hypothesis is popular, the author believes it’s flawed for several reasons:

**Reason #1: Scientists have uncovered three major discoveries that debunk the passion hypothesis** :

  * **Discovery #1: Passion isn’t an ingredient for motivation.** Self-determination theory states that the real ingredients are independence (having control over your responsibilities makes you want to do them well), capability (feeling competent results in a feeling of satisfaction), and connection (liking your coworkers makes you happier).
  * **Discovery #2: Most people don’t have occupational passions.** When Robert J. Vallerand, a psychologist, surveyed Canadian university students about their passions, he discovered that 84% of students had a passion, but less than 4% of the passions were related to work.
  * **Discovery #3: Occupational passions can be developed.** Amy Wrzesniewski, an organizational behavior professor, studied college administrative assistants and discovered that the assistants who saw their job as a calling (rather than simply a way of making money) had been working the job the longest. This suggests that people learn to love their work as they acquire the ingredients of motivation.



**Reason #2: Since the rise of the passion hypothesis, workplace satisfaction has actually decreased.**

  * Example #1: According to Conference Board surveys, in 1987, 61% of Americans said they were happy with their jobs. By 2010, only 45% of Americans were.
  * Example #2: Anecdotal evidence shows that even people who have jobs that match their passions aren’t happy. For example, 27-year-old Scott, who works in politics, admits that his job matches his passion, but he’s still not happy because it includes some tasks he doesn’t like.



**Reason #3: The people who have jobs they love didn’t get them by following their passions.**

  * For example, Andrew Steele, an astrobiologist who loves his job, didn’t know where he was going to end up when he started his Ph.D. program. He signed up because it gave him options, not because he was passionate about the subject.



### Rule #2: Instead, Improve Your Skills

As we established in Rule #1, following your passion is unlikely to lead you to love your work. Rule #2 explains what _will_ lead you to love your work—improving your scarce and prized skills (career capital) to the point where you’re so good people can’t ignore you.

#### Career Capital Theory

The author’s interpretation of career capital theory includes three statements:

**Statement #1: The traits that make a job desirable are scarce and prized.** After looking at case studies of three people who enjoy their work, the author discovered three notable traits:

  * **Trait #1: The job provides the opportunity for autonomy.** For example, Al Merrick, a surfboard shaper, doesn’t have to adhere to a dress code or work prescribed hours. His surfboard factory is a block from the beach and he can take off and go surfing whenever he wants.
  * **Trait #2: The job provides the opportunity to change the world.** For example, Steve Jobs’s advances in the field of technology have changed the lives of everyone who uses computers.
  * **Trait #3: The job provides the opportunity to use imagination.** For example, Ira Glass, host of _This American Life_ , narrates a one-of-a-kind podcast that lets him use his creativity.



**Statement #2: Careers are subject to the rules of supply and demand.** The rules state that if you want something scarce and prized, you need to pay for it with something equally scarce and prized. You’ll “buy” the three desirable job traits using your career capital.

**Statement #3: You must adopt the craftsperson mindset to build career capital.** There are two different mindsets when it comes to work:

  * **The passion mindset** is concerned with what the universe can do for you. It leads to pessimism and an identity crisis because if you concentrate on what you’re _supposed_ to be getting, it makes you aware of what you’re _not_ getting. 
    * For example, Jane, a college dropout, expected the universe to give her adventures, and when it didn’t, she was unhappy.
  * **The craftsperson mindset** is the opposite of the passion mindset—instead of concerning yourself with what the universe can do for you, you focus on what you can do for the universe. You don’t have to think about whether your job is perfect or represents your identity—you simply focus on developing your skills, thus increasing your career capital.
    * For example, Steve Martin practiced comedy and the banjo for years to develop his skills.



#### How to Acquire Career Capital: Practice Deliberately

To develop your career capital, you need to adopt the craftsperson mindset and practice your skills to develop them. The best way to practice is “deliberately,” a method studied by psychologist Anders Ericsson. Most people in the workforce don’t practice deliberately, and as a result, their skill level plateaus. Therefore, if you _do_ practice deliberately, you’ll have an advantage.

There are five steps to deliberate practice:

**Step #1: Determine which skills will give you career capital.** In some industries, there’s only one kind of career capital—for example, in TV writing, the only meaningful skill is scriptwriting. In other industries, multiple skills make up career capital—for example, venture capitalism makes use of a variety of skills, including entrepreneurship and market knowledge.

**Step #2: Determine which skill or skills you want to develop.** It’s fastest and easiest to develop skills in areas you already have a head start in.

  * For example, cleantech venture capitalist Mike studied at Stanford, which gave him the opportunity to work on projects with Stanford professors.



**Step #3: Determine your goals.** Once you’ve decided what skill you’re going to develop, you need to decide how good you have to get at it.

  * For example, TV writer Alex decided that “good” meant writing a script that an agent was willing to take on.



**Step #4: Seek out both appropriate challenge and immediate feedback.** You need to push yourself beyond your comfort zone and be told what you’re doing right and wrong in order to improve.

  * For example, the author forced himself to understand a difficult paper by studying it for one hour at a time. He also quizzed himself on the important definitions in the paper and checked his answers for feedback.



**Step #5: Stay focused and exercise diligence.** Diligence refers to focusing on developing the skill you’ve chosen and not being distracted by other pursuits. It takes a long time to develop a skill, so you need to stick with it.

  * For example, musician Jordan Tice practices the guitar for hours a day.



(Shortform note: To learn more about deliberate practice, read our summary of Anders Ericsson’s book Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise.)

#### When to Stick It Out and When to Quit

There are certain jobs and situations that inhibit your ability to amass career capital. If your current job has any of the following factors, you should quit and look elsewhere:

  * **The job doesn’t give you enough opportunity to develop scarce and prized skills.**
  * **The job is useless or immoral, or involves working with disagreeable people.** While you could theoretically build up career capital at a job like this, you probably wouldn’t want to work there for as long as it would take to do so.



### Rule #3: Cash in Your Skills for Autonomy

Now that you’ve developed your scarce and prized skills, you can start cashing them in for the scarce and prized traits that make a job desirable. In Rule #3, we’ll look at the desirable trait of autonomy.

**Autonomy is the ability to control what you work on and how you work** , including, among other things, your schedule, responsibilities, and office space. Autonomy is such an important determiner of happiness that the author calls it the “dream-job elixir.” Most common dream jobs include autonomy, and people who have autonomy in their workplace tend to be happier and more productive.

#### Two Pitfalls

When trying to cash in your career capital for autonomy—for example, by asking your manager if you can change your hours—there are two possible pitfalls:

**Pitfall #1: You don’t have enough career capital.** If you attempt to seize autonomy before you’ve earned it, it won’t last because you won’t make money—if you prematurely demand autonomy from your boss, you’ll either be denied the request or fired. If you choose to start your own business, you won’t be able to find clients because you have no experience. Either way, you’ll shortly have to take on a non-autonomous job in order to support yourself.

  * For example, a young professional quit his day job to write a blog about how blogging funded his lifestyle. However, his blog wasn’t actually making him any money, so his content was weak and his only piece of career capital was enthusiasm. Enthusiasm isn’t scarce and prized and wasn’t enough to buy him autonomy. 



**Pitfall #2: Resistance.** Once you have career capital, you become so valuable to your employer that they don’t want to give you any autonomy (such as a reduced schedule) for fear of losing you and your skills. Therefore, as you gain career capital, anticipate that your employer will resist your bids for autonomy. They’ll offer you more money or status to try to keep you, but if you want autonomy, you’ll have to turn them down. Additionally, you may encounter resistance from your friends and family, because they think it’s a bad idea to turn down raises or promotions.

  * For example, when software developer Lulu Young asked her employers if she could work part-time, they didn’t want her to reduce her hours because she was good at her job and they wanted to get as much work out of her as possible. (Ultimately, though, they did let her work part-time because they didn’t want to lose her entirely.)



#### How to Decide When to Bid for Autonomy: The Law of Payment

When presented with a professional decision or opportunity to gain more autonomy, you need to assess whether you risk falling into either of the pitfalls. To decide what to do, you can take a simple test called the law of payment. The law states that **you should only choose to do something that will give you more autonomy if you have evidence that people will pay you to do it.** “Pay” could refer to the classic case of a customer giving you money, or to getting a job, loan, or outside investment. If someone is willing to pay you to do something, this shows that your skills are valuable.

For example, entrepreneur Derek Sivers, who came up with the idea behind the law of payment, only took on projects after he had evidence that someone would pay him to complete them. He became a full-time musician only after music was making him more money than his day job. He started a company that sold CDs only after he knew enough people to be confident he’d have lots of clients.

### Rule #4: Cash in Your Skills for Mission

In Rule #3, we looked at how to cash in your scarce and prized skills for autonomy. Now, we’ll look at how to cash them in for **a** **mission, which is a useful, potentially world-changing goal that focuses your career.**

#### Finding Your Mission: The “Adjacent Possible”

**A mission needs to be innovative and never-seen-before in order to change the world. As a result, missions come from a space called the “adjacent possible”:** a place just beyond the cutting edge of human knowledge that can be reached by building incrementally upon the current understanding.

You need to have enough career capital to see into the adjacent possible before you can discover your mission. For example, Pardis Sabeti was only able to find her mission of using genetics to cure old diseases after she became an expert on genetics.

#### Developing Your Mission

Coming up with an idea for a mission is only the first step to cashing in your career capital—next, you need to figure out which projects to pursue to transform that idea into a reality.

There’s a three-step process to developing a mission. Each step of the process forms one level of a pyramid:

**Bottom level: research.** The bottom level is research in your field, which will help you develop career capital and approach the adjacent possible. For example, to create a strong base for his pyramid, the author read papers, talked to experts, went to lectures, and then summarized his findings. He also went for walks to give himself time to brainstorm.

**Middle level: little bets.** A little bet is a small experiment that will give you feedback about pursuing a particular direction. Each little bet should have the following characteristics:

  * It can be finished in fewer than 30 days.
  * It forces you to learn a skill or create something new.
  * Its result offers feedback.



For example, archaeologist Kirk French’s mission was to popularize archaeology, and his first little bet was to digitize an old archaeological film. A series of film-related little bets led him to become a host of the Discovery Channel’s _American Treasures_.

**Top level: tentative mission.** The top level is a statement that describes an approximate mission. The statement can be frequently edited as you acquire career capital in the bottom level and get feedback from your little bets in the middle level. For example, the author’s tentative mission at the time of writing was to use distributed algorithm theory in new settings to create results.

#### Adopting a Marketing Mindset

Once you’ve found your mission and started to develop it by pursuing projects, adopt a marketing mindset in order to share it with the world—the more people who interact with your mission, the greater your world-changing ability. The marketing mindset states that mission-driven projects need two criteria:

**Criteria #1: They need to be remarkable** —they need to be so novel and interesting people want to talk about them.

  * For example, after deciding on a mission to combine technology with art, Giles Bowkett built Archaeopteryx, an AI program that composes its own dance music. Few programmers knew how to compose music, and few musicians knew programming, so the project was remarkable—Giles was probably the only person in the world who could have built it.



**Criteria #2: They need to be displayed on a visible and respected platform** so that lots of people hear about them, which increases your reach.

  * For example, to spread the word about Archaeopteryx, Giles went to speak at conferences and publicly released the program’s code to the open-source community, which is a group of people who share and work on each other’s projects for free. Many programmers and employers keep an eye on open-source platforms because they’re a good place to discover new talent, so plenty of people found out about Archaeopteryx.
