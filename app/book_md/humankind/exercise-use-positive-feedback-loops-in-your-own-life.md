## Exercise: Use Positive Feedback Loops in Your Own Life

Bregman claims that having a more optimistic outlook on human nature can create positive change in our society. In this exercise, we’ll explore how you can use the power of expectations to improve your own relationships.

* * *

Think of a person who you don’t always get along with—it might be a coworker, friend, or family member. How would you describe your relationship to that person? What specifically do they do that annoys you?

Now, think about how you perceive that person. What kinds of generalizations do you make about them? How does your perception influence what you expect from them? (For example, if you think of a coworker as naturally lazy, you might expect them to always miss deadlines.)

According to Bregman, when we expect negative results, we get negative results. How might your own negative expectations of that person contribute to their behavior? (For example, perhaps your negative expectations of your coworker lead you to constantly check in on their progress. This could make them feel anxious or frustrated and therefore less motivated to meet the deadline.)

On the other hand, Bregman suggests, when we expect positive results from people, we get positive results. How could you change your expectations of that person to be more positive? (For example, you might have more conversations with them to see their point of view or use loving-kindness meditations.)
