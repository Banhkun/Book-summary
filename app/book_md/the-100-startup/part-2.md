## Part 2: Launching Your Business

Once you've decided on your product, it's time to start planning your business launch. Be warned: It’s easy to fall into the trap of “perpetual planning.” If this happens, you may spend years trying to make the perfect plan and never actually turn it into action. Instead of overcomplicating things, take action quickly and adjust your plan as you go.

Before you launch your business, you need to ensure your product is marketable because, if it isn’t, you’ll struggle to convince people they should buy it. To check if your product is marketable, ask yourself the following questions:

  1. **Is the market big enough?** Research keywords and phrases on Google and other search engines to see if a large enough number of people are interested in buying the product.
  2. **Does your product solve an apparent problem?** It’s easier to sell the solution to an apparent problem than to sell the solution to an unknown issue. 
  3. **Does your product make life easier or better?** While selling a product that focuses on desire or luxury is possible, more people will be interested in a product that removes hardship or improves standard-of-living.
  4. **Does your product offer a better solution than other products?** Look at the issues customers have with the current market. Knowing what makes your product better than or different from the competition makes marketing much easier.



Once you're certain your product is marketable, start planning the details of your launch. A**s preparation for the launch, develop an offer and create a one-page business plan.**

### Develop an Offer

**Once you have your product in mind, develop an offer based on the value of your product.** An offer consists of four parts:

  1. An explanation of your product and its cost
  2. An explanation of the benefits your product provides
  3. Pre-emptive solutions to frequent objections
  4. A reason for people to buy your product right now



**When developing your offer, use the following format as a guide:**

  1. Overview
     1. What is your product or service?
     2. What is the cost of your product?
     3. What audience would purchase your product right now?
  2. Benefits
     1. What is the primary benefit of your product?
     2. What are the secondary benefits of your product?
        1. What’s the most impactful one?
  3. Objections
     1. List the three main objections customers have to your offer.
     2. List three counter-arguments to address these objections.
  4. Urgency
     1. Why should customers want to buy this right now?
     2. What could you add to make this offer more urgent and enticing?



**A _successful_ offer consists of three elements:**

  1. **Alignment with your audience.** You won’t get very far if your product doesn’t appeal to your target audience. For example, if you run an online Excel course, you’ll likely have more success targeting young accounting professionals than young artistic professionals.
  2. **An enticing promise.** The value of your product should be on display. For example, if you’re selling a coupon book, marketing the amount that people can save will draw people towards your product.
  3. **The right timing.** If you release a brilliant product at the wrong time, it will likely fail. For example, if you create expensive, luxurious clothing, launching in the middle of a recession will significantly limit your client base.



#### Five Strategies to Develop an Offer

**When creating your offer, keep these five strategies in mind:**

##### Strategy One: Avoid hard-selling your product or service.

**Most people like to purchase products, but they don’t like being _sold_ on a product: **It turns them away because they feel uncomfortable and pressured. While offers require _gentle_ persuasion, if you have the proper audience and the right timing, you shouldn’t have to spend a lot of time convincing your customers that they need your product.

For example, if you went door-to-door trying to sell vacuum cleaners to people who don't necessarily need them, you’d likely have to aggressively sell your products to convince people to make a purchase. However, if you set up a website and let customers come to you, you ensure that you have the proper audience (customers that are interested in your __ vacuum) and the right timing (the customer needs a new vacuum).

##### Strategy Two: Create a sense of urgency.

**Nudge your customer to purchase your product by offering time-sensitive or limited-quantity offers.** These could be 2-for-1 deals, discounts, or packages. For example, if you ran a yoga studio, you could offer a limited-time offer that would give clients two months of classes for the price of one. By setting an end date for the deal, you’re urging customers to purchase before it’s “too late.”

##### Strategy Three: Create a frequently asked questions (FAQ) page on your website.

**Building an FAQ page allows you to address objections early on and** **people’s minds at ease, while simultaneously displaying the value of your product.** Some common concerns include:

  * Does this product actually work?
  * Is this worth the money?
  * How do I know I can trust you?
  * What are other people concerned about?
  * Can I find this product or service without paying?



Note: While you _do_ want to offer solutions to people’s concerns, you _don’t_ want to get defensive. Focus on what makes your product valuable and avoid attacking the objection.

For example, if a commonly-asked question is “Why is this service so expensive?”, your answer shouldn’t be, “If you’re not willing to pay, then don’t buy this service.” Instead, a more productive answer would be, “Unlike other services, this service is personalized to you! While that does lead to a higher cost, this program is designed to give you the best experience possible. ”

##### Strategy Four: Offer a satisfaction guarantee.

Customers often worry about investing their money into a product or service that they haven’t used before. **Offering a satisfaction guarantee alleviates your customers’ fears and creates a mutual bond of trust between you and your clients.** For example, if you’re selling a teeth whitening product, you could promise your customers that they’ll see whiter teeth within thirty days or you’ll give their money back.

Note: Either offer a strong guarantee such as giving a full refund, or offer no guarantee at all. Middling or unclear guarantees can actually hurt your credibility. For example, a guarantee such as, “Satisfaction guaranteed. If not, we’ll figure something out,” makes you seem unsure about your own product as you’re unwilling to take on the risk of offering full refunds.

##### Strategy Five: Overdeliver your product.

After making a purchase, many consumers feel a moment of anxiety where they question their purchase. **To alleviate this fear, go above-and-beyond to make your customers feel like they made the right choice.** A few ways you can over-deliver your product include:

  * Writing a handmade thank you note
  * Adding in additional materials free of charge 
  * Giving discount codes for future purchases 



### Create a One-Page Business Plan

As well as creating your offer, you should also draft a business plan. Some entrepreneurs believe in building a long business plan that outlines every facet of their organization. However, these can get confusing and complicated, leading many investors to skim through the material without really grasping it. Instead of making more work for yourself for little benefit, **make a one-page business plan that investors will actually read, using the following format as a guide:**

  1. Overview
     1. What do you plan on selling?
     2. Who do you think will buy it? 
     3. What problem does your business solve?
  2. Finance
     1. What do you plan on charging?
     2. How do you plan to process payment?
     3. Are there other ways that this product will bring in income other than direct sales?
  3. Marketing
     1. How will people find your business?
     2. How can you incentivize referrals?
  4. Measure of Success
     1. This business will be successful when it has **_ number of clients or makes $**.
  5. Obstacles
     1. List 3-5 concerns or questions about your business and offer solutions to those concerns. For example, if you’re building an online kitchenware store, your concern may be, “How do we ensure fulfillment of purchases?” Your solution may be, “We plan on subcontracting a local warehouse to store our excess inventory and oversee the delivery process.”
  6. Deadline
     1. We want to launch our business on **____**.



#### Mission Statement

**In addition to your business plan, you should form a mission statement, or an explanation of the central values upon which your company is built.** This statement should be no more than 140 characters and should explain in simple terms how your business can help people.

For example, if you run a day-care center, your mission statement may be, “I help working parents feel comfortable with using a day-care center by giving their children personalized, quality care during the workday.”

### Launch Your Business

While every launch has different goals and obstacles, all of them require pre-launch preparation and active participation during the launch cycle.

#### Pre-Launch Preparation

A successful launch relies on thorough preparation. To prepare for launch day, **create a launch plan, build anticipation, and set yourself up for success.**

##### Create a Launch Plan

There are a lot of moving pieces involved in a launch, and the more planning you do, the more smoothly your launch will run. Your launch plan should outline:

  1. The time and date of your launch
  2. The length of your launch cycle
  3. Any promotions you’ll be running
  4. The roadmap for your marketing efforts



On top of preparing your product and marketing for launch,**make sure you’re ready to receive the proceeds from your customer purchases efficiently by doing the following:**

  * Inform your bank of potential incoming funds to prevent them freezing your account. Create a backup plan in case the bank freezes your account anyway.
  * Diversify your payment options using services such as Paypal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Venmo.
  * If you’re selling a high-priced item, create a payment plan if you can. This allows more customers to purchase your product, even if they don’t have enough money to buy it outright. Alternatively, you can incentivize full payment by offering a discount.



##### Build Anticipation

**Build anticipation by slowly feeding information to your target audience.** This will create hype and get consumers excited about purchasing your product. For example, film studios release lots of pre-release information about movies, including teasers, trailers, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage.

**As you start to promote your launch, use the following tips:**

  * Reveal the time and date of your launch well in advance. This allows you to set clear preparation deadlines for yourself while also building anticipation in your audience.
  * Provide an early preview of what’s to come. Build intrigue by revealing that you’re working on something big, but don’t give away a lot of details.
  * Once you’ve teased your project, constantly explain why it’s important, and how it’s going to benefit your audience. 
  * Reveal your launch plan. Tell customers when and how they can buy your product as well as any pre-order or early purchase bonuses you’re offering. 
  * Give last-minute reminders just before launch. Just before you launch, remind customers that your launch is just around the corner, and that they’ll soon be able to buy.



**To help build anticipation, answer the following questions:**

  * What makes your product stand out against competitors?
  * What bonuses, discounts, or incentives are you offering at launch?
  * How can you make your launch fun or entertaining?
  * Can you make a video or audio message to accompany your product?
  * What time-sensitive incentives can you use to create a sense of urgency?
  * Can you create custom products that are only available at launch?



##### Set Yourself Up for Success

In the days leading up to your launch, **take the following steps to help you run your launch day effectively:**

  * Read and proofread all launch materials more than once. You’ll likely find errors or phrases that sound awkward.
  * Test every step of the order process more than once. This includes checking your web links, running test orders, and checking your payment processing systems on different devices and browsers.
  * Register any closely related domains to your official website, including different suffixes such as “.com,” “.net,” or “.org.” Domains are inexpensive, and you’ll want to get as much traffic as possible.
  * Check that all uploaded files are correct and complete. You don’t want to accidentally prevent a customer from getting your product because of an upload error.
  * Keep your inbox clean to ensure you’re seeing any messages relating to your launch.
  * Craft a strong launch message for your audience.
  * Ask for help from friends, family, and business contacts to spread the word about your product.
  * Write to media contacts about your launch.
  * Post to social media about your launch, especially platforms you have a following on.
    * Have your launch day media prepared in advance.
  * Create an automated thank you message to send to every buyer.
  * Create a follow-up schedule. 



As you approach launch day, a variety of issues may arise that could tempt you to delay your launch. **Barring absolute disaster, you should stick to the deadlines you set.** Constantly delaying looks bad to customers and may keep you from ever actually launching your product.

#### The Launch Cycle

**A launch cycle is the period of time from launch day to the end of your “launch promotions.”** For example, if you launch on a Monday with a “limited-time launch offer” that ends on Friday, your launch cycle would be five days long.

##### Participate in Your Launch

Take an active role in your launch by communicating with customers, sharing information, and solving problems as they arise. **Use the following practices to help you keep the process as smooth as possible:**

  * Set multiple alarm clocks for launch day to make sure you’re awake and ready.
  * Soft launch about ten minutes early to ensure everything is operating correctly.
  * Ask the first 3-5 buyers if everything worked smoothly.



**Your efforts to build hype shouldn’t end once you’ve launched.** Keep sharing information with potential customers to get them interested in your product. To do so, consider the following tips:

  * Make a “launch day” post. Show how excited you are to be launching your product and encourage your customers to make a purchase. 
  * Address any issues with your launch. Something is bound to go wrong. Be transparent and explain how you’re handling the situation.
  * Show satisfied customers. Use testimonials and positive reviews as marketing tools to validate the worth of your product.
  * Remind customers of time-sensitive products, bonuses, or discounts. If you have a launch special, share when your offer expires, and what people will miss out on if they don’t buy immediately.



**Keep the costs of your launch cycle low by considering the following:**

  * Maintain low costs by doing the bulk of the launch work yourself. Invest your own time and energy into maintaining your product, rather than hiring expensive outside help. While it may be tempting to borrow money to get an office or hire employees, putting in the effort yourself upfront will prevent you from having to deal with debt later.
  * Market before you make. If you purchase a lot of inventory up front or spend hours making a product no one wants, you risk losing time and money. Market your product and see what the response is before investing significant effort into producing it. 
  * Adjust to initial results. Once you’ve made a few sales, take a moment to review how the product is doing and how the market is responding. Use this information to adjust your approach moving forward.



##### Four Strategies for a Successful Launch

**The following four strategies will help to ensure that your product launch is as successful as possible:**

**Strategy One: Keep your word.** If you offer a time-sensitive discount or bonus, you _must_ adhere to the guidelines you set. If your launch went well, you will likely receive a series of emails or phone calls asking for an exception. While it may be tempting to make more money, sticking to your word tells people that you’re serious about deadlines, something they’ll remember next time you launch a product.

**Strategy Two: Be honest about flaws.** Though it sounds counterintuitive, being upfront about any limitations of your product and why those limitations exist will help **build trust with your customers.** If you try to hide issues or restrictions, customers may view you as untrustworthy or manipulative.

**Strategy Three: Create effective marketing materials.** Your launch marketing must do three things:

  1. **Tell a good story.** Your audience should enjoy following the journey of your product through ideation to development to launch. If your story is boring, people will likely lose interest.
  2. **Relate to your audience.** Your audience has to understand how the product will impact them directly. If your audience doesn’t understand how the product will benefit them, they likely won’t purchase it.
  3. **Create a timely offer.** Your audience should understand why they need the product _right now_. If your audience doesn’t feel the need to purchase immediately, they may hold off or not invest their money.



**Strategy Four: Pay attention to feedback.** When you launch a product, listen to your audience. If most people are providing positive feedback, you know your launch has been a success. However, if most people don’t agree with the valuation of your product or are dissatisfied with it, make adjustments accordingly.

##### The Days Following a Launch Cycle

While the next part of the summary will cover long-term growth and development, **there are a few things you need to do directly following your launch cycle:**

  * If you have a team, thank them. Without them, your launch cycle may have been made significantly harder.
  * Be sure to thank your customers with a follow-up message.**** Explain the direction your company is headed, letting satisfied customers know what to expect from you next. 
  * Take a moment to celebrate before turning your attention to building on the results of your launch cycle. Launching a business or product is a lot of work, and you deserve to take a moment for yourself.
