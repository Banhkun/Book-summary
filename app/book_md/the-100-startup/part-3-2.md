## Part 3.2: Growing Your Business

Growing your business usually isn’t as hard as starting your business. If you can keep your customers happy over a long period of time, positive word of mouth will spread naturally. **However, there are three things that you can do to keep your business moving forward effectively:**

  1. Make adjustments to increase income.
  2. Franchise yourself.
  3. Determine how much you want to expand.



### Make Adjustments to Increase Income

**Once your business is up and running, find ways to increase your income and expand your company.** The first thing you need to do is determine your model of growth. From there, the key to finding which adjustments benefit your business the most is experimentation.

#### Determine Your Growth Model

**There are two ways that your company can grow:**

  1. **Horizontally:** Widening your audience by providing different products and services for different kinds of customers.
  2. **Vertically:** Deepening your relationship with your current audience by providing more in-depth products or services.



Both models are valid, and it is possible to see limited growth in both directions at the same time. As you start to make adjustments to your business, **keep in mind which model of growth you're focusing on, and how you can use your adjustments to support your chosen model.**

#### Seven Strategies to Increase Income

**As you make adjustments to your company, use the following strategies to increase your revenue:**

##### Strategy One: Generate traffic.

**The success of your company relies on regular traffic to either your storefront or your website.** The more eyes you can get on your product or service, the more likely you are to make a sale.

(Shortform note: For more information on generating traffic to your website, check out this article from Forbes.)

##### Strategy Two: Generate conversions.

**Once you have a decent amount of traffic, focus on increasing your conversion rate, or the rate at which people make a purchase.** For example, if you have 100 customers visit your website, and four make a purchase, your conversion rate is 4%.

One way to create more conversions is to do A/B testing. A/B testing places two live offers, headlines, or webpages against one another and determines which is leading to more conversions. This allows you to constantly adapt your promotions and marketing based upon which efforts are working the best. There are many services you can use to help with this process, including Google Optimizer.

Beyond A/B testing, you should look to the sources of your traffic, including Google searches, social media, and referrals, and determine which are creating the most conversions. This will give you a better sense of where you should focus your marketing attention.

##### Strategy Three: Raise the average price per sale.

**There are three ways you can increase the average price per sale of your product or service:**

  1. **Upsell:** Offer an upgraded version or an additional item with the purchase. For example, if you edited written works, you could offer an upgrade that includes proofreading for “just $50 extra.”
  2. **Cross-sell:** Offer a product related to the customer’s purchase. For example, if your customer just bought a tent, you could show that other customers who bought the tent also bought a camping lantern.
  3. **Make a sale after the sale:** Offer a special product or discount immediately after a sale. For example, if your customer just signed up for a private consultation, you could make a special “clients-only” offer for your book.



##### Strategy Four: Give your existing customers more to buy.

While bringing in new clients is important, your existing customers have already shown that they’re willing to spend money on your product or service. **Capitalize on this by creating advanced or supplementary products or services that your current clientele can purchase.**

##### Strategy Five: Create a product from your service (and vice versa).

**If you currently offer a _service_ , develop a _product_ that relates to that service. **For example, if you run a restaurant, you could sell a cookbook that includes some of your most iconic dishes.

**Alternatively, if you currently offer a _product_ , develop a _service_ based on that product.** For example, if you wrote a self-improvement book, you could offer life coaching sessions based around the lessons discussed in the book.

##### Strategy Six: Build a “Hall of Fame.”

**Highlight your best or most successful customers and share their testimonials about your business.** For example, if you’re a physical trainer, and one of your clients lost 100 lbs while training with you, ask them to provide a testimonial with before and after information.

If possible, provide a variety of stories from people with different backgrounds. This helps build your credibility by proving that your product or service works for a wide variety of people. For example, if you’re a physical trainer, sharing testimonials from both a world-class athlete and a person who hasn’t worked out a day in their life shows that your service can work for a wider audience.

##### Strategy Seven: Ask for referrals.

**Ask your customers to write a review, share your page on social media, and tell their friends about your product.** If you can, offer a referral incentive such as a discount or special item for both the customer and the people they bring to your business.

### Franchise Yourself

Franchising yourself is the process of splitting your time between multiple business ventures to gain one or more new streams of income. Your new ventures may be related to your original business idea. For instance, Brooke, the owner of a holistic health practice, franchised herself by founding a secondary business training other health practitioners.

Running multiple businesses or projects can be a lot of work for just one person. For this reason, you may choose to get outside help with either your original business or your new ventures. This allows you to build relationships with other business owners, explore new ideas, and target new audiences without having to take on all of the risk and effort yourself. **There are two primary ways to enlist the help of others when franchising yourself: partnerships and outsourcing.**

#### Partnerships

**Partnerships are collaborations between you and another business owner, usually in the form of joint ventures, or single projects that both teams contribute to.** For example, if you ran a makeup company, you could partner with a beauty blogger to create a new line of lipsticks.

Sometimes, partnerships create a completely new business that is collectively owned by the partners. For example, if you were a fitness instructor, you could partner with another fitness instructor to create a new private training gym.

Regardless of the project or business, **there are a few things you and your partner(s) must agree upon:**

  * How are costs being divided?
  * How is income being divided?
  * What are the roles of each partner?
  * What information or products are being provided by each partner?
  * Will the project be jointly marketed? 
  * How long does the partnership exist?
  * How frequently will the partners discuss the project or business?



#### Outsourcing

**Outsourcing is the process of hiring outside contractors to help with the management of your business and the development and fulfillment of your product or service, thus freeing up your time to work on other ventures or other areas of your original business**. There are many pros and cons to outsourcing, and its usefulness varies from business to business.

##### The Pros

**Companies that promote the outsourcing process say the following:**

  * It helps you meet demand, especially if orders are coming in faster than you can fulfill them.
  * It takes the pressure of shipping and order fulfillment off of your shoulders.
  * It allows you to utilize resources or technology you may not have access to but that contractors do, such as industrial printers or engraving machines.
  * It gives you support without having to onboard or maintain employees.



##### The Cons

**Companies that reject the outsourcing process say the following:**

  * It increases your costs.
  * It makes quality control difficult because you don’t have direct control over outsourced processes.
  * It requires a significant amount of management time.
  * It forces you to compromise because you have to operate under another company’s schedule and procedural process.



##### Affiliate Programs

**Affiliate programs are outsourced marketing agreements in which a business offers a percentage of a sale to an external party in exchange for that party marketing their product.** For example, many podcasters participate in affiliate programs. Companies reach out and give the podcaster a unique discount code that the podcaster then shares with their listeners. Every time a listener purchases a product using that unique code, the podcaster is given a percentage of the sale.

As a business owner, affiliate programs can be instrumental to reaching a wider audience. However, if you offer a small commission, don’t expect affiliates to do much more than the bare minimum of the agreement. If you want to encourage greater participation, offer a better rate and make your expectations clear.

### Determine How Much You Want to Expand

**As your business comes into its own, determine how much you want to expand.** While some business-owners dream of taking over the world, others just want freedom and stability without the added stress of growing too large. To grow your business the way _you_ want to, define the ideal size of your company and invest time into its development.

#### Define the Ideal Size of Your Company

To make effective decisions about the future of your company, you need to know what the ideal version of your business looks like. **If you don’t want to worry about the stress of expansion and aren’t concerned about making more money, you may want to keep your company small.** This allows you to keep your stability and freedom without sacrificing your personal life.

**If you want to make more money but don’t want to sacrifice too much ownership of your product, you may want to consider a mid-sized model.** This allows you to expand your business and reach a wider audience without being beholden to larger corporations or mass markets. For example, if you made designer sunglasses, you could maintain your mid-sized business by hiring employees to meet demand while refusing to outsource the creation or distribution of your product.

**If you want to make a lot of money and aren’t concerned about the ownership of your business, you may want to consider a “built-to-sell” model.** A built-to-sell business is a business created with the express purpose of being sold in the future. In a built-to-sell model, your business must have its own identity and must be scalable because a potential buyer wants to be able to separate you from the brand and grow the organization according to their needs.

The most scalable businesses are built on a concept that is both valuable and teachable. For example, you could create a business that conducts financial research to build personalized reports for businesses. This information is valuable to companies, but can also be taught to a large number of employees.

Note: The “built-to-sell” model is different from the “$100 startup” model. Where the $100 startup model is built on a passion and requires almost no capital, the built-to-sell model isn’t built on personal interest and requires more capital upfront.

#### Invest Time Into Development

As your startup grows, you may find yourself spending more time fixing problems than working on the development of your company which limits your potential for growth. For example, if you’re spending all of your time dealing with a faulty website or responding to emails, you’re not focusing on the long-term trajectory of your company.

**Even if it’s just for an hour every morning, take time to take actions that will improve your business, not just maintain it:**

  * Are there any new products or services you can develop?
  * Are there any joint ventures you can create?
  * Can you develop a launch, event, or offer to boost income and traffic?
  * How can you increase your average price per sale?
  * Is there a unique way to communicate with your customers?
  * What are the causes of your business’s chronic problems and how can you eliminate them?



As you create a development plan, you’ll need to keep your eye on a few key metrics:

  * Sales per day
  * Visitors or web traffic per day
  * Average sale price
  * Conversion rates
  * Referral rates



**Select two metrics to look at every day and leave the rest for biweekly or monthly reviews.** Every company is different, so take the time to find the metrics that mean the most to you and your business.

> **Failure and Unwanted Advice**
> 
> As you grow your business, you will inevitably fail at least once or twice. Don’t let these failures stop you from taking action and growing your company. Instead, learn from your mistakes and use the knowledge you gained to navigate future issues.
> 
> Whether you’re struggling or thriving, people will give you their advice, whether you want it or not. While other people can provide useful information, you ultimately have to trust your own judgment. Your company is yours to run, and you have to make choices that align with your perspective, not the perspective of others.
