## Exercise: What’s Your Game?

Storr writes that we’re constantly engaged in status games and competing for status across many areas of our lives. Many factors determine which games we play, some of which can be harmful—but Storr believes that we can choose to play healthy games that enhance our well-being.

* * *

Think about the status games that you participate in: the social groups where you follow rules and adopt status symbols to compete for others’ respect (like the industry where you work, the social organizations you’ve joined, or the communities in which you’re a member). List them below.

Think about the hierarchy of the status games you play. Which game or games are the most important to you? Which ones do you think are least important to devote time and effort to?

Consider whether these status games are healthy and enable you to relate to other people in positive ways. Do these games contribute to your sense of meaning and well-being? Why or why not?

Would you make any changes to the selection of status games you play or the way you play them? Why or why not?
