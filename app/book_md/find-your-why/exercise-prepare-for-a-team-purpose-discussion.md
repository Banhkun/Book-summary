## Exercise: Prepare for a Team Purpose Discussion

Follow Sinek’s steps to prepare for a team purpose discussion.

* * *

Describe the team you’ll be working with. Is it the entire organization or a smaller team within a larger one? Based on your observations, are team members disconnected from their purpose, or are they just struggling to put it into words? How can you tell?

What problems do you think the team needs to address before the purpose discussion?

List three to five team members who could facilitate the discussion, and note why each would be a good fit. What can you do this week to reach out to them and see if they’d be up for the challenge?

List the people you’d like to invite to the discussion. Consider the area of the team each represents so you can ensure you have vertical and horizontal diversity.
