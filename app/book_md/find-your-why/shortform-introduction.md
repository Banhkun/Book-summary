## Shortform Introduction

In _Find Your Why_ , Simon Sinek, David Mead, and Peter Docker lay out the steps individuals and organizations can take to discover their purpose and strengths and share them with the world. Discovering your unique purpose—your Why—and strengths helps you find fulfillment at work and in life. When you live in alignment with your purpose, you make better career decisions and inspire people to join you, whether as part of your team or supporters of your mission.

### The Book’s Publication and Intellectual Context

_Find Your Why_ was published in 2017 by Penguin UK as a practical guide to applying the theory laid out in _Start With Why. _

_Find Your Why_ builds on the theory Sinek laid out in his first bestseller, _Start With Why_ : The most successful organizations have a clear purpose that keeps every action they take aligned with their core beliefs. _Start With Why _is itself part of the lineage of philosophy and psychology books that deal with purpose, like Viktor Frankl’s _Man’s Search for Meaning_ , and of the newer lineage of books dealing with organizational culture and cultural change, like Malcolm Gladwell’s _The Tipping Point._

Sinek wrote this sequel to _Start With Why _to broaden his impact so that more organizations and individuals, even if they don’t have access to direct coaching from his company, can discover their Why. _Find Your Why_ builds on its predecessor by laying out a step-by-step process for discovering your Why, for both organizations and individuals. Peter Docker and David Mead developed the steps to put Sinek’s theory into practice.__

#### The Book’s Impact

_Find Your Why_ didn’t achieve as much success as _Start With Why_ in terms of sales and positive reviews. This might be because it doesn’t add any new ideas to _Start With Why. _However, the workbook format of _Find Your Why_ is useful for trainers and coaches who are looking for practical advice on how to apply the ideas in the first book.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Online reviewers who enjoyed the book appreciate its practical approach to the theories. Readers of _Start With Why _who wanted to apply its theories in their own lives and organizations benefited from the book’s detailed instructions and examples.

Critics of the book point out that much of it repeats _Start With Why_ , and it doesn’t offer new insights to readers familiar with Sinek’s theory. Others also felt that the process laid out in the book is unrealistic or impractical for individuals seeking their purpose, as it requires having a willing partner and a lot of time.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

After reviewing the _importance_ of finding your purpose as explained in _Start With Why_ , Sinek lays out two step-by-step processes, one for individuals and another for teams and organizations, for _discovering_ that purpose. The process requires either a partner or a facilitator-led group meeting and culminates in a written purpose statement. The book delves into the details of choosing a location, facilitator, and participants, then preparing for the meeting, conducting it, and following up—which may be unnecessary for most business leaders experienced in running meetings.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

The first two chapters go over the theory that underpins Sinek’s concept of “Why.” Chapter 3 details the steps for the discovery process for individuals, and chapters 4 and 5 detail the steps for teams. Chapters 6 and 7 discuss steps to take after the discovery process, and three appendices offer specific instructions for facilitators. There’s repetition of concepts and instructions in the book, and many of the steps for individuals and teams are similar.

### Our Approach in This Guide

In this guide, we’ll first discuss the basics of Sinek’s theory and its benefits for people and teams. Next, we’ll look at the model Sinek developed to understand the place of purpose in your life. Then, we’ll discuss the importance of putting your purpose into words. Finally, we’ll go through the process suggested by the authors to discover your purpose, put it into words, and share it with others. Throughout the guide, we’ll contrast Sinek’s ideas with other organizational culture and self-help authors and offer alternatives to the process outlined by Sinek, Docker, and Mead.
