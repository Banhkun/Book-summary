## Exercise: Determine Your Personal Practices, or How

This exercise will help you determine your individual How, or the methods that will help you accomplish your Why, or purpose.

* * *

Group the themes you set aside after writing your purpose statement until you have no more than five. Write those five themes in active and inspiring language that expresses your unique How, or methods. For example, “build safe communities.”

  * “I seek opportunities for connection.”



Consider your current work. Does it allow you to apply your How, or methods, or are you having to stifle them? How can you create opportunities for yourself to apply more of your unique How, or methods, in the work you’re doing now?
