## Exercise: Take Greater Responsibility

Think about how you take responsibility currently and ways you might do so better in the future.

* * *

Name an important goal of yours. This could be personal—like improving a relationship—or professional—like learning a new skill.

Write down two ways you’ve pursued this goal in the past week.

If you didn’t pursue this goal, write down why.

Evaluate your answer to the question above: Is it full of excuses, or do you take responsibility for your role in the situation? Remember that even a valid reason for not pursuing your goals may signal an avoidance of responsibility. For example, you may not have pursued your goal because you were sick—but you may have fallen ill because you’ve been neglecting your health.

Take responsibility for your goals by listing two things you’ll do to achieve them this week.
