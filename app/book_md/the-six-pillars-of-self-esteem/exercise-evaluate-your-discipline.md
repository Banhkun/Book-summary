## Exercise: Evaluate Your Discipline

If you have children, they’ll inevitably make you mad. Answering these questions will help ensure you discipline them properly while still protecting their self-esteem.

* * *

Describe a situation in which your child misbehaved recently. What did they do?

How did you respond to your child’s behavior? Did you yell at them or calmly discuss the issue? Did you do nothing?

Reflect on how your behavior likely affected your child’s self-esteem. What might they have learned from your behavior? Are you happy with this lesson?

List two behaviors you can do in the future that will provide your child with the appropriate discipline but still support their self-esteem.
