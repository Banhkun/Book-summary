## Exercise: Craft Your Powerful Appearance

Your appearance influences how other people view you and, consequently, how much power you have over them. Brainstorm ways you can craft a more powerful appearance.

* * *

First, you must create a strong reputation. List a unique quality that you can build your reputation around. How might you highlight this quality more in your social interactions?

Another important aspect of a powerful appearance is maintaining your independence. Reflect on a time when you got emotionally involved in a situation and lost control. What can you do to remain more calm and detached in the future?

Consider Greene's suggestions on how to be more mysterious (speaking less or more vaguely, being absent occasionally, and being less predictable). How might you practice one of these strategies?
