## Planet 6: Success

Getting the sixth planet in your psychological universe into alignment means being successful. Success means different things to every person, and it also means different things to your Chimp and your Human. **The first step in attaining success is deciding what success means to you personally.** Only then can you figure out how to achieve it.

Your Chimp and your Human will have different definitions of success. Typically, your Chimp will desire superficial things like money and power, while your Human will want things more meaningful on a higher level, like the fulfillment of your purpose. Take some time to examine your goals and what will make you feel successful, and decide which Chimp goals and which Human goals are worth pursuing.

Your Chimp and your Human will also have different ways to judge when you’ve reached success. Your Chimp might rely on specific markers of success such as an ‘A’ grade on a test or a certain job title. Your Human might rely instead on the effort you put into a project or the learning you took away from it—so, for example, if you don’t get an ‘A’ on that test, your Human might consider you successful anyway if you tried your best and learned a lot along the way.

Your ultimate happiness with your life might depend on which measure of success you value more. If you only feel successful when you achieve specific markers, you’ll often be disappointed because life won’t always go your way. However, if you measure success by the effort you put into life, you’ll be better able to emotionally deal with disappointments.

### Planet 6’s Moons

Planet 6 has three moons that help stabilize it and guide your journey toward success:

  1. The moon of Realms
  2. The moon of Preparation
  3. The moon of Carrots



#### Planet 6 Moon 1: Realms

The first moon, the moon of Realms, recognizes that different people will be in charge of different aspects of your life. When you have disagreements with others, you’ll resolve them quicker if you're able to effectively determine:

  * Who is in charge of each particular situation
  * What the rules are
  * Whether or not you agree to those rules



There are three realms in which you’ll interact with other people:

  * Your realm
  * Another person’s realm
  * A joint realm



The rules will be different for each of these realms. Determining who sets the rules and who must abide by them will in large part determine how you resolve problems.

##### Your Realm

Your realm is any area where you're clearly in charge, such as your own home. In your realm, you set and enforce the rules. You expect someone entering your realm to respect your rules and your right to have the final say in decisions—for example, if someone enters your home, you’d expect them to check with you first before starting to cook a meal with your kitchen and equipment.

If your rules and your right to set those rules are not respected, your Chimp will start acting out, expressing anger, irritation, or other negative emotions. Therefore, you'll have more control over your life—and feel more successful in your endeavors—if you clearly set the rules and enforce them within the realm you command. **When other people clearly understand what you expect, they will less often violate your rules and you'll have less conflict.**

In your realm, you also need rules that govern your _own_ behavior. These are the rules your Human comes up with to keep your Chimp in line. You’ll be far more likely to be happy and successful if you're able to establish and maintain clear rules for your Chimp. So, for example, if you establish a clear rule for yourself that you never eat junk food after 9 p.m., you’ll have an easier time controlling your Chimp’s late-night snack urges.

##### Others’ Realms

When you're in someone else’s realm, you must respect and abide by their rules just as you would expect them to do for your rules in your realm.

Respecting someone else’s rules doesn't mean acting subservient—it just means respecting their right to have the final say. However, you're never obligated to abide by someone else’s rules if they make you uncomfortable. **You always have the right to leave someone else’s realm if their rules don’t sit right with your values.** For example, if you're hanging out with a group of friends who expect you to do something mean to someone else, you might have to accept that those are their rules and you can’t change them, but you're within your rights to find another group of friends.

##### Joint Realm

When you're in a joint realm, you enter into a relationship with another person where each of you agrees to a set of rules. There are two types of joint realms (relationships), and you must be clear about which you’re in because the rules will be different for each:

  * **Personal relationships:** In a personal relationship, you interact with the other person because of a personal connection, such as a friendship or a family bond. Such relationships may not have formal rules or boundaries—you and the other person will decide between yourselves how to behave. 
  * **Professional relationships:** In a professional relationship, you interact with someone because of an official, formalized connection, such as employment or instruction. These relationships have official rules and boundaries, and typically function properly only when personal emotions are excluded from your interactions.



In both types of realms, there will be aspects of your relationship that will be shared but there will also be aspects that won't be shared. To prevent either of your Chimps from becoming aggravated, you must be clear as to which rules you both have a say in and which you each decide separately.

For example, in a personal relationship like a marriage, both people will be involved in buying a house, but each person may then have different responsibilities when moving in—one person might pick out the wall colors while the other might decide on the furniture placement. In a professional relationship, a manager and employee might both agree on the rules of when they can take a lunch break, but the decisions for where to go for that break will be the responsibility of each person individually.

#### The Moon of Preparation

Your moon of Preparation will stabilize your planet of Success because proper preparation will greatly increase your chances of seeing a project through. To properly prepare your Chimp and Human for a project, think through four areas:

  * Commitment
  * Ownership
  * Accountability
  * Goals



##### Commitment

Both your Chimp and your Human must commit to a project if you're going to successfully stick with it. **Commitment is more than motivation:** Motivation is ruled by emotions (by your Chimp), but such emotions can be fleeting. Motivation alone won’t pull you through a project because as soon as you “don’t feel like” doing it, you’ll abandon it.

In contrast, **commitment is following a plan even if you don’t feel like it** , and comes from the Human part of your brain. In order to engage both your Chimp and Human in a solid commitment to your project, think through two aspects:

  1. **What will you need for your project?** This list will include things that are _essential_ (for example, if you intend to start a jogging program, you’ll need running shoes) and things that are _desirable_ (for example, it would be nice to have a running partner, although you could jog without one, so it’s not essential). 
  2. **What challenges might you face?** These include difficulties you can’t change (for example, if you want to get in shape, you’ll have to exercise), things you can change (for example, if you want to go on a vacation but have a tight budget, you can choose to visit an affordable destination), and things that might trip you up (for example, if you want to lose weight, you shouldn’t keep junk food in the house). 



Once you’ve explored these aspects of your project, you’ll be mentally prepared for setbacks and challenges, and you’ll therefore be more likely to stick with your project.

##### Ownership

To enhance your commitment to a project, you need to feel some type of ownership of it. **When you feel ownership, both your Chimp and your Human are enticed to work harder because the success becomes personal—it becomes a reflection of your identity.** For example, imagine you work in a retail store, and the owner of the store suddenly transfers ownership of the store to you. Even if you were a conscientious worker before, you're likely to work much harder once you have an ownership stake in the store’s success.

Having ownership in a project can mean different things:

  * You came up with the project yourself.
  * You made a significant contribution to the design of the project.
  * The project suits you perfectly in some way that enhances your life (for example, if you sign up to help build homes in a poor country, you won’t have come up with the idea or designed the program, but you may still feel ownership if you feel the project reflects your identity)



##### Accountability

To succeed in a project, you must take responsibility for its completion, which means being disciplined and holding yourself accountable for each step along the way. This is where projects often fail: **It’s easier to plan how you're going to approach a problem than it is to actually execute that plan.**

To prevent your Chimp from shirking its responsibilities when it loses its emotion-based inspiration, establish benchmarks of progress that will hold you accountable, such as deadlines or checkpoints for partial completion. You can also engage another person to report to—you’re much more likely to stick with a project if you keep someone else updated on your progress.

Be realistic in your accountability checks so you don’t set yourself up for failure, which will activate your Chimp. Don’t expect to accomplish enormous chunks of your project in short amounts of time or you’ll just end up discouraged.

##### Goals

The fourth aspect of preparing for success is setting proper goals. **Set goals that are ambitious enough to excite you but not so unrealistic that you set yourself up for failure.** If you strive for goals that are unreachable, you’ll feel deflated and unmotivated when you don’t achieve them, and your Chimp will encourage you to give up entirely.

_Goals_ are different from _dreams_. Dreams are things you wish for but don’t have full control over because there are outside influences involved, such as other people or lucky timing. Goals are things you can aim for and do have full control over. Your goals can help you work toward your dreams. However, if you mistakenly see your dreams as your goals, you won’t feel in control of your situation. You’ll perceive this lack of control as a threat, and your Chimp will awaken.

For example, if your dream is to win a race, you don’t have full control over that because you can’t control your competition—other people will be training for the race too, and may be faster than you simply because they have, for example, longer legs. However, you can set realistic goals that can help you possibly achieve your dream, such as getting in shape and eating well. If you see _winning_ as your goal, your Chimp will be upset if you lose. However, if you see _training well_ and _doing your best_ as your goals, your Chimp won't be upset if you lose the race, because you’ve still been successful in your personal goals.

#### The Moon of Carrots

You're much more likely to be successful if you have a diverse set of “carrots,” that is, _rewards_ , that you use to encourage yourself. Both your Human and your Chimp will respond more positively to rewards than to punishments. Rewards excite your inner Human and Chimp, while punishments—even if they are temporarily effective—produce anxiety and resentment.

Therefore, fill out your Moon of Carrots with a variety of rewards that will keep you working toward success, including:

  * **Prizes:** Rewarding yourself with small prizes for accomplishments can motivate your Chimp and your Human to reach for the next milestone. Prizes can be small and superficial, like a special latte or movie tickets.
  * **Celebrations:** Reflecting on the work you’ve done and celebrating it will satisfy your Chimp’s need for praise. Keep a visual record of your progress to remind your Chimp how well you’re doing—for example, post your schedule on the wall and check off each task as you accomplish it. 
  * **Recognition:** Seek validation from other people to satisfy your Chimp’s need for social recognition. Without recognition, your Chimp might start to feel resentful and unhappy.



Be aware of “sticks” (punishments) that you might encounter and that can derail your commitment to your project. Such sticks are typically negative thoughts, such as feelings of guilt, regret, and blame. Your Chimp gravitates toward such negative thinking because it gets caught up in emotions. When you find yourself beating yourself up for a setback, recognize this as a form of self-punishment and adjust your thoughts—your situation won’t improve through negative thinking. Instead, activate your inner Human to direct your thoughts to ways you can either change your circumstances or learn to accept them.

### Managing Success

Once you’ve achieved success, you’ll be faced with different challenges from your Chimp. Be aware of the possibility for these so that you're better prepared to deal with them. They include:

  * **Complacency:** Once you’ve achieved success, you might start taking it for granted, feeling like you’re entitled to your success and forgetting the hard work you had to do to accomplish your goals. If you fall victim to such complacency, you’ll be less likely to achieve continued, or additional, success. Counter your Chimp’s instincts to take it easy by reminding yourself that success needs to be constantly maintained. 
  * **Fear:** When you’ve accomplished something great, you might be filled with a fear that you can’t repeat the performance, which can prevent you from trying to accomplish more. To counter this fear, don’t let your Chimp compare your accomplishments. Remind yourself that each situation is new, so that you don’t have unrealistic expectations.
  * **Depression:** You may experience an emotional letdown after achieving a goal, as the focus, energy, and routines that drove you disappear. This is a common reaction, and you can counter it by addressing your Chimp’s needs at this time: Celebrate your successes, allow time to rest and recuperate, and set new goals. 



### Managing Failure

When you experience failure, you'll have an emotional reaction. This is normal, and to properly move on from your failure, you must allow your Chimp to go through this emotional reaction. If you fully understand your emotions, you’ll be better able to anticipate them, deal with them, get some perspective on your situation, and eventually, move on.

Your Chimp’s emotional reaction to failure is a grief reaction. **We normally think of grief as a reaction to a death, but grief is a normal response to any loss or failure.** Grief is your Chimp’s way of processing something that’s hurtful and difficult to accept. There are some typical stages of grief that you can expect. These can happen in any order, but commonly occur in this order:

  * Denial: You don’t accept the reality of the event or its consequences.
  * Yearning: You get caught up wishing the event never happened.
  * Bargaining: You try to change the outcome of the event.
  * Anger: You get caught up in frustration—sometimes blame accompanies this stage.
  * Disorganization: You start to accept your new situation and feel depressed and empty.
  * Reorganization: You more fully accept what happened and start to see a path forward.



While everyone reacts differently to traumatizing circumstances, you can expect to get through these stages in about three months to a year if your loss was significant.
