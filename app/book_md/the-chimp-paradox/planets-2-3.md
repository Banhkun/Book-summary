## Planets 2-3: Other People and Communication

Now that we’ve detailed your own psychological mind and how it works, we’ll examine how your “Planet 1” interacts with other people. Understanding your Planet 2 and Planet 3, the planets of _Other People_ and _Communication_ , means figuring out how to interact with other people in effective, constructive ways even if those other people are being difficult. To do so, follow these guidelines:

  * Speak through your Human.
  * Allow for each party to make their own choices.
  * Adjust your expectations.
  * Examine your prejudices.
  * Speak to the right person.
  * Choose the right time.
  * Find the right place.
  * Bring the right agenda.
  * Use the right method.



### Use Your Human Mode

**To successfully interact with other people, recognize that everyone has a Chimp and a Human just like you do, and that they may have trouble managing their Chimp, just as you might.** To best manage both of your Chimps, strive to speak from Human to Human, and leave your Chimps out of the conversation.

If you speak to someone else using your Chimp, they will most likely respond with their Chimp. This is how arguments happen: Your Chimp snaps at your partner because she did something that angered you, and _her_ Chimp snaps back, upset that you’re getting so angry about something so trivial. It’s also why arguments are so difficult to stop once they get started—both Chimps are naturally stubborn and reluctant to back down from a position once they’ve dug in.

To prevent this, go through the steps of Chimp management outlined earlier before you approach someone—exercise your Chimp, reason with it, and contain it. Then, anticipate that the other person will initially respond to you with her Chimp, and help her manage _her_ Chimp as best you can by allowing her to go through the Chimp management steps also: Particularly, allow her to exercise her Chimp so that she vents her emotions and is better placed to hear your reason and logic. Follow up by speaking to her with calm logic that her Chimp has no choice but to agree with.

### Allow for Choices

**The key to maintaining a good relationship is to acknowledge that each of you has a choice and can make a decision about the relationship, and the other person can’t force that decision.** Therefore, you can offer to relate to another person in a certain way but that other person doesn’t have to respond in the way that you want. If she does, then there’s no problem. But if she chooses not to, then you have your own choice to make: Do you want to accept her choice and continue a relationship on those terms, or do you want to leave the relationship?

For example, if your girlfriend is always late to your get-togethers because that’s just how she lives her life, then you can talk to her about how it bothers you, but you can’t force her to care about lateness in the same way that you do. If she’s content being late to appointments, then she’s not obligated to change for you. However, you can certainly decide that this isn't an acceptable characteristic of someone you date, and you can find another partner. Both of you have a choice and must respect the other person’s choice.

### Adjust Your Expectations

**You must have realistic expectations of other people, or you're setting your relationship up for failure:** You can’t expect someone to have talents or traits that they simply don’t have and never promised to have. For example, if you want to be with someone who’s a good artist, but the person you’re dating isn't a good artist, you can’t fault them for that. You have to accept them for who they are and then decide for yourself if you'll stay in the relationship or not.

### Examine Your Prejudices

When you first meet someone, you form an opinion from things you observe, such as their clothing, hairstyle, attitude, posture, and speech. This _first impression_ will dictate, to a large extent, how you feel about that person from then on. Be aware that you may be forming this opinion based on Gremlins of prejudice that you’ve added to your Computer but that may not be correct. For example, if you believe that blond-haired people aren’t smart, you might decide that a blond lawyer you meet isn’t very intelligent, based on this prejudice, and you may end up misjudging someone who is, in fact, highly competent.

### Speak to the Right Person

**To effectively communicate your message, you must talk to the person you wish to communicate to.** While that may sound obvious, all too often, people don’t do this. Instead they talk about their problem to other people—for example, mutual friends, coworkers, or family members. Consequently, the message never arrives with the person for whom it’s intended, and the problem doesn’t get resolved.

#### Assertiveness Versus Aggressiveness

Often, your reluctance to speak to the person at the center of your issue is caused by a lack of assertiveness, which in itself is often caused by your Chimp’s fear of upsetting other people because that might cause you to be excluded. This frequently comes from a confusion about the difference between being assertive and being aggressive, and people sometimes avoid being assertive out of fear that they’ll come across as aggressive.

**Assertiveness is explaining to someone what _is_ and what _isn’t_ acceptable. Aggressiveness is doing this with emotion in an attacking manner. **Being assertive is good; being aggressive is not. Assertiveness will get your message across clearly and effectively and will lead to solutions. In contrast, aggression will wake up the Chimp in the other person and will lead to conflict: The other person will either attack or recoil—either way, she is no longer listening to your message.

To be assertive, follow these steps, using “I” statements for each:

  1. Explain what you don’t want the other person to do.
  2. Explain how their actions make you feel.
  3. Explain what you do want them to do.



So, for example, if your manager yells at you for being late, instead of responding with aggression and defensiveness, you could say:

  1. “I would like you to listen to me without interrupting.” Then explain why you're late.
  2. “When you shout, I feel uncomfortable.”
  3. “I would like to discuss this with you in a calm way.”



### Choose the Right Time

**Approach the other person at a time when your conversation won’t be rushed, and when the other person isn’t already agitated** (and therefore, their Chimp is already activated). Make sure you have time not only to explain your position but also to listen fully to their position.

### Find the Right Place

**Find a neutral place that is neither in your “territory” nor theirs** , so they don’t feel that you’re trying to intimidate them. Find a quiet place so you’ll have few interruptions, and you can focus solely on your conversation.

### Bring the Right Agenda

**Be clear on what exactly you want to address and what you want to accomplish with your conversation.** If you don’t have a clear purpose, your conversation will be reactive rather than proactive, and it will more likely wander and end up being hijacked by your Chimp.

Be aware that your Chimp and your Human may have different agendas:

  * **Your Chimp wants to “win” your conversation.** It wants to express emotion and defend itself against criticism.
  * **Your Human wants to reach a mutually acceptable outcome.** It wants to use logic to understand and explain both perspectives. It's open to finding a solution that might not be ideal but will be a good compromise. 



The best way to approach a conversation is to first allow your Human to discuss with your own Chimp what agenda you want to bring to the discussion, so that you can get out of the way any instinctive feelings of “winning” and “losing,” which rarely lead to productive conversations.

**During your conversation with the other person, try to explicitly state not only your agenda but also what you think her agenda is.** This allows the other person to correct you if you’re misunderstanding her, and it keeps your conversation on track.

Additionally, let the other person accomplish her agenda first. If you let her air her grievances, not only will she be more receptive to hearing your side of the story, but you may also gain a better understanding of the situation and might change your mind on some aspects of it.

### Use the Right Method

Decide whether you want to approach the other person face-to-face or through writing, such as an email or letter. There are pros and cons to either method: Writing your thoughts down allows you to word them constructively and allows the other person time to digest them before responding, but subtleties and nuance can be lost in writing. Often, speaking face-to-face can prevent misunderstandings.

When communicating face-to-face, **keep in mind the way you _package_ your message: the way you present your message to the other person.** Packaging your message involves four things:

  1. **Body language:** the non-verbal messages you're conveying with your posture, face, and limbs. You can convey many emotions without words—for example, defensiveness (by crossing your arms), aggression (by towering over someone), or displeasure (through facial expressions). 
  2. **Intonation:** About a third of your message’s meaning is conveyed through your voice. Faster speeds indicate urgency or anxiety, while slower speeds indicate relaxation or confidence. Louder volume might indicate urgency, relaxation, or confidence, while softer volume might indicate uncertainty. Your emphasis on specific words can change a sentence’s meaning entirely: For example, the sentence “I like you” mean different things depending on if you emphasize the “I,” the “like,” or the “you”). 
  3. **Verbiage:** We attach emotions to certain words, and when you use emotive words inappropriately, the other person can feel attacked, awakening their Chimp. For example, saying “I hate that” will elicit a different emotional response than saying, “I’m not thrilled about that.” Choose your words carefully so as to convey your meaning without unnecessary emotions attached. 
  4. **Attitude:** Your attitude is your demeanor—whether or not you come across as friendly and approachable or aloof and cold. Inner Chimps are skilled at interpreting other people’s attitudes so that they don’t approach someone who poses a danger. If your attitude says “Stay back,” then other people’s Chimps will recognize that and will act defensively toward you. 



### Manage Continuing Conflict

Sometimes conflict won't be resolved even through a well-managed conversation. In these cases, there are three ways you can approach your continued conflict:

  1. **Negotiation:** You can try to continue to work with the other person on a one-on-one basis, trying to find common ground and agreement through additional discussions.
  2. **Mediation:** Sometimes you may need to bring in a neutral third party to help facilitate the discussions between you. The mediator would not pass judgment on either of your positions nor make decisions for you, but would instead be a calming presence so that you both can keep your Humans driving the conversation.
  3. **Arbitration:** If you just can’t reach a consensus with the other person, you may need to bring in a third party who will make that decision for you. This might be a legal person, like a judge, or it might be someone who’s somehow related to your situation, like your boss, and whom you both agree to allow to make the decision. 



### Planet 2’s Moon: Your Troop

Your troop is a small group of people who support and nurture you. It’s an important feature of your Planet of Other People because it provides you stability and happiness.

Your Chimp has a natural drive to be part of a troop. In the wild, chimpanzees without a group of chimpanzees are unprotected against predators, and our inner Chimp feels the same way. Your inner Chimp will therefore go to great lengths to be a part of a troop. This means that your Chimp cares greatly about what other people think because if they think badly of your Chimp, they might exclude it. Consequently, your Chimp will conform to the norms, beliefs, and values of the troop so as to stay included.

Your Chimp’s drive for a troop also means that it's hyper-aware of who is or is not in your troop, and views people outside of your troop with suspicion. This can cause conflict when your Chimp reacts negatively to someone just because it perceives them as part of a different troop.

Your Human also wants a troop, but less for survival and more for the benefits of living in a community where all people are cared for. Your Human wants to be popular and liked just as the Chimp does, but your Human recognizes that in a civilized society, you can disagree with members of your troop and not face exclusion and eventual death. Further, your Human tries to see people outside of your troop as potential friends, recognizing that not everyone is automatically an enemy just because they are different.

Therefore, the Chimp and Human see other people fundamentally differently. To function effectively in the real world, you need to let your Human be courteous and personable with everyone, inside or outside of your troop, However, you do need to listen to your Chimp sometimes, too—the truth is, some people really are outside your troop, and not everyone has your best interest at heart.

#### Selecting Your Troop

Your Chimp wants to create a troop that protects it and aids its survival, and will look for troop members who can fill that purpose. It will look for:

  * A leader—unless your Chimp is the leader, in which case it will look for followers
  * People with status and wealth, who can boost the strength of the troop in society
  * People with superficial qualities like good looks 
  * Familiar people, such as people from your hometown or school. 



Your Human will look for troop members who can provide friendship, and will seek out people with personable qualities that complement you, such as:

  * Honesty
  * Loyalty
  * Sense of humor
  * Positive outlook
  * A general ability to control their own Chimp, so as to minimize arguments



Sometimes your Chimp and your Human will disagree on a troop member. This might happen when someone has certain markers of success like popularity but is actually not a well-meaning person. For example, your Chimp might like to hang out with the party animal who has lots of friends, while your Human recognizes that this person has irresponsible lifestyle habits that can affect you negatively.

When choosing your troop, be careful to assign roles appropriately, so that the other members of the troop agree with their roles. For example, some people need a leader—this might be a boss or a doctor, or a childhood friend. However, if that other person doesn’t want to fulfill this role for you, you can’t expect them to, or you’ll end up with conflict.
