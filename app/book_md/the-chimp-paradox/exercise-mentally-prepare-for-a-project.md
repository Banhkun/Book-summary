## Exercise: Mentally Prepare for a Project

Both your Chimp and your Human must commit to a project if you're going to successfully stick with it. If you think through what you’ll need for the project and what challenges you might face, you’re much more likely to stick with it.

* * *

Describe a project you're planning to take on. Make a list of everything you’ll need to be successful in that project. (This might include both physical items like office space or craft tools, and it might include intangible things like time.)

Now make a list of up to three challenges you anticipate facing as you move forward. (Include both short-term and long-term challenges.)

Write down how you plan to meet those challenges. What can you do to prevent them, or in response to them when they happen? Will you need additional resources to face them? (If so, add them to your first list.)
