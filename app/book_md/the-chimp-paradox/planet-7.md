## Planet 7: Happiness

Your seventh planet is Happiness. The specifics of what makes a person happy are different for every person, so to start, figure out specifically what will make you happy. Be aware, when evaluating what makes you happy, of the difference between what you might _want_ and what you _need_. These are often the differences between what your Chimp wants and what your Human wants.

**Keep tabs on your happiness and track your progress consciously.** Keep a journal of the things that make you happy and the things that don’t. Keeping them consciously in your mind in this way will help you live more purposefully.

When you find yourself in a difficult time and feel unclear about how to move forward, you can use the “virtual twin” technique. With this technique, you’ll invent a copy of yourself to whom you can give advice. Give this twin a name to make it more real. Then, have a conversation with your virtual twin. Give your twin advice on how to solve their problems. You may find that you have an easier time figuring out your twin’s problems than your own because you’ve created some psychological distance.

### Planet 7 Moon 1: Confidence

Your planet of happiness won’t spin smoothly if you don’t have confidence in yourself. When you're confident, you feel secure, and when you're secure your Chimp feels happy.

When we discussed success, we explored how your happiness should be based on your efforts, not on the outcome of those efforts. Similarly, **base your confidence on your efforts, and not on the results of them.** If you base your confidence on specific accomplishments, then your confidence will be variable and you’ll live with constant fear of failure—this is typically how your Chimp measures its confidence. However, if you base your confidence on your efforts, then you’ll feel confident that you’ve done your best even when things don’t work out for you—this is how your Human views confidence.

The Human approach to confidence allows confidence to build on itself, since having an upbeat and optimistic outlook often leads to success anyway, which in turn feeds your confidence. For example, imagine you're preparing to give a speech in front of 1,000 people. Your Chimp will likely automatically feel fear and apprehension, because it bases your self-worth on the outcome of the speech. However, your Human knows that everyone agrees public speaking is difficult, and that if you mess up, it won’t reflect on who you are as a person. Your Human knows that if you do your best for the speech, you’ve succeeded. When you let your Human drive your confidence in this way, you’ll likely approach your speech with less anxiety and will consequently do a better job regardless.

### Planet 7 Moon 2: Security

If your Chimp doesn't feel safe and secure, you won’t achieve happiness. Your Chimp has a strong drive to protect itself from risk and danger in order to find happiness, but these instincts themselves can prevent you from finding happiness. For example, your Chimp might instinctively resist change because change means things will be unfamiliar and will introduce vulnerabilities into your life, but this might mean you resist pursuing a new career that would ultimately improve your happiness, if changing careers seems scary.

To prevent your Chimp from overreacting to perceived danger, **confront your fears about risk.** Your Chimp won’t be quieted by you simply ignoring risk, but if you're honest about the possibilities—both good and bad—that might result from any decisions you make, your Chimp will be better able to calm down, knowing that you at least are aware of the possible danger.

  * **Recognize your fears:** Have a conversation with your Chimp about what it fears. Figure out which things your Chimp can and cannot control. For example, you can’t control death or unexpected injury. However, you can control running out of time on a project at work, by improving your time management skills. 
  * **Establish routines:** Your Chimp craves familiarity. If you're facing a new and uncertain situation, create routines that will make it feel more familiar and therefore safer.
  * **Reach out to your troop for support:** Seek reassurance from other people who have your best interests at heart. 
  * **Accept that every activity carries risk:** Your Chimp is most afraid of feeling out of control, but there are many things that your Chimp simply can’t control. When you're honest with your Chimp about risks, your Chimp usually settles down, knowing that at the very least, you're aware of these risks.
