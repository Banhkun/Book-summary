## Planet 1: Your Psychological Mind

Our exploration of your psychological universe begins with a discussion of three key elements of your inner mind, each of which loosely corresponds to a physical area of your brain and serves a unique role in your psyche.

These elements are:

  * The Chimp, controlled by your limbic system
  * The Human, controlled by your frontal lobe 
  * The Computer, controlled by your parietal lobe



**Planet 1 is a split planet on which your Chimp and your Human both live and operate. A moon, representing the Computer, revolves around it, guiding and stabilizing the planet.** In general, the Chimp is emotional, the Human is rational, and the Computer is habitual—it’s the command center for your unthinking habits and knee-jerk reactions. The Chimp and Human are the two primary forces driving your reactions to the world. They each have different ways of thinking and differing agendas, but each defers to the Computer for guidance on how to carry out those reactions.

### Understanding Your Chimp and Your Human

Your Chimp (your emotional side) and your Human (your rational side) are two separate, independent sources of thought. At any given time, your reactions and decisions are controlled by one or the other. You can sometimes recognize the conflict between these two elements when you find yourself talking to yourself, having battles in your head between emotion and reason.

There is scientific evidence showing that only one of these influences controls us at any given time. Brain scans can detect blood flowing to one area over another depending on which is being used: If you're having calm, rational thoughts, more blood flows to the frontal lobe—the Human area. If you're having emotional, distressed thoughts, more blood flows to the limbic system—the Chimp area.

The Chimp and the Human operate with different thought patterns, agendas (goals), and laws. We’ll explore each of these differences below.

#### Your Chimp

The Chimp makes decisions emotionally, basing thoughts on assumptions and hunches. This can be either good or bad: Sometimes, your “gut feeling” is accurate and perceives something subtle that your rational mind misses. Other times, gut feelings are based on overly negative, defensive, or paranoid thoughts, and can direct you wrongly. This is the paradox: The Chimp’s emotional nature can be sometimes helpful and sometimes harmful. Understanding how your Chimp thinks and operates will allow you to harness its emotional drives when they can benefit you, while limiting the harm they can cause when they turn negative.

##### Your Chimp’s Thinking

As we stated earlier, your Chimp is emotional and irrational. Therefore, when it reacts to a situation, it:

  * **Jumps to conclusions:** A Chimp makes fast judgments before it has a full set of information. 
  * **Thinks in black and white:** Chimps see situations as either very good or very bad, and are unable to process subtleties. 
  * **Digs in:** Chimps don’t often consider alternate points of view or other interpretations, and once they’ve chosen a stance, they tend to defend it blindly, regardless of what additional information comes to light.
  * **Is paranoid:** Your Chimp has evolved to look out for danger and therefore defaults to paranoia in situations where it doesn't understand what’s going on. The more insecure your Chimp feels, the less trusting it becomes, and in uncomfortable situations, it can easily interpret harmless situations as dangerous—for example, it might hear offhand comments and assume they’re insults. 
  * **Thinks catastrophically:** Because of its tendency to see danger everywhere, your Chimp overreacts to situations with intense emotion, anxiety, and despair. 
  * **Thinks irrationally:** Because your Chimp jumps to conclusions, it doesn't evaluate whether something is likely or realistic before settling on an opinion. Therefore, its thoughts are often ungrounded in reality or logic. 
  * **Judges first, questions second:** A Chimp makes its judgments based on feelings and impressions and only then looks for facts and rational to back up its decisions. 



When a Chimp reacts with these instincts, it can cause problems that could have been avoided. For example, imagine Tom is waiting for his brother, Joe, outside a restaurant. Joe is so late that they’ve missed their reservation. Tom’s Chimp hijacks his brain with emotional thoughts, such as: Joe knows I hate being late, he doesn’t respect my time, he’s let me down, and so on. When Joe does show up, Tom’s Chimp drives him to confront Joe angrily before asking for an explanation. When Joe defends himself by explaining what held him up, Tom’s Chimp switches to feeling remorse and embarrassment, but the damage to their relationship has already been done, and neither brother enjoys the rest of the evening.

##### Your Chimp’s Agenda

Your Chimp thinks in these emotional, irrational ways because it has two primary goals:

  * **Self-survival:** Your Chimp wants to protect itself from harm, which is why it's so attuned to danger.
  * **Perpetuating the species:** Your Chimp wants to produce the next generation, which means it’s imbued with instincts and drives that influence its reactions.



Your Chimp is always, unfailingly, looking to satisfy these two goals. When you understand this and how these goals influence your Chimp’s thinking and laws of operation, you can find ways to satisfy these urges that will keep your Chimp under control.

##### Your Chimp’s Laws

**To carry out its agenda, the Chimp operates according to the laws of the jungle, which are based on _instincts, drives, vulnerability,_ and _gender_ , **each of which is explored below.

**Instincts**

The laws of the jungle are based first and foremost on _instincts_ : innate responses designed to increase our chances of survival. These are automatic reactions to triggers that don’t require any conscious thinking. For example, a baby instinctively sucks on things because it's pre-programmed to nurse.

The Chimp’s instinctive response to danger is the _Fight, Flight, or Freeze_ reaction (FFF). This is nature’s way of protecting us by prompting us to either:

  * Fight, by confronting a threat
  * Flee, by running from a threat
  * Freeze, by keeping still so that the threat doesn’t notice us



Remember that the Chimp’s agenda is to survive, and the FFF response is designed to help ensure survival by enabling the Chimp to act immediately and without thinking. Because of this, the Chimp doesn’t take time to assess which threats are significant and which are trivial, and therefore, just to be safe, your Chimp reacts to any threats as if they were mortal threats. This is why your emotional response to triggers is often extreme.

While this may be a helpful response to threats in the jungle, in society such an intense reaction can cause more problems than it solves. For example, if you have to make a public speech, your inner Chimp might start screaming, “But this might kill me!” and prompt you to either avoid it (flight) or stumble and forget your lines (freeze).

**Drives**

The laws of the jungle are also determined by _drives_ , which are similar to instincts but are not triggered by specific events like instincts are; drives are always present, influencing our decisions.

Your Chimp has powerful drives like sex, dominance, territorial defense, parental behaviors, and the desire to belong to a group, all of which advance its agenda of survival and the production of offspring. Because these drives are so important to the survival of the species, we have evolved pleasure responses to them, so that engaging in these drives feels enjoyable.

Like with instincts, drives can be helpful in a jungle but harmful in society. For example, each of us is born with a drive to eat. In a jungle, when presented with food, we are driven to gorge on it because we don’t know when we might eat again. In society, this drive can lead to obesity, because it's far less likely that we won’t be able to find food again after a meal.

Further, the pleasurable element attached to drives can become a problem in and of itself, if it leads to addiction. Any of the Chimp’s drives can end up as an addiction, which can cause great harm to a person's life.

**Vulnerability**

The laws of the jungle are also determined by feelings of vulnerability. A Chimp often feels insecure because there are many animals in a jungle more powerful than it (for example, a tiger—or in real life, your boss). A feeling of vulnerability drives many of the Chimp’s behaviors that we discussed earlier, such as aggression, defensiveness, or a tendency toward paranoia.

**Gender**

The type of jungle laws your particular inner Chimp adheres to is determined by whether you have a male or female inner Chimp. Some inner Chimps are male while others are female, and your interactions with the world will be determined in large part by which gender your particular inner Chimp is. The gender of someone’s inner Chimp doesn't have anything to do with that person’s actual gender. While male and female _people_ are very similar, a male or female inner _Chimp_ is very different. The discussion here of the inner Chimp’s gender is based on physiological differences in men and women that correspond to different evolutionary needs of male and female chimpanzees in the jungle.

One major difference is the differing amounts of the hormones estrogen and testosterone in each gender—men have more testosterone while women have more estrogen. Testosterone imparts a higher sex drive and more aggression, while estrogen promotes calmness and passivity. Therefore, a male inner Chimp and a female inner Chimp will have different levels of aggression and calmness.

Another difference is that women’s brains have more connections to the emotional regions of the brain (the left amygdala has more brain connections than men’s left amygdalas). In theory this is because in the wild, female chimpanzees are naturally smaller than the males, and therefore must develop skills other than brute strength in order to survive. For this reason, females are better at judging body language and mood, since that helps them protect themselves from threats they may not be able to physically fight off.

Because of this need to protect herself from physical threats in non-physical ways, and because a female chimpanzee is tasked with protecting her young and providing shelter for them, it benefits a female chimpanzee to be insecure enough that she’s constantly looking for threats. Similarly, female inner Chimps are often insecure and overly cautious. Further, because they are quick to become anxious, they often avoid making decisions out of a fear of making the wrong decision. Whether you’re a man or a woman, if you find yourself unable to confidently make decisions, it’s not because of a problem with you, it’s because your inner emotional Chimp has hijacked your brain.

#### Your Human

In contrast, your inner Human makes decisions rationally, basing thoughts on facts and logic. The Human’s main job is to balance the Chimp’s emotional instincts with sensible ones.

The importance of the Human part of the brain (the frontal lobe) is evidenced by what happens when it stops working properly. People who have suffered injuries to their frontal lobes lose the ability to regulate their emotional impulses. A famous example of this was Phineas Gage, a railroad employee in the late 19th century who survived an explosion that thrust an iron rod through his eye and out the top of his skull, destroying his frontal lobe but leaving him otherwise functional. After the injury, his personality completely changed; while he had once been careful, responsible, and thoughtful, he instead turned foul-mouthed, impulsive, and aggressive.

##### Your Human’s Thinking

Your Human reacts to a situation with logical, rational thinking. This means:

  * **Looking for evidence:** Humans base their opinions on facts, and will weigh different points of view before settling on a conclusion.
  * **Being realistic:** Humans ask whether a conclusion is likely or whether it’s unrealistic.
  * **Seeing context:** Humans keep an eye on context in a situation, asking _how_ something came to happen or _why_ someone said a certain thing. 
  * **Seeing perspective:** Humans keep an eye on the long-term timeline, understanding that things that happen are temporary events. This allows Humans to temper their reaction, knowing that something bad that happens now will pass, and isn’t worth getting overly upset about.
  * **Seeing shades of gray:** Humans can see subtleties that Chimps are blind to, understanding that things are not always simply good or simply bad. Therefore, Humans are less likely to judge someone harshly for doing something wrong because they understand that everyone has some good and some bad in them. 
  * **Looking for reasons:** Humans look for explanations to make sense of someone else’s behavior. 



##### Your Human’s Agenda

Like your Chimp, your Human has two overriding goals. These goals, though, are fundamentally different from your Chimp’s purely survivalist goals:

  * **Self-fulfillment:** Humans want to become the best versions of themselves possible and to achieve meaningful success. This will mean different things to different people: For example, some people will want to establish financially secure lives for themselves and their families, while others may feel fulfilled helping other people instead. 
  * **Societal harmony:** Humans are instinctively social creatures and want to establish societies that enable peaceful coexistence with each other through rules and laws. These rules and laws are designed to control the Chimp inside each of us, so that the Human can remain in control of our behaviors.



##### Your Human’s Laws

Because its goals are more socially focused than your Chimp’s goals, your Human brain operates through laws of society rather than the laws of the jungle. Such laws allow people to work and live together peacefully, and are based on:

  * **Honesty:** If people aren’t honest, loyal, and reliable, they can’t trust each other. A society needs trust in order to work properly. 
  * **Compassion:** The ability to understand and empathize with others’ experiences is a crucial element of a developed society—people helping other people in need is what differentiates our species from other animal species.
  * **Conscience:** The ability to feel remorse is another crucial element of a functioning society, for if people don’t feel bad about their mistakes, they won’t improve themselves.
  * **Lawfulness:** Humans tend to follow rules, both written and unwritten, accept responsibility for their actions, and hold other people accountable for their mistakes. 
  * **Self-control:** Humans differ from Chimps in their ability to control their impulses. While Chimps act immediately on their emotional triggers and demand immediate gratification, Humans are able to override their reaction impulses and delay their rewards. 
  * **Purposefulness:** Humans innately seek a higher purpose and meaning for their lives.
  * **Achievement:** Humans like to accomplish goals—something that furthers their sense of purpose, mentioned above. 



### Managing Your Chimp

Managing your Planet 1—your psychological mind—means reconciling the conflicting thinking, agendas, and laws of the Chimp and the Human in each of us. In general, your goal is to allow your Human to drive your actions, not your Chimp, because you're less likely to behave in positive, productive ways when your Chimp is in control. Your Human thinks about the future, deciding on actions that will ensure that later, you’ll be happy with how you used your time. In contrast, your Chimp functions in the _here-and-now_ , deciding actions based on how it feels in the moment.

**You can’t change your Chimp’s nature (its instincts or drives), but you can manage them.** Your Chimp is your responsibility as much as your dog would be your responsibility: If your dog attacks someone, you can’t simply shrug and say, “It was the dog, what can I do?” In the same way, you can’t can’t use your Chimp as an excuse to justify your own poor behavior—for example, you can’t snap at someone and then simply say, “It was my instinct, no big deal.”

It takes time and practice to get good at managing your Chimp. To start, follow these three steps:

  * Step 1: Recognize when your Chimp is taking over.
  * Step 2: Understand how your Chimp works.
  * Step 3: Work with your Chimp to prevent outbursts.



#### Step 1: Recognize When Your Chimp Is Taking Over

**When you have an immediate emotional reaction, you can recognize it as your Chimp by asking yourself if you _want_ to feel this way.** For example:

  * If you're worrying about something, ask, “Do I _want_ to feel anxious?”
  * If something upsets you, ask, “Do I _want_ to feel angry?”
  * If you can’t motivate yourself to do something you know you need to do (such as catch up on a work project or organize your basement), ask, “Do I _want_ to feel apathetic?”



If you answer “no” to these questions, then your Chimp is in control of your emotions.

#### Step 2: Understand How the Chimp Works

You can't get control of your Chimp unless you fully understand how your Chimp operates and why it’s so difficult to ignore. Your Chimp’s urges are hard to resist because of two primary reasons:

**1\. The Chimp’s reactions are more immediate:** When our brains process information, messages go first to the Chimp, not the Human, to determine the threat level. If the Chimp decides there’s no danger, the message gets passed to the Human. But if the Chimp detects danger—or desire—it reacts immediately. This is why your emotions are often triggered before you’ve had a chance to fully assess a situation.

Once your Chimp logs an emotional response, it decides on a course of action and then looks to your Human for confirmation. This is why people typically make decisions emotionally and then justify those decisions rationally: For example, you might decide to eat a cookie at lunchtime because you want to, and you’ll justify it with excuses like, “It’s only one,” or “I didn’t eat any cookies yesterday.”

**You can gain control of your Chimp by recognizing that when it decides on a course of action, it's merely making a suggestion, not a command.** So, when your Chimp wants that cookie, and asks your Human for permission to eat it,_your Human does not have to say yes._

**2\. The Chimp’s reactions are more powerful:** In nature, a chimpanzee is about five times as strong as a person. Your inner Chimp is similarly five times as strong as your inner Human. The emotional reactions of the Chimp are therefore harder to ignore and control.

Because your Chimp is so much stronger than your Human, you can’t control it by confronting it head-on in a battle of wills. Your Chimp’s desires will simply override your Human’s willpower. For example, you may have willpower in the morning to eat healthy all day, but by lunchtime, when faced with a snack, your Chimp will ignore that morning resolution, and will compel you to give in to the temptation.

To resist your Chimp’s power, you’ll need a plan that works with its nature but still allows your Human to drive your actions, which brings us to Step 3:

#### Step 3: Work With Your Chimp

To control your Chimp, you must recognize that its instincts and drives will always be there. If you try to simply ignore them, they will inevitably pop up and take control of you—for example, telling yourself before bedtime that you’ll get up early and exercise won’t prevent your desire for extra sleep from rearing up when morning comes around. And if you don’t have a pre-planned method for dealing with that desire when it arrives, it will drive your actions.

##### Preventive: Indulge Your Chimp’s Drives

You can get control of many Chimp drives by acknowledging its drive and meeting its needs in appropriate and harmless ways. For example, you could:

  * **Release aggression:** If you have an aggressive Chimp, finding an outlet for that aggression, such as participating in sports or banging on drums, can satisfy those urges. 
  * **Establish boundaries:** Defining your territory will help your Chimp feel relaxed, secure, and content. This might mean carving out a physical space for your own belongings at home, or it might mean defining your job responsibilities at work so that your colleagues don’t try to encroach on your role (or unload their responsibilities onto you). 
  * **Redirect:** Sometimes you can fulfill your drive with something that’s similar to the drive’s true desire. For example, sometimes people who have strong maternal drives but don’t have children will work in fields that allow them to care for other people, like teaching. 



##### Reactive: Exercise Your Chimp

By indulging your Chimp’s drives in small and socially appropriate ways, you can often keep those drives in check. However, at times, your Chimp will inevitably assert itself: Something will happen that will upset you, unnerve you, or stress you, and your Chimp will awaken.

To stop your Chimp from gaining control of your brain when it does assert itself, you can use three techniques:

**1\. Listen to your Chimp:** Allow your Chimp to “exercise itself” by expressing its emotions. When your Chimp vents its feelings, it typically calms down. Therefore, allow your Chimp to get its feelings off its chest—to say whatever it feels, even if those feelings are irrational. Most Chimps only need about 10 minutes of an outburst and will then feel calmer and more in control. If the process might take longer, or your Chimp needs more than one exercise, allow as much time as your Chimp needs.

Of course, you must be sure that you vent in this way in an appropriate setting. Vent to someone you trust, who will understand that your feelings are coming from your Chimp and won’t punish you for them later. You may even feel more comfortable writing down your thoughts instead of voicing them to someone.

Once your Chimp has gotten all its thoughts and feelings out, it can take a rest and your Human can take over. At this point, let your Human examine the things that your Chimp has brought to light. It’s very likely that many of your Chimp’s complaints are irrational, but some may be legitimate problems that your Human needs to address.

**2\. Talk to your Chimp:** Once you’ve allowed your Chimp to talk, it’s your turn. Address your Chimp’s complaints so that you can put them to bed and “box up” your Chimp, constraining it safely away. Reason with your Chimp: Explain why you should act a different way than it wants to act. Don’t try to dismiss or ignore your Chimp’s objections; agree with your Chimp when it has legitimate points. However, explain other facts and logic that it will have no choice but to agree to.

For example, maybe someone cut you off on the road and your Chimp was activated. Agree with your Chimp that the other driver was obnoxious and drove dangerously, but point out that there’s nothing to be gained by driving poorly in response—tailgating the other car or cutting her off in return won’t solve anything and will only put both of your lives in danger. Since your Chimp can’t argue with this logic, it will usually calm down.

**3\. Distract or reward your Chimp:** Another method of managing your Chimp is to “offer it bananas.” That is, offer it something it will want and that you can use either as a distraction or as a reward.

An example of a distraction would be reading a book while you’re waiting for someone, or listening to music while you’re doing an unpleasant task like folding laundry.

An example of a reward would be a promise of something pleasant after you’ve done an unpleasant task—like having a second cup of coffee after you’ve responded to five work emails. Additionally, praise or recognition from other people can be powerful rewards: For example, if you’ve been putting off cleaning up your basement, you might invite some friends over to hang out in your newly organized basement, which will propel you to get the task done in anticipation of their praise.
