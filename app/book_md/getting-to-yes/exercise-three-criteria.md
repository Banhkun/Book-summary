## Exercise: Three Criteria

The authors identify three criteria for successful negotiation: 1) the agreement must be wise, meaning that it meets the interests of each side and itâ€™s fair; 2) the process must be efficient; and 3) the process must strengthen the relationship.

* * *

Think of a recent negotiation you were involved in. How did it compare to the above criteria?

If you had applied one or more of the criteria, how would it have changed the negotiation process or the agreement?
