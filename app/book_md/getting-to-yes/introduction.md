## Introduction

**We’re all negotiators — negotiation is how we get what we want from others** in business and personal life. We negotiate with our bosses, clients, sellers, real estate agents, family members, and others. In fact, we reach most decisions in our lives through negotiation, often without realizing it.

In _Getting to Yes_ , authors Roger Fisher and William Ury note that the number of situations requiring negotiation keeps increasing, which makes it essential to learn negotiation skills. Twenty or more years ago, command-and-control structures with a chain of bosses ordering our actions were common. Today, however, organizational structures are less hierarchical, more companies emphasize teamwork, and people expect a say in decisions that affect them rather than being dictated to. This requires negotiation.

_Getting to Yes_ , a 30-year-old classic updated in 2011, presents an alternative to adversarial bargaining — **principled negotiation, a process focusing on finding creative options that serve mutual interests** (some have referred to it as win-win negotiation). Their method continues to be taught in many U.S. law schools.

**Negotiation is defined as a give-and-take effort by two or more parties to reach agreement on a matter in which some of their interests conflict, some are shared, and some differ.**

Although we negotiate all the time, most of us don't do it very well. People tend to approach negotiation from one of two extremes: overly aggressive or overly friendly (hard or soft).

  * **Hardball negotiators view negotiation as a contest they must win**. Their strategy is to take the toughest positions and hold out the longest. Their win-at-any-cost approach exhausts energy and resources and ruins their relationship with the other side. 
  * On the other hand, **those who take an overly friendly approach seek to avoid conflict at all cost and reach an amicable agreement**. They readily make concessions and may end up feeling exploited.



Whichever method people use, there’s a tension between getting along with people and getting what you want.

By contrast, principled negotiation combines elements of these approaches — there are times to be tough and times be lenient. In addition, **the method aims to decide issues on their merits (facts and evidence), rather than on what’s acceptable/unacceptable to each side, and to look for mutual gains**. Where interests conflict, results are based on fair, objective standards.

Principled negotiators avoid games. Each side’s goal is to get only what they’re entitled to while being civil and to be fair but avoid being taken advantage of. The process is transparent rather than dependent on hiding your real goal or strategy from the other side.

Part one of the book discusses problems created by the standard method of bargaining — positional bargaining. The next four parts describe the four key elements of the alternative method of principled bargaining. The remaining parts describe procedures and tactics and how to deal with challenges, including a power imbalance between the sides.

**Anyone can use principled negotiation and it can be applied to any issue.**
