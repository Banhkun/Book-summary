## Exercise: Evaluate Your Breathing

Nestor argues that due to a combination of genetics, soft foods, and self-reinforcing cycles of congestion, most of us have developed poor breathing habits. It may be that while reading this guide, you’ve been self-conscious about how you’ve been breathing. Take a few moments to think about how you breathe on a regular basis.

* * *

Take a few deep breaths through your nose, letting your stomach expand as you do so. Exhale slowly as you breathe out, letting your stomach naturally contract. After several repetitions of this cycle, what effect (if any) has it had on your mood? Do you feel calm, or more agitated? How much of a difference did breathing slowly make?

When you were consciously breathing through your nose, did it feel natural or did it feel forced? If it felt forced, do you think it’s because you normally breathe through your mouth? When you stopped being deliberate about your breathing, was your next breath through your mouth or your nose?

Think back to the last time you did something strenuous (working out, climbing stairs, moving boxes). Do you remember whether or not you were breathing through your mouth? If so, did it feel like you were getting enough air, or did it feel like breathing itself was exhausting?

What breathing practices or advice from this book do you feel would be useful and applicable in your own life? How easy or difficult do you feel it would be to make a lasting change to how you breathe?
