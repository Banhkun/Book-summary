## 1-Page Summary

In _Unlimited Memory_ , Kevin Horsley explains that, using the right techniques, anyone can train their brain to learn and remember anything. He offers several techniques to help you remember everything by making associations between things you already know well—like your car or your body—and things you want to remember. He also describes strategies to help you remember things through story, art, and visualization.

Kevin Horsley is a professional speaker and author of books such as _The Happy Mind_ and _Remembering the Presidents of the USA_. He’s also a World Memory Championship medalist and has received the title of International Grandmaster of Memory—a title held by only 22 people in the world—from the International Association of Memory. This is an association devoted to connecting memory sport federations from different nations, and it governs and hosts memory competitions all over the world.

In our guide, we’ll explain Horsley’s theories on learning and memory and the importance of attention and associative learning. We’ll also look at some of his specific techniques and how to implement them and explore how to retain information long after you’ve learned it. We’ll supplement Horsley’s ideas with scientific context and tips from other memory experts and writers.

### Memory: The Foundation of Learning

According to Horsley, **your memory is one of your most important abilities as a human being**. It underpins learning—the process of gaining new knowledge—because remembering information is the key to utilizing it. Memory is also foundational to gaining skills because all skills build on knowledge. For example, in order to gain the skill of speaking another language, you have to build the knowledge of that language’s vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, and then you have to _remember_ that knowledge so you can apply it.

> **The Different Types of Memory**
> 
> Horsley writes about memory in a general sense, but there are different types of memory that store different types of information. His advice largely relates to _semantic memory_ , or the memory of facts and information about the world. As we’ll see later, he often advises that you connect semantic memories to _episodic memory_ —the memory of events and experiences—to help you better retain them. These are both types of _declarative_ or _explicit memory_.
> 
> His advice doesn’t apply as well to _implicit memory_ , which includes things like procedural memory—the knowledge of how to perform tasks like sewing or playing an instrument. Implicit memory also includes priming, the phenomenon where a past experience increases how quickly you can respond to something in the present—for example, if you see a picture of a banana and then someone asks you to name a fruit, you're more likely to respond with "banana" than another fruit like "apple" or "orange."
> 
> Implicit memory doesn’t require conscious effort to store or retrieve information, so conscious memory techniques may not directly improve your implicit memory. However, practicing these techniques may make your memory stronger overall, like exercising a muscle, so it could indirectly improve your implicit memory as well.

Improving your memory will help you in many ways: For example, **you’ll be able to connect better with others by remembering meaningful details about their experiences and identities.** You’ll also be able to make better decisions in the moment because you won’t have to search for the information you need to base those decisions on—you’ll just have it waiting in your memory.

(Shortform note: A strong memory can have many advantages, but it can also come with some disadvantages: Remembering a great deal can cause you to feel overloaded with information or to have trouble distinguishing between important and unimportant information. It can also cause you to dwell on negative experiences in your past or hold on to unpleasant memories that you’d rather forget. In these cases, however, there are other memory techniques you can use to deliberately forget something, giving you even greater control over your memory and how you want to use it.)

Many people think of memory as a _capacity_ you’re born with—they believe that some people simply have a better memory than others. However, Horsley asserts that this is a limiting belief: A self-fulfilling prophecy about your own limitations that keeps you from learning and tapping your mind’s full potential. In other words, if you believe you have a poor memory, this belief will hold you back and ensure that you _do_ have a poor memory. **The ability to remember information is a _practice_ , not an innate trait, which means you can improve it through training and using memory techniques.** Thus, you can incorporate a memory practice into your daily life to help you remember anything you want.

(Shortform note: There are other factors beyond practice that can impact your memory capacity. These include personal habits such as drug and alcohol use, sleep deprivation, health issues like vitamin deficiencies or poorly regulated epilepsy, brain injuries, and degenerative diseases like dementia. You may be able to improve your memory by avoiding alcohol, getting adequate rest, and maintaining a nutritious diet, but diseases and injuries are often beyond our control. Although memory loss is often accompanied by embarrassment and shame, avoid judging yourself if you suffer from a memory disorder that prevents you from making use of Horsley’s ideas.)

Horsley explains that you can use his techniques to achieve an unlimited memory. He uses this term literally: If you devote the necessary time and effort to it, there’s no limit to the amount of information you can remember.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that the human brain may have a limit to its memory capacity, but it’s so large you probably never need to worry about reaching it: Experts estimate the brain can hold up to 2.5 petabytes of information, which is equivalent to 2.5 million gigabytes. For comparison, the average laptop has about 256 gigabytes of storage capacity, which is just one 10,000th of the brain’s capacity.)

Horsley explains that having an unlimited memory is a matter of adopting four habits, which we’ve synthesized into three: attention, association, and practice. In the next sections we’ll explore in more detail how to adopt each of these habits.

### Attention: Stay Present While Learning

Your ability to commit information to memory depends on how well you pay attention to it. **Paying close attention to what you’re learning requires you to be present in the moment** —focusing on the task at hand and blocking out irrelevant stimuli or interruptions.**** If your mind is cluttered with discouragement, distraction, or a lack of a clear goal, you can’t be present. Below we’ll explain how to manage these types of clutter to help you pay better attention.

(Shortform note: Mindfulness is a term used to describe being fully present in the moment and unbothered by external distractions. Research shows that mindfulness practices like meditation can improve memory capacity and function by reducing stress and stimulating structural changes in the brain (a phenomenon known as neuroplasticity). Pairing Horsley’s techniques with mindfulness practices may improve your memory even further.)

#### Dealing With Discouragement

According to Horsley, the way you talk to yourself determines how well you can pay attention. If you tell yourself you’re bad at paying attention, and you believe you’re bad at it, you will be. He explains that people often have limiting beliefs that keep them from improving their abilities. These beliefs include things like “I’m unintelligent,” “I don’t have enough help from others to do this,” and “It’s too hard.” Believing these things will make them true, but shedding these beliefs will unlock your potential. **To get rid of your limiting beliefs, replace them with empowering beliefs** like “I have a natural aptitude for learning and remembering,” and “I can do anything I set my mind to.”

(Shortform note: Because they’re often subconscious and deeply ingrained, we may not recognize our own limiting beliefs. To help you identify them, be aware of any time you think something like “This is just how I am.” As humans, we’re capable of great change, so any belief that makes you think you can’t change might be a limiting belief you need to overcome. On the other hand, sometimes you may hold a belief that you consciously know isn’t true but that still influences your behavior. Simply telling yourself that these beliefs aren’t true won’t be helpful since you’re already aware they’re not true; thus, Horsley’s advice to replace the limiting belief with an empowering one will have a greater impact than simply saying the limiting belief isn’t true.)

#### Dealing With Distraction

Another reason we struggle to pay attention and be present in the moment is that **we try to do too many things at once**. We often attempt to multitask when we’re learning, but Horsley explains that multitasking is impossible because you can’t direct your attention to more than one thing at a time. Research shows that multitasking slows you down and increases the number of mistakes you make. If you stop trying to multitask, you’ll find you can pay attention more closely and for longer periods than if you continue to try to split your focus. To do this, Horsley recommends training yourself to focus only on one thing at any given moment and avoid the urge to constantly distract yourself.

> **When Can We “Multitask”?**
> 
> Experts suggest that what we tend to think of as multitasking is actually _serial tasking_ , or switching rapidly between tasks. As Horsley asserts, serial tasking reduces efficiency and performance on whatever you’re doing because of the mental energy you expend by switching tasks. However, there are certain activities that you may be able to do simultaneously provided that 1) one of the activities is automatic enough that it doesn’t require your conscious attention, and 2) the two activities don’t require the same types of neural processing.
> 
> For example, you can’t write an email and listen to a podcast at the same time because they both require language processing, but you could potentially write an email and exercise on a stationary bicycle at the same time because the bicycle doesn’t require your conscious attention or your language processing skills.
> 
> However, even if two tasks can be done at the same time, one of them may still prove a distraction. Athletes training for an important event, for example, may not want to distract themselves with music or a movie: Even though the tasks engage different parts of the brain and the exercise they’re doing is something they can do automatically, distractions can keep them from focusing on their form and technique, which can impede their progress.

#### Creating a Clear Goal

When trying to learn something, identify two aspects of your goal: 1) what you want to learn and 2) how you want to apply it. And the more specific these goals are, the better. According to Horsley, a lack of a clear, specific goal in what you’re focusing on creates a disconnect in your mind between what you’re trying to do and what you want to do: If you don’t know what your goal is, you won’t know how to go about achieving it, and you won’t be able to tell when you _have_ achieved it. Establishing a clear goal requires you to be curious about what you’re learning so you’ll have a better idea of how you can apply the topic to your life. This will help you establish _why_ you’re learning this information, which makes it easier to organize your ideas and retain knowledge.

(Shortform note: In _Flow_ , psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi affirms the importance of goals in achieving a state of flow—a state in which you feel a strong sense of purpose and direction toward achieving your goals (similar to the state of focused attention that Horsley describes). However, Csikszentmihalyi adds that having too many goals can be a distraction and keep you from achieving any of them. He also notes that you’ll need to adjust your goals as you go along to avoid becoming anxious or bored. For example, if you achieve your goal, you need a new one to motivate you to keep progressing, and if you hit a major obstacle you may need to change your current goal to accommodate this challenge.)

You also need to identify what about the topic interests you, because we naturally struggle to pay attention to anything that doesn’t interest us. If your topic isn’t immediately of interest to you, look for ways to connect it to things that _do_ interest you.

(Shortform note: In _Grit_ , psychologist Angela Duckworth suggests that it’s not enough to develop an interest in something; rather, you need to maintain that interest in the long term by turning that interest into a _passion_. If you’re passionate about what you’re learning, you’ll be able to keep up with a consistent practice instead of losing steam when your interest starts to fade.)

### Association: Connecting What You’re Learning to What You Know

Horsley’s second memory principle is association: According to Horsley, **we learn everything by association**. Association is when you make mental connections between knowledge you already have and the knowledge you’re trying to learn. You’re using your long-term memory (things you already know well) to latch onto items that are passing through your short-term memory. This allows you to store them in your medium-term memory (which ultimately becomes your long-term memory). This is how you make new information accessible to your brain.

(Shortform note: In _The Brain That Changes Itself_ , Norman Doidge explains that creating mental associations actually causes physical changes in the brain through a phenomenon known as _neuroplasticity_. When you have a thought or learn something new, a neural pathway between nerve cells in your brain forms, and the more you have that same thought or remember that information, the stronger the pathway (and its respective mental association) gets. This also means that the less you use a pathway, the weaker that pathway becomes, which highlights the importance of review and practice as we’ll see later in this guide.)

For example, when you meet someone for the first time, their name is new information. When they tell you their name, it will go into your short-term memory, and unless you make a deliberate effort to create an association between that name and some other information that’s already in your long-term memory, it will fade from your short-term memory within seconds. If you meet someone named Julie, for example, you may look closely at her face and imagine her covered in jewels to help you remember the sound of her name. This will shift her name from your short-term memory to your medium-term memory, and revisiting that association will eventually push the information into your long-term memory.

(Shortform note: The “terms” in short-term, medium-term, and long-term memory refer to different timespans: Information stays in your short-term memory for less than a minute, and once it’s consolidated into long-term memory, it can last forever. Medium-term memory lasts for a few hours, which means you’ll need to strengthen that association enough within those few hours to make it stick in your long-term memory. If you learn a name and create an association, but you don’t refresh your memory of that association until the next day, it’s likely that you’ll have already forgotten it. Be aware of the different lengths of your different types of memory so you can review new information at the best times.)

The more knowledge you have, the easier it is to take in new knowledge because there’s more to connect it to. The techniques for memorization that Horsley describes are all based on associative learning. These techniques include the SEE method for remembering any information, as well as tips for organizing your memories and specific advice on how to remember lists through pegging information.

#### The SEE Method

To help you create such associations and make any piece of information easier to learn, Horsley recommends the SEE method. SEE stands for Senses, Exaggeration, and Energize. The SEE technique helps you make information more meaningful, and **meaningful information is easier to remember than meaningless information**. These three strategies can be used in any order, but Horsley recommends using all three for any piece of important information you want to remember.

**Senses** : Your five senses are your means of perceiving—and thus learning about—the world. Creating an association between information and your senses automatically makes it more memorable. You can use your senses to make sensory images in your mind that will make information more real and accessible to your brain. For example, say you’re trying to memorize musical terms like _forte_ , _allegro_ , and _octave_. _Forte_ means strong and loud, and a fort is a strong structure, so create a sensory image by picturing someone standing on top of a **fort** (visual image) yelling **loudly** (auditory image) to be heard from the ground.

**Exaggeration** : As you’re creating your sensory associations, make them ridiculous or illogical to make them stick in your memory better. It’s easier to remember a cat the size of a thimble than a regular-sized cat, for example, or to remember a man with a neon-green mustache than a man with a mustache of a regular color. Returning to our musical terms example: _Allegro_ means fast and lively and sounds like “leg,” so imagine a pair of **legs** **growing** comically long, like the size of skyscrapers, so they walk **faster**.

**Energize** : Once you have your exaggerated sensory images, animate them. Creating action in your images helps you turn them into a narrative, and it’s easier to remember action than nonaction. To illustrate this, consider our final musical term: octave. _Octave_ means a range of eight notes, and an octopus has eight tentacles, so imagine an **octopus** animatedly playing a piano and hitting eight notes at once.

> **Other Ways to Make Information Memorable**
> 
> In _A Mind for Numbers_ , Barbara Oakley echoes Horsley’s argument that information is easier to recall the more you’re able to connect it to existing information. Also like Horsley, she suggests that relating new information to your senses makes it more memorable, but she also identifies several other factors that make information easier to remember.
> 
> These factors include: 1) if it involves physically moving your body (this is distinct from Horsley’s _Energize_ tip because his technique relies on a mental image rather than actual movement), 2) if it makes you laugh (you might incorporate this into Horsley’s _Exaggeration_ tip by making your associations so extreme as to make them laughable), 3) if you write it down, 4) if you say it out loud, 5) if you link it to something spatial (which aligns with the next section in our guide, and 6) if it tells a story.
> 
> Others provide additional support for why turning information into a story makes it more memorable: In _Wired for Story_ , Lisa Cron explains that our brains are neurologically wired to retain information better if it’s told as a story because it helps us understand the world around us and make predictions that could help us survive. If someone could tell us a compelling story about how they escaped danger, we could use that information to avoid a similar danger in the future—provided it was presented in a memorable way.

#### Creating Organized Memories

Another associative technique that Horsley describes is organizing your memories so they’re easier to retain. He recommends strategies in which you associate new pieces of information with things you already know well. For example, imagine you’re trying to memorize the eight primary emotions according to Robert Plutchik: joy, sadness, fear, anger, anticipation, surprise, disgust, and trust. We’ll use a home as our reference point.

Since there are eight things we’re trying to remember, we’ll identify eight places in a typical home that we can associate each word with: the computer, television, closet, dryer, oven, refrigerator, trash can, and thermostat. Now you’ll use the SEE method to create a clear image you can associate with each emotion.

  * Imagine yourself happily scrolling through adorable cat pictures on social media, or gleefully purchasing a huge bouncy house online: Your **computer** represents **joy**. 
  * Think of the most heartbreaking movie or show you’ve ever seen and imagine yourself crying giant tears like a cartoon character: Your **television** represents **sadness**. 
  * Think about a huge, terrifying, growling monster hiding in your closet: Your **closet** represents **fear**. 
  * Imagine an angry little fairy getting tossed around and around in your dryer, getting more and more furious: Your **dryer** represents **anger**. 
  * Think about waiting excitedly in front of your oven for a big batch of cookies to finish baking: Your **oven** represents **anticipation**. 
  * Imagine yourself going to your refrigerator and finding it unexpectedly filled with flavorful, colorful dishes from many different cuisines. Your **refrigerator** represents **surprise**. 
  * Imagine going to your trash can and finding it overflowing with rotten food, smelling like a landfill. Your **trash can** represents **disgust**. 
  * Think about adjusting your thermostat, and imagine a giant thermometer with the temperature moving up and down. Consider how you don’t actually know the exact temperature of your home by any other means; you just have faith that the thermostat is correct. Your **thermostat** represents **trust**.



According to Horsley, **organizing knowledge as you take it in is the best way to learn and memorize it**. Every new piece of information you’re trying to memorize (the emotions) is being connected to information that’s already in your long-term memory (areas of your home).

This organizational technique involves a four-step process:

  1. Identify the organizational reference tool you want to use, such as your car, your body, a place you know well, or a journey or route. 
  2. Identify places in these reference tools where you can place associations. 
  3. Create distinctive images of each piece of information you’re learning using the SEE method. 
  4. Assign each piece of information to one of the places you identified in step 2.



(Shortform note: Horsley’s strategy for creating organized memory is commonly referred to as the _method of loci_ , or the _memory palace_ (among other names). This method has ancient roots in Greek practices, and even beyond into prehistory. It’s widely used by other memory champions like Dominic O’Brien (who memorized a sequence of 2,808 playing cards), Rajveer Meena (who memorized 70,000 digits of pi), and Katie Kermode (who memorized 224 names and faces in just 15 minutes). Its efficacy is also supported by scientific studies. The reason it works so well is that, like our memory for stories, our spatial memory was important to our early survival because it helped us remember safe spaces and other important locations.)

#### Remembering Lists and Numbers

Horsley also offers a specific associative technique to help you remember lists of items or terms. Horsley recommends the pegging method for remembering these. This involves **assigning meaningful words to numbers and then associating those words with each list item**. For example, if you want to remember the three states of matter—1) solid, 2) liquid, and 3) gas—you could use the following associations: “One” rhymes with “gun,” which is a solid object, so the first item on the list is “solid.” “Two” rhymes with “dew,” which is a liquid, so the second item on the list is “liquid.” “Three” rhymes with “breeze,” which refers to gases (like oxygen and carbon dioxide) in motion, so the third item on the list is “gas.”

You can make links based on the numbers’ physical shapes (like associating zero with an egg or eight with a pair of glasses) or based on words that rhyme with the numbers (like associating two with glue or nine with wine).

(Shortform note: This system requires making two separate lists: One list is for the numbers themselves and the words you’re associating them with (like “one” and “gun” or “zero” and “egg”), and the other list is the list you’re using this peg system to memorize (like the three states of matter, or whatever other concept you need to remember). However, you may only need to make the first list once, as you can reuse it as many times as you want to memorize additional content. As you’re first starting out, be sure to take in the information slowly, as it takes a while to get the hang of it—but the more you use it, the faster you’ll get.)

This technique works well for remembering numbered lists, but you can also use it to remember numbers themselves. Horsley uses a pegging system to associate numbers with consonant sounds based on how they look (vowel sounds are excluded from this and act as filler). He codes “one” as the “T” sound, for example, because the letter and the number look similar. He codes “two” as the “N” sound, “three” as the “M” sound, “four” as the “R” sound, and so on. Thus, if you needed to remember the number 124, you could remember it as the word “**t** u**n** e**r** ,” “toner,” or “tinier.” Thus, by turning numbers into words and sentences, you can remember as many numbers and number sequences as you need to.

(Shortform note: This number technique is a variation on the pegging system known as the _major system_. You can use this system to create pegs for just the numbers zero to nine or expand beyond that into double and even triple-digit numbers according to your needs. Some memory athletes use a set of 1,000 pegs so they can memorize very long numbers. You can adopt the traditional major system or make your own, and you can also use variations of this system to remember things like dates of events.)

### Practice: Hold on to What You’ve Learned

The attention and association techniques will help you remember things for a certain period of time, but in order to remember them forever, you need to **practice and review the information regularly until it’s fully committed to your long-term memory**.

According to Horsley, these reviews should take place at certain intervals to maximize your retention.**** First, review the information 10 minutes after you’ve learned it. For this first review, go through the information in the reverse order from which you learned it. This greatly strengthens your memory of the ideas.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that when your brain is first reviewing newly learned information, it does so in reverse. Thus, deliberately performing your first review in reverse might be particularly helpful because it taps into your brain’s natural learning process.)

Next, he recommends reviewing the information at the following intervals: one hour, one day, three days, one week, two weeks, three weeks, one month, two months, and finally three months. After that, Horsley says, the information will be permanently etched in your memory.

(Shortform note: It’s unclear what the best intervals for reviewing information are, and research suggests it depends on the timing of when you’ll need to retrieve it. If your goal is permanent memorization (meaning you want to be able to retrieve it indefinitely), find the interval system that works best for you.)

#### Make It a Daily Habit

Horsley writes that while these techniques can work for anyone, it’s not an easy process, and it won’t happen if you don’t commit to doing it. Making these techniques work requires you to devote yourself to improvement, which in turn requires discipline.

You need to **decide to practice them every day**. Consider what goal you want to achieve (you may have identified this in the first step when you developed your sense of direction), and commit to achieving that goal daily.

> **Developing Habits With Cues and Rewards**
> 
> In _A Mind for Numbers_ , Barbara Oakley suggests that you develop habits through the same mental processes you use for memorization and learning. By developing an association between a triggering stimulus (or cue) and the habit you want to form, you can quickly train yourself to remember to perform that habit. You can reinforce this association by giving yourself a reward every time you perform the habit in response to the cue.
> 
> For example, if you want to get into the daily habit of studying, identify something you do every day—such as watching television in the evenings—and use that as a cue to study. Then, after you’ve studied, you can reward yourself by watching television. At first, you’ll need to consciously remind yourself to study each night, but over time it will become an unconscious habit as your brain learns to associate that daily habit with the reward of watching television.
