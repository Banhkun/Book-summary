## 1-Page Summary

Do you want to become the master of your own mind? Do you struggle with thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that don’t align with your goals and aspirations? If so, Ryan A. Bush’s book _Designing the Mind_ can help. Bush provides a collection of strategies that will help you change the thought patterns, emotions, and behaviors that are holding you back into ones that help you become your best self. He argues that your thought patterns and emotional responses aren’t static, as many people believe—in reality, **you can “reprogram” your mind like a computer to create new, more favorable patterns of thinking.**

Bush is a designer whose work centers on creating a better future by improving systems and people. He’s worked in systems design for tech startups, creating everything from software to buildings, and he continues to pursue a lifelong passion for self-optimization. He created Designing the Mind, a self-development organization, to share knowledge from philosophy and psychology that people can use to take control of their minds. His other projects include Mindform, an online community and training platform with the same mission as Designing the Mind, and The Anxiety Algorithm, a 30-day program that helps you change your relationship with anxiety and stress.

In our guide, we’ll discuss:

  * Bush’s assertion that the mind is like a computer with software that can be adjusted to better suit your needs
  * How to rewrite faulty thought patterns
  * How to get rid of emotions that don’t serve you 
  * How to change your behavior so it aligns with your goals and values



(Shortform note: The author organizes the information in _Designing the Mind_ into three “realms,” which we’ll refer to as _levels_ in this guide: cognitive, emotional, and behavioral. This is arguably effective because each level builds on the previous one’s skills, creating a smooth progression from mental mastery, to emotional mastery, and, finally, to behavioral mastery.)

Our commentary will explore alternative methods for changing unwanted thought patterns, emotions, and behaviors. It’ll also provide a deeper look into some of the neurological and psychological phenomena behind Bush’s arguments.

### Background: Rewriting Your Mental Programs

According to Bush, you don’t have to accept your default mental processes as your unchanging reality—to be your best self, you _shouldn’t_. In this section, you’ll learn how you can shape your mind by treating your thought processes like computer algorithms that can be edited. We’ll also discuss how the brain is built to adapt and change, making this kind of conscious modification possible.

#### The Mind as a Computer

Bush argues that **the mind is like a computer, with immeasurable inputs and algorithms** that prompt the behaviors that make us who we are.

(Shortform note: To best understand Bush’s analogy, it’s important to have a baseline knowledge of computer processing. When we use a computer, we input data that trigger algorithms—formulas that are coded into the computer’s software. Algorithms provide step-by-step instructions, and the computer uses these instructions to execute commands that lead to the desired outputs, or results. For example, a search algorithm retrieves information from stored data based on search queries. Algorithms help us find the best solution for a problem consistently and efficiently.)

In our _minds_ , inputs are external stimuli—for instance, things we see, hear, or experience—that come from events in our daily lives. These inputs then trigger our “mental algorithms,” or thought patterns, which lead to outputs in the form of our feelings and actions.

**Sometimes, our default thought patterns don’t serve us.** They might be linked to biases and faulty assumptions that prompt undesirable emotions and behaviors, leading us to act counterproductively to our values and goals. Bush asserts, however, that you don’t have to maintain faulty thought patterns forever—since the mind functions like a computer, with the proper knowledge, you can alter your brain’s algorithms like an engineer designing computer software. When you learn to modify your mental algorithms, you can better control the nature of your outputs.

> **How Neuro-Associations Control Our Thoughts and Drive Our Behavior**
> 
> In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins also asserts the importance of “reprogramming” the brain to better control your actions, thoughts, and emotions. Rather than attributing problematic patterns to biases and faulty thinking, however, Robbins argues that they stem from subconscious, harmful neuro-associations.
> 
> How do these neuro-associations form, and what exactly _are_ they? According to Robbins, your neurons (brain cells) communicate by sending signals to each other via neural pathways, which are physical connections in your brain. Those neural pathways create neuro-associations—mental connections between certain concepts, experiences, and feelings—by linking your emotions about and sensations from a particular experience.**** As a result, your future thoughts about that activity or subject automatically trigger the same emotion. If an experience brought you pleasure, you’re likely to repeat it to trigger that pleasure again; if it brought you pain, you’ll avoid it in the future.
> 
> Not only do your neuro-associations influence all of your decisions—by motivating you to avoid pain and seek pleasure—but they’re also strong enough to withstand any logic that contradicts them. This means that your associations can drive you to engage in self-destructive behaviors and poor decision-making against logic and your better judgment. Furthermore, since neuro-associations are subconscious, you often can’t figure out _why_ you keep acting illogically.
> 
> Ultimately, if you don’t understand the power of pain and pleasure associations to motivate your every action, including your decisions, you can’t take control over your behavior. You’ll end up perpetually _reacting_ to things around you instead of _acting_ of your own will. Luckily, Robbins argues that you can rewrite your harmful neuro-associations, just as Bush argues you can reprogram your mind: Robbins suggests **creating new neural pathways and weakening the old ones.** To do this, you associate pain with your old, disempowering behavior and pleasure with a new, healthier habit.

##### Shortform Example: Change a Faulty Thought Pattern to Change Your Response

Let’s look at an example of a faulty thought pattern that you can change to alter its resultant emotions and behaviors. Say there’s an open position at a company you really want to work for. You apply for the job, but you don’t get it—this is the input. This input then triggers a negative thought pattern: You tell yourself that you weren’t smart enough for the job, and you assume you did poorly in the interview. This thought pattern prompts the undesirable emotional outputs of frustration, anxiety, and embarrassment. Additionally, you respond to the setback unproductively by avoiding future job applications.

Using Bush’s tools (which we’ll discuss further in later sections), you could experience the same thing—not getting hired for a job you want—and change your response by modifying your thought patterns. Instead of assuming that you did something wrong in the application process, you might recognize that you just weren’t the right person for that particular position. Maybe the company already had someone in mind and they were just interviewing outside candidates as a formality.

With these altered thought patterns, you might still feel some disappointment, but you won’t experience the previously intense negative emotions about yourself and your capabilities. Likewise, your experience won’t stop you from applying for other jobs in the future or seeking feedback that could help you improve.

> **Is the Brain Really a Computer?**
> 
> Bush isn’t the first person to compare the brain to a computer as a framework for understanding how the mind works—researchers have been using this analogy for decades. Today, the question of whether or not we should view the brain as a complex computer is at the heart of a fierce debate.
> 
> Some experts claim that the metaphor is limiting insights on the cutting edge of neuroscience more than it’s aiding them. They poke holes in the metaphor, pointing out ways in which the brain behaves unlike a computer and arguing that such inaccuracies will lead researchers to misguided assumptions.
> 
> On the other hand, other experts argue that the brain-as-computer metaphor remains useful. In their eyes, it doesn’t matter if the brain doesn’t act like a computer. Like Bush, they believe that what matters is that **the brain accomplishes many of the same functions as computers do:** It intakes, processes, and exports information. In their view, the fact that your brain computes makes it a computer.

#### The Malleable Nature of the Brain

Scientifically speaking, how is it possible for us to make the large-scale changes to our minds that Bush recommends? **Bush argues that the brain’s malleability—which neuroscientists call _neuroplasticity_ —has evolutionary roots.** Our ancestors frequently had to adapt to changing conditions, so their brains also had to restructure and adjust to support their survival. Even today, by default, we’re constantly creating new neural pathways through our experiences—pathways that are strengthened or weakened as we learn and practice different thought processes and behaviors.

(Shortform note: We experience the evolutionarily-rooted benefits of neuroplasticity starting in infancy, and it continues to help us throughout our lives. As Bush states, neuroplasticity allows us to learn new things and improve our cognitive abilities, but that isn’t all it does: It also helps us recover from trauma like strokes and traumatic brain injuries, moving important functions to undamaged areas of the brain when functions in damaged areas are lost. To actively improve your brain’s plasticity, stimulate it with challenging activities that require focus, like reading or learning a new language. Additionally, incorporate novel experiences into your life, like traveling to new places. Finally, get plenty of sleep and exercise regularly.)

To modify your mind and harness neuroplasticity _with intention_ , Bush notes, **start by studying your current thought patterns.** What kind of judgments do you make about different situations, places, and people? Consider your mental processes like an outside observer, with the recognition that they don’t represent objective truth. This exercise is called _metacognition_ , or developing an awareness and understanding of your own thought processes.

(Shortform note: In _The Happiness Trap_ , Russ Harris describes the process of metacognition in terms of two selves: the thinking self and the observing self. Harris argues that the thinking self provides a judgmental, running commentary on events, while the observing self neutrally observes this commentary. When you can distinguish what your thinking self thinks from reality, your observing self can recognize your thoughts as mere stories your brain tells you to help you survive, rather than objective truth. You’re no longer controlled by your thoughts, and you only listen to them when they’re useful to you.)

Mindfulness practices like breath-focused meditation can be a great starting point for developing metacognition since they allow you to pay attention to your thoughts and feelings without judgment. (Shortform note: If you’re unfamiliar with mindfulness and don’t know where to start, consider joining a meditation group in your community to learn more about the practices that are available. Additionally, you can find many different mindfulness resources on YouTube or through wellness apps like Calm.)

In the rest of this guide, we’ll discuss specific strategies you can use to rewrite your default programming on three levels: thought patterns, emotional responses, and behaviors.

### Level 1: Adjusting Your Thought Patterns

According to Bush, **the first level of mental programming you need to address to become your ideal self is your thought patterns and beliefs.** Having faulty beliefs will make it difficult to master the other aspects of your mind because your choices, feelings, and behaviors all stem from what you believe.

(Shortform note: Many psychologists agree with Bush’s assertion that our mindsets and beliefs play a huge role in how we experience the world. They even suggest that what we believe we’re capable of becomes our reality. For example, research conducted on intelligence mindsets in students showed that students with a growth mindset—the belief that their intelligence could improve with practice and attention—showed a marked improvement in their academic performance over time. In contrast, students with a fixed mindset—the belief that nothing they could do would change their level of intelligence—didn’t show improvement.)

In this section, you’ll learn how biases and the false beliefs they can trigger harmfully distort your thinking patterns, as well as how to rewrite your biased thoughts into more beneficial patterns.

#### The Problem With Biases and False Beliefs

The author asserts that **the ultimate goal of improving your thought patterns is to develop a perception of reality that’s as close to the truth as possible.** One of the main challenges to achieving this goal is the prevalence of cognitive biases that distort our beliefs and perceptions. Cognitive biases are snap judgments we make about ourselves, others, and the world around us that are often based on false premises.

In basic terms, a biased thinking process looks like this: We receive some type of input, and instead of this prompting an accurate thought pattern, our thoughts in response to the input are distorted by a bias. The distorted thought pattern then leads to false beliefs and unfavorable actions based on those false beliefs. False beliefs can be highly problematic, especially when we have a lot of them that link together into a belief system that distorts our entire worldview.

For example, racial biases—assumptions about groups of people based on their race or ethnicity—lead to discriminatory behavior and inequalities. These faulty thought patterns shape people’s views of how others should be treated. The patterns allow people to justify harmful actions and inequities they would otherwise condemn because they believe the racial group they’re biased against somehow deserves the poor treatment.

(Shortform note: Bush primarily frames cognitive biases as detrimental since they introduce inaccurate beliefs and assumptions that distort people’s entire worldviews. However, some people argue that biases are neither wholly good nor wholly bad: In the right circumstances, they can be helpful. For example, having a bias toward favoring the medical advice of doctors over advice from people with no medical training can keep you safe and save you time researching treatments. Then, if someone like a celebrity or other public figure uses their influence to promote false and potentially dangerous medical information, you’ll be inclined to listen to licensed medical professionals instead.)

##### Why Do Biases Exist?

Though they often get us into trouble, **biases are likely so prevalent because they conserve energy.** Our brains are confronted with a constant flow of information and choices, and it would be overwhelming and fatiguing to thoroughly process them all. Biases save us energy by prompting snap judgments about people, places, and things—even if they’re often inaccurate. These faulty assumptions are then integrated into our belief systems and thought patterns, leading us to rely on the same incorrect biases again and again.

> **Information Overload in the Digital Age**
> 
> Neuroscience research supports Bush’s idea that our brains can only handle a limited amount of information at a time. When we’re presented with too much information in a short period, we experience overwhelm and decision fatigue. This has become more prevalent in the digital age, when unprecedented access to technology has substantially increased our risk of information overload. Confronted with the continuous stream of information from our smartphones and computers, our brains are in a perpetual state of distraction and multitasking.
> 
> This overwhelm has significant physiological consequences: Multitasking leads to increases in adrenaline, a hormone associated with the fight-or-flight response, and cortisol, a hormone associated with stress. Additionally, the brain becomes overstimulated, entering a depleted state.
> 
> The overwhelm also results in poor decision-making based on thought patterns that don’t serve us. Since we make countless inconsequential, small decisions throughout the day based on the information we encounter, we have less energy to make more important decisions. Thus, we rely more on mental shortcuts like biases to assess situations and lighten our cognitive load.

##### Bias Example: Availability Bias and the Fear of Flying

Bush touches on many different cognitive biases, including availability bias. While under the influence of availability bias, our brains rely on the most immediate or prominent examples—rather than the best, most accurate examples—when making assessments and decisions.

For example, the fear of flying (and, more specifically, the fear of being in a plane crash) can be traced to availability bias. We see coverage of plane crashes in the news and on social media that uses images and personal stories to provoke an emotional response in us. Emotions create strong associations in the brain, so going forward, when we think of flying, we think of these tragedies. Using these examples, we make the assessment that flying is dangerous and will likely lead to a crash. In truth, we’re _statistically_ very unlikely to experience a plane crash. However, our brains don’t develop as strong of an attachment to data, so stories of crashes are more readily available in our minds. Thus, we develop an irrational fear of flying.

(Shortform note: We commonly use availability bias as a cognitive shortcut to make quick decisions, but what determines how well we remember different pieces of information (and thus, which information we rely on when using this bias)? For one, we recall events we witnessed ourselves better than information we heard secondhand. Additionally, we remember novel incidents like plane crashes better than common occurrences like uneventful flights.)

#### How to Overcome Your Biases

According to Bush, **to more accurately perceive reality, you need to actively work to eliminate your biases.** This can be a difficult process because we typically struggle to see our own biases, even when we can recognize them in other people. Despite this, it’s possible with study and practice.

(Shortform note: The inability to recognize our own biases comes from a psychological phenomenon called naive realism: an egocentric bias in which we believe that our perception of reality represents objective truth. Thus, we assume that any perspective that contradicts our own is biased. Theoretically, as children develop and learn logical reasoning skills, their naive realism diminishes. In practice, however, many people are still limited by this bias into adulthood. This can lead to strong divisions over anything from debates among friends about the merits of a TV show to widespread conflicts over differing political views.)

Let’s explore three ways to overcome biases: through mindfulness, self-study, and reflection.

##### Practice #1: Use Mindfulness to Overcome Biases

As we mentioned earlier, mindfulness practice can be a good way to start building awareness of your cognitive processes, including your biases. According to Bush, it allows you to focus your attention on patterns of thinking that would otherwise be automatic.

> **Specific Practices for Using Mindfulness to Reduce Bias**
> 
> Mindfulness helps you cultivate conscious awareness of yourself and the world around you, encouraging nonjudgmental observation and a commitment to regular introspection. As Bush suggests, this introspection may make identifying your personal biases and behavioral patterns easier as you get to know yourself better. Here are three mindfulness practices you can use to recognize your biases and change your biased behavior:
> 
> **1) Practice being aware of your emotions.** Negative emotions that we often shy away from—like judgment, apathy, and fear—can be important indicators of biased thoughts and impulses.
> 
> **2) Separate your sense of self from negative thought patterns.** Mindfulness involves decentering your thoughts and emotions and recognizing that they don’t always represent the truth. When you recognize that your biased thoughts are temporary and not necessarily a reflection of who you are, you can more objectively examine them.
> 
> **3) Use a loving-kindness meditation.** The Buddhist practice of loving-kindness involves wishing yourself, your loved ones, your enemies, and finally the whole world well. This meditation increases feelings of connectedness, and research shows that it substantially decreases unconscious bias toward marginalized groups.

##### Practice #2: Use Self-Study to Overcome Biases

Bush also advises learning about the most common biases so you can begin recognizing them in yourself. Study them using multiple sources, and familiarize yourself with the situations that normally trigger them.

(Shortform note: Bush suggests self-studying cognitive biases as a way to begin overcoming them, but if you want a little more structure in your learning, consider taking a course on the topic. There are many online options on platforms like Udemy, and some universities also offer cognitive bias courses.)

##### Practice #3: Use Reflection to Overcome Biases

Once you identify a bias _you_ have, Bush advises trying to notice every situation that triggers it. Instead of acting based on your biased thinking, pause to reflect. Consciously create an alternative, unbiased thought pattern and act based on this new pattern. The more often you do this for the same type of situation, the more intuitive your new thought pattern will become. Eventually, it’ll replace the biased thought pattern entirely.

> **Strategies for Recognizing and Overcoming Unhelpful Thought Patterns**
> 
> How can you recognize your biases and identify new thought patterns to take their place? One way to identify problematic thought patterns is by cultivating curiosity in everything you do—examine your thoughts about different situations, and ask yourself why you’re responding in a certain way.
> 
> Using curiosity, you can observe your thoughts nonjudgmentally. The curious mindset also helps you to accept that there are multiple ways of thinking about a situation—instead of staying stuck in one thought pattern, ask yourself, “What’s another way to interpret what’s just happened?”
> 
> If you’ve identified an unhelpful thought pattern but you’re having trouble thinking of a healthier alternative, consider asking someone else for their input, such as a therapist or a trusted friend. When you’re stuck, hearing someone else’s perspective can help you see the situation in a new light.

##### Bias Example: Rewriting Confirmation Bias

As Bush mentions, one well-known and universal cognitive bias is confirmation bias. When under its influence, **we place a disproportionately high value and strong focus on information that confirms our existing beliefs** while ignoring or denying information that contradicts those beliefs. An example of a triggering situation for confirmation bias might be reading an article that represents an opposing opinion on a political issue that’s important to you: You might immediately dismiss it as illogical, irrelevant, or further confirmation that the other side doesn’t know what they’re talking about.

Confirmation bias can limit your exposure to new information and ideas, preventing important growth and change. Therefore, it’s useful to identify and reduce this bias in yourself.

> **Strategies for Overcoming Confirmation Bias**
> 
> To reduce the influence of confirmation bias on your beliefs, always consider the credibility of the source you’re reading—what might their agenda be? Where do they get their information, and is the evidence they’re using to support their points legitimate? What is the article _actually_ trying to say? If you can answer these questions for every article you read (including those that support your current beliefs), you’ll be able to better determine the quality of the information.
> 
> In the future, before settling on a final opinion about an issue, read articles from different sources and different perspectives and keep an open mind to ideas you don’t immediately agree with. This will help you move past the limitations of confirmation bias, and it’ll give you a more objective framework for evaluating arguments on any issue.

### Level 2: Conquering Your Emotions

The next level of mental programming Bush suggests you work on is conquering your emotions. He argues that understanding and altering your emotional responses must come next because **emotions, more than anything else, drive us to act.** If you have a poor emotional reaction to a situation, then your behavioral response will likely do more harm than good. (For example, most of us have said or done something in anger that we regretted once we calmed down.) If you learn to modulate your emotional responses, you can more easily change your behavior for the better.

(Shortform note: Emotions are great motivators toward action because of how we evolved to survive—many emotions come from the amygdala, the part of the brain that processes fearful or threatening stimuli. When we see something that appears dangerous—like an aggressive animal, for example—emotions like fear prompt the fight-or-flight response, which physiologically prepares our bodies to deal with the danger by facing or fleeing it. This isn’t always useful in today’s world when we have strong emotional responses to things that aren’t truly a threat to us, like public speaking or job interviews. Bush’s strategies for redirecting unhelpful emotions could be especially useful in those cases.)

In this section, we’ll discuss where our emotions come from. We’ll also explore Bush’s method of using rational thinking to get rid of undesirable emotions.

#### Where Our Emotional Responses Come From

To begin controlling your emotions, Bush notes, you have to first understand how they form. **Your rational thought processes mediate your emotional responses:** Instead of responding with an emotion directly after you experience a stimulus (like an interaction with another person or a piece of news you receive), there’s a thought pattern in between the two that determines how you feel about the stimulus. Usually, if you judge that the outcome of the stimulus is desirable, you’ll experience positive emotions. If you judge that the outcome isn’t what you wanted, you’ll experience negative emotions.

> **How to Identify the Source of Unexpected Emotions**
> 
> Bush argues that emotions always stem from our thoughts, but what about situations when we feel an emotion and can’t pinpoint any thoughts or triggers that could’ve caused it? Sometimes, our brains trigger emotions unconsciously. Neurological studies show that the human brain picks up on a lot of information in our environment without our conscious awareness, meaning that we may unconsciously notice things that then inspire confusing emotional responses.
> 
> If you experience an emotion and can’t figure out where it came from, ask yourself the following questions:
> 
>   * Were the preceding events surprising or gratifying?
> 
>   * Will what happened stand in the way of what I want, or will it help me achieve it?
> 
>   * How much control do I have over what happens next?
> 
>   * Do the events align with my belief in what’s right and what’s wrong?
> 
>   * Were the preceding events my fault or someone else’s?
> 
> 

> 
> Studies show that thought patterns that prompt strong emotions typically answer these types of questions. As Bush asserts, if your answers to these questions work in your favor, you’ll probably experience positive emotions. If not, you’ll experience negative feelings.

#### How to Change Your Emotional Responses

Bush states that **you can change your emotional responses by reevaluating how you think about situations that cause undesirable emotions.** Start by keeping a log of every undesirable emotion you experience. As you name each emotion, also write down the situation that triggered it and any thoughts you had before you felt it.

(Shortform note: In addition to logging your emotions and their triggers, consider writing down your physical experiences of different feelings. Emotions don’t just happen in your mind—they prompt physiological responses in your cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, skeletomuscular, and autonomic nervous systems. For example, you might feel hot and flushed when you’re angry, or you might feel nauseated and weak when you’re anxious. Logging when these physical sensations occur can help you pinpoint connections between feelings and events, and they can indicate how strong a feeling is.)

Over time, Bush notes, you’ll start to see patterns in the kinds of situations and lines of reasoning that lead to negative emotions: For instance, maybe almost every time you feel sadness, the emotion is preceded by self-deprecating thoughts. Once you’ve identified some of your patterns, you can start to rewrite them. Analyze the faulty thoughts and beliefs that lead to each undesirable emotion and come up with rebuttals for them. This will prevent the undesirable emotion from triggering. As you practice identifying and challenging the reasoning behind undesirable emotions, you’ll get better at moving past them.

> **Replacing Negative Thought Patterns vs. Ignoring Negative Thought Patterns**
> 
> As Bush argues, redirecting negative thought patterns and replacing them with positive ones can help you overcome emotions that don’t serve you. Some people might confuse this with thought stopping—actively watching for and banishing negative thoughts—but there’s an important distinction between these two practices.
> 
> While challenging and redirecting negative thoughts _acknowledges_ the negative thoughts and helps you identify alternative perspectives, thought stopping is when you attempt to _ignore_ negative thought patterns entirely. This doesn’t work—when you suppress a thought instead of addressing it, it’ll most likely resurface even stronger, along with all of its accompanying emotions. Instead of ignoring your negative thought patterns, approach them mindfully by recognizing them without judging them.

##### Faulty Reasoning Example: Your Friend Cancels on You

Let’s examine an example of how to deal with destructive emotions that are based on faulty reasoning. Say you have plans to go out with your friend, but they cancel at the last minute. They apologize and say that they’re just too busy at work, and you say it’s not a problem. Still, you’re left feeling frustrated and a little anxious. Instead of letting these unpleasant emotions inform your next interaction with your friend, you take a moment to understand where the feelings are coming from.

Right when you got your friend’s text, you had the thought, “If they’re canceling this late, they must be avoiding me because they’re upset with me.” You tried to think of anything you could have done to offend them, and when you couldn’t come up with anything, you felt frustrated with them and defensive. You also felt anxious because you don’t want to be in conflict with them.

To get rid of these unproductive emotions, you find a rebuttal for your faulty thought patterns: Your friend has shown no other signs of being upset with you, and they previously told you how busy they’ve been at work long before they canceled. They were also adamant about rescheduling your get-together. This rebuttal soothes your anxiety and frustration—you realize that you don’t have to feel defensive _or_ insecure because your friend’s choice is unrelated to your relationship with them.

### Level 3: Mastering Your Behavior

In the previous two sections, you learned how to change faulty, bias-driven thought patterns and get rid of unhelpful emotions. In this section, you’ll learn how to implement Bush’s final level of self-mastery: control over your behavior and actions. We’ll examine his assertion that you should direct your behavior toward values-based goals, along with his strategies for changing your behavioral habits.

#### Self-Control and Following Your Goals

According to Bush, **you should strive to gain as much control over your behavior and actions as possible.** People who have a high level of self-control experience a collection of benefits, including a healthier lifestyle, more stable finances, more successful relationships, and a generally better state of mental and physical health.

> **The Virtuous Cycle of Self-Control and Healthy Living**
> 
> While having a high level of self-control can contribute to a healthier life and create the benefits Bush lists, having a healthier lifestyle can also increase self-control, creating a virtuous cycle. For example, getting good-quality sleep is important for brain health, and brain health highly affects our behavior—when we’re feeling tired and stressed, we tend to make poor decisions rather than maintaining strict self-control.
> 
> Further, studies show that sleep deprivation specifically affects the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. These parts of the brain regulate emotions and logical reasoning respectively, so poor sleep leaves you less able to control your thoughts or emotions. Since Bush argues that you have to master mental and emotional control before developing behavioral self-control, to make it to Level 3 of his framework, it’s important to get good sleep.

##### Base Goals On Your Values

To reach a successful state, **you have to specifically direct your behavior toward _achieving your goals_.** Bush argues you should base your goals on your _values_.

(Shortform note: In _The Success Principles,_ Jack Canfield expands on the idea of using goals to shape your behavior, arguing that you should act as if you’ve already achieved your goals. This will help you attract and recognize opportunities and people that will bring you closer to completing them. To determine how specifically you should act, ask yourself the following questions: How would you feel when you achieve your goals? How would you think? How would you talk? What would you wear? Additionally, try modeling the behaviors of successful people, like self-confidence and comfort with taking risks.)

Before we explain how to set values-based goals, let’s explore what values actually _are_. Values start as your intuitions about the perceived “goodness” and “badness” of different actions and consequences. When you have the same intuitions about what’s good and bad over and over, you get a sense of your ideal traits, such as kindness, courage, or honesty. The collection of these ideals becomes your value system, which represents your ideal self and the traits you want to embody. Embodying your values will bring you fulfillment and success.

> **How to Define Your Values When You Struggle to Intuit Them**
> 
> Discovering your values might be hard if you're not in touch with your intuition. If you’re in this situation but you still want to gain the benefits of clarifying your values (increased success and fulfillment), you'll first need to take extra action to identify your values _consciously_.
> 
> Start by reviewing a list of core values—like wisdom, loyalty, and kindness—and write down the ones that resonate with you. Additionally, think about the people you admire most and the qualities they represent, and write down these qualities too. For example, you might admire a family member for their generosity.
> 
> Once you have a list of values you feel represent you, group them into categories. For instance, if you wrote down kindness, generosity, and empathy, you might make a group of values centered around helping others. These groups can help you identify major themes in your value system and figure out what matters most to you.

##### Values vs. Desires

Bush warns that **values shouldn’t be confused with desires.** Desires represent the things we want and crave—like a fancy new phone or expensive concert tickets—but they aren’t necessarily the things that will make us happy. Often, when we acquire the object of our desire, it doesn’t make us feel as good as we thought it would, leaving us unsatisfied. Desires also invite loss into our lives—we feel good when we obtain something we want, but we suffer when we inevitably lose it since everything’s impermanent.

(Shortform note: As Bush states, greater desire often invites greater dissatisfaction. Unfortunately, our modern consumer culture depends on us desiring things. Every year, companies spend billions of dollars on advertising that entices us to spend more on items we desire. Then, we desire more money to keep spending, and our dissatisfaction increases. Research shows that people in countries with greater wealth—and thus a more robust consumer culture—are often unhappier than people in poorer countries. To break the cycle of consumerism and desire, focus on appreciating and taking care of what you already have. Additionally, look to the truly important things for fulfillment, like the people you love or activities you enjoy.)

Even though they rarely contribute to our long-term happiness, Bush notes, desires are often more powerful than values. Our brains are designed to follow desires without question—the feel-good chemical dopamine (which is tied to desire) pushes us toward action with the promise that we’ll receive a reward once we get what we want. In contrast, values are steady and ever-present, but they’re also easier to ignore.

> **How to Reduce Your Dependence on Instant Gratification**
> 
> Desires are more powerful than values because fulfilling them brings an immediate reward—dopamine—and we’re hardwired to seek instant gratification. It’s much harder for us to conceptualize and make decisions based on an intangible future reward, which is what following our values brings.
> 
> That being said, delaying gratification is a skill we can practice and learn. One strategy for doing so is using commitment devices, or circumstances that you set up to remove temptation. For example, say you want to spend more time reading because you value having a wide breadth of knowledge. Still, you’re struggling to achieve your goal because you often pick up your phone and spend hours scrolling through social media instead of reading, since it gives you an instant hit of dopamine. To help you commit to your values-based reading goal, consider putting your phone in another room while you read or deleting the social media app from your phone.

##### How to Set Values-Based Goals

Bush describes a values-oriented framework you can use to design your goals. As representatives of your ideal self, your values should be at the top of your goal framework, meaning that your goals should always bring you closer to them in some way. Then, use reason and logic to determine the best methods for achieving those goals. Finally, let your desires drive you to take action toward your goals.

For example, say you strongly value independence. To become closer to your ideal self as an independent person, you make a lofty, value-driven goal to be your own boss someday. Instead of quitting your job right away, though, you use logic to make a plan that will allow you to save enough money to open a business of your own. Finally, you allow your desires—like wanting comfort and security, wanting a flexible schedule, and so on—to push you to take the steps necessary to make the plan a success.

(Shortform note: Keeping your goals centered on your values first _before_ logic and desires works well because it helps you focus not only on _what_ you want but _why_ you want it. In other words, values-based goals give you purpose, direction, and motivation since they align so closely with what you truly want and who you truly are. This means that, in addition to helping you achieve self-mastery, values-based goals might actually make you healthier—recent studies show that a sense of purpose can have important health benefits. Having a strong sense of purpose can counteract the effects of chronic stress and protect the body against inflammation. Additionally, high levels of purpose reduce activity in the amygdala, making you less emotionally reactive.)

#### How to Change Your Habits

Along with aligning your behavior toward values-based goals, Bush asserts that **eliminating and replacing bad habits is another way to take control of your behavior.** Good habits are behavioral patterns that push you toward your goals, while bad ones take you away from your goals.

(Shortform note: Although bad habits push us farther from our goals, they’re often behaviors that make us feel good in the short term. Because, as previously noted, we seek instant gratification over long-term results, bad habits often seem more appealing than many good habits that require us to put in more work. Generally, habits are so hard to break because they’re formed in a part of our brain that’s out of our conscious control, leaving us mostly unaware that we’re engaging in them.)

Bush describes two strategies you can use to redirect your behavior and form more beneficial habits:

##### Strategy #1: Keep Track of Your Habits

According to Bush, **just keeping track of your habits can sometimes be enough to break bad ones.** To change your behavior, you have to first understand and analyze your current patterns, which this strategy promotes.

Start by writing a list of habits you want to have and habits you don’t want. For example, maybe you want to cook five nights a week and take your dog for a walk every morning, but you also want to stop biting your nails and procrastinating on your email responses. Once you have your list, keep a record of how many times you do each habitual behavior per week. You’ll see how much of a hold bad habits have on your time, and you can then take the steps necessary to break them.

(Shortform note: When trying to change your habits, Jack Canfield also argues that you should start by identifying old habits you want to change and new habits you want to implement. In _The Success Principles_ , he expands on this strategy: He suggests narrowing things down and focusing on changing just four habits every year. Studies show that it takes about 13 weeks to establish a new habit, so you can learn a new one every quarter. Start by listing your four bad habits and explaining why they’re potentially harmful. Then, identify a new behavior to replace the old one. Finally, create a plan with specific steps that will help you implement the new habits, and focus on one plan per quarter.)

##### Strategy #2: State How You Plan to Spend Your Time in Advance

According to Bush, **you can create a new, positive habit by setting clear intentions and goals for enacting it.** We’re often too vague when trying to implement a new behavior—without a specific plan, we’re much less likely to follow through. This is because we have to use more willpower and make more decisions when the time comes for us to actually engage in the new behavior. If you have a plan beforehand, that mental work is already done for you.

When planning a new habit, express the following in specific terms:

  * The behavior you want to implement
  * The exact time and day you’ll implement it
  * The location where you’ll implement it



For example, instead of saying to yourself, “I want to walk my dog more,” say “I want to take my dog for a half-hour-long walk every morning at 7:00 am in the park.”

(Shortform note: After planning out the details of your habit (and thus eliminating the risk that you’ll succumb to decision fatigue), you can further increase your likelihood of success by visualizing yourself enacting the plan. In _Organize Tomorrow Today_ , Jason Selk, Tom Bartow, and Matthew Rudy describe how visualization prepares your mind and body for an action before you really take it. It allows you to rehearse what you want to happen, meaning that by the time you have to do the action you visualized, you’ll feel more prepared for potential challenges and surprises. Therefore, if you picture yourself doing the behavior at the time and in the place you planned, you’ll be more likely to succeed when you actually implement it.)
