## Chapter 5: Capture

**In early 1944, one of Corrie’s operatives, a man named Jop, was captured by the Gestapo**. Rolf warned Corrie that this likely signaled the beginning of the end for her rescue operation—the Germans would get information out of Jop one way or the other that was almost certain to result in the arrest and capture of everyone involved. Corrie had been concerned about the growth of her operation for some time and how difficult and complex it had become to maintain it. With a network of dozens of people delivering supplies and information, only one domino needed to fall for the whole operation to collapse.

### February 28, 1944

On the morning of February 28, 1944, Corrie was in bed, sick with the flu and flushed with fever. As she opened her fluttering eyelids, she thought she saw Eusie and two of the other fugitives scrambling into the hiding place. Dismissing it as a fever dream (they hadn’t planned a drill for that day), she drifted off back to sleep.

Suddenly, officers burst into Corrie’s room, interrogating her exactly as Kik and Rolf had said they would. The practice had paid dividends. When they asked where the Jews were hiding, Corrie feigned ignorance and claimed she had no idea what they were talking about. As the officers brought her downstairs, Corrie witnessed a scene of absolute chaos unfolding at the Beje. Gestapo officers were ransacking the house and the watch shop, tearing them apart as they looked for Jews.

**Corrie and Betsie were savagely beaten during the home interrogation, as the Gestapo attempted to force a confession**. Betsie, characteristically, later said she felt sorry for the officers who had hurt her, that they were so devoid of God’s love as to behave this way. All the while, Corrie was terrified for the six Jews hiding behind the false wall in her room—although they had successfully made it to the hiding place, surely it was just a matter of time before they were discovered.

She was also horrified to discover that the Gestapo had extensive knowledge about the workings of her operation and even knew about her warning signal. The officers falsely placed the “all clear” triangle in the sign to lure more conspirators into the Beje for interrogation, torture, and arrest.

In the course of their ransacking, the officers tore the walls of the Beje apart with sledgehammers in their search for the hiding Jews while Corrie and Betsie sat and listened, bloodied and helpless. Although the six fugitives were not discovered during the course of the raid, the arresting officer vowed to Corrie that he would post a permanent guard at the Beje to wait until the six emerged from wherever they were hiding.

After hours of brutality at the hands of the Gestapo, **the ten Booms—Corrie, Betsie, and Casper, in addition to Willem, Nollie, and Peter—were loaded into a van and hauled off to the local Haarlem police station.** On the night of the German invasion in 1940, Corrie had had an awful premonition of her family being carted away through the streets of Haarlem on their way to an unknown and terrifying destination—now, this dark vision was being fulfilled.

The ten Booms were placed in a small holding cell together while they awaited whatever fate lay in store for them. Peter advised Corrie to lie down and not say anything, lest she betray any information to one of the Gestapo plants in the cell with them. At last, Rolf arrived at the station. Still operating as an ordinary Haarlem police officer and undetected by the occupation authorities, Rolf discreetly told Willem that he would be able to flush any incriminating documents or evidence down the toilet.

**In their hour of need, the family turned to what had always sustained them in dark times—their Christian faith**. As they waited in the dank cell in the Haarlem jail, Casper recited from memory Psalm 119:114, “Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.”

### In Custody

**The family was transported by bus that afternoon to the Duch city of The Hague for processing and further questioning**. There were other prisoners loaded onto the bus, including the bloodied and bruised Pickwick. They arrived at an administrative building, the Gestapo headquarters for The Netherlands. Due to his advanced age, the authorities offered to release Casper and allow him to return home to the Beje. But Casper ten Boom refused this offer of mercy, telling the Germans that he would never close his door to anyone seeking help—if he went home, he would simply continue hiding fugitives. Even the Nazi terror could not rob Casper of his humanity.

**After being processed and registered by the Gestapo, the family was transported to the federal prison at Scheveningen**. First, the female prisoners were separated from the men, and then Corrie was separated from her sisters. Corrie was at last placed in a cell with several other women. She made her way to a filthy cot, where she managed to fall asleep sick, hungry, and miserable.

The boredom and lack of stimulation in the prison was unbearable. The women spent their days entirely within the cramped walls of the cell, only interrupted by the delivery of meager and barely edible portions of food. After talking with her cellmates, Corrie was dismayed to discover that several of the women had been imprisoned for as long as three years in the cell. While Corrie languished, she tried to block out the thought of what had become of the Jews in the hiding place. She couldn’t bear to confront the idea that they had been captured.

### The Gospels

Despite the occasional distractions, pastimes, and the company of her cellmates,**Corrie’s flu grew worse under these conditions of malnourishment and lack of access to proper medical care**. Two weeks after her arrival at Scheveningen, Corrie was taken to the prison hospital.

When she was being admitted to the hospital, a nurse surreptitiously asked Corrie if there was anything she could do to help her. Astonished by this unexpected display of kindness, Corrie asked her if she would be able to procure a needle and thread, soap, toothbrush, and, most importantly of all, a Bible. The nurse told Corrie that she would see what she could do.

The doctors diagnosed Corrie with pre-tuberculosis. When she got back to the waiting room, the nurse covertly pressed a small package into Corrie’s hand as she walked by. When Corrie returned to her cell, she eagerly opened the package. To her delight, **the package contained two bars of prewar soap; a packet of safety pins; and the four Gospels, in four small, separate booklets**. Corrie, characteristically, distributed the goods among her cellmates, but they refused to accept the Gospels. The veteran prisoners told Corrie that there would be severe consequences for anyone caught with them. Their sentences would be doubled and they would receive _kalte kost_ —bread rations with no hot food. But Corrie was willing to take this risk, for there could be no more precious gift than having access to the holy word.

### Solitary

Two nights later, the guards called Corrie to come out of the cell. She was brought deeper and deeper into the prison, where she was finally escorted into a cell. There were no other inmates with her. **She had been placed in solitary confinement.**

The conditions were even worse than in her first cell. The cot was revolting, and it was clear that someone had recently vomited on it. She wondered why she had been put in solitary. Had they found out about the contraband the nurse had smuggled in for her? Had the Jews in the hiding place been found? How long would she be in here?

The days became a monotonous hell. The fever with which she had entered Scheveningen grew worse under these conditions. The only care she received was from a medical trustee who would deliver her some mysterious yellow medicine administered from a filthy bottle. In all these interactions, Corrie begged for word of her family, especially her father, but no one would share information with her.

Corrie’s only source of comfort was a small window, from which she could see a small piece of sky. Occasionally, when the wind blew the right way, she could hear the sea. Gradually, her health returned, despite the inhumane conditions and grossly inadequate medical care. The Gospels provided her with the spiritual nourishment she needed.

**In these agonizing circumstances, Corrie was reminded of Christ’s suffering**. She remembered that Jesus had also suffered loss and defeat, far worse than what she and her group and that Beje had suffered—but He had ultimately triumphed and redeemed all mankind. She took comfort in this knowledge, and saw that her faith would be rewarded—for Christ’s love would conquer all.

### Secret Communication

Corrie kept track of time by using an improvised knife (made from a corset pin she had sharpened against the cement floor) to scratch a calendar on the wall of her cell. On April 15, 1944, a month after entering solitary confinement, Corrie marked her 52nd birthday.

Two days later, on April 17, Corrie was taken to the shower room to bathe for the first time in weeks. There, to her delight, were other women, brought there for the same purpose. Although she did not see her sisters, she rejoiced to experience the company of others for the first time in over a month. **She resolved that, the next time she was brought out to shower, she would bring three of her four Gospels, to share God’s love and glory with her fellow prisoners.**

On April 20, 1944, Corrie heard her fellow inmates shouting up and down the cell blocks. This was unusual, as the guards would typically never allow such a blatant act of disorder and insubordination. But, as she learned, it was Hitler’s birthday, which meant that most of the guards were away at a celebration honoring the _Fuhrer_.

**This was a rare opportunity for the inmates in solitary confinement to share information with one another and with the prisoners in the non-solitary units**. The entire prison was soon playing an elaborate game of “telephone” as each cell acted as a link in a communication chain, shouting through the cell blocks and passing information to one another. They shared personal information and relished in the opportunity to finally get to know one another, regaining a small sliver of their humanity.

Corrie shouted through the halls for word of Nollie, Betsie, Willem, and Casper. Corrie learned that all the members of her family, as well as Pickwick, had been released—except for Betsie, who was still in Scheveningen. Although this was wonderful news, she still had no idea what had happened to her father after he had bravely refused the offer of release. No one had any news of what had befallen Casper.

### Father Released

One week later, Corrie received a care package from Nollie, consisting of a sweater, cookies, vitamins, a needle-and-thread, and a bright red towel. But Nollie’s package also contained a secret note, written behind the postage stamp. It said, simply, **“All the watches in your closet are safe.” This was code—it meant that all six Jews had safely escaped from the Beje.** This was blessed news for Corrie, showing her that the risks she had taken and the suffering she and Betsie were enduring had not been in vain after all.

**A few days later, in early May, 1944, Corrie received yet another letter from Nollie, this one bearing terrible news: Casper was dead**. He had died at Scheveningen a mere ten days after the arrest, with his date of death marked March 9, 1944. Nollie had no idea where he was buried.

Corrie agonized and mourned the loss of her father and the fact that she had no place to go to honor his memory. But she also remembered what Casper had always told her—that death was in God’s hands, and only He could determine when someone’s time on Earth had ended. She took comfort in knowing that Casper was now with God and Mama.

He was free from the agony and suffering of the mortal world, and he had lived a life committed to serving God and upholding his abiding faith. **Corrie sketched a new date, March 9, 1944, on her prison cell calendar. Its inscription was simple, but powerful: “Father released.”**

### A New Interrogation

The weeks in solitary confinement continued, with no clear end in sight for Corrie’s suffering and loneliness. In late May 1944, after three months in Scheveningen, she was finally called for her hearing. She feared what would happen to her as the guards escorted her to the infamous interrogation huts.

**When Corrie arrived, her interrogator was nothing like what she’d imagined. Lieutenant Rahms was different than the other Nazi officials she had encountered**. Where they had been harsh, violent, and outwardly cruel, Rahms was gentle, disarming, and even seemed to express concern for Corrie. His first act, upon seeing that she was shivering, was to light a fire in the hut’s stove to help her warm up and get comfortable.

But, by this point, Corrie was enough of a veteran of Nazi persecution to see through his ruse. **Rahms’s disarming nature was merely a ploy, a tactic he was using to attempt to coax information out of her.** He was trying to get Corrie to confess and betray the accomplices who hadn’t yet been apprehended by the Gestapo, reassuring her that he would help her if she agreed to cooperate and told him everything she knew. Corrie prayed that her gullibility would not put the lives of others at risk.

In the course of the hour-long interrogation, it became clear to Corrie that the Gestapo had been mistaken about the true nature of the workings at the Beje. They seemed to think that it was the headquarters of a food ration card fraud and theft scheme, as Rahms’s questions mostly seemed to focus on this topic. Corrie genuinely had little knowledge of this, and she had little information to share with Rahms.

Despite his disarming style of questioning, Rahms’s cruel Nazi ideology did express itself during the interrogation. When he asked Corrie about the good works she did in accordance with her faith, she talked about her work with mentally handicapped children. **Rahms scoffed at this work, claiming that God would surely value an able-minded convert over a “half-wit.”** Corrie rebutted his ideas about the uselessness (from the perspective of fascist society) of disabled people, claiming that they, too, were creatures of God and no different in His eyes than anyone else.

The interrogation resumed the next day. This time, Rahms attempted to appeal to Corrie by asking her about her family and her faith. Rahms spoke about his distaste for the grim work he was engaged in at Scheveningen and his fears for what might happen to his family at home in Germany. Corrie told him that Jesus Christ could be his light and salvation, even in a dark and cruel world.

Over the next two days’ interrogations, Corrie sensed that Rahms was genuinely enjoying their conversations, as he no longer asked her any questions about her underground activities. **Rahms struggled to understand why a supposedly loving and benevolent God put a devout Christian like Corrie in a filthy solitary confinement cell**. Or why He would allow such a good and pious man like Casper ten Boom to die alone in prison, separated from his family and everyone he knew.

Corrie, of course, knew that these were the workings of God, not for humans to question or try to understand. Like her father’s metaphor about the bag at the train station being too heavy for her to bear, **she knew that there was some knowledge that mankind could not bear—so God would bear it for us.**

### Reunion

**As Rahms escorted Corrie back to her cell following their final session together, he provided Corrie with one remarkable act of kindness—he allowed her to see Betsie**. In what was surely a break from protocol, he walked Corrie past Betsie’s cell, allowing her to linger long enough for her to catch a glimpse. To Corrie’s astonishment, Betsie had decorated and brightened her cell, just as she had done at the Beje. Even in the grim circumstances of Scheveningen, Betsie’s warmth and cheer could find expression.

In June 1944, Rahms brought Corrie to a small room at the prison, where she found her family waiting for her. Willem, Flip, and even Betsie were there! The occasion was the reading of Casper’s last will and testament. This unexpected reunion was a bright spot in Corrie’s otherwise dreary sojourn in Scheveningen.

She learned some important details about the six Jews’ escape from the Beje. After a few days, the soldiers on duty at the Beje had been replaced with ordinary Haarlem police. Rolf then arranged to have the fugitives freed from the hiding place and transferred to other safehouses. Unfortunately, however, the elderly and asthmatic Mary Itallie had been apprehended while she was out walking the streets. Corrie struggled to understand why Mary would have ever exposed herself (and her fellow fugitives) to such danger by moving around in public that way.

**Willem, meanwhile, was severely ill with jaundice due to the unsanitary conditions, malnutrition, and lack of medical care during his stay in prison**. Betsie, too, was gaunt and pale from her ordeal. Her nephew Kik, Corrie learned, had been sent to a prison in Germany after he was arrested in connection with his efforts to help a downed American airman reach the North Sea to escape to Britain. Clearly, the family had suffered unimaginable hardship because of their refusal to submit to the Nazi terror.

**But Corrie did receive something at this meeting which was to comfort her greatly in the ordeals and tribulations that were soon to come: a Bible from Nollie**. It was to be her rock and strength through the storms that lay ahead.
