## Chapter 4: A Sanctuary

**The man sent by the Resistance to examine conditions at the Beje introduced himself to Corrie only as “Mr. Smit.”** False identities were standard operating procedure within the Resistance: knowing too much about one’s co-conspirators was dangerous for the entire group. Mr. Smit, Corrie learned after the war, was actually an architect, one of Europe’s most famous.

Some aspects of Corrie’s operation met with Smit’s approval. Corrie had, for example, implemented a warning system to prevent aid workers delivering supplies from entering the Beje if a raid was already underway—**a small triangular sign that in the shop window was the “all clear” signal to enter; its absence was the signal to stay away.** Smit deemed this acceptable, as well as the hiding space for the ration cards beneath the stairs.

**But the lack of a true hiding place for the _people_ at the Beje was a major cause for concern. **When Smit went up to Corrie’s room, however, he found that the architecture of the house was ideally suited for constructing a secret hiding place.

Smit installed a false brick wall in Corrie’s room, behind which was to be the secret room where Jews would be able to hide. Corrie was astonished by the thoroughness and quality of Smit’s work. It was perfect, totally undetectable from the outside. There was enough room to stand and walk around in the hiding place, as well as a well-hidden vent that would let air in from the outside. The hiding place was only accessible through a small sliding panel, which was hidden behind bookshelves in front of the false wall.

Mr. Smit proudly declared that the Germans would have great difficulty locating anyone hiding in the space he had built, boasting that the Gestapo could search for a year and never find anything. The Beje was now ready to function as a permanent hiding place.

### A Desperate Situation

Corrie knew that her activities were dangerous, and that she faced severe punishment—even death—at the hands of the Nazis if caught. She had been forced to lie in service of her work. But Casper reminded her that the lies that crossed her lips were spoken with love—the love that he had always told her was the greatest and most powerful force in the universe. And **she was prepared to face death in order to show that love, just as Christ had on the cross—for, in sacrificing herself, there could be no greater act of love.**

But still, it was impossible not to think about the enormous risks she and her circle were running by this time. In early 1943, the hiding place to which the Resistance had sent Harry de Vries after his brief sojourn at the Beje was discovered by the Gestapo. In the ensuing raid, Harry was rounded up and taken to the police station in Amsterdam. Corrie did manage to see him one final time before he was transported to Amsterdam and from there, most likely out of the country to a concentration camp.

The police officer Rolf (who had spotted Fred Koonstra delivering ration cards at the Beje the previous summer) arranged this meeting, letting slip to Corrie the day Harry was to be sent away—apparently, Rolf had some sympathies with the Resistance. When she said goodbye to Harry at this meeting, Corrie knew she would never see him again.

In another heartbreaking incident, a young Jewish mother and baby had appeared at the Beje, knowing that it was a safehouse. Unfortunately, the Beje was full and unable to accommodate them, so arrangements were quickly made to hide the mother and baby with a sympathetic local pastor. But the pastor was unwilling to take them in, citing the security risk and fearful for what would become of him in the event of a raid.

As a last resort, the pair were spirited off to a farm in the countryside. This was far from ideal: the farm was not a secure safehouse and it was believed that the authorities already knew of its existence. Still, it was the only solution available. Sure enough, the farm was raided by the Gestapo, and the mother and baby were taken away, never to be heard from again.

All over Haarlem, tensions were stretched to the breaking point. The deprivations of wartime began to be felt all across the city as winter set in. Food and fuel were running constant shortages, taking a terrible toll on the very young and the very old—including Christoffels, who finally succumbed to the cold and hunger in winter 1943.

### Expanding the Operation

**Corrie’s rescue and hiding operation was growing rapidly by spring 1943. What had started out as a small network of friends and family had expanded by this time to include 80 co-conspirators**. Many of these contacts were people in positions of authority in Haarlem, including the police officer Rolf, who began directly assisting the operation by funneling fugitives to hide at the Beje (often under the pretense of needing a watch repaired) and ensuring a minimal police presence in the area.

Corrie worried that the circle was growing too large and unwieldy. The more people who were involved, the greater the likelihood that one of them would betray the group to the occupation authorities. The widening circle of conspirators—and, now, possible informants—necessitated the use of extra security procedures. The operation was now carried out through clandestine meetings and illicit telephone conversations using pseudonyms and code words to deceive the authorities, whom Corrie understood to be listening in on such conversations.

**In 1943, a Jewish man named Meyer Mossel, who had been a synagogue cantor in Amsterdam, came to live at the Beje**. Mossel had been deemed a high security risk for operators of Haarlem safehouses due to the fact that he “looked” especially Jewish—he had sharp and distinct Semitic features that members of the Resistance feared would make him difficult to pass off as Gentile. But Corrie was unwilling to turn away Mossel, whom she christened (quite literally) on his false paperwork as “Eusebius Smit.”

**“Eusie,” as the family at the Beje came to call him, was a warm and benevolent presence in the home.** He delighted everyone with his humor and cheerfulness, despite the obviously fraught circumstances. He struck a particular chord with Casper, with whom he shared an abiding love for the Judeo-Christian religious tradition. Indeed, on Eusie’s first night at the Beje, Casper said he would be honored if the cantor would lead the evening’s prayers.

He even had a jaunty attitude when it came to the violations of religious dietary laws to which he was sometimes forced to submit in hiding. The general privations of wartime plus the rationing system made it increasingly difficult to secure kosher food. One evening, the only meat Corrie was able to procure was pork. After trying a sausage with some initial reluctance, Eusie humorously declared that there was probably a Torah passage which justified eating non-kosher under such circumstances—but that he would wait to start looking for it until he finished his meal!

### Taking Extra Precaution

**At its peak in 1943-44, the Beje hiding place was home to six Jews who lived there on a permanent basis, along with Corrie, Betsie, and Casper**. But because it was now functioning as a permanent safehouse instead of a temporary refuge, the leaders of the Dutch Resistance began to demand that Corrie tighten her operation and instill more strict discipline at the Beje.

Pickwick was dismayed to learn that Corrie had not taken some basic precautions to protect herself, the Jews living in her home, or her wider circle of accomplices in the increasingly likely event that the home was raided by the Gestapo. He insisted that Corrie hold regular drills—she needed to make sure that all six Jews were able to get into the hiding place from wherever they happened to be in the house in under one minute.

They needed to be able to do this without leaving behind any trace that they had been there. The Gestapo, Pickwick warned, would be thorough in checking a suspected safehouse for any signs that additional people were living there. Even seemingly innocuous things like left-behind ashtrays, overfilled wastebaskets, or a warm spot on an empty bed could arouse their suspicions.

**He also told Corrie that she needed to implement an alarm and warning system.** This would alert the six fugitives that the Germans were on their way and that they needed to make their way to the hiding place in Corrie’s room immediately. Pickwick installed a buzzer system that could be pressed if the Beje was tipped off about an incoming raid—the buzzer was installed at strategic points throughout the house and was loud enough to be heard from anywhere _inside,_ but not _outside_. Whoever answered the door would have to stall the officers as long as possible, to allow the refugees as much time as possible to escape.

### Conducting Drills

Eventually, the permanent guests at the Beje became quite effective at getting to the hiding place, though they never quite got their routine down to less than a minute. The group had a set routine for scrambling up into Corrie’s room and escaping behind the false wall, leaving behind no trace of their presence. As the refugees practiced getting up to the hiding place, Corrie, Betsie, and Casper would set to work rearranging the house to give the appearance that only the three of them lived there.

The very first drills, however, showed just how disorganized the group was. Far from Pickwick’s ideal of a one minute interlude between the sounding of the buzzer and the completion of the escape and concealment, the residents of the Beje took _four_ minutes. The drills frightened the group because they reminded everyone of the true danger they were facing.

Nonetheless, they recognized the importance of mastering this regimen. Although they never got it down to a one-minute routine, they did eventually manage to achieve a two-minute time. Even the elderly and asthmatic Mary Itallie, one of the six Jews in hiding at the Beje, managed to master this routine, though her loud coughing and wheezing threatened to betray the entire group.

**Corrie herself needed to prepare for being harshly interrogated by the Gestapo.** Her nephew Kik arranged drills for her, in which he and Rolf would burst into Corrie’s room while she was still sleeping and bark questions at her, just as would happen if she were to find herself face-to-face with the German police. “How many Jews are you hiding?” they would scream at her. But Corrie, who had been raised to believe that lying was a sin, was honest to a fault in these mock interrogations, often giving the literal answer, “Six.” Or sometimes, the mock interrogators would trick her with a question like, “Where are you hiding your nine Jews?” to which Corrie would respond, “We have only six Jews here.”

**Allies told Corrie that she needed to give the _correct_ answers to these questions, not the _true_ ones, **lest she inadvertently betray herself and everyone else at the Beje.**** She must deny that there were _any_ Jews there. Her honesty, while genuinely motivated by her unshakeable Christian faith, was a serious hazard. With time, however, she learned how to calmly and coolly give the _correct_ answer to these questions: “I don’t know what you’re talking about. There are no Jews here.”

### A New Family

**As time went on, the six Jews and the ten Booms became a true family unit**. They ate, laughed, sang, and prayed together, retaining their humanity in the face of nearly unimaginable fear. The cohesion of the group and their overwhelming regard for one another showed when Mary was first brought to the house. It was obvious that sheltering her posed a serious risk to everyone. The issue of whether or not to admit her at the Beje was put to a vote—and, on a unanimous, 9-0 vote, they chose to let her stay.

**Despite the sense of community and genuine bonds of love and affection that had formed between the people living at the Beje, it was still an environment fraught with fear and anxiety**. If anyone on the street were to see the group gathered together for a meal, for example, it could prompt suspicion that Jews were hiding in the house. Everyone was aware of the grave dangers they faced. Any unexpected spotting by neighbors or passersby on the street necessitated quick thinking to avert suspicion.

On one occasion, when the group feared that people in a neighboring house had spotted them, Corrie made the snap decision to start loudly singing, to create the appearance that everyone in the house was merely gathered there for a birthday party. Even the normal appearance of the window washer at the Beje triggered Corrie’s worst fears about the people in her care being captured by the Germans—to say nothing of herself.

### A Return Visitor

**One night, a familiar face returned to the Beje—Otto Altschuler, the cruel and odious young German who had worked as an apprentice at the watch shop before the war.** Back then, he had loudly propagated his anti-Semitic and fascist views. Now he was in a position to put these principles into action.

As a German soldier stationed in Haarlem, Otto paid an unexpected visit to the Beje. In characteristic fashion, he mocked and threatened the ten Booms, darkly musing at how the tables had turned: he had once been their subordinate, but he was now in charge and would make sure they obeyed his orders. He sneered upon learning that Christoffels had died during the winter’s food and fuel shortage and expressed his same contempt and disgust for the family’s religious piety. After Corrie made him some tea and politely sat with him, Otto suddenly demanded to inspect the area upstairs—where the six Jewish fugitives were hiding.

Otto’s visit was an opportunity for Corrie’s group to test the effectiveness of their drills. When he first came to the door in his uniform, Corrie set off the buzzer to alert the six to the imminent danger. Otto heard the buzzer go off, but Corrie was able to wave his suspicions away by.... Corrie stalled him as long as possible before the young captain forced his way upstairs. To her great relief, the constant drilling had paid off. There was no trace of the group when Otto made his way upstairs. Finding only Casper and Betsie, Otto angrily stormed out of the house. The group was safe—for now.
