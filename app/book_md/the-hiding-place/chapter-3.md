## Chapter 3: Joining the Resistance

More disturbing than the rationing, curfews, identity cards, or confiscation of radios, however, were the measures that the German occupiers began to take against the Jews of Haarlem. For years, Corrie’s brother Willem had warned his family about the violent antisemitic ideology of Nazi Germany. Now it was happening on Dutch soil.

**The Jewish community of Haarlem began to face harsh discrimination**. They were barred from entering restaurants, cafes, and parks, to Corrie’s horror and dismay. The anti-Jewish measures soon took on a violent character—Jewish cemeteries and synagogues were looted and vandalized, with the perpetrators desecrating holy religious texts and painting swastikas on the walls and doors of Jewish houses of worship. Later, Jews were marked out from the rest of the community by the infamous decree ordering them to wear yellow stars stitched to their clothing.

**One of the most shocking aspects of the antisemitic campaign was how eagerly many ordinary Dutch people gleefully participated in it.** The Netherlands had its own version of the German Hitler Youth, called the NSB. These were local Nazi sympathizers and collaborators, who espoused a hateful antisemitic ideology that found expression in terrorizing and harassing their Jewish neighbors. Corrie was aghast to discover that people whom she had known and seen in Haarlem in ordinary times were now enthusiastic participants in the gathering storm of hate.

**By 1941, Jews began simply disappearing off the streets**. There were awful scenes being played out on the streets of Haarlem, as Corrie saw her Jewish neighbors and acquaintances (many of whom she hadn’t even _known_ were Jewish) being subjected to harsh interrogations, raids, and mass arrests. In the watch shop, the disappearances left behind a more subtle, yet sinister trace—repaired watches left on the hooks, never picked up by their owners. As Jews were hauled off the streets, no one could truly guess where the Germans were taking them. Awful rumors began to circulate about Jews being deported _en masse_ to camps in Eastern Europe where they would be worked to death or even killed outright.

### Mr. and Mrs. Weil

The streets Corrie had known all her life were running red with blood. She wanted to help, wanted to assist her friends and neighbors in distress, wanted to live up to her most deeply held Christian principles. **But how could one individual stand up to the powerful forces of concentrated evil?**

In this, she looked to Willem. As a pastor in the Dutch Reformed Church, Willem operated a nursing home in the nearby town of Hilversum. Just as he had worked to help persecuted Jews escape Nazi Germany, now **he was using the nursing home to hide Dutch Jews who faced the threat of arrest and deportation**. He was using the nursing home as a temporary hiding place, where fugitive Jews could wait until they found a more permanent safehouse out in the countryside, where there were fewer occupying troops.

**Corrie’s first act to rescue Jews in Haarlem was helping her neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Weil**. In November 1941, the Germans surrounded and vandalized the Weils’ furrier shop, located next to Casper’s watch shop. The ten Boom family watched as the Germans looted and destroyed the shop, thankfully while its occupants were absent. Corrie and the family made the pivotal decision to intervene, spiriting Mr. Weil into the Beje and sheltering him until the authorities left. But Mr. Weil still feared for his wife: she had been visiting her sister in Amsterdam at the time of the raid. She needed to be warned _not_ to return home.

**The family reached out to Willem, who had extensive contacts in the Dutch Resistance and knew of addresses where persecuted Jews would be able to hide**. If anyone would be able to get a warning to Mrs. Weil and help get the couple to safety, it would be Willem. Corrie made the long journey to Hilversum, where she asked Willem’s son, Kik, to help. At 9 o’clock that evening (after the German-imposed curfew), Kik came to the Beje to escort Mr. Weil to safety. When Betsie asked how this would work, Kik told her not to ask too many questions—the underground survived by secrecy.

### A Solemn Pledge

**The decision to join the Resistance was a turning point for Corrie**. She knew that working with the underground would mean lying, defying authority, stealing, forging, and possibly even violence, all of which was in direct violation of her bedrock Christian faith. Yet that same faith also told her she could not sit idly by while her neighbors were being persecuted. She prayed for the answer to the question—how should a Christian act when evil is in power?

The introduction of the yellow star and the campaign of antisemitic persecution revealed to Corrie neighbors whom she hadn’t known were Jewish. One of them was a man she and her sisters had known only as “Bulldog,” so named because he was always to be seen walking his beloved bulldogs through the streets of Haarlem.

One day, Corrie and Casper saw him on the streets, without his dogs. Concerned, they asked him what had happened to his pets. At a visit to his home that evening, **he tearfully revealed the truth—he had euthanized his pets by poisoning them. As a Jew, he was not allowed to have animals and he couldn’t bear the idea of them being taken away from him by the Germans.** Bulldog, whose real name was Harry de Vries, explained that he didn’t even think of himself as Jewish. He was born a Jew, but he had long since converted to Christianity, and his wife had always been a Christian. But this was no protection from Nazi ideology, which saw Jewishness as a matter of blood and race, not professed religion.

(Shortform note: Under the German Nuremberg Laws, which were later extended to the countries occupied by the Nazis, anyone who could be proven to have at least three Jewish grandparents was considered to be Jewish, regardless of what religion they practiced. Converting to Christianity would not save one from this new, racial form of antisemitism.)

Another neighbor, a rabbi, implored Casper to take his Torah and Talmud, sacred Jewish religious texts, for safekeeping. This rabbi feared that he would soon be arrested and deported by the Germans, and wanted to know that these holy texts would be safe from harm. Casper agreed to do so—shortly after, the rabbi disappeared, and he was never seen again by Corrie or anyone else.

Witnessing these horrors happening to her neighbors and seeing so many in her community succumbing to the worst evil by collaborating with the Nazis, Corrie made a solemn pledge to God: she would help His people in any way she could.

### The Beje Safehouse

**By May 1942, the Holocaust was in full swing, with Jews being deported _en masse_ from German-occupied countries to labor and extermination camps in Eastern Europe**. Although the full extent of what was happening to the deported Jews was not yet known by the ten Boom family, they knew that their Jewish neighbors were in grave danger. Nollie, like Willem, had begun the work of hiding Jews, using her connections with the Dutch Resistance to secure documents that would conceal their Jewish identities. She was soon harboring two Jewish women full-time in her home.

The family was resisting the Nazi oppression in other ways as well. One day in church, Corrie’s beloved nephew Peter performed the “Wilhelmus,” the Dutch national anthem, which had been expressly banned by the occupation authorities. As the familiar chords began to ring out in the cathedral, the entire congregation sang along, **joining Peter in this small, but powerful act of defiance and national pride in the face of tyranny.**

Corrie was displeased by Peter’s showy act of defiance. Nollie was hiding two Jewish women in her home, to say nothing of Willem’s activities. The Gestapo would surely hear about Peter’s performance, which would bring dangerous scrutiny to the ten Boom family. Sure enough, within days of playing the forbidden anthem, Peter was arrested by the Gestapo.

**As the war progressed, the Beje increasingly became a refuge for Jews looking to hide from Nazi persecution**. Every night seemed to bring a new knock to the door, and a new person looking for refuge. The situation was becoming unsustainable: there was only so much room at the Beje, and the home was situated dangerously close to the local police headquarters. In 1942, The watch shop was not yet a full-fledged safehouse. It was instead being used as a _temporary_ hiding place for individual Jews or Jewish families seeking refuge from the Gestapo before they could be sent to more permanent safehouses, usually in the remote Dutch countryside.

**Willem told Corrie that she needed to develop her _own_ contacts to secure papers and supplies for the people living at the Beje and that she needed to operate at least semi-independently**. Otherwise, he explained, her potential capture could compromise all other rescue operations in Haarlem. While the different elements of the Resistance collaborated, they also needed to maintain a healthy separation from one another, for safety. That way, the other cells could continue to function even if _one_ was detected by the authorities. Willem knew that he was likely to be already on the authorities’ radar; it was too risky for everyone to have Corrie be so openly collaborating with him.

**The most critical challenge Corrie faced was ration cards** —she needed to find a way to secure them for the Jews under her care. The safehouses in the countryside to which they would be sent demanded that incoming Jews have valid ones. Unlike other documents, ration cards couldn’t be easily forged or counterfeited, as they were changed too frequently and would be too easy for the authorities to spot.

She needed to obtain _real_ cards—it was Willem who suggested that she _steal_ them. This was another dilemma, one that put Corrie’s Christian values to the test. She knew she would have to defy the law to obtain the ration cards. But she also knew that she was answering to a much higher law.

### The Ration Card “Robbery”

Corrie knew Fred Koonstra, the man who ran the Food Office, which was the department in charge of issuing ration cards. Before this, he had worked for the local electric company, reading the meter at the Beje. He also had a mentally challenged daughter, which gave him a more meaningful connection to the ten Boom family. **For years, Corrie had been administering religious services and instructions to the mentally challenged community of Haarlem, including Fred’s daughter.**

She visited Fred and told him plainly about the situation she was in and how he was in a position to help her. She was running a major risk, as she did not know Fred’s politics and had no way of knowing whether or not he would be sympathetic to the cause of rescuing Jews. Corrie prayed silently to herself that she had not made a mistake in approaching him. To her relief, Fred agreed to cooperate.

**He told Corrie that the best way to get the ration cards would be to stage a fake robbery of the Food Office,** at a time when only he and the record clerk were there. Corrie agreed to this plan, despite her qualms about the dishonesty it involved. Fred had one more question for Corrie: “How many cards do you need?” Corrie only had five Jews at the Beje, so she really needed no more than this. But, when she answered Fred’s question, she found herself saying, “100.” She was going to go to the maximum extent to rescue as many people as she could. She told Fred not to tell her who he would recruit to perform the “robbery,” or any other details of the operation. The less she knew the better.

The conspiracy worked. A week later, Fred turned up at the Beje with 100 cards, as well as bruises on his face—the “robber” had evidently committed to realism. He and Corrie worked out an arrangement in which he would deliver new cards to the Beje each month, disguised in his old meterman uniform. The new cards would be stored under a secret hollow space under the stairs at the house.

The system worked well enough, as Fred would innocuously stroll into the Beje in his meterman uniform, pretend to read the meter, deposit the new issue of food ration cards, and leave. Only one time did Corrie fear that something would go wrong. On July 1, 1942, a policeman named Rolf strolled into the Beje at the same time as Fred, ostensibly to drop off a watch that needed cleaning. But to Corrie’s relief, Fred maintained his composure and the officer left with no incident. This exchange was one of Corrie’s first tastes of just how nerve-wracking her life was about to get.

### The Resistance

One night after the curfew, Corrie’s nephew Kik (Willem’s son) took her to a home in the fashionable suburb of Aerenhout, journeying by bicycle. There, she was introduced to the local leaders of the underground. **She was shocked to discover that the head of the Haarlem Resistance was none other than Pickwick!** As she went around the room and met the other leaders, she saw that no one gave their real names. The organization was committed to anonymity.

**They briefed her on the organization’s purpose—the Resistance existed to assist the Allied forces by sharing intelligence about German armed forces’ movements and positions**. But they were instantly sympathetic with Corrie’s effort to rescue Jews and offered her their resources, knowledge, and contacts to help her expand and solidify her operation. They also shared some good news: Peter was about to be released!

Pickwick welcomed Corrie to the Resistance, but he warned her that the consequences would be severe if she was ever caught. He told her that it was better that she did not know anyone’s real name, so that she would not be able to reveal anyone’s identity if she were apprehended and interrogated.

The organization impressed upon Corrie the need to make sure that her safehouse was truly safe. The place in her home where Jews were hiding needed to be totally undetectable, with everyone at the Beje knowing exactly what to do in the event of a sudden raid by the Gestapo. Pickwick knew that the Beje lacked a secret room—he told Corrie this needed to be addressed immediately.
