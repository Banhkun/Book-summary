## Exercise: Exploring Defiance

Think about the circumstances that might cause you to defy authority.

Have you ever been in a situation where an authority figure asked you to do something or behave in a way that was in conflict with your beliefs? Briefly describe the situation.

In a few sentences, share how you responded to this situation.
