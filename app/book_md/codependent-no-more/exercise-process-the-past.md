## Exercise: Process the Past

Processing the past is a necessary part of healing. Giving yourself permission to feel bottled-up emotions from your childhood lets you complete the grieving process and find acceptance. Writing about your feelings gives you the distance to understand and learn from them.

* * *

Note: Processing past traumas can bring up a lot of negative and powerful emotions. Though you need to experience these emotions to heal, make sure you are in a safe place both physically and mentally first.

Think back to a painful or significant moment in your life, perhaps from your childhood. Describe what happened. What did you feel at the time? How did you handle it?

Now, describe how you feel about the event in the present. (Are you still holding onto any of your past emotions? If so, why do you think that is? Have the emotions changed at all?)

Describe how completing this exercise has made you feel. (Are you more at peace or more upset?) Why do you think you feel this way?

Finally, make a plan for processing your emotions going forward. (For example, you could journal about your feelings every night to process instead of repressing.) Be specific, with actionable steps.
