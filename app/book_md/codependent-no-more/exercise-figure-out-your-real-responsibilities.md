## Exercise: Figure Out Your Real Responsibilities

Codependents are bad at taking responsibility. They try to control things that aren’t their responsibility while ignoring their real duties. Determining your real responsibilities will let you focus your energy where it needs to be.

* * *

Write out the things you feel responsible for. To aid with this, look at your past actions and see what they can tell you about the things you feel responsible for. (For example, you might not consciously think you’re responsible for your sister’s mood, but if you’re always avoiding conversations that might upset her and ignoring your own needs to keep her happy, you probably feel that way subconsciously.)

Next, divide these responsibilities into two categories: Mine and Not Mine. Under each responsibility, write in detail about why it’s yours or not yours. Think about the following questions to help you decide which category to put each responsibility under: Can you really control each responsibility? If so, are you taking away someone’s right to choose? (For example, if you try to control your sister’s mood, you’re taking away her right to choose how she reacts to difficult conversations.)

Look at the responsibilities under the Not Mine category. Make a plan for how you’re going to release each of them. Be specific, with actionable steps. (For example, if you always rearrange your schedule when your boyfriend wants to spend time with you, you can write out what you’ll say to turn him down the next time. You could also organize your calendar according to how important the activity is; then you’ll have a clear idea of what activities you can rearrange and which ones take priority.)
