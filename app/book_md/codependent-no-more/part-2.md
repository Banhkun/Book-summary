## Part 2: How to Heal | Chapter 2: Practice Self-Care Through Detachment

In Part 1, we learned what codependency is and how it comes about. Now we’ll look at different ways to heal from codependency. We’ll cover the following strategies:

  * Practicing self-care through detachment
  * Nurturing self-esteem
  * Surrendering control and taking responsibility
  * Moving through grief to acceptance
  * Processing emotions healthily
  * Making healthy goals
  * Final tips



The first method of healing we’ll look at is practicing self-care through detachment. This is important because codependent people are often attached to others. According to Beattie, this means you focus on another person’s behavior while ignoring your own. You also focus on the other person’s feelings while losing touch with your own emotions. This leads to anxiety, obsession, and controlling behavior.

**Being attached to someone else means that all your energy goes into their life, leaving none for yourself.** Attached people feel depressed and like life has no meaning outside of the other person. You may think you’re controlling another person’s life, Beattie states, but your obsession is controlling yours.

The most important—and most difficult—step in recovery for codependents is focusing on taking care of themselves, rather than putting all their energy into other people. Beattie maintains that**it’s only by detaching from the other person and practicing self-care that you can control your life**.

> **Is Attachment Really That Bad?**
> 
> Some writers disagree with Beattie’s assertion that attachment is entirely negative. In _Attached_ , Amir Levine and Rachel Heller argue that attachment is a necessary and important part of life and that being dependent on another person actually makes you more independent, assertive, and confident. This seems to contradict Beattie’s point.
> 
> However, Levine and Heller simply use the word “attached” differently than Beattie. Levine and Heller define attachment as a healthy connection with other people. Beattie defines attachment as unhealthy dependency. At their cores, both books agree with each other, maintaining that everyone needs healthy connections with other people. Healthy connections promote emotional health and provide a sense of security and peace, which does increase confidence and independence as Levine and Heller assert.
> 
> Though their core messages are similar, the authors explore the subject differently. Levine and Heller focus on the attributes of healthy connections and how they work, while Beattie focuses on the steps you have to take _before_ you can make healthy connections. While relationships can provide encouragement, security, and emotional stability, you need to experience these things outside of the relationship, too. If you don’t, you’ll come to rely on the other person too much and risk becoming codependent.

### What Is Self-Care?

Beattie believes that **self-care is living a responsible life** : knowing you are important and taking responsibility for yourself. You do this by being mindful of your needs, wants, emotions, and responsibilities toward yourself and others.

Beattie warns that people can abuse the concept of self-care. People might claim to take care of themselves when avoiding, escalating, or causing problems. For example, if you take time off work without notice because you want to sleep in, you’re not practicing self-care—you’re neglecting a responsibility and leaving your coworkers in the lurch.

Beattie explains that fulfilling your responsibilities is a tricky aspect of self-care for a codependent because you have the tendency to place too _much_ responsibility on yourself. **Before accepting a responsibility, ask yourself if it truly is your duty.** One helpful question to keep in mind is whether your actions respect both your and the other person’s right to choose. For example, by taking off work without notice, you’re not respecting your boss’s right to choose a replacement for the day, and you’re forcing your coworkers into a stressful and overworked position.

> **Is That Really What Self-Care Means?**
> 
> Beattie’s definition of self-care might surprise some people. When many people think of self-care, they picture spa days and expensive purchases rather than personal responsibility. However, Beattie’s definition is bolstered by the American Psychological Association and the National Institute of Health: Both agree that true self-care is being mindful of your physical and mental needs.
> 
> The popular misunderstandings of self-care are often caused by taking the real principles of self-care too far. For example, some people misconstrue the need to care for their physical health, pushing themselves beyond their limits in the hopes of attaining a certain body type. Others take the need for relaxation too far and ignore their responsibilities in favor of lazing about and making unwise purchases.
> 
> Beattie’s inclusion of responsibility to others as well as yourself in her definition of self-care helps combat these tendencies: Responsibility toward yourself keeps you from overworking yourself, and responsibility toward others prevents you from neglecting all your duties.

> **Accepting That You’re Important Enough for Self-Care**
> 
> It is difficult for codependents to accept that they are important and that caring for themselves needs to be a priority. In _12 Rules for Life,_ Jordan Peterson suggests combatting this tendency by believing that you have an important job that you are alive to complete. If you hold this belief, treating yourself well becomes a moral obligation.
> 
> Peterson also suggests using others as a reason for treating yourself well: for example, saying, “Not taking care of myself will hurt the people around me, so I will take care of myself.” This may be good advice for the general person suffering from low self-esteem, but it’s dangerous for codependents who already pin too much of their value on other people.
> 
> Instead of rooting your reasons for self-care in other people, do it because you deserve good things simply by being you. Your important job is to be yourself and live happily and healthily. You can encourage this kind of thinking by challenging your negative self-talk with evidence (for instance, “I’m not lazy, I’ve been working hard every day and completed XYZ.”), turning negative comments about yourself into something positive (for example, turning “I’m so slow” into “I’m careful and diligent.”), and improving your physical health, because the better you feel physically, the better you’ll feel mentally.

### How Does Detachment Factor Into Self-Care?

According to Beattie,**detachment is the underlying principle of recovering from codependency.** It means pulling back from the person you’ve attached to and refocusing your energy on yourself. Instead of focusing on caring for the other person, you’re caring for yourself first. In this way, you’re practicing self-care.

Beattie stresses that detachment doesn’t mean abandoning the other person or being cruel: It means not allowing them to control you. **You’re taking responsibility for yourself and letting others be responsible for themselves.** Detaching yourself can also force others to take responsibility for themselves and improve their lives. In the end, having a healthy relationship will benefit both you and the other person, even if it’s painful or uncomfortable at first.

If possible, Beattie advises that you should detach with kindness and care for the other person. If necessary, though, anger is a powerful motivator. Detaching in anger is more painful, but it will give you the space to work through the problem and your emotions. This doesn’t mean that detachment happens all at once, though: Even if you initially detach in anger, you have to continue practicing it every day.

> **Non-Attachment and Compassion: How Buddhist Teachings Can Fight Codependency**
> 
> Beattie’s understanding of detachment shares many characteristics with the Buddhist belief of non-attachment. Non-attachment revolves around getting rid of _unhealthy_ attachments: You can have nice things and relationships as long as you don’t let those things control you.
> 
> The Buddhist methods of non-attachment are very similar to Beattie’s recommendations, which we’ll discuss in the next section. However, Buddhism emphasizes recognizing impermanence, which Beattie doesn’t. Buddhism stresses that you have to let go of objects, goals, and relationships once their time has passed. You can tell that something’s time has passed when it starts holding you back instead of helping you. Non-attachment is freedom, so if something makes you feel trapped or controlled, it’s time to let it go.
> 
> Beattie’s recommendation to detach in kindness and care unless necessary also mirrors Buddhist teachings. The Buddhist teaching on compassion specifies that you should remain nonviolent, but that sometimes, a situation calls for a forceful response. In those cases, it wouldn’t be compassionate to stand by and watch the situation get worse in the hopes of remaining nonviolent.
> 
> In the case of codependency, it wouldn’t be healthy or kind to remain attached to the other person, because in doing so, you’re preventing the other person from taking responsibility for their own life. You couldn’t resolve the situation through kindness and care, so the responsible act is to detach forcefully in anger.

### How to Practice Detachment and Self-Care

According to Beattie, the most important way to detach and practice self-care is to step back from a situation and ask yourself, **“What do I need or want in this moment?”** This lets you reflect on your emotional state, responsibilities, and energy levels before making a decision.

Beattie adds that there are a couple of principles to remember when considering your wants and needs. First, don’t shoot yourself down, even if you think a need or want is selfish or inconsequential. Be compassionate with yourself and remember that your wants and needs are just as important as everyone else’s.

(Shortform note: Furthermore, prioritizing your own needs and wants is not selfish—it is self-care. Selfishness involves taking things away from other people for yourself, while self-care is providing for yourself.)

Second, Beattie stresses the importance of **being honest when you ask yourself what you need.** Self-care can sometimes mean things like desserts, rewards, and fun outings, but it can also mean making that phone call, doing that task, or apologizing to that person.

(Shortform note: The key to honest self-care is finding a balance between celebrating your successes and acknowledging your shortcomings. Maybe you completed a project, but you also ordered takeout when you’re trying to eat healthily. Honest self-care celebrates completing the project, acknowledges the shortcoming of dinner, and makes a plan to improve in the future (maybe you need to prepare dinner earlier or cook in bulk on the weekends). You honestly assess your shortcomings, and you recognize the work you need to do to practice self-care.)

> **How to Practice Difficult Self-Care**
> 
> Providing for yourself and honoring what you need or want isn’t always fun, but there are some steps you can take to make difficult tasks easier. Break your difficult task into smaller, more manageable steps, speak encouragingly to yourself, and track your energy levels so you can schedule difficult tasks for when you’re most energized.
> 
> For example, if you have to make a difficult phone call, you can break the call into a few steps, such as writing out the most important points and deciding where you’re going to make the call. If you know you’re more energized in the morning, you can schedule the phone call for right after breakfast, when you’ll be best able to handle the mental pressure. Right before the call, spend some time encouraging yourself. This will put you in a more positive mindset to complete your task.

#### Ask for Help

Once you’ve determined your needs and wants, Beattie explains that the next step is to ask yourself,**“What do I need or want from _other people_ in this moment?”** and then to actually _ask_ them for it. Codependents struggle with this, as they would rather give help or attention than receive it, but learning how to follow through on your needs and wants is a vital step to self-care.

According to Beattie, **one of the things everyone needs from others is positive attention.** Pay attention to those needs and take steps to fulfill them. Asking for a hug is especially powerful, as hugging releases endorphins, which make you happier and more at ease. (Shortform note: Hugging also releases stress, lowers blood pressure, and boosts your immune system. In fact, hugging is so important to your health that doctors recommend a minimum of four hugs a day.)

If you have difficulty asking for or finding someone to give you positive attention, Beattie suggests getting it second-hand through your own actions. Try giving out compliments. Make sure they’re honest, but give them out freely. It’ll make both you and the other person happy.

(Shortform note: It may seem backward to give someone else compliments when you’re craving positive attention. However, studies show that complimenting other people boosts your own mood. In addition, people tend to mirror behavior, so if you start complimenting or paying attention to another person, they’ll be more likely to reciprocate.)

> **Asking for Attention Doesn’t Make You Needy**
> 
> As discussed in Chapter 1, codependents find it difficult to ask for help because they haven’t been able to rely on others in the past and they want to avoid being a burden. Asking for positive attention can be even harder because it requires emotional vulnerability. In addition, many people are afraid of appearing needy or “attention-seeking.” However, needing positive attention is a normal part of the human experience. Everyone needs support and care, and there are a few ways you can go about asking for it.
> 
> Taking a five languages quiz is a great way of opening up a discussion about your needs because it’s a more lighthearted way of addressing a serious topic. These quizzes can help you identify what kind of affection you’re craving by explaining the different kinds and how they manifest, which will help you meet those needs.
> 
> When asking for positive attention, don’t criticize the other person for not noticing your needs. Many people feel like their needs are obvious to others, but this is rarely true. Focus on the positives and be clear about what you need, rather than passive-aggressive.

#### Prioritize Yourself

According to Beattie, **an important part of self-care is prioritizing yourself.** When other people ask you for help, consider yourself first. Do you have the energy, time, and resources to help? Is this a responsibility? Do only what you’re responsible for and comfortably can, and try not to feel guilty if that’s not perfect or exactly what the other person wanted. If the problem isn’t your responsibility to fix, then you’re doing yourself and the other person a favor by refraining.

This might seem counterintuitive since you’re refusing the other person’s request. However, Beattie explains that codependents often end up in maladaptive cycles of behavior. You take care of someone else’s responsibilities and they in turn neglect those responsibilities even more.

In these cases, Beattie maintains that **refusing to take on those responsibilities will lessen your stress and allow you to focus on your real duties, and it’ll help the other person by forcing them to take responsibility** for their own life. The other person probably won’t see your refusal in this positive light, but in the end, you’ll both be healthier and more balanced individuals who can take care of yourselves.

(Shortform note: People react badly to being refused, even if the refusal is good for them, as Beattie suggests is the case in codependent relationships. Your refusal means the other person has to take responsibility for themselves, and if they’ve shirked responsibility for a long time, they’re going to react negatively. To encourage them to take responsibility while minimizing pushback, be an example of personal responsibility yourself. Be very clear that you expect them to take responsibility, and reward them when they do.)

> **The Importance of Saying “No”**
> 
> As discussed previously, saying no to people—in essence, what Beattie is advocating here—is not selfish. You’re not taking anything away from someone by denying their request. That said, saying no can still feel hard, especially if you’re not used to doing so.
> 
> In _Essentialism, Greg McKeown provides tips_ on how to say no:
> 
>   * **Remember that rejecting the request isn’t the same as rejecting the asker.**
> 
>   * **Remember why you’re saying no.**
> 
>   * **Be clear with your answer.**
> 
> 

> 
> McKeown also suggests phrasing your answer gently, without outright using the word “no.” Beattie contradicts this, saying that being clear and asserting your right to say “no” is important. Beattie’s advice is especially true for codependents first starting their healing journey, as they’re just learning to prioritize themselves. As you grow used to prioritizing yourself, you can move to gentler phrasing.

#### Miscellaneous Tips on Detachment

Now that we’ve covered the basics of how to detach and practice self-care, here are some final tips on how to succeed in the process.

According to Beattie, detachment often involves distancing yourself from hurtful past experiences and, in the process, practicing forgiveness. Some codependents don’t do so, instead holding on to their anger. **Allowing yourself to feel angry is healthy, but don’t let it stop you from detaching.** Remember, detaching is about you. The person who hurt you may deserve your anger, but you don’t deserve to have your autonomy taken away by them.

(Shortform note: Beattie focuses on the psychological effects of forgiveness: specifically, that forgiving someone lets you control your life rather than letting anger dictate your actions. However, there are significant physical benefits that come from forgiveness as well. When you hold on to anger, your body reacts like you’re sick and produces high amounts of white blood cells. Forgiveness allows your body to return to a healthy state.)

##### Handling Setbacks

Beattie also stresses the importance of being gentle with yourself when trying to detach. You’re teaching yourself a new way of thinking by putting yourself first, and that takes time. **Setbacks are therefore a normal part of the healing process,** and you should forgive yourself when you experience them. Setbacks can manifest in a variety of ways, including a return to maladaptive coping mechanisms, ignoring your needs, or getting into a relationship with another addict.

Beattie warns that setbacks are painful and upsetting, and you may wonder if there’s any point in trying to heal when experiencing one. There is. Every time you get up after a setback and keep working toward healing, you’re making progress and training your brain to put your needs first.

> **How to Handle Setbacks**
> 
> How can you handle setbacks? Beattie doesn’t say, but we have a few tips for handling them healthily:
> 
> **1) Remember how far you’ve come since the beginning of your recovery.** Experiencing a setback makes you feel like your efforts to heal were useless. Remember your experiences before you started healing. You’ll be relieved to remember how much better you’ve gotten at taking care of yourself. You’ll also be motivated to keep going, as you’ll remember that progress is possible.
> 
> **2) Go back to the basics of recovery.** You might’ve moved past basic coping mechanisms like asking yourself what you need and want as you recovered. Going back to these principles will reinforce the foundation of your recovery and make you more confident.
> 
> **3) Schedule easy and fun activities to boost your mood.** This will give you a boost of happiness and confidence to help you through the setback.
> 
> You can also plan ahead for setbacks. When you’re having a good day, try writing yourself “rainy day letters”: Write about how great your good day is and include plenty of encouragement for the next time you experience a setback.
