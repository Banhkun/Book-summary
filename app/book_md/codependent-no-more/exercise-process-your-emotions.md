## Exercise: Process Your Emotions

Processing your emotions is a vital skill. When you process your emotions, you are in control of your actions and can make good decisions. By walking through the healthy and unhealthy ways to react to your emotions, you can get some distance from the situation and decide how to react with a clear head.

* * *

Think about a difficult emotion you’re feeling or felt recently. Describe why you’re feeling that emotion, what you think about it, and what you’ve done to process it. (Have you taken responsibility for the emotion? Have you remembered that it doesn’t define you?)

Now, write about your _unhealthy_ reactions to that emotion. (Are you lashing out? Are you blaming other people?) If you have trouble picturing yourself reacting unhealthily, imagine someone else doing so.

Finally, write about your _healthy_ reactions to that emotion. (Are you using “I” statements? What can you learn from this emotion?) Describe how you might use these healthy reactions more often. Again, if you have trouble picturing yourself reacting healthily, imagine someone else doing so.
