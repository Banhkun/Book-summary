## Exercise: Identify Your Family’s Rules of Engagement

According to Beattie, the unspoken rules that govern family interaction can either promote or stifle open communication. Families that discourage communication have a high risk of codependency. Understanding these rules of engagement can help you communicate better and foster better relationships.

* * *

Identify some of the unspoken family rules that determine how you interact with others. For instance, are there any emotions you feel unable to express or any topics that are taboo due to your family’s expectations? Were you taught you have to act or look a certain way? Write down all the examples you can think of.

Now, describe a recent interaction with someone where these rules affected how you behaved. Did you avoid talking about something? Did you hide your feelings? Try to connect your behavior to the family rules you listed above.

Finally, describe how that interaction might have changed if your family rules were different. What might you have said or done differently? Try to find a different, positive action for each family rule that affected the original interaction.
