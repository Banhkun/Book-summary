## Part 1: Defining Codependency | Chapter 1: What Is Codependency?

In _Codependent No More,_ Melody Beattie explores codependency and how it affects people. She draws on her own experience as a codependent, addict, and councilor to present a realistic yet compassionate image of codependents and their struggles. Furthermore, she shows how codependency can ruin lives just like addiction, and how, just like addiction, it can be overcome.

In Part 1, we’ll look at what codependency is and how it forms; we’ll discuss how to overcome it in Part 2. In this chapter, we’ll cover the definition of codependency, its characteristics, and its causes.

### The Evolving Definition of Codependency

According to Beattie, **codependency is a stress-induced pattern of behavior that dictates how a person treats another and how she allows that other person to influence _her_.** The codependent obsesses over the other person and seeks to control them.

Beattie cautions readers, though, that **hers is not the definitive definition**. Codependency occupies a nebulous place in the psychological field. Many definitions of codependency exist, all capturing an aspect of the condition. These definitions vary between doctors, clinics, and individuals. Some experts maintain that codependency is a disease, becoming worse over time, while others argue that codependent behavior is a normal response to an unhealthy situation.

Though many of these descriptions are outdated, they are useful for getting a better understanding of codependency. Let’s look at a few of the major definitions and discoveries that led to Beattie’s understanding of codependency.

> **The Difficulty in Defining Codependency**
> 
> Defining codependency is a difficult task, even decades after Beattie’s work first brought widespread attention to the condition. Part of this difficulty is that codependency is not technically a mental illness according to the DSM-5, which provides information for diagnosing mental illnesses. There is no single, clear definition agreed upon by experts. The American Psychiatric Association denied codependency its own entry in the DSM-5 because it has too many overlapping symptoms with other diagnoses, such as dependent personality disorder (DPD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD).

> However, codependency has a few prominent traits that do not fit a DPD or BPD diagnosis: most notably the tendency to assume too much responsibility, as opposed to the shirking of responsibility defined in DPD and BPD. This points to codependency deserving its own diagnosis, and the issue is still debated among experts.
> 
> Currently, codependency is generally defined as a dysfunctional relationship where Person A needs Person B, and Person B needs to be needed. Beattie’s definition remains one of the most comprehensive, as she addresses the cause of codependency as well as its symptoms.

#### The History of Codependency

According to Beattie, codependency was initially defined as **having unhealthy coping mechanisms for dealing with a loved one’s alcoholism**. This definition remained until experts discovered that codependent people act like alcoholics, as if the codependents themselves have an addiction. The definition then focused more on the codependent’s loss of control in their life, rather than on the family member’s problems.

As experts conducted more research, they expanded the definition to include conditions other than alcoholism and refined it to describe the cause of the unhealthy coping mechanisms codependents displayed. At this point, codependents were known as **people whose lives were out of control because of relationships with needy or dependent people**.

Beattie asserts that the final major shift in defining codependency came with the realization that some families displayed codependent behavior without an external problem to cause it. This led to the discovery that family dynamics themselves can cause codependency. We’ll discuss this in more detail later in this chapter.

> **When Codependency and Addiction Co-Present**
> 
> While Beattie argues that any prolonged stressful situation can cause codependency, and it may not be linked to addiction, the disorder is still closely linked to addiction because counselors discovered it at substance abuse clinics. Experts recognized patterns of behavior in the family members of the alcoholics they treated and, as the patterns became more obvious, changed their methods to support the families as well as the addicts.
> 
> The connection between addiction and codependency goes both ways. While Beattie addresses the primary link (addiction causing codependency), the stress of being in a codependent relationship can drive people to substance abuse. Thus, treating codependency is vitally important.
> 
> Some people believe that when addiction and codependency co-present, both disorders must be treated. Because each causes the other, only treating one won’t help. However, while most recommended treatments admit that the codependency needs to be treated, they maintain that treating the addiction is the main step to healing.

#### Define Codependency for Yourself

While Beattie provides a definition of codependency, she maintains that **having a single concrete definition is less important than being able to define codependency for yourself**. Understanding your own codependency and how it affects you is the first step toward healing.

> **The Dangers and Benefits of Self-Diagnosis**
> 
> Beattie maintains that self-diagnosing codependency is an important step toward healing. However, self-diagnosis is a controversial subject in psychiatry. Some doctors maintain that self-diagnosis is dangerous because it relies on personal research and inexpert opinions. People without psychological backgrounds can overlook important symptoms of mental illness. In addition, mistreating yourself based on an incorrect self-diagnosis can exacerbate your true condition.
> 
> However, other doctors argue that self-diagnosis is actually a helpful tool: Doctors suffer from personal biases which affect how they diagnose patients. Self-diagnosis avoids these biases.
> 
> Most poignantly for codependents, self-diagnosis changes how you view yourself and your condition. Once you have a name to put to your struggles, it is easier to accept that you need and deserve treatment: A codependent can go from thinking, “I’m a terrible person,” to, “I’m codependent and I can get better.” This shift in mindset is a powerful step toward healing.

### Characteristics of Codependency

Like many psychological issues,**codependency has varied and sometimes contradictory symptoms.** For the full list of symptoms, please see the book. We’ve synthesized Beattie’s 14 major characteristics into three critical categories.

(Shortform note: These categories are fluid. Several of the symptoms listed below can fit into more than one category. We’ve limited each symptom to a single category to maintain clarity.)

#### Putting Responsibility in the Wrong Place

Beattie believes that **codependents put responsibility in the wrong place.** They see themselves as responsible for everyone else’s behaviors but don’t take responsibility for their own. This manifests in the following ways:

  * Obsessing over other people’s behavior and attempting to control that behavior
  * Taking care of everyone else and putting even minor problems above their own needs
  * Believing they know best and getting angry when other people don’t listen to them



> **Taking Responsibility for Others and Not Yourself: Why Does It Happen?**
> 
> Some people argue that taking too much responsibility for others comes from thinking yourself too independent: so independent that you alone have the power to help yourself and others. In reality, everyone is interconnected; no one exists in a vacuum, being the cause and controller of everything around them.
> 
> While at first this mindset seems contrary to Beattie’s—one arguing that you’re too independent and the other maintaining that you’re too dependent—they’re really different ways of saying the same thing. In the first mindset, you _think_ you’re independent, but you’re not. By _thinking_ you’re independent and trying to control everything, you’re really becoming dependent on and being controlled by other people and your situation, as Beattie asserts.
> 
> To overcome this mindset, look at the outside influences on your behavior, even who built your house or stocked the grocery store. This reminder that you’re not operating alone lets you release over-responsibility.
> 
> But what about the inability to take responsibility for yourself? Often, this is due to low self-esteem: Codependents base their self-worth on their actions. Admitting to a mistake would deal heavy damage to their esteem. It feels safer to control other people’s actions because if the other person makes a mistake, the codependent isn’t as affected. Meanwhile, the codependent can’t worry about their own actions while focusing on the other person. We’ll talk more about self-esteem and its effects on codependents in Chapters 3 and 4.

#### Neglecting Themselves in Favor of Others

Because they focus on other people’s behavior,**codependents struggle to take care of themselves** or let others help them, Beattie explains. This can manifest in the following ways:

  * Having low self-esteem and relying on others to validate their worth through reassurances and compliments
  * Having weak boundaries and gradually acclimating to things they swore not to tolerate
  * Not being able to trust others or let others help them
  * Suppressing their own desires or lack of desires when it comes to sex



> **The Fear of Being a Burden Leads to Self-Neglect**
> 
> What causes a codependent’s self-neglect? Arguably, it’s the fact that codependents fear being a burden. They worry that if they don’t make themselves useful or pleasing, their loved ones will abandon them. To please others, they discard their own needs and boundaries, both in their sexual and everyday life. They cannot ask for help, because doing so would be burdening the other person. This fear usually stems from childhood: At some point, they learned that asking for help meant they were a burden.
> 
> Ironically, in their quest to be self-reliant, codependents end up needing other people for validation. Unfortunately, this reliance only worsens self-esteem and self-neglect. External validation boosts your mood, but it also reinforces the idea that you need to focus on other people and not burden them to receive that validation.
> 
> The fear of being a burden is a difficult mindset to escape. Pay attention to your inner critic and recognize when it accuses you of being a burden. Use those situations to practice being open about your needs and boundaries, rather than listening to that inner voice.

#### Being Unable to See Themselves Clearly

Beattie maintains that codependents can’t receive help or take responsibility because they lack self-knowledge. **They’ve repressed their feelings, needs, and personality** for so long that they’ve lost touch with them entirely. This can manifest in the following ways:

  * Repressing their feelings and losing sight of their personality, wants, and needs
  * Being unable to understand or communicate what they really mean
  * Refusing to admit that anything is wrong



> **Suppression vs. Repression: The Benefits and Dangers**
> 
> While Beattie refers to repression throughout her book, a more accurate word is suppression. Suppression is the purposeful pushing away of thoughts or feelings, while repression is a subconscious act. Suppression can be useful in the short term, allowing you to function until you are safe to experience your emotions. However, if you suppress your feelings or needs long enough, it turns into repression. This causes you to lose touch with these feelings and needs entirely, as Beattie asserts, and causes severe problems as listed above.
> 
> There are a few steps you can take to avoid repression:
> 
>   * **Name your emotions with “I” statements such as “I feel disappointed.”**
> 
>   * **Journal to understand your thoughts and feelings better.**
> 
>   * **Make a habit of sharing your thoughts and feelings with others,** even if it means admitting that things are wrong or communicating harsh truths.
> 
> 


#### The Effects of These Symptoms

Beattie stresses that the above symptoms are warning signs and that **codependency gets worse the longer it lasts.** When it goes unaddressed, codependents become depressed. They may isolate themselves, lose interest in hobbies and activities, be unable to complete daily tasks, and consider suicide. This can lead to codependents becoming addicts themselves.

> **The Connection Between Depression, Addiction, and Codependency**
> 
> As Beattie implies here, depression and addiction frequently go hand-in-hand. Someone with depression might turn to alcohol or drugs to cope, and an addict might develop depression. Because codependency has very similar symptoms to addiction, codependents are at high risk for both conditions.
> 
> If you notice depressive symptoms in yourself, such as loss of interest in life, prolonged sadness, or thoughts of suicide, reach out to a medical professional. You can also fight depression by increasing positive interactions with other people, taking care of your physical health, and focusing on positive experiences.

### What Causes Codependency?

Beattie states that **codependency is a reaction to prolonged and often extreme stress**. While temporary stress won’t make a big difference in your overall behavior, prolonged and extreme stress does. If your husband is late coming home once, you might worry, but after he gets home safely, you leave the stress behind. When you never know if your husband is coming home, the stress continues and grows every day. **And** **every day, your unhealthy coping mechanisms become more ingrained and habitual.**

These habitual coping mechanisms usually result in “reaction mode.” When in reaction mode, you’ll react to things in both healthy and unhealthy ways, but you’ll almost never _act_ on your own volition, Beattie explains. You'll make decisions solely based on others’ actions and how they make you feel. Instead of being able to make decisions and head off problematic behavior, you’re only able to react after the damage has been done.

Eventually, Beattie notes, even leaving the stress behind isn’t enough to return to normality. **Reaction mode has become your new normal** , and you subconsciously cling to the same coping mechanisms, even though they have started hurting you rather than helping.

(Shortform note: In business situations, reaction mode occurs when a company cares more about profits than their employees. Companies cut their workforce to save money, and their employees struggle to run the company, _reacting_ to one problem after another. In the same way, codependents don’t allot enough time or attention to themselves, and they struggle to live their lives, reacting to everyone else.)

> **How to Escape Habitual Stress**
> 
> Beattie discusses habits in the context of both habitual stress and habitual coping mechanisms. In general, habits can be good. They increase your brain’s efficiency by lessening the energy you spend making everyday decisions. According to Charles Duhigg’s _The Power of Habit_ , 40% of your daily actions are habitual.
> 
> However, habits can also be dangerous. When a habit forms around a stressful situation, your brain becomes more susceptible to stress. Let’s look at how this works:
> 
>   * You experience a stressful situation. Continuing our example, your husband is late coming home.
> 
>   * Your brain makes a connection between stress and being away from your husband.
> 
>   * The next time you’re away from your husband, you feel stressed and may not know why. If you don’t recognize what’s happening, you can’t counter the stress response.
> 
>   * Every time you fail to counter the response, the stress habit grows stronger.
> 
> 

> 
> To stop this process, identify the habitual stress connection. Your brain is too efficient for you to notice the initial connection, but you can recognize when the connection is being reinforced. For instance, if your husband is at work and you feel stressed, the connection is being reinforced. Take the opportunity to schedule an enjoyable activity; this alters the connection your brain makes and reduces your stress.

#### Causes of Stress

Codependency is associated with substance abuse because substance abuse is a clear and persistent cause of stress. However, Beattie argues that **codependency can crop up in any situation of “family illness,” when one member of a group has a problem and the repercussions spread to the entire group.**

(Shortform note: Most well-known family illnesses are mental disorders, but other situations like high-stress jobs or chronic illness can also cause codependency. While some people living with a family illness experience an increase in motivation in the face of the challenge, most experience depression, anxiety, and resentment for the affected party.)

##### Underlying Stress

The source of stress is not always as obvious as substance abuse. Beattie emphasizes that **some families experience codependency without any clear cause** : no history of substance abuse, no highly stressful situation, and no particularly needy family members. So what is the source of the stress? What traps you in reaction mode?

In these cases, the problem is usually the underlying family system, Beattie explains. All families have unspoken rules that govern how members behave and interact with one another. These rules develop naturally and can either help or stifle your family’s communication.

**Families that discourage open communication are at high risk for codependency.** In a family like this, you feel the need to repress your emotions. You need to be perfect and untroublesome, and you maintain the status quo even when change would be good. The stress of following or _reacting to_ these rules can cause codependency. This kind of codependency is dangerous, Beattie warns, because it’s difficult to detect the source. Underlying family systems have few obvious problems, and there is no established solution as there is for addiction.

> **Why It’s Important to Recognize Your Family System**
> 
> Underlying family systems like those Beattie describes are also called rules of engagement, and you learn them through trial and error. When you engage in a certain behavior and receive negative reactions, your brain prohibits the behavior. Some families might have spoken values, such as "You can tell us anything," but the underlying system enforces the opposite. For example, Mark’s parents say he can tell them anything, but when he shares his problems or feelings, they tell him to man up or brush him off.
> 
> Common family systems include discouraging talk about feelings or difficult topics, requiring you to act in certain ways because of your age or sex, and enforcing that your worth comes from success.
> 
> Every family has different rules of engagement, and it causes interpersonal conflict when people’s rules clash. If you grew up not talking about difficult situations, your husband wanting to discuss them feels threatening. If you grew up with a healthy communication dynamic, your friend might seem cold and standoff-ish because she doesn’t open up emotionally. Evaluating your family rules, and trying to understand those of others, can therefore help you foster stronger relationships and practice better communication.
> 
> If you know your family system discouraged communication, caused stress, and therefore left you at high risk of codependency, be proactive in preventing it by using the techniques discussed in this guide. This is important because there aren’t established solutions for healing family systems like there are for addiction, so you need to take charge of your healing.

##### Example #1: Reaction Mode Triggered by Extreme Stress

George is an alcoholic. He regularly goes into town and comes back drunk, or he doesn’t come back until the next morning. His wife Maria never knows where he is or when he’ll be coming back, nor the condition he’ll be in when he does return. When the problem starts, she calls his employers, friends, and favorite bars looking for him. This checking becomes a habit until she calls even when George comes home on time and sober.

Maria is dragged about by her husband’s behavior. She can’t control him; she can only mitigate the damage. After years of living in reaction mode, Maria can’t make decisions. All her choices revolve around George’s actions, even when he starts treatment and the stress is relieved. Reaction mode has become an integral part of how her brain works. It has become a dangerous habit, and Maria might not even realize it exists.

##### Example #2: Reaction Mode Triggered by Underlying Stress

Bobby grew up in an average, middle-class family. He has no family history of substance abuse, chronic illness, or other obvious family illnesses, and he had an overall pleasant childhood. Externally, everything seemed fine. But under the surface, the family system was putting stress on Bobby that would eventually manifest as codependency. Let’s look at what happened:

Bobby’s family isn’t one for emotional displays. Whether intentionally or not, his parents have shown that such displays are weak, childish, or annoying. They reward restraint and disapprove of complaints. As a result, Bobby grows up repressing his emotions. He doesn’t ask his parents for help because he feels he should handle his problems alone. He feels pressured to always be calm and in control, not letting his desires or emotions impact his actions. When he succeeds, the adults in his life praise him for his maturity. When he fails, people say he needs to grow up.

The family system had a set of rules that dictate actions. Bobby spent his entire life reacting to these rules. Now, years later, he is stuck in reaction mode just as much as Maria, even though his reason for being so is subtler.
