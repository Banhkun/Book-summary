## Chapter 6: Control Your Emotions

By learning to control your emotions, you’ll be in a better position to use the tools discussed so far (dual processing, contrasting, creating mutual purpose, etc.) to have successful crucial conversations.

Getting a better understanding of how emotions work is the first step. When we lose our cool we tend to blame others for pushing our buttons or making us mad. But we’re the drivers of our emotions, which in turn drive our actions.

Emotions don’t just happen. Here are two truths about them:

  * Emotions aren’t forced upon you by others. Others don’t make you mad; you make yourself mad. **You create your own emotions** — you make yourself angry, insulted, or frustrated.
  * Once you’ve created your emotions, you can do one of two things: Rethink them or be driven by them to act in unproductive ways. To put it another way, **you either control your emotions, or you’ll be controlled by them**.



Here’s an example of how emotions can lead to unproductive behavior. Maria is a copywriter who worked with her boss, Louis, on a project, which they were supposed to present jointly. But Louis presented the entire project himself without giving Maria a chance to speak. She’s angry and resentful, and feels betrayed. Nonetheless, she doesn’t want to come across as oversensitive, so she doesn’t tell Louis she’s upset. Instead she erupts occasionally with sarcasm (masking) and cheap shots (avoiding), which is jeopardizing their working relationship.

Maria’s story illustrates some of the pitfalls of not controlling your emotions. If you don’t control your emotions, matters will get worse. On the other hand, if you suppress them, they’ll still surface, for instance through sarcasm or body language. Either way, you’re being held hostage or driven by your emotions, which makes conversation impossible.

### You Can Change Your Emotions

**When you have strong feelings, you can influence and often change them** by thinking through them. Choosing different emotions makes it possible to then choose behaviors that lead to better results.

When you’re in an emotional state, it’s not easy to mentally reboot to regain control. To do it, you need to understand how feelings develop.

First there’s a trigger (often something someone else says or does) to which we respond emotionally, with worry or by feeling hurt, etc. Our feelings then drive us to action (for instance, to silence or cheap shots). We go from trigger to feelings to action.

But someone’s actions alone can’t cause our emotional reactions. When faced with the same circumstances, different people have different emotional responses. What makes the difference is that _after_ we see what someone did and _before_ we react emotionally to it, **we tell ourselves a story** **to interpret what we saw.** This creates our emotions. Our **Path to Action** is: We see and hear something. We tell ourselves a story about it. We feel. We act.

Since we are the one telling the story, **we can take back control of our emotions by telling ourselves a different story**.

### Your Stories

Stories are your rationale for what’s going on. They’re your interpretations of the facts, helping to explain what you see and hear. They explain why, how, and what: Why did the other person act that way? How should I interpret it? What should I do?

As we come up with our own interpretation or stories, our body responds with strong emotions. It happens instantaneously — we tell the story and our temper flares before we know it. For example, when someone laughs at us, we take it as an insult and feel a surge of anger instantly without consciously thinking about it.

At first, we control our stories as we tell them, but **once they’re told, the stories control us**. They dictate how we feel, and then how we act. As a result our stories control the outcomes of our crucial conversations.

However, **the same set of facts can be used to spin infinite stories.** We can tell different stories and break the emotions/actions loop.

If you want more positive results from your crucial conversations, change the stories you tell yourself, even in the heat of the moment.

### Skills for Mastering Your Stories

To slow down your story-telling process and adrenaline rush, retrace your Path to Action one step at a time (going backward to the triggering event, starting with how you’re behaving):

  * **Act** : Examine your behavior. Ask: How am I acting — with silence or violence?
  * **Feel** : Identify your feelings. Ask: What emotions are driving me to act this way?
  * **Tell story** : Question your stories. What story is creating these emotions?
  * **See/hear** : Examine the facts. What observable evidence (which can be seen/heard) do I have to support this story?



By retracing your path, you enable yourself to think about, question, and change one of more of the elements.

**Examine Your Behavior**

If you realize you’re slipping into silence or violence (being verbally aggressive), stop and take stock. Take an honest look at what you’re doing. Don’t try to justify your actions. If you tell yourself your violent behavior is a necessary tactic, you won’t see the need to reconsider your actions.

To be objective, **consider how others would see your actions**

**Identify Your Feelings**

After examining your behavior, the next step in retracing your path is exploring your feelings.

Identifying your emotions can be difficult — many people can’t accurately describe their feelings. They might say they’re angry when they’re feeling embarrassment and surprise. Or they might not realize it when they’re angry.

To develop emotional literacy:

  * When experiencing strong emotions, stop and think about your feelings.
  * Use specific, accurate descriptions (rather than saying something general, like you’re bummed out).
  * Talk openly with others about how you feel. 
  * Expand your emotional vocabulary by learning to specifically describe a range of feelings.



Knowing what you’re really feeling helps you take a more accurate look at what is going on and why. You’re more likely to take an honest look at the story you’re telling yourself if you can admit your true feelings.

#### Question Your Stories

Once you’ve identified what you’re feeling, stop and ask: Is that the right emotion under the circumstances? Challenge the illusion that what you’re feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances.

**By questioning your feelings, you open yourself up to question your stories**. Question whether the emotions and the story behind them (which is only one of many possible explanations) are accurate.

**Don’t confuse stories with facts** : When you generate stories instantly, you get so caught up in the moment that you begin to believe your stories are facts. You confuse subjective conclusions with data/facts. (Remember: Stories are our interpretations of facts.)

#### Examine the facts

**Focus on what’s observable** , for instance on what someone said or did. Ask yourself: Am I focusing on an actual behavior or a conclusion? What somebody did is objective and verifiable. What you think about what the person did is a subjective conclusion.

Watch for emotionally charged terms: She _scowled_ at me; he made a _sarcastic_ comment (these express judgments). Judgments and attributions create strong emotions; they are stories, not facts. Less volatile descriptions allow for broader interpretations of someone’s behavior.

**Beware of ‘Clever Stories’**

Our stories fall into one of two categories:

  * Accurate stories that motivate constructive behavior. 
  * Inaccurate stories that justify our current behavior so there’s no need to change.



The second category comprises clever stories, which**allow us to feel good about behaving badly.**

They often start with a sellout — an instance in which we’ve consciously acted against what we know is right. For example our sellout may be that we refused to let someone merge into traffic when we should have. After the fact, we tell a story characterizing the other person as a bad driver to justify our rude behavior.

Other common sellouts:

  * You should help someone but you don’t.
  * You should apologize but don’t.
  * You should listen but become defensive instead.
  * You recognize problems but don’t speak up.



You can either own up to your sellout or try to justify it. **Instead of admitting errors, we often tell clever stories to justify them.**

Clever stories take three basic forms.

**1\. Victim stories — It’s not my fault:** With**** victim stories you portray yourself as innocent. Someone else did something and you’re suffering as a result.

Sometimes, you may be an innocent victim, but more often you intentionally ignore the role you played in the problem. You tell your story in a way that avoids addressing what you did that might have contributed to the problem.

For example, you complain that your boss disrespected you or treated you unfairly when she took you off a big project. But you neglect to acknowledge that you contributed to the situation by not letting her know you were behind on the work, leaving her in the lurch.

**2\. Villain stories — It’s someone else’s fault:** You may also create stories that portray others as villains. You exaggerate your own innocence by overemphasizing the other person’s guilt or stupidity.

For example, You might describe a boss who is gung ho about quality as a control freak who likes to make employees miserable, rather than acknowledge making mistakes yourself. Labeling (e.g. control freak) is common in villain stories. It’s a way of dehumanizing people, so you feel OK about attacking them.

Victim and villain stories reflect a double standard — when you make a mistake, you’re a victim; when others make mistakes they’re villains for inconveniencing or hurting you.

**3\. Helpless stories:** You portray yourself as powerless to do anything constructive. You convince yourself you have no good alternatives, which justifies your actions.

For example, you might say: “If I didn’t yell, he wouldn’t listen,” or “If I confronted the boss, she’d get angry at me.”

Victim and villain stories explain why we’re in the situation we’re in. Helpless stories explain why we can’t do anything to change our situation.

Helpless stories often grow from villain stories and offer fool’s choices — we can be honest and ruin the relationship or stay silent and suffer. We attribute unchangeable traits to others. For example, we claim that because a colleague is a control freak (villain story), we can’t give her feedback; control freaks can’t handle it. We can’t change that (helpless story).

**Why We Resort to Clever Stories**

  * Sometimes they’re true — we really are an innocent victim or maybe we really can’t do much to change the situation.
  * Clever stories excuse us from any responsibility, when we are partially responsible. 
  * We can’t admit we’re wrong: Instead we emphasize others’ faults and our innocence and powerlessness.
  * We did something we feel a need to justify. We sold out in some way, by acting against our own good judgment or conscience.



**Tell the Full Story**

Once you learn to recognize the clever stories you tell yourself, you can learn the final skill for mastering your stories: Changing clever stories into useful stories. Telling a useful story instead creates emotions that lead to constructive actions, such as dialogue.

**The key to transforming a clever or self-justifying story into a useful one is telling the full story.** Clever stories leave out important information about ourselves, others, and about our options. They become useful stories when we add the missing information.

When you fill in the missing details, victims become actors, villains are humans, and helplessness is replaced with action.

**1\. Victims become actors:** When you start describing yourself as a victim, ask: What’s my role in the problem?

Maybe you did something to help cause the problem, not necessarily from malicious motives, but perhaps from thoughtlessness. Considering your own role helps you see how you’ve minimized your mistakes and exaggerated the role of others.

For example, you may be upset because a coworker always seems to leave the difficult or less desirable tasks for you. But the missing detail is that you’ve never spoken up about it or made any attempt to learn why she does this.

**2\. Villains become humans:** When you find yourself blaming others, stop and ask: **Why would a reasonable person do this?** There are a variety of possible reasons for everything. Asking this question helps us to humanize others, and to assume personal accountability.

The point is not to excuse others’ bad behavior but to address our own stories and emotions.

Considering alternate motives allows us to open our minds and engage in dialogue — so we can learn their true motives.

For example, the coworker who seemed to avoid tough jobs jumped in recently to help you with an important assignment. Your initial reaction was to be suspicious of her motives (maybe she was trying to make you look bad), but on second thought, maybe she really was trying to help you.

**3\. Helpless gives way to action** : When you find yourself wallowing in helplessness you can tell the full story by returning to your original motive. Ask yourself what you really want. Reject the fool’s choice that’s made you feel helpless, by **asking what you should be doing to get what you want**.

By refusing helplessness and blaming others you force yourself to use your dialogue skills to address a problem rather than complaining about it.

For example, instead of feeling helpless to do anything about your coworker’s unhelpful behavior, you could prioritize your desire to have good work relationships and talk with her about how you could both contribute to this goal.

### Maria’s Useful Story

Returning to the example at the beginning of this chapter, in which Maria is upset with Louis for excluding her from the presentation they both work on, here’s how she could change her story.

  * She could acknowledge her role in not speaking up about her frustration.
  * Ask herself why a rational person would do what he did: Maybe he just got carried away in his enthusiasm for the project.
  * Ask herself what she really wants: A good working relationship, and recognition for her work.
  * Ask herself what she should do to achieve those results: Make an appointment to talk about how they can work better together.



So Maria scheduled a meeting, which she could go into with an open mind after going through the above process. Louis apologized for dominating the presentation, acknowledging that he talks too much when he gets nervous.They agreed to split future presentations into two halves, with each presenting a part.

By telling the full story we stop nonconstructive emotions and behaviors. We regain control and return to dialogue; we master our stories and emotions.
