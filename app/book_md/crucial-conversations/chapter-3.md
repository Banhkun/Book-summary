## Chapter 3: Know Your Heart

Learning dialogue skills starts with diligent self-examination because if you don’t understand yourself, you can’t be fully effective at dialogue.

**In crucial conversations, you’ll revert to tactics you grew up with** (debate, silent treatment, manipulation, etc.). You need to understand your tendencies in order to counteract them and learn new skills.

You also need to be able to see how you’re contributing to the problems you’re experiencing. In disagreements, it’s human nature to focus on what you think someone else is doing wrong. But **when you focus on blaming or finding fault, you lose track of what you really want, to your detriment**.

For example, two children who get into a fight over who should be first to use the bathroom forgot their objective (using the bathroom) when they became focused on winning the argument. As a result, they prolonged their misery.

It’s important to begin high-risk discussions with the heart (with the right motives) and stay focused no matter what happens.

You do this by making two heart-based assumptions:

  1. **First, you must know what you want, and despite temptations, stick with your goals.**
  2. **Second, don’t make fool’s choices (either/or choices). Rather than choosing between fight and flight, realize that dialogue is always an option.**



> **Example: Greta the CEO**
> 
> Here’s an example of how switching your motives unconsciously due to emotion can affect your ability to stay in productive conversation.
> 
> Greta, a corporate CEO, has been trying for months to get her top managers to cut costs, but they’ve been dragging their feet. During a crucial conversation on the problem, a manager explains frankly why progress hasn’t been made: Greta herself is the roadblock.
> 
> The manager explains that while Greta says she wants her team to cut expenses, everyone knows that she’s spending money building and decorating a new office for herself, which comes across as hypocritical. Greta responds to the manager’s honesty by tensing up, looking as if she is under attack, and starting to point a finger. Her motive has changed: She is no longer focused on cost-cutting but on reasserting her authority or worse.

When you come under pressure in a discussion, if you’re not alert to your emotions, you may forget your original purpose (understanding and solving a problem by creating a shared pool of information) and switch to winning, punishing, or keeping the peace.

  * **Winning:** Winning is praised in sports, movies, and TV. We learn at an early age that we have to outdo/beat our fellow students, and get the teacher’s attention with the right answer. But the desire to win short-circuits dialogue. You start with the goal of resolving a problem, but as soon as someone challenges you, you switch your purpose to winning.
  * **Punishing**. As your anger at being challenged builds, you may want to discredit the other person or put them in their place, again straying from your original purpose.
  * **Keeping the peace** : When a conversation gets uncomfortable, you may withdraw or go quiet, choosing peace over further conflict. But you likely won’t avoid a negative result in the end. For example, had no one spoken up at Greta’s meeting for fear of conflict, the results would have been negative nonetheless: She wouldn’t have learned the real issue, and her managers would have continued to resist cutting costs.



Here’s how to stay focused on your original goals/motives for the conversation, and avoid getting sidetracked by a desire to win or by some other motive: Focus on what you really want, and refuse the fool’s choice.

### Remember What You Really Want

#### Reboot

Stopping and asking yourself a question can redirect your thinking when heat starts to build — for instance when someone strongly disagrees with you. **Stop and remind yourself of what you really want**. Then ask whether you’re starting to change your goal to something else. What you’re feeling and doing are clues. Under the influence of adrenaline your motives change without conscious thought.

Once you zero in on your shifting motives you can choose to change them. **Remind yourself of your original purpose**(what you want from the conversation for yourself and others), then consider how you should behave to achieve your purpose. Ask yourself, **“how should I behave, if I _actually_ wanted my results?”**

#### Stay on Track

Taking the wrong path can be tempting. You may try to pick a fight, or succumb to your ingrained desire to win. Again, remind yourself of what you’re trying to accomplish in the conversation, and stay on track.

#### Be Aware of Your Body

Under pressure, your body reacts. If you catch this happening, you can switch your brain from a fight or flight response to problem-solving mode. When posed a demanding question, your body sends blood to the brain to help you think and away from the parts of the body that prep for fight or flight.

Asking questions about what you want reminds you of your goal and resets your brain in a way that helps keep you focused on dialogue.

> Example: Greta the CEO (cont’d)
> 
> In the preceding example of the uncomfortable managers’ meeting, here’s what happened. Greta dodged the bullet by stopping her initial anger and **remembering what she really wanted from the conversation** : Her goal was to encourage the managers to embrace the cost-reduction efforts.
> 
> When she realized that the barrier was the staff’s belief that she was a hypocrite, she went from feeling angry to being grateful that by speaking up her manager had given her the opportunity to address the problem. Instead of expressing anger, she expressed openness and interest.
> 
> She explained that her new office was part of a marketing effort to create a different image.
> 
> However, she admitted that she hadn’t paid enough attention to the cost. A candid conversation followed and they agreed to move ahead with the building project, but to cut costs in half.
> 
> Because Greta remained focused on her motive instead of being derailed by anger, she got the results (cost reductions) she was seeking.

### Reject the Fool’s Choice

Often when our adrenaline starts pumping, our brain function stalls and we feel forced to choose between only two bad alternatives. But this either/or belief gets us sidetracked and can kill dialogue.

For example, when a group of teachers met to discuss curriculum changes, one of them — an older, experienced teacher — digressed from the topic and rambled to the point that a younger teacher became frustrated and interrupted him rudely and offensively. The younger teacher made a fool’s choice — he was disrespectful because he thought his only choices were rudeness or not speaking up, thus allowing the unproductive conversation to continue.

But instead of focusing on only those two options, the young teacher should have set aside his emotions and asked himself what he wanted for himself and the relationship. **He could have maintained his relationship with his older colleague, while also speaking up in a respectful way** — helping the older man to clarify and focus his points, to add his meaning to the shared pool.

When you refuse the fool’s choice at an emotional time, and return to the question of what you really want, your brain responds with better options. You can share your concerns, listen to others’ concerns, _and_ build your relationship at the same time.

#### Give Yourself New Choices

You can refuse fool’s choices by coming up with new choices. You do this by going through a thought process that moves you from either/or to _and_. Here’s how it works.

  * **Reiterate what you really want.** If you know what you want for yourself, others, and your relationship, you can avoid the fool’s choice, For example, if your husband isn’t following through on commitments to you, you can state your desire as: I want my husband to be more reliable. 
  * **State what you _don’t_ want. **What is the outcome you most want to avoid? For example, I _don’t want_ to have an angry and useless conversation with my husband that creates bad feelings and doesn’t lead to change.
  * **Combine the two statements into an _and_ question.** For example, how can I have an honest conversation with my husband about being more dependable, _and_ avoid creating bad feelings or wasting our time? When you ask yourself if you can accomplish both, you realize you can.
