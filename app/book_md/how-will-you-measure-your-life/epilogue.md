## Epilogue

The theories in this book won’t be of any use to you unless you have a purpose, or an understanding of what you’re trying to achieve in your life. For the theories to help you make decisions by predicting outcomes, you need a basis for weighing potential outcomes.

For a business, having a clear purpose drives executive decisions and keeps employees focused on what's important to the company. Similarly, you need a purpose for your life, against which to weigh decisions.

**A company’s purpose provides three things:**

1) A model or picture of what the company will look like or be when it has achieved its goals

2) The full commitment of executives and employees to the model they’re trying to create (no one compromises on it under any circumstances)

3) Several metrics the company’s leaders and employees can use to measure progress individually and collectively

Companies that want to have an impact need to choose a purpose deliberately—it won’t just materialize—then pursue it with a strategy that accommodates both a deliberate plan and emergent opportunities.

### Your Life Purpose

Similarly, you need to choose your own purpose (decide what kind of person you want to be and what you want to achieve in your life), and pursue it with an evolving strategy. The same elements that comprise a company’s purpose—a model, commitment, metrics—should be part of your purpose.

As an example of how to do this, here’s how Christensen applied the formula:

#### Model

Christensen based his answer for who he wanted to become on his values of family and faith:

  * Someone who helps improve others’ lives
  * A husband, father, and friend who is kind, honest, forgiving, and generous
  * Someone who is guided by God



#### Commitment

Deep commitment to the above values guides Christensen’s daily priorities—what he chooses to do and not do.

#### Metrics

This metric is the yardstick you’ll use to measure your life. Christensen decided to measure or assess his life by the number of people he helps to grow and become better people. This metric leads him to constantly look for ways to help others.

Figuring out your purpose in life gives you a framework for making sense of every other decision and circumstance. The theories and knowledge presented in this book can help guide your career, relationships, and ethics, but your purpose is your North Star.

(Shortform note: For more on defining your own and your company’s purpose, read our summary of Start With Why, by Simon Sinek, here.)
