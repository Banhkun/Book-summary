## Exercise: Build Your Children's Capabilities

Parents need to ensure that the experiences they provide challenge children to take responsibility, do difficult things, and create or invent things. These help children develop processes theyâ€™ll need in the future.

* * *

List the two to three most important experiences/activities you are providing to your children (for example, music lessons, church activities, chores, or sports). Why did you choose these activities?

What are some process capabilities your children need for the future? Processes are ways a child uses her resources to do or create something new. Processes include how she thinks, questions, and solves problems.

Do the experiences listed above help your children build process capabilities? If so, how? If not, what specific experiences can you provide to help your children build process capabilities?
