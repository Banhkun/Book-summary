## Part 1 | Chapter 1: Finding Happiness in Your Career

We all have ideas as kids about what will make us happy in life, but our dreams give way to compromises when we become adults. As a result, many people pick jobs and careers for the wrong reasons. As time goes on, you settle for what you have, accepting that doing what you love isn’t a realistic option.

But you don’t have to settle—the key to finding happiness in your career is creating a strategy for where you want to go and how to get there. The next few chapters focus on how to build such a strategy.

### Start With a Strategy

In business and life, several steps create a strategy:

  * Determining priorities
  * Balancing plans with opportunities and challenges
  * Allocating your resources



**Your strategy is continuously evolving: As it takes shape, new information, problems, and opportunities come up that you need to incorporate.** When you proactively manage this strategy process, you have a good chance of building a career you love. Here’s a closer look at this process:

**Priorities** : The starting point is setting priorities—identifying the factors or criteria most important to you in a career. This requires understanding motivational theory and how it applies to you, because people’s reasons for choosing a job often don’t align with what really makes them happy (what drives or motivates them). Often, you don’t realize this until you’re stuck.

**Opportunities and Challenges** : Next, you need an understanding of how to adjust your career plans when unexpected opportunities and challenges come up. Some people have a plan for the next five years, while others just play it by ear. Either way can work, but theory can guide you by indicating when you should be methodical and stick to your plan, and when you should be open to unexpected or emergent opportunities (covered in Chapter 2).

**Resources** : Finally, to implement your strategy you need an understanding of how to support it with your resources. You’ll have to decide among many demands—people often devote their time to whatever seems most urgent or what delivers the most-immediate rewards, but this gets them off track. You must use your resources in ways consistent with your intentions.

With the right strategy, you don’t have to settle—you can find true happiness in your career. This chapter will focus on the first step of creating a career strategy: determining priorities.

### Theories of Motivation

To set the right priorities, you need to understand the theories of motivation. **When you feel unhappy and stuck in your career or life, it’s usually because what you’re doing isn’t what really motivates you.** Whether you’re motivated (or not) at work affects how you interact with your boss and colleagues, as well as whether you’re happy.

Many people think incentives are the key to being satisfied at work, and they opt for jobs on the basis of the incentives they offer. Similarly, companies offer incentives in hopes of getting employees to do what they want them to. Both employees and employers are likely to be disappointed because **incentives don’t make people happy in their jobs.**

The first step to figuring out what motivates you is understanding two theories of motivation: the incentive theory and the two-factor motivation theory.

#### 1) Incentive Theory

The incentive theory argues that people do what you pay them to do (that is, they do what it's in their financial interest to do). For example, if you want executives to act in the best interests of shareholders, then align their interests with those of shareholders—for instance, tie executive compensation to stock prices so that execs make more money when stock prices go up (making shareholders happy). Executives focus on what their financial incentives tell them to.

This theory of aligning interests with incentives has been the rationale for huge executive compensation packages. Managers often adopt the same approach. It’s appealing because it’s simple—you can basically manage people by a formula.

Even parents often use incentives in an effort to get the behavior they want from kids—for instance, offering money for good grades.

But there’s a flaw in the incentive theory. It can’t explain why people working for nonprofits or serving in the military work hard without incentives or substantial pay. If not money, what motivates them? Another theory explains it.

#### 2) The Two-Factor Theory

This theory by Frederick Herzberg argues that certain factors in the workplace cause job dissatisfaction, while other factors cause satisfaction; the two sets of factors work independently of each other.

**The first set is hygiene factors** : These are things that, if not handled properly, will generate dissatisfaction. They include compensation, job security, status, work environment, manager practices, and company policies. Companies have to address these factors or people will be dissatisfied.

**Pay is a hygiene factor (not an incentive). It has to be sufficient to prevent dissatisfaction—however, it won’t create satisfaction**. Improving hygiene factors removes dissatisfaction, but it doesn’t make people happier or more satisfied. Dissatisfaction and satisfaction are separate measures, rather than existing on a continuum from unhappy to happy.

**The second set of factors—those that create satisfaction—is motivators** : These are things that make people love their jobs, including challenging work, responsibility, learning, the chance to grow, and the chance to make a meaningful contribution. The motivating factors are mostly inherent in the work itself and in the person doing it, rather than external like hygiene factors.

(Shortform note: For more on how motivation works, read our summary of Drive, by Daniel H. Pink, here.)

### Career Unhappiness

Motivation theory explains why many of Christensen’s classmates were unhappy in their careers—they chose them primarily on hygiene factors like compensation and job security, perhaps for good reasons such as paying off college loans, affording mortgages, and supporting a family.

But they’d gone to business school for reasons driven by motivation factors, not hygiene factors—for example, becoming entrepreneurs or solving social problems. Many people told themselves they’d stay in an unsatisfying job just for a few years until they became established financially. But as their incomes grew and they established commensurate lifestyles, they became dependent on their jobs and began to resent them, knowing they chose the jobs for the wrong reasons.

Money in itself isn’t to blame for professional dissatisfaction—it’s when people make money their highest priority, and continue to focus on making more money as the only goal after hygiene factors have been met. In some professions—for instance, trading—money is an indicator of success (traders make big money when they’re right). But people are nonetheless unhappy when they don’t have other motivators.

### Applying the Theory

The two-factor motivation theory suggests that **when seeking a job or career that will make you happy, you should look beyond whether a job meets basic hygiene factors and ask whether it meets motivational criteria.** For instance, ask yourself:

  * Do I find this work meaningful?
  * Will I be able to learn and grow?
  * What are the opportunities to achieve and be recognized?
  * What kind of responsibility will I have?



It’s easy to fixate on the perks of success—salary, title, office—thinking they’ll make you happy, especially when friends and family see them as indicators that you’re a success. But focusing on hygiene factors beyond a basic level triggers a never-ending quest for more.

Don’t confuse correlation with causality in considering whether you’ll be happy in a job—hygiene factors such as money may correlate with a job you like, but they’re not what generates happiness; they’re more of a byproduct.

**Focus on the factors that make you love coming to work each day** —and the hygiene factors, after a certain point, will take care of themselves. When you love coming to work, you have an advantage over people just putting in their time: You’ll be motivated to do your best, and you’ll excel at what you do.
