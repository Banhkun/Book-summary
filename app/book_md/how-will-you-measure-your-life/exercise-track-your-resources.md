## Exercise: Track Your Resources

Where you apply your resources (time, talent, energy, money), intentionally or unintentionally, is your real strategy. It’s the accumulation of your daily decisions and actions. Follow the flow of your resources to determine whether you’re on track for where you say you want to go.

* * *

List the main things or pursuits in your life that compete for your attention and resources. What percentage of your time and money do you allocate to each in a given day or week?

How does this allocation align with your beliefs about what’s most important in your life?

Is there anything you would like to change? Why or why not?
