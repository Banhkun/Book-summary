## Part 2 | Chapter 4: Finding Happiness in Your Relationships

The chapters in this section of the book show how personal relationship challenges are similar to the problems many businesses face. The same theories that apply to businesses can help you strengthen and nurture your relationships, whether you want to be a better spouse, parent, or friend.

### Invest in Your Relationships

As we discussed in Chapter 3, many people over-invest in their careers at the expense of their families and relationships.

However, your career, by itself, won’t bring you happiness and fulfillment. Your career priorities are just part of a larger set of priorities, including your spouse, children, friends, faith, health, and so on. Work can be rewarding, but it doesn’t compare to the deep happiness you experience in relationships.

Like your career, your relationships need consistent attention. But two things work against this:

  * **You’re tempted to invest your resources where you see an immediate payoff** ; careers provide immediate rewards, while the payoff from investing in your relationships doesn’t show up until later.
  * **You pay less attention to friends and family because they’re less demanding than your boss.** Because they love you and know your career is important to you, they want to be supportive. This can lull you into thinking things are going well at home and you can put your relationships on the back burner. You may not realize you have a relationship problem until it’s too late to fix it.



### The Good Money/Bad Money Theory

**The good money/bad money theory of focusing on immediate versus long-term rewards explains why you need to nurture your relationships from the start.**

Generally, investors have two goals: growth and profit. According to the theory of good and bad capital:

  * Good money is money from investors who are willing to wait patiently for growth in the size of the company, but who are hungry for profit in the short term. (Early profit is crucial because initial strategies often fail, and you need to have money left over to try a new approach.) These investors have their eye on the company’s future.
  * In contrast, bad money is money that comes from investors who demand short-term growth over long-term sustainability. (Prioritizing growth over profit is bad because it's more expensive to fund a large company and large companies are harder to change.) When impatient or bad investors drive the company’s strategy, the business often fails. 



Here are two examples of how good and bad capital affect companies:

  * When Honda entered the U.S. market, it followed the good-money theory. It waited patiently for growth while it figured out its profit model of switching from its initial strategy of competing with Harley-Davidson to creating and filling a market niche for dirt bikes. Pursuing immediate growth by pouring more money into the failing big motorcycles would have been driving strategy with bad money.
  * In contrast, bad money sank a company called Iridium, which sold mobile phones connected by a network of satellites enabling people to call each other from anywhere. Early investors poured in bad money, seeking big growth before the company had figured out how to be sustainable for the long term. But there were problems with the early phones and system, and the company soon declared bankruptcy (Shortform note: Later efforts to reorganize the company and improve the technology were successful.) 



### Applying the Theory

Like investors who prioritize short-term growth over long-term sustainability,**people often take a bad money approach in their personal lives, opting to invest in immediate rewards.**

For example, you might devote all your attention to a demanding job you enjoy, to the point that work becomes your identity. You skip vacation or work while on vacation, and you check your phone constantly. You expect family and friends to understand that your work takes precedence. You forget family members’ birthdays and neglect to return emails and calls from friends. As a result, you’ll experience the same consequences as a business does that fails to invest in the future—your relationships will erode and eventually fail.

While your intended strategy may be to have strong relationships, the strategy you implement is one that creates shallow relationships and problems. When you don’t invest, you don’t get returns; **you have to invest in your relationships well before you need them, like planting a tree long before you expect it to produce shade**. In their later years, many people regret not keeping in touch with friends and family, who then aren’t there as they face struggles.

### Invest in Your Children

**People who are achievement-driven often mistakenly believe they can sequence their investment in their personal lives** , especially when it comes to children. For example, you might think you can focus on your career when your kids are small, then shift your attention to them when they’re older and start interacting more with adults.

However, if you wait until they’re older, you’ll have lost critical developmental time that you can’t get back. It’s crucial that parents devote time to children from the earliest months of life. Research shows that parental interaction is particularly important in cognitive development. The first year of life is the most important time for children to hear words. The number of words they hear earlier in life correlates with later school performance on vocabulary and reading comprehension tests.

The way parents speak also matters, according to research. Simple directions like “finish your milk” have little effect on cognitive development. However, face-to-face conversations in adult language, commenting on what you’re doing or asking questions, have a huge impact. Such conversations play a bigger role in children’s cognitive development than income, ethnicity, or parents’ education.

Parents who don’t invest early in their children’s intellectual development miss a critical opportunity to give them an edge when they start school. **You can’t defer investing in your children and relationships and expect to make it up later.**
