## Chapter 3: Align Resources With Priorities

You can have a life strategy, understand your priorities and what motivates you, and adjust your plans for unexpected opportunities. But **your stated strategy isn’t the one shaping your life unless it’s where you’re putting your resources—your energy, time, and money**.

Resource allocation is the third component of your strategy: Where you spend your resources, intentionally or unintentionally, is your real strategy. It’s the accumulation of your daily decisions and actions. Follow the flow of your resources to determine whether you’re on track for where you say you want to go.

### The Problem of Misaligned Resources

Keeping resources in alignment with strategy is a challenge for companies as well as individuals. There are many ways an unintended strategy can take over in a company, including:

**1) Companies undermine their own strategy by incentivizing the wrong employee behaviors.**

  * **Example** : Sonosite, a company that made ultrasound machines, sold two models: a larger, more expensive one and a small, cheaper handheld one. Although the small one had greater market potential and the company wanted to boost its sales, they found that salespeople were pushing only the bigger machine. The reason was that their commissions were based on the total value of their sales—and they made more money selling the bigger machines. What made sense from the CEO’s perspective didn’t make sense from the salesperson’s perspective, which was driven by the resource allocation.



**2) Short-term interests with immediate rewards take precedence over a company’s long-term success strategy.**

  * **Example** : Unilever, a producer of personal care products, had a leadership development program, in which participants worked on new products and processes. However, since success in the program determined their chances of promotion, they focused on short-term products and processes delivering quick results instead of those that would assure the company’s future success. And when they became senior leaders, they continued in that mindset. The company seldom hit home runs or had big successes because their training program encouraged participants to hit singles.



**3) Employees act independently of company strategy.**

  * **Example** : In the 1990s, when Apple forced out Steve Jobs, it ran into problems with its next-generation operating system, Copland, because not everyone was on the same page. Without Jobs enforcing discipline and focus on the project, engineers devoted their energies to other ideas they were more interested in working on, even though management kept stressing Copland’s importance. Eventually, the company scrapped the project. When Jobs returned in 1997, he got everyone allocating their resources in a way that aligned with Apple’s priorities, which were: 
    * Make the best products in the world.
    * Change how people think about using technology.
    * Provide a great user experience.



### Applying the Theory

Resource allocation works the same way in your life and career as it does in companies. **Your personal resources include your energy, time, talent, and wealth**. You apply them to various enterprises in your life: your relationship with your spouse, parenting, relationships with others, succeeding in your career, health and personal interests, and contributing to your community.

All of these things compete for your attention, requiring countless daily allocation decisions—for instance, should you stay an extra hour at work because you have momentum on a project, or do something your family needs your help with?

You’ll allocate your resources unthinkingly unless you pay attention to your strategy and manage your resources accordingly. How you allocate them may make the difference between a life of fulfillment or one of frustration.

Much unhappiness stems from prioritizing short-term goals, such as a bonus, promotion, or upscale lifestyle, rather than long-term objectives, such as a good marriage and raising children to be good people. In trying to earn more to provide more for their families, some people neglect to spend time with them. In practice, they allocate diminishing resources to the things, like their relationships, which they say matter the most to them. They’re implementing a different strategy than the intended one. **If the way you use your resources doesn’t reflect the person you want to be, you won’t be that person**.
