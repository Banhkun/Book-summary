## Exercise: Challenge Racism

Think about how you can push back against racist social conditioning.

* * *

Have you ever engaged in “race talk”? If so, briefly describe what was discussed and how discussions like these contribute to the reinforcement of the racial hierarchy.

Have you ruled out living in certain areas because of bad schools or declining property values? Do you think your concerns were warranted? Explain why or why not.

Whether or not you think your concerns were warranted, how do you think your actions, and the similar actions of other white people, have impacted the racial makeup of the communities you've ruled out?
