## 1-Page Summary

In _White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk About Racism_ , author and anti-racist educator Robin DiAngelo explores **white fragility—the phenomenon by which white people become angry, defensive, or hostile when confronted with the idea that they are complicit in systemic racism.** As a white woman herself, DiAngelo documents the ways in which white Americans are unable to emotionally withstand even minor amounts of racially triggered stress and retreat into a defensive posture when forced to discuss racism.

_White Fragility_ is written for white people who consider themselves to be liberal or progressive on racial matters. **Like all white people, white progressives are raised in a society that is institutionally racist.** By this, we mean a society in which all key political, economic, social, and cultural institutions are overwhelmingly controlled by white people. This disproportionate share of power is the product of centuries of history during which people of color (especially black people) were systematically enslaved, expropriated, disenfranchised, segregated, and marginalized. As a result, white control of society became the “normal” or “standard” state of affairs.

Being raised in such a society with such a history leaves an indelible mark on white people, even those white progressives who believe they stand in opposition to it. _Everyone_ is socialized by the conditions that surround them—and in the American context, those conditions have always placed white people in a superior position and black and brown people in an inferior position. Simply _being_ white in such a society confers an incalculable advantage.

### Misdefining Racism

White _progressives_ , however, believe themselves to stand in opposition to racism. Because of their own belief in their moral superiority relative to _other_ white people, however, progressives often become extremely defensive or outraged at the mere suggestion that they, too, benefit from (and, therefore, contribute to) institutional racism. **The gap between their professed beliefs and their participation (however unwitting) in a system of oppression becomes an unbearable psychological burden—triggering white fragility.**

This stems from how white people in general tend to define racism as a personal character trait. For them, it is something mean and cruel done by mean and cruel people, usually involving explicit and open hostility toward people of color. But this definition of racism is wrong. Racism is _not_ an individual character trait. The discussion of whether or not an individual white person is or is not “racist” entirely misses the point about how racism actually works.

**Racism is inherently about _power_ within society—wielded _collectively_ by those who have it against those who don’t. **It is deeply embedded in the social, political, cultural, economic, and legal power structures of the United States. White people, as the group that has always wielded power in America, derive enormous material and psychological advantages from this racist organization of society—whether they believe they do or not.

### The Myth of Individualism

The belief in individualism is a central part of American ideology.**** It is the belief that individuals have full agency to shape the outcomes in their lives. According to individualism, no one faces any barriers on the way to achievement that are not of their own making.

**Individualism is a comforting and validating belief—for white people, who sit atop the nation’s economic and political power structures.** It tells them that their success and advantages in life are entirely the result of their own hard work, intelligence, and initiative.

But individualism sends a very different message to people of color. If powerful and successful people are powerful and successful because of their own merits as individuals, then it can only follow that _powerless_ and _unsuccessful_ people are in that condition because they are somehow “lesser” individuals. By its very nature, a belief in individualism renders one incapable of acknowledging the structural power disparities within society that lead to inequitable outcomes for different groups.

#### No One Is Objective

White beliefs in objectivity are closely related to the myth of individualism. Because white people believe that they are unique individuals unshaped by history or society, they also come to believe that their views of the world are entirely objective. If you don’t believe you’re conditioned by society or any other external forces, you can’t accept the reality of your own biases.

**Being asked to confront one’s actions and beliefs as racist can be deeply upsetting to white people, because it punctures their myth of objectivity.** It suggests that one does _not_ have complete autonomy over how one thinks and acts—but, rather, that one ventures out into the world profoundly shaped by forces beyond one’s control.

### The Origins of Race

**Modern notions of race really started during the age of European colonization of the Americas, which began in the 16th century.** Europeans kidnapped black Africans and transported them across the Atlantic Ocean to perform slave labor in the New World. Ideas of race arose from _these_ historical traditions. Notions of racial superiority (for white people) and inferiority (for non-white peoples, chiefly those of African descent) emerged to _justify_ the brutal system of exploitation. If black people were morally and intellectually inferior, then it was not immoral to enslave and kill them.

It is important to remember that this social construction of race _preceded_ racism—indeed, it was essential to it. **Our notions of race are inextricably linked to centuries’ worth of ideas and practices about who should and should not wield power in society.**

### Colorblindness: Denying Race, Denying Racism

**White people are socially conditioned from birth to accept and support white supremacy**. Although overt expressions of racism on the part of white people have been taboo since the Civil Rights Era, white society has failed to recognize the pervasiveness of institutional racism in American life. One common manifestation of this is the widespread claim by white people that they are “colorblind” or “don’t see race.”

**Colorblindness enables white Americans to delude themselves into believing that they can avoid problems of race by simply pretending that they didn’t exist**. But race profoundly shapes the experiences, views, and expectations of everyone in society. It is simply impossible for a white person raised in a society organized on the basis of institutional racism to not “see” race.

And even if it were possible, colorblindness would not be a desirable goal, because the experiences of people of color _are_ inevitably defined by race. **To deny the existence of race or to minimize its importance is to deny the existence of racism itself—and thus give implicit assent to it.** A white person who professes to not see race unsurprisingly becomes defensive and agitated when the realities of institutional racism—and their responsibility for it as a beneficiary of it—are explained to them.

### Race Talk

**Because they are conditioned by a structurally racist society, white people act in myriad ways to bolster institutional racism.** One example is the way that white people speak to each other about racial topics—often without ever explicitly mentioning race at all. This phenomenon is known as “race talk.”

White people will engage in race talk on the topic of black crime by expressing concern about the “character” of a neighborhood, the test scores at a local school, or declining property values. Race does not have to be mentioned at all. It is assumed by all white participants in such a conversation that these negative attributes like crime are definitionally tied to blackness. This is despite the fact that studies of census data and crime statistics do not support this belief, certainly when controlling for other factors like poverty (although it does not stop police from detaining and imprisoning men of color at far higher levels than their white counterparts). Such conversations serve to reinforce solidarity between white people and solidify white attitudes about the rightful ordering of the racial hierarchy.

These attitudes, in turn, guide white _actions_. Thus, in a phenomenon known as “white flight,” white Americans will leave neighborhoods that are becoming more diverse (one study showed that even a tiny 7 percent African-American population in a neighborhood can trigger white flight), citing the desire to send their children to “good” schools. **Although it’s not spoken, the assumption is that a “good” school is one attended by few minorities.**

#### Racist Jokes and White Solidarity

In 2007, sociologists Leslie Picca and Joe Feagin studied the ways in which white people expressed ideas and attitudes about race to one another. They found that innate beliefs in white supremacy were strong, even among supposedly liberal and progressive white millennials. They found that **white millennials in college settings frequently told racist jokes, all while persisting in the belief that they were more open-minded and tolerant when it came to race.**

Picca and Feagin argued that the telling of such jokes amounted to a performative ritual of white solidarity that strongly reinforced white supremacist beliefs and actions.

### White Denial

White misconceptions about racism inform how white people view people of color (specifically African-Americans) and how they are able to deny their own culpability in reinforcing racial inequity—a culpability that is rarely questioned because of instinctive white fragility.

As discussed, **white people are able to deny the presence of racism because they treat it as specific behaviors committed by specific people** , rather than the structural phenomenon that it actually is. In this incorrect conception of racism, racism functions like an act of criminality. The possibility of it always exists, but it has to be consciously and knowingly “committed” by someone.

#### The Pervasiveness of Institutional Racism

But, again, this is a misunderstanding of racism. Racism is not simply the utterance of racial slurs or acts of racially motivated violence—behaviors, in other words, that are performed by _individuals_. At its most powerful and insidious, racism acts at a collective, societal level.

**Because white people have always been dominant in society, they have not had to confront the consequences or even the _existence_ of their enormous privileges. **This is largely because racism encodes whiteness as the normal or standard condition for society. This pervades even basic language.

The “Americanness” of people of color, for example, is always qualified as “African-American,” “Asian-American,” or “Latin American.” Rarely are white people called “White-American” or “Caucasian-American.” Whiteness is assumed to be standard, normal, and synonymous with American identity itself.

Most importantly, our systems and assumptions determine who controls institutions and, therefore, wields power—this is what is meant by institutional racism. This, in turn, leads to inequitable outcomes for people of color relative to white people.

Indeed, even a cursory look at America’s most powerful institutions shows just how embedded institutional racism is.

  * The ten richest Americans are 100 percent white
  * Congress is 90 percent white
  * Directors of the 100 top-grossing films of all time are 95 percent white



Although this is just a snapshot, it demonstrates how institutional racism pervades and dominates American economic, political, and cultural life. Seeing the overwhelming whiteness of America’s elite (not to mention the dominance of white figures like Washington, Madison, Jefferson, Lincoln, and FDR discussed in history books) sends a powerful signal to children, even at an early age.

#### White Excuses

Many white people claim that by virtue of having black friends, they are free from any charges of responsibility for institutional racism. But **having individual friendships with people of color does not invalidate or cancel out the powerful social conditioning that comes with being raised in a white supremacist society**. This is especially true if white people refuse to discuss race with their friends of color—thereby denying their friends’ lived experiences.

Such claims are merely excuses, refusals to engage in reflection about one’s own participation in a white supremacist society. **Racism is a continuum or a spectrum**. A white person will never be entirely free of racist attitudes, but with honesty and a willingness to question one’s own racially problematic behavior, one can move toward the more just end of the continuum.

### White Comfort

**Because of white fragility, white people react harshly to even the most minor challenges to their status in the racial hierarchy.** In anti-racist or anti-bias training seminars, DiAngelo recounts instances in which white participants were made aware of racially problematic statements or behaviors they’d engaged in during the course of the seminar. Inevitably, no matter how gently and constructively these criticisms were offered, they would be met with some form of hostility or denial.

**These responses invalidate the experiences of people of color and shut down the possibility of real engagement** with the reality that _all_ white people benefit from and continue to uphold white supremacy. They make the common mistake of conflating intention with impact. One’s intentions with regard to people of color are completely irrelevant when they result in racist outcomes.

Some white people even cling to the idea that it is actually _white_ people who face systemic racism rather than people of color (distressingly, a recent social survey found that 55 percent of whites believed this).

#### A Mechanism of Control

But we should not make the mistake of characterizing white fragility as merely a defensive mechanism. Rather, **white fragility is a powerful means of reinforcing white supremacy and shutting down any challenges to it by people of color.**

By casting the _white_ person in the discussion as the victim, white fragility enables white people to command social resources of time and attention. For example, a white woman brought to tears after being forced to confront her complicity in systemic racism might compel other people (even people of color) to comfort and reassure her that she isn’t racist. The _white_ woman and _her_ shame and anxieties become the center of attention.

Or, a white man who reacts angrily and defensively in the same situation will similarly refocus the attention on his angry and bombastic reaction. **These tactics draw attention away from the discussion of systemic racism, shut down potential challenges to it, and make _white_ concerns and _white_ anxieties the focus.**

### Confronting White Fragility

The work of recognizing and shedding (as much as possible) one’s racist conditioning as a white person can be extremely difficult. But it is important to do if you’re serious about your professed opposition to racism. **You cannot tackle systemic racism if you cannot identify and come to terms with the ways in which _you_ unfairly benefit from and perpetuate it.**

Instead of retreating into fragility, look at the feedback, especially when it comes from a person of color, as an opportunity to learn and grow. Your response shouldn’t be, “How dare you!” It should instead be, “Thank you.”

**Racial healing can only begin when white people shed their reflexive defensiveness and build greater capacity to be uncomfortable with examinations of their own privilege** and their contributions to racist power structures. White people must discard the myth that their white racial identity doesn’t exist and accept the truth that it powerfully shapes how they view the world and their role in it.

The discomfort is not incidental—it is key to growth and to uncovering one’s inevitable racial blind spots. The process of disrupting racism, after all, involves acknowledging one’s unfair benefits and advantages as a white person and then working to cede those privileges. It’s not easy—racism is a system from which all white people benefit. If anti-racism entailed zero sacrifice on the part of whites, racism would be far easier to overcome.

**White people have a moral responsibility to educate themselves and take the initiative to disrupt and combat racism wherever they see it.** It is critical that this be a self-directed journey. You as a white person must do the hard work yourself. It is not the responsibility of people of color to guide you through your anti-racist education or to accommodate your white fragility when you are confronted with your own culpability for racism.

This work will often be challenging and difficult, forcing you to grapple with aspects of your own privilege and complicity. But it is necessary work if we as a society are serious about rolling back the legacy of racism.
