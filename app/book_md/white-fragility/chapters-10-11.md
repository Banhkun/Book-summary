## Chapters 10-11: White Racial Stress

In this final chapter, we’ll bring the discussion back to white fragility and how it reinforces racist power structures and racist outcomes:

  * We’ll explore how and why white people react with hostility, denial, and extreme discomfort at even the most minor challenges to their racial position. 
  * We’ll also look at how white fragility places white concerns and white anxieties at the center of any racial discussion—and how it moves those discussions away from a real examination of racism and impacts on people of color.



### White Comfort

**White people react harshly to even the most minor challenges to their status in the racial hierarchy.** In anti-racist or anti-bias training seminars, DiAngelo recounts instances in which white participants were made aware of racially problematic statements or behaviors they’d engaged in during the course of the seminar. Inevitably, no matter how gently and constructively these criticisms were offered, they would be met with the same set of reactions, including:

  * Outright denial;
  * Claims to hurt feelings, physical distress, or having been misunderstood;
  * Arguments that the message was delivered in a hurtful tone, and therefore not valid;
  * Claims that their experiences with _other_ forms of discrimination (like classism, sexism, or homophobia) either supersede racism or make it impossible for one to be racist;
  * Claims that charges of racism are overblown, the product of oversensitivity, or directed at the wrong targets; and
  * Accusations that the person of color making the criticism is the “real” racist for even having a discussion about race at all.



**All of these responses invalidate the experiences of people of color and shut down the possibility of real engagement** with the reality that _all_ white people benefit from and continue to uphold white supremacy. They make the common mistake of conflating intention with impact. One’s intentions with regard to people of color are completely irrelevant when they result in racist outcomes.

### White Fragility: Saving Face

White people lose face from these challenges, because they believe (incorrectly) that they are being attacked personally. In situations where myths of meritocracy are being challenged (as in a discussion of how white people benefit from racially biased hiring decisions, for example), white people may also feel that their sense of having “earned” their position is being called into question.

Unable to reconcile these challenges with their belief that they are good people,**white people retreat into white fragility, which helps them save face**. Many even use the language of violence to describe what they’re feeling when confronted with examples of their own racism, claiming that they feel “assaulted” or “traumatized.” One woman DiAngelo encountered even claimed that she might be suffering a heart attack after hearing that an anecdote she relayed was racially problematic. This woman was saying that even the mere discussion of racism could result in her death.

Some white people even cling to the idea that it is actually _white_ people who face systemic racism rather than people of color (distressingly, a recent social survey found that 55 percent of whites believed this).

#### A Mechanism of Control

But we should not make the mistake of characterizing white fragility as merely a defensive mechanism. Rather, **white fragility is a powerful means of reinforcing white supremacy and shutting down any challenges to it by people of color.**

By casting the _white_ person in the discussion as the victim, white fragility enables white people to command social resources of time and attention. For example, a white woman brought to tears after being forced to confront her complicity in systemic racism might compel other people (even people of color) to comfort and reassure her that she isn’t racist.

Or, a white man who reacts angrily and defensively in the same situation will similarly refocus the attention on his angry and bombastic reaction. **These tactics draw attention away from the discussion of systemic racism, shut down potential challenges to it, and make _white_ concerns and _white_ anxieties the focus.**

Being able to set the terms of discussion, and define what is and is not acceptable, is itself a powerful manifestation of white privilege. White fragility demands that people of color as a means of social, emotional, economic, and even physical survival walk a constant tightrope around their white colleagues and neighbors. The cumulative effect of white fragility is to discourage people of color from challenging white supremacy by dramatically raising the emotional costs of doing so.

#### White Tears

**One common expression of white fragility, especially on the part of white women, is crying.** Author DiAngelo documents several instances during her career as an anti-racist educator in which white women sobbed and broke down upon hearing stories from people of color about their experiences with racism, or hearing about their _own_ culpability for racist outcomes in society.

While these women no doubt felt that their outbursts of emotion came from a genuine place of solidarity and empathy, it was seldom experienced that way by people of color. To them, the crying was self-indulgent behavior that sucked up the energy in the room and redirected the conversation toward the emotional distress of the crying white woman, _not_ the people of color taking great personal risk in sharing their stories of oppression.

White tears are a powerful manifestation of white fragility, a way of neutralizing or stopping a discussion about racism by transforming it into a conversation about an individual white woman’s hurt feelings.

**The trope of a distressed white woman in a racially mixed setting also conjures powerful and traumatic historical memories for people of color, especially black men.** During the era of mass lynchings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, white mobs frequently used the supposed (and often fabricated) threat that black men posed toward white women as a pretext for horrific acts of violence. Thus, black men learned to navigate their role in the racial hierarchy by being especially sensitive to the emotions of white women.

Because of this historical memory, black men often feel they must instinctively minimize white female distress, lest they draw the ire of white _men_ —who see themselves as the protectors of white women and who occupy the dominant position in the gender _and_ racial hierarchies. **The crying reinforces this racial hierarchy by placing white comfort and white feelings front and center, thereby justifying white claims to emotional resources, time, and attention.**

The lesson for white people is clear. Racism hurts and even kills people. Your hurt feelings pale in comparison to the enormous toll of centuries of racism. It’s simply not about you and your sadness.
