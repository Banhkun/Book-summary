## Exercise: Reflect on Your Relationship With Work and Productivity

Headlee argues that because modern society overemphasizes work and productivity, it’s important to be intentional and strategic about how you spend your time to avoid the negative effects of overworking. In this exercise, you’ll explore your relationship with productivity and ways you can incorporate more leisure and social connection into your life.

Reflect on the last week, and list any occasions when you felt like you weren’t being productive enough or like you’d wasted time. What factors do you think caused that feeling? For example, were you experiencing financial stress, comparing yourself to others, or feeling the pressure of cultural norms? If you didn’t experience pressure to be more productive, explain why you think that was the case.

Write down a few fun or restful activities that you’d like to make time for in your schedule. For example, you might want to take a 30-minute walk as a break from work or take a nap to recharge. For every day of the week, write down a leisure activity that you’ll prioritize.

Headlee also identifies non-digital social interaction as a key to well-being in a productivity-obsessed culture. Write down a plan to regularly engage in social time that isn’t text-based and involves speaking to people. For example, you might schedule a monthly game night with friends.

To truly embody Headlee’s advice of embracing leisure, consider spending the next 30 minutes doing fun or restful activities—anything from sitting and staring out the window to listening to music or playing a game with a friend. Write down a few potential activities—make sure they’re activities you enjoy and that don’t have a specific goal attached to them.
