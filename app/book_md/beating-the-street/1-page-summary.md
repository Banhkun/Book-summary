## 1-Page Summary

In _Beating the Street_ , famed mutual fund manager Peter Lynch explores how ordinary investors can outperform the market—and the pricey Wall Street fund managers who assemble stock portfolios—through hard work, diligence, and persistence in picking the right stocks to build a winning portfolio.

Lynch’s key insight, drawn from his decades of success managing the Magellan Fund at Fidelity, is that all the information _anyone_ needs to become a successful investor is readily available—you just need to be willing to put in the hard work to translate that information into well-researched and timely stock investments.

In this guide, we’ll explore Lynch’s strategy by which non-professional, individual investors can beat the pros at their own game, looking at:

  * Why bonds, despite their reputation as a low-risk investment, offer poorer returns than stocks over the long haul
  * Why it’s crucial to do your homework and understand everything about the companies you’re investing in
  * The importance of being patient, persistent, and willing to endure the inevitable short-term losses that come from investing in the stock market



Throughout the guide, we’ll supplement Lynch’s insights with investment advice and perspectives from other investors and financial experts. We’ll also provide some historical context for Lynch’s ideas and explore how the investment world has changed since the book’s publication in 1993—and how those changes might affect today’s investment strategies.

> **Don’t Trust the Stock Gurus—But Don’t Try to Beat the Market Yourself Either**
> 
> In recent years, part of Lynch’s core insight—that professional stockpickers and fund managers are vastly overrated—appears to have largely borne out. One 2022 study of actively managed equities funds (mutual funds composed of individual corporate stocks selected by fund managers) showed that _not one of the 2,000+ funds analyzed delivered higher returns than the market as a whole over the five-year period studied_. Even if some of the funds managed to deliver higher returns in a given year, none were able to do so consistently over time. According to the researchers, this strongly indicated that the high-performing years were due to luck and not to any insight or savvy on the part of the fund managers.
> 
> However, the authors of this study take a different lesson from this finding than Lynch does. Where Lynch argues that the poor track record of Wall Street fund managers shows that you can do a better job than them through smart research and timely investments, the study authors write that _no on_ e can consistently outperform the market on a year-over-year basis.
> 
> Instead of trying to assemble your own portfolio of individual stocks, the study authors urge ordinary investors to put their money into index funds: low-fee investment vehicles designed to mirror the performance of the market as a whole. And rather than constantly buying and selling individual stocks, they recommend simply holding your shares in an index fund over decades. We’ll explore index funds in detail in Part 3 of this guide.

### Part 1: Beware of Bonds, Trust in Stocks

Lynch writes that, despite their reputation as a riskier and more volatile investment, **stocks have significantly outperformed bonds over the long term**. In this section, we’ll explore the downside of bond investing by first exploring the basics of how bonds work and then detailing some of the main risks that come from investing in them. Then we’ll examine why Lynch advocates stocks as a superior investment.

#### How Bonds Work

To understand why many investors think bonds are less risky than stocks, it’s useful to briefly explain how bonds work. **A bond is a debt obligation issued by a borrower** —with the borrower usually being a corporation, a state or municipal government, or the US Treasury. These entities issue bonds to raise capital. When you purchase a bond as an investor, you’re loaning money to the bond issuer, which pays you back with interest.

We can illustrate how bonds work with an example. When you buy a $1,000 bond from the issuer, it typically pays out interest at a fixed rate (the _coupon rate_) for a specified period of time. At the end of this period, the bond purchaser receives the full $1,000 value of the bond (the _face value_). So if your one-year $1,000 bond pays out 5% interest, you’ll receive a 5% ($50) interest payment after six months (the _coupon date_). After one year, the bond will reach its _maturity date_ , when the face value of the bond comes due and you’ll be paid back the $1,000 face value. So, over the course of your investment, you’ll have earned a 5% return on $1,000.

(Shortform note: This simple illustration of bonds doesn’t fully outline some of the other options that bond issuers may exercise—and that can put your returns at risk. In _The Simple Path to Wealth_ , JL Collins writes that some bonds are “callable.” This means that the bond issuer may have the option to “call back” the bonds or pay them off before the maturity date. Bond issuers typically do this when interest rates are falling and they can borrow more cheaply by issuing new, lower-rate bonds, the proceeds from which they can use to pay off old, high-interest bonds. Thus, if your bond is called back, you’ll receive your face value payment earlier, but you’ll lose out on those high fixed-interest payments.)

#### The Risks of Bonds

This simple illustration of bonds makes them seem like an attractive, low-risk, low-stress investment. But, warns Lynch, **bonds are actually fraught with risk because their _real_ returns are highly vulnerable to 1) inflation, and 2) interest rate changes**.

(Shortform note: Contrary to Lynch’s argument, some experts write that there are market conditions where bonds can be a better investment than stocks. For example, in 2023, analysts argued that a weak stock market and the unsustainability of corporate profits made bonds a safer—and more lucrative—investment.)

##### **Inflation Risk**

Inflation is when prices rise across the economy. So a basket of goods that you could buy for $10 last year might cost you $12 under inflationary conditions this year. And, warns Lynch, that spells trouble for fixed-income investments like bonds. Remember, your bond coupon payments will pay the same fixed rate of interest throughout the life of the bond until it reaches maturity. But **if prices are rising during that time, the _real_ purchasing power of those fixed payouts will decline**: Your fixed $50 coupon payment buys you less as prices rise.

(Shortform note: Although inflation does pose a risk to bond investors, there are bonds designed to mitigate this risk. Inflation-linked bonds, issued mainly by sovereign governments like the US, are indexed to inflation. This means that the principal and interest payments you receive rise and fall with the rate of inflation. For example, let’s say you buy a $1,000, 20-year US Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) with a 2.5% coupon indexed to an inflation rate of 4%. The principal on the bond (which was initially $1,000) will adjust upward daily to account for the 4% inflation rate. And although the coupon _rate_ will still be fixed at 2.5%, the _dollar value_ of each interest payment will rise, as the coupon will be paid on the inflation-adjusted principal value.)

##### **Interest Rate Changes**

Changes in the general interest rate can also erode the value of your bond investment, cautions Lynch. To understand this, we also need to understand that, in addition to holding on to your bond until the maturity date, you can also _sell_ your bond to a third party before it reaches maturity.

But there’s an inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices go down. This is because when interest rates rise, investors have an opportunity to purchase newly issued bonds that pay a higher interest rate. Because they have this opportunity to earn higher bond returns elsewhere, they’re only going to buy _your_ older, lower-interest bond at a discount. So if you want to sell your bond before it reaches maturity, you run the risk of selling it below face value, depending on the interest rate at the time.

> **Interest Rate Spikes and the Collapse of Silicon Valley Bank**
> 
> It’s not just individual bond investors who are at risk from interest rate changes: Even major banks and financial institutions are vulnerable to these shocks. Although the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) had many causes, a primary one was the rise in interest rates during 2022-23 that made the bank’s heavy investments in long-term bonds untenable.
> 
> It started when SVB had a glut of cash deposits from its tech startup clients. But since those companies already had plenty of access to cash loans thanks to low interest rates, SVB had to find other ways to invest and make money. And what they chose to invest in were long-term mortgage-backed securities—a type of bond. SVB put 56% of their total assets into these bonds, far higher than most banks do. As we’ve explored, bond prices fall when interest rates rise. So if interest rates were to rise, the value of all these bonds SVB had bought would decline. In effect, the bank was taking a big gamble that interest rates _wouldn’t_ rise.
> 
> Then, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in 2022 to combat inflation, the value of SVB’s bond holdings plummeted. As word spread about the bank’s teetering financial position, depositors scrambled to pull out their money. To meet this depositor demand, the bank had to sell its already-discounted bonds at ever-greater losses—triggering even more panic by depositors and leading to a bank run that resulted in the second-biggest bank failure in US history.

#### Trust in Stocks Over Bonds

These bond risks, writes Lynch, highlight why **stocks are the superior investment option over bonds**. He writes that the historical performance of the stock market, as measured by popular stock indexes like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq, shows that sustained investment in stocks yields higher returns than bonds over time. This is because stocks are an equity investment, not a debt investment like bonds. When you open stock in a company, you become a shareholder—a partial owner of that company. And as a shareholder, you have the opportunity to enjoy both dividends (payments companies make to shareholders out of profits earned) and annual increases in the stock prices themselves.

Lynch cautions that this superior performance is over the _long_ term: In a given quarter or year, bonds may yield higher returns than stocks. But, he emphasizes, over the course of decades, stocks always win out.

> **The Case for Bonds**
> 
> Although Lynch generally derides bonds as an inferior investment option compared with stocks, other investment experts make a case for including bonds as part of your overall investment strategy.
> 
> In _The Little Book of Common Sense Investing_ , John Bogle makes three arguments for why bonds can be a superior investment to stocks:
> 
>   * **Bonds can beat stocks over short periods of time**. According to Bogle, from 1900 to 2017, bonds provided a better return on investment than stocks in 42 of those years.
> 
>   * **Bonds provide protection during market drops because they’re less volatile than stocks** : A one-year Treasury bond at 4% interest effectively guarantees a 4% return on your investment. Consequently, bonds can stabilize your investment portfolio amidst the stock market’s ebbs and flows.
> 
>   * **Bonds can offer greater yields than dividend yields**. For example, in 2017, bond yields (the annual return on bonds relative to their price) remained higher than stocks’ dividend yields: The average bond yield was 3.1%, while the average dividend yield was 2.0%. So, bonds can generate a greater flow of liquid income for investors than stocks.

### Part 2: Selecting and Managing Your Stocks

Now that we understand the advantages of stocks over bonds, it’s time to explore Lynch’s suggestions for how to construct a successful portfolio.

Lynch writes that **amateurs can pick stocks as well as—and often _better_ than—professional portfolio managers**. But, he cautions, outperforming the pros isn’t easy. It requires researching the financial and market fundamentals of the companies whose stocks you buy. Once you construct that portfolio, he writes it’s important to monitor and manage it effectively: Avoid investing in so many stocks that you can’t keep track of them, do a regular review of your holdings to know which companies’ stocks to dump or buy more of, keep your portfolio diversified, and play the long game.

> **Alternate View: Focus on Overall Market Data, Not Specific Stocks**
> 
> Some successful investors have taken the opposite approach from Lynch—forgoing detailed analysis of individual companies and instead focusing on large-scale, market-wide price fluctuations. In _The Man Who Solved the Market_ , Gregory Zuckerman tells the story of Jim Simons, a former mathematician who became one of the most successful hedge fund managers in history. The key to Simons’s success, writes Zuckerman, was his insight that price fluctuations within financial markets followed recognizable and predictable patterns. When identified, these patterns could be used to strategically buy and sell the right stocks, bonds, currencies, and other financial instruments at the right time.
> 
> For Simons, it wasn’t necessary to know anything substantive about the underlying stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies being traded or _why_ their prices fluctuated the way they did: What mattered was the integrity of the data and the reliability of the patterns identified by his trading algorithm. If the algorithm could detect a non-random pattern and make bets that paid off more often than not, the fund would invest even if it followed no apparent economic logic.

#### Understand the Fundamentals

**Your job as an investor is to understand the fundamentals behind the companies you invest in** , writes Lynch. Picking stocks isn’t supposed to be a game of chance: When you buy a stock, you’re not buying a raffle ticket, hoping that your stock is the “lucky” one that rises in value. Instead, behind every stock is a real company, with managers, employees, products and services, and a business strategy. Your job as an investor is to understand the fundamentals behind the companies you invest in—the products or services they bring to market, their strategy for long-term growth, and their overall financial health. If you’re picking stocks without doing this research, you’re effectively just gambling.

Lynch writes that it’s important to get into the details of a company’s operations before you decide to invest in it. In fact, during his time as a fund manager, Lynch often made a point of visiting the headquarters of companies he was considering adding to the Magellan portfolio and meeting with executives. He wanted to know that a company’s leaders had clear plans for future growth, that a company wasn’t saddled by unsustainable levels of corporate debt, and that the people running the firm were generally competent.

> **Fundamental vs. Technical Analysis**
> 
> Lynch’s approach of rigorously analyzing individual companies and stocks speaks to the differences between two schools of investing thought: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.
> 
> Fundamental analysis is the more traditional approach, which Lynch advocates. This school of thought attempts to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. Adherents of this philosophy seek to answer _why_ a particular stock goes up or down in value. They do this, as the name suggests, by delving into the “fundamentals” of the company behind the stock. They’ll look at sector-wide trends and the company’s earnings, expenses, assets, and liabilities to make predictions about what the stock will do.
> 
> Technical analysis, on the other hand, identifies trends and correlations— _how_ a particular stock goes up or down in value. It’s much closer to what Simons and his colleagues did, as detailed in _The Man Who Solved the Market_. Technical analysts assume that the “fundamentals” are _already_ factored into the stock price, so it’s a waste of time and effort to analyze them. Instead, they use mathematical analysis to identify patterns and trends within the market and across different types of financial instruments (like stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies). These trends can signal what a stock will do in the future.

#### Manage Your Portfolio

Once you’ve figured out which companies’ stock to purchase for your portfolio, Lynch writes that it’s time to turn to how to manage that portfolio. According to Lynch, proper management of your portfolio is key to your success as an investor. He offers some core principles of stock portfolio management:

  * Don’t invest in too many companies.
  * Pay attention to the companies you invest in.
  * Diversify your portfolio. 



##### 1) Don’t Invest in Too Many Companies

Crucially, **you should never hold more stocks in your portfolio than you can personally manage or keep track of**. A manager of a large fund with a staff of analysts can afford to own stock in hundreds or even thousands of companies; however, as a retail investor, you’ll never have the bandwidth to do the research you need to do to make informed investment decisions in a portfolio that large.

> **What’s the “Right” Number of Stocks to Own?**
> 
> Although Lynch recommends keeping a small portfolio so you’ll be able to manage and oversee the stocks in it, there are risks to this approach. In a small portfolio, it takes just a few stocks with low returns to drag your entire position down. Similarly, your portfolio can become overly dependent on just a few high performers. For these reasons, some research suggests that the right number of stocks to hold in a well-diversified portfolio is 25 to 30 companies.
> 
> In determining how many stocks you should own at once, investment experts also advise that it depends on your stage in life, your investment goals, and your personal risk tolerance. Someone in their 20s may be more comfortable with a relatively small portfolio of only a dozen or so stocks. Although this will likely be a more volatile portfolio because it’s more subject to the ups and downs of just a few companies, at this age you have enough time left before retirement to ride out the short-term fluctuations. Meanwhile, someone nearing retirement may want to hold a larger portfolio of around 30 stocks to reduce the risk of loss if one or two stocks decline.

##### 2) Pay Attention to Your Stocks

Lynch advises you to **pay consistent attention to the stocks in your portfolio**. Playing the stock market is not a “set it and forget it” business. Analyzing the key metrics of the companies whose shares you own—quarterly earnings statements, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements—will help you determine which stocks are poised for sustainable long-term growth and which are overvalued and likely to suffer a decline. Don’t just hold onto a stock by inertia: If the fundamentals of the company are truly headed in the wrong direction, it may be time to sell them.

Lynch writes that it’s best to take copious notes on the activities of the companies in your portfolio. He recommends a review of your full portfolio every six months to evaluate which stocks to drop, which new ones to add, and which current ones to buy more of.

(Shortform note: Although Lynch recommends constant vigilance with your portfolio, other investment experts write that this level of oversight may not be sustainable for most individual investors. To have a truly well-diversified portfolio, you’d likely need to own between 20 and 100 stocks. You’d also need to constantly review the financial statements of dozens of companies. This takes more time than most non-professional investors have, not to mention a level of knowledge and expertise to properly interpret that data that many such investors likely won’t have.)

##### 3) Keep Your Portfolio Diversified

Lynch writes that it’s crucial to **maintain a balanced portfolio**. This means having a mix of stocks from many sectors of the economy. Indeed, warns Lynch, it’s a risky strategy to overload in stocks from companies in any one industry, no matter how stable and secure that sector may seem. Ideally, you want a portfolio whose composition closely reflects the total market—this protects you against a collapse in one industry, because your losses there may be offset by gains (or at least smaller losses) in other industries.

Recent history shows why it would be a gamble to bet too heavily in one industry: Putting all your money into tech stocks would have wiped you out during the dot-com crash of the early 2000s; going all-in on cryptocurrency would have been calamitous in 2022 when cryptocurrencies plummeted amid fraud scandals.

> **The Risks of Over-Diversification**
> 
> Although many experts agree with Lynch that it’s wise to maintain a diversified portfolio, there’s also risk in having a portfolio that’s _too_ diversified. Some evidence suggests that the risk-mitigation benefits of a diversified portfolio diminish greatly once you own more than 20 stocks. In other words, there’s only a marginal difference from a diversification standpoint between owning 20 stocks and 10,000.
> 
> If you own too many different stocks and become too diversified, you can reduce your potential for high returns. In a portfolio consisting of dozens or even hundreds of stocks, a few stocks performing exceptionally well will have only a middling impact on your returns because they would only represent a small share of your total portfolio. But if you had a diversified portfolio of only around 20 stocks, those high performers would have an outsized positive impact on your returns.

##### 4) Play the Long Game

Lynch writes that **successfully managing your portfolio is largely about staying the course in the market.** Don’t worry about the short-term ups and downs—the historical performance of the market over decades shows that consistently owning stocks is a winning strategy.

When you start buying stocks, you’ll inevitably experience market downturns. They can last for a month, a quarter, or even a couple of years. These downturns are often unpredictable and are usually caused by large-scale macroeconomic events and conditions that individual investors have zero control over—from interest rate changes, to geopolitical events, to natural forces like weather and pandemics.

And when these bear markets strike, you’re likely to lose money. But, warns Lynch, this isn’t the time to flee the market in a panic. Indeed, he doesn’t think of them as market collapses at all, but rather as market _corrections_ —times when previously overvalued stocks come back to Earth and settle at prices that more accurately reflect their worth. And it’s during _these_ market corrections that savvy investors can seize the opportunity to find bargains and buy stocks at discount prices. By contrast, writes Lynch, bull markets (when stock prices experience a prolonged rise) are often a sign of _overpriced_ stocks, where you’ll be hard-pressed to find good bargains.

> **Time in the Market, Not Timing the Market**
> 
> The history of stock prices, as measured by well-regarded indexes like the S&P 500, bears Lynch’s argument out. Many investment experts argue that success is more about time _in_ the market than about _timing_ the market. In other words, continually investing in the stock market is a better strategy for high returns than trying to buy stocks at a low price and sell them at a high price. This is because it’s difficult to predict when the market will go up and down, and as Lynch points out, you as an individual investor have almost no control over it.
> 
> But evidence suggests that playing the long game does work. Over the past 94 years, the S&P 500 has swung back and forth, with 27% of those years having negative returns. So if you’re buying and selling stock in a one-year timeframe, you have a significant risk of taking a loss. But the longer the time window of your investment, your chances of positive returns become overwhelmingly likely. Over those same 94 years, through December 31, 2022, 94% of _10-year_ periods have had positive returns.

### Part 3: The Case for Index Funds

We’ve now explored why you should invest in stocks instead of bonds and how you should build and manage your personal stock portfolio. But what if you want to get exposure to the stock market without going through the trouble of researching, building, and managing your own portfolio of individual stocks?

Lynch writes that **stock funds can offer a good alternative to constructing and maintaining your own stock portfolio**. So what are stock funds and how do they work? A stock fund is a type of investment fund that pools money from multiple investors to invest in a selection of stocks. When you buy shares in a stock fund you don’t actually own the underlying stocks—instead, you own shares of the fund itself. The fund manager is responsible for selecting and maintaining the mix of stocks in the fund, which saves you the time and trouble of having to do this.

But, as we’ve seen, Lynch is skeptical of pricey fund managers, who he argues often charge high fees and deliver returns that don’t even beat the average market returns. That’s why he recommends stock index funds as a particular _type_ of stock fund for investors who want to enjoy solid returns without having to manage their own portfolio—or see their returns eaten up by high management fees.

Index funds are stock funds composed of a broad portfolio of stocks that are designed to mirror one of the big market indexes. Many popular index funds at large investment companies like Vanguard, Fidelity, or State Street offer index funds that track well-known market indexes like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The stocks in an index-tracking mutual fund are automatically selected based on their position in these indexes. You're not actively managing it, nor is a fund manager. The fund you invest in purchases shares of companies in proportion to those companies’ positions within whichever index the fund’s tracking. For example, if the fund you bought into tracks the S&P 500 and Google stock comprises 3% of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500, your fund will have 3% of its holdings in Google stock.

> **The Rise—and Risks—of Passive Investing**
> 
> In the years since Lynch wrote _Beating the Street_ , index funds have risen greatly in popularity. These funds are described as being “passively managed.” They don’t have an active manager like Lynch selecting stocks for inclusion in the portfolio based on their financial performance or projections for future growth. Instead, these passively managed funds buy and sell stocks automatically when those stocks enter or exit indexes like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
> 
> And because index funds have become such major purchasers of US stocks, index funds now control 20% to 30% of the US equities market. Despite their popularity, some observers are concerned that the growth of index funds represents a dangerous concentration of economic power.
> 
> Today, for nine in 10 companies listed on the S&P 500, their largest single shareholder is one of the “Big Three” money managers—BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. And these three firms control 80-90% of the index fund market. With this level of concentration, we could soon be facing an economic future where a small handful of individuals would have vastly disproportionate power over most publicly traded companies.

#### Different Types of Index Funds for Different Investment Needs

Lynch advises that there are many different types of index funds that track different segments of the financial market, depending on where an investor wants to put her money, such as market cap funds, sector-based funds, and regional funds.

##### Market Cap Index Funds

These are funds that invest in stocks based on those stocks’ total market capitalization (or “market cap”)—the number of shares currently issued multiplied by the price per share. So, for example, a company with one million shares currently issued trading at $50 per share would have a market cap of $50 million. There are funds that invest in large-cap stocks (those with market caps above $10 billion), mid-cap stocks (with market caps between $2 billion and $10 billion), and small-cap stocks (those with market caps between $250 million and $2 billion).

You’d purchase shares in large-cap index funds if you want the relative stability of investing in mature, well-established companies that are more likely to earn steady returns than small companies or startups. On the other hand, you’d invest in medium- or small-cap index funds if you want the potentially high returns that can come from investing in startups and growing companies—and can stomach the higher volatility and risk that can come with it.

(Shortform note: Although you can invest in mid-cap and small-cap indexes if you want to cover the entire market, you can have most of the total market represented in your portfolio just by investing in large-cap funds. This is because the biggest stocks already account for such a large share of the total market capitalization. The S&P 500 index of large-cap US equities encompasses the top-500 American companies by market capitalization. According to S&P, this represents approximately 80% of the total market capitalization.)

##### Sector-Based Index Funds

There are also index funds that buy stock in companies exclusively in a specific industry or market. For example, a fund may buy shares of companies in sectors like energy, consumer goods, health care, information technology, or real estate. You’d invest in a sector-based fund if you believe that that sector offers higher potential for growth than other sectors of the economy, or if you want to hedge your portfolio if you’ve invested in other sectors.

For example, let’s say you’ve invested heavily in the traditional energy sector (which includes oil companies, natural gas producers, and coal mine operators). You might then want to purchase shares in a renewable energy index fund (which includes companies engaged in wind, solar, hydroelectric, and even nuclear energy), so you can offset potential losses in case the price of oil drops or if the government passes new regulations that restrict fossil fuel production.

(Shortform note: Sector-based funds do come with their own unique risks. Investing in a sector-based index fund means your returns are closely tied to the performance of a specific industry, even if you’re diversified _within_ that industry. If that sector experiences difficulties or downturns, your portfolio could take a hit. Cyclical effects could also put your portfolio at risk. This is because different sectors of the economy tend to perform differently at various points in the economic cycle. For instance, tech sectors might do well during economic expansions, while utility sectors might perform better during recessions. If you don’t watch these cyclical effects, you could wind up overly invested in a sector on the wrong end of the business cycle.)

##### Regional Index Funds

There are also index funds that buy shares in companies (often those with the largest market caps across a wide range of industries) that are based in a particular region or country. So, for example, there are funds that trade exclusively in North American, European, Asian, or South American stocks.

You would invest in regional index funds if you believe that a particular region or country’s economy offers the kind of growth you want. If you want more stable, but potentially lower returns, you would perhaps invest in a regional fund that comprises companies from more developed markets, such as North America or Western Europe. If you’re looking for potentially high returns (and can handle higher risk), you might invest in regional index funds composed of stocks from companies in developing parts of the world—such as sub-Saharan Africa or Southeast Asia.

(Shortform note: When you invest in region- or country-specific index funds, it’s important to understand country risk. Country risk is the risk of investing in a particular country. The risk can come from factors including but not limited to political instability, natural disasters, and unfavorable exchange rates. There are several resources available to assess country risk, including information published by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). In addition, the major credit rating agencies—Standard & Poor's (S&P), Moody's, and Fitch—each have country-by-country analyses of economic fundamentals such as political stability, the rule of law, and fiscal and monetary flexibility.)
