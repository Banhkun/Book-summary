## Exercise: Assess Your Core Purpose, Values, and Support System

George argues that the key to leadership is having a core purpose and a set of ethical principles that serve as guiding points throughout your career. He also asserts that it’s essential to maintain a strong support system _outside_ of work. In this exercise, we’ll go through the steps to identify your unique core purpose, make a plan to embody your values, and assess the role of the people in your support system.

Your core purpose and values stem from your life experiences and greatest setbacks. Write down a few of the key events in your life. How did these events change your outlook and values? For example, if you had a learning disability that led to negative experiences at school, this might have made you realize the importance of providing tools and accommodations for neurodivergent students.

From the experiences you described in the previous question, identify your top priority or the value that motivates you the most. How might you translate that priority into a career goal? For example, if your top priority is taking care of the environment, this could be translated into a business career dedicated to creating or selling plastic-free products.

Next, reflect on the principles you want to embody as you pursue your core purpose. List the values that are non-negotiable, and make a plan for putting those values into action. For example, if one of your values is to ensure that everyone in your organization has a voice, you might make a plan to create an open forum for your team members to express their opinions and feedback.

Having a strong support system is another key element to effective leadership. Write down the people closest to you who are most likely to support you in your leadership journey. How does each one contribute to your well-being as a person and a leader? For example, one person might be a reliable source of honest feedback when you’re neglecting a certain area of your life. Another loved one might simply be a source of joy when you need to unwind from work stress.
