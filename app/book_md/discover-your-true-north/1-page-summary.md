## 1-Page Summary

What’s the common thread among the world’s most successful business leaders? In _Discover Your True North_ , Bill George argues that it’s not about being the most talented, or the most charming person in the boardroom—it’s about being true to yourself and staying focused on your core priorities and values (what he calls your unique “True North”).

After analyzing interviews with 48 international business leaders about their career journeys, George distills their most salient insights into simple guidelines that anyone can follow to become a leader in their organization: Work toward something you’re truly passionate about, optimize your leadership using introspection and feedback, and maintain a healthy personal life. George also describes common pitfalls that can distract leaders from their core purpose if they get caught up in the appeal of external rewards like money and fame.

Bill George is an executive fellow at Harvard Business School where he also taught leadership courses for 18 years. He’s the former board chairman and CEO of the health care technology company Medtronic and was also a senior executive at Honeywell. He’s authored several books centered on his True North business leadership philosophy, beginning with the original 2007 edition of _Discover Your True North._ The first edition incorporated research interviews with 125 leaders, and for this 2015 expanded and updated edition, he interviewed 48 additional leaders. He also added a new chapter highlighting the emerging need for business leaders who can navigate the globalized business world.

In this guide to the 2015 edition, we’ll explain how to identify your core purpose and values by reflecting on your unique life experiences, common mistakes to avoid on your leadership journey, how to hone a team-oriented approach to leadership, and how to maintain a personal support system. We’ll also compare George’s recommendations to those of other business leaders and include actionable tips for executing his guidelines.

### Identify Your Core Purpose and Ethical Principles

The first step to becoming an effective leader is to identify your core purpose (what George calls your “True North”) and ethical principles. The **core purpose is your overarching goal for your career and the “why” behind everything you do** in your leadership journey. Your ethical principles are the moral boundaries you must identify so you can work toward your core purpose without sacrificing your integrity.

In this section, we’ll examine why these components are important and how to identify them based on your unique life experiences.

#### The Core Purpose

George asserts that throughout your career, **your core purpose will help guide you when making decisions and motivate you when you’re experiencing challenges**. In other words, it’s something you can refer to and remind yourself of the ultimate goal you’re working toward. Without a core purpose, George warns, you risk ending up in an unfulfilling career because you chased things like a higher salary and fancy possessions instead of following your true passion.

(Shortform note: Although George focuses on the individual benefits of identifying a core purpose, many experts suggest that having a core purpose has company-level benefits as well. In _The Culture Code_ , Daniel Coyle describes two main benefits of a purpose-driven company. He says that a core purpose increases the quality of work because employees are more motivated to work toward a meaningful and unified goal, and it increases employees’ rate of learning because they recognize the importance of what they’re doing. On the other hand, not having a core purpose can lead to lower performance (due to a lack of motivation) and inconsistent decision-making that doesn't align with the long-term mission.)

George says that no one can determine your core purpose for you. To identify your unique core purpose, start by **reflecting on your life story and your biggest challenges** (what George calls “crucibles”). George found through his interviews that many of the world’s successful business leaders were shaped by their life experiences and setbacks, which they channeled into a passion to pursue a meaningful goal. When you reflect on your own core purpose, these experiences could include experiences from your childhood or even recent events that impacted your priorities and vision for yourself.

(Shortform note: George suggests that your core purpose may not emerge until later in life, since big life changes—like the death of a loved one or a major illness—may change your outlook and priorities. However, others disagree on when people can find their purpose and whether it can change. For example, in _Find Your Why_ , Simon Sinek, David Mead, and Peter Docker say that your “Why” (a core belief that inspires your work) is fixed by the time you’re in your twenties—even if you haven’t articulated it yet. The authors contend that while life events may temporarily distract you from your purpose or challenge you to reevaluate it, they don’t _change_ your purpose.)

In one example of someone using their life story to define their core purpose, George describes how the early experiences of Howard Schultz—the former CEO of Starbucks—helped him identify his vision for his career. When he was a young child, his family struggled financially when his father was injured and lost both his job and health insurance. At this time, his mother was also pregnant, and they had no savings to cover expenses.

Experiencing the precarity of poverty and seeing his father’s shame over his blue-collar job inspired Schultz’s core purpose—to create his own company where the employees would feel respected, and even part-time employees would have access to company-sponsored health insurance.

> **Recent Criticisms of Schultz’s Labor Practices**
> 
> While Schultz has made efforts to provide substantial benefits to Starbucks employees in alignment with his core purpose, his recent actions opposing Starbucks unions may conflict with his core purpose of respecting and supporting all employees.
> 
> With Schultz as CEO, Starbucks started providing health insurance to part-time employees beginning in 1988. Schultz also expanded health care coverage to include domestic partners of employees.
> 
> However, since Starbucks stores started unionizing in 2021, critics have accused Schultz of illegal, union-busting tactics to prevent workers from forming unions and hinder their efforts to collectively negotiate for things like guaranteed hours and protected benefits. Examples of Starbucks’s alleged union-busting tactics include increasing wages for non-union members and firing employees involved in unionizing. Overall, the Starbucks union has filed over 500 charges of unfair labor practices.
> 
> Schultz—who has been the CEO of Starbucks off and on in recent years before stepping down again in early 2023—says unions interfere with the company’s direct relationship with employees. Others argue that opposing unions takes away workers’ ability to protect their benefits and give honest feedback without retaliation.

#### Ethical Principles

Once you’ve identified your core purpose, you’ll also need to reflect on what your ethics are as a leader. George says that by doing so, you can **ensure that your team members align with those values** as well as your core purpose.

(Shortform note: Although George doesn’t explain _how_ to ensure that team members align with your values, one potential strategy is to articulate your ethical principles in your marketing content to attract new recruits who are already aligned with those values. Then, during the hiring process, discuss the company’s ethics to determine whether interviewees are a good fit for the company.)

Another important element is **articulating your ethical principles _before_ you’re in crisis** when they’ll be the hardest to stick to. For example, if you decide early in your career that you’ll never lie to your colleagues to cover up a mistake, it’ll be easier to stick to this choice even when you mess up and lying becomes tempting in the moment.

(Shortform note: While defining your ethical principles in advance may help guide decisions in challenging situations, you may also benefit from _reinforcing_ those principles after you’ve articulated them. In _Dare To Lead_ , Brené Brown recommends creating a rubric for your values that you can use regularly to check if your behavior is in alignment with them. To do this, list some behaviors that align with your values as well as behaviors that don’t. When you check in, you can also identify if there were any specific moments when you embodied your core ethics to assess how well you’re practicing them.)

### Avoid Common Pitfalls

According to George, identifying your core purpose and ethics will help you become an effective and resilient leader throughout the ups and downs of your career. To illustrate the importance of having these guiding principles, **George identifies the five traits that commonly cause leaders to stray from their core purpose and ethics**.

The common thread in these behaviors is **self-centeredness and excessive pursuit of external rewards like power and money**. George writes that by being aware of these potential pitfalls, you can recognize when your leadership is faltering and take corrective action (with your core purpose and values as a guide).

(Shortform note: Resisting egocentric tendencies and materialism may be particularly challenging for leaders after they’ve already achieved substantial success in their industry. In _Ego is the Enemy_ , Ryan Holiday recommends a few tips to avoid losing control of your ego. His advice is: Remain a lifelong student and be open to new knowledge and lessons, don’t be tempted by new opportunities that don’t advance your long-term goal, and be wary of feelings like entitlement that can lead to poor decisions.)

#### Cut-Throat Competitiveness

George writes that when people are willing to **manipulate and scheme to advance themselves** (also called “Machiavellianism”), they’ll often devolve into paranoia and self-doubt. This is because cut-throat leaders assume that since they desperately clawed their way to the top, there must be someone else with the same mindset scheming to usurp their power. In addition, this type of person might fear deep down that they’re not actually qualified for the position they’ve achieved.

(Shortform note: Psychologists say that some of the causes of Machiavellianism include genetic factors and exposure to manipulative self-advancement in one’s family, the media, or other environments. In addition, people with this personality trait naturally gravitate toward professions such as business, politics, and management, where this kind of behavior often contributes to their success. This suggests that for people predisposed to Machiavellianism, this trait may be particularly difficult to reign in. For others, working in a less competitive environment may be the best way to counteract this tendency.)

#### Lack of Accountability

George explains that when some people get to a position of power, they **don’t want to take responsibility for anything that goes wrong**. Instead, they’ll deny their role in it, blame other team members, and make short-sighted decisions that ultimately lead to their downfall. For example, instead of taking responsibility for a business’s low revenue, a leader lacking accountability might instead lie on reports or expect other people to fix the problem, which could end up making it worse.

#### Self-Isolation

In this case, leaders **don’t solicit feedback or establish good relationships with their colleagues**. George asserts that when leaders self-isolate, it makes them prone to mistakes that could otherwise be avoided. For example, a leader might insist on continuing with a business model that other managers and employees already know from experience doesn’t work. However, since the employees aren’t welcome to share feedback, the leader will unknowingly tank the business.

> **Building Relationships Through Humility**
> 
> Embracing humility as a leader may help to counteract the lack of accountability and self-isolation that George describes. In _What Got You Here Won’t Get You There_ , Marshall Goldsmith says that leaders sometimes develop the bad habit of blaming others for their mistakes because they’re afraid of admitting that they’re flawed. However, when leaders openly accept accountability for their actions, they’re more likely to gain the respect of their colleagues.
> 
> The fear of appearing weak or flawed may also play a role in self-isolation because it discourages people from reaching out to others for help or feedback. If you’re a leader who has self-isolated and is in the early stages of building relationships with your colleagues, it may be challenging at first to get honest and helpful feedback. In _Radical Candor_ , Kim Scott says that one way to build respect and trust is to allow your team to observe you reacting well to candid criticism. Scott adds that being willing to receive criticism publicly shows your team how important it is, and it demonstrates that you’re open to learning and improvement.
> 
> In addition to enhancing your leadership, research suggests that improving your relationship with employees will have a positive effect on the organization and the experience of your team members as well. Studies show that gaining the trust and respect of your employees increases employees’ performance, company loyalty, creativity, and job satisfaction.

#### Chasing Promotions

Another common mistake that leaders make is **being hyperfocused on climbing the corporate ladder**. George warns that this causes leaders to neglect their personal life and other aspects of their well-being, which is ultimately harmful to their mental and physical health. In addition, if leaders move up through the ranks too quickly, they don’t have time to learn important skills and lessons through experience, making them anxious in challenging situations.

(Shortform note: In addition to the downsides that George addresses, some people assert that focusing on promotions isn’t a useful way to exert your energy because it’s not fully in your control. Instead, they recommend focusing on things that are both inherently rewarding and fully in your control, like developing your skills and building good relationships with your colleagues. This advice aligns with George’s recommendation to make sure your work is intrinsically motivating and to intentionally foster positive relationships.)

#### Obsession With External Rewards

Lastly, George says that if leaders **become too caught up in seeking the approval of others** through wealth, fame, and power, they’ll get stuck in a cycle of always wanting more and being envious of people who seem to have more than they do. This ultimately distracts them from their core purpose, leading to dissatisfaction and potentially unethical behavior.

(Shortform note: Experts suggest that an unhealthy obsession with materialism can arise from cultural messaging through advertisements and other media that equate money with success. For others, materialism may be a response to a feeling of insecurity or inadequacy that stems from a difficult upbringing. To combat this type of behavior, some experts recommend intentionally taking time out of your day to express gratitude for what you have. This elicits a positive emotional response that breaks the cycle of relying on material gain to feel good.)

### Strengthen Your Leadership

George says that to avoid the common leadership problems of the previous section and reach your full potential as a leader, there are **three key ways to optimize your leadership** : 1) Find a role that you’re highly motivated to do and that takes advantage of your best skills (what George calls the “sweet spot”), 2) support your team members, and 3) adapt to the globalized business environment.

#### Find Your Ideal Role

George says that your ideal role will **showcase your strongest skills and allow you to spend time doing things you’re highly motivated to do**. To identify this kind of role, reflect on your strengths and your intrinsic motivation (motivation that comes from within, like the desire to create a more equitable world). If you’ve done some earnest introspection about your core purpose, you’ll likely already have a good understanding of what kind of work you’re intrinsically motivated by.

(Shortform note: In addition to finding a position that takes advantage of your unique strengths and that you’re willing to do without external rewards, Laura Vanderkam identifies a few additional elements to the ideal job in _168 Hours_ : It allows you to have autonomy over _how_ you do your work, to engage in work that’s challenging but not _too_ hard so you can easily immerse yourself in activities, and it provides an environment with supportive coworkers.)

George gives the example of Warren Buffett as a successful business leader who found his ideal role in the business world. He writes that Buffett could have made a lot of money working as a stockbroker, focusing on trading and selling stocks for clients frequently to make a commission on the trades. However, Buffett knew this wasn’t the kind of work he was excited about or what he was best at. Instead, he chose to run his own investment firm, where he could implement his own investment philosophy (investing in companies long term). Running his own investment firm enabled Buffett to tap into both his strengths as an investor and his intrinsic motivation to do work that he enjoys.

(Shortform note: In her biography of Buffett, _The Snowball_ , Alice Schroeder says that Buffett’s passion for investment stemmed from his childhood love of collecting and his fascination with numbers, as well as his desire for independence. His entrepreneurial endeavors throughout his adolescence suggest that Buffett keyed in on his core purpose early in life and often carved out opportunities to pursue it.)

In contrast, George warns that if you’re in a role where you’re solely _extrinsically_ motivated (by external rewards like a prestigious title or a high salary), you **risk falling into the trap of sacrificing your core purpose and your ethics for material gain**. For example, if you’re primarily motivated by receiving praise from your boss (rather than enjoying your work), you might start to sacrifice quality just to maintain high output and keep getting accolades. This pattern could then continue indefinitely, even if it isn’t aligned with your core purpose or values.

George says that ultimately, external rewards will be unfulfilling because they don’t stem from an inner desire like your core purpose does. In addition, when you’re striving for things like money, fame, and power, you tend to make unhealthy comparisons between yourself and others, leading to dissatisfaction no matter how much you achieve. Therefore, George asserts that a desire for external rewards should always be balanced by your core purpose and intrinsic motivations.

(Shortform note: Some research suggests that balancing intrinsic and extrinsic motivation alone may not be enough to avoid the unfulfilling cycle of chasing material rewards. Experts explain that even if you’re doing a job that intrinsically motivates you, excessive external rewards (like a large bonus) can reduce your intrinsic motivation due to what’s called the “overjustification effect.” In this process, when you receive rewards for doing something, you start to think that you performed the behavior _because_ of the extrinsic reward and therefore become less motivated to do it without any reward (as you would have initially).)

#### Support Your Team Members

George’s next piece of advice for strong leadership is to enable your team members to do their best work rather than trying to micromanage or force others to do what you want. He argues that this is important because younger generations expect their leaders to give them respect and autonomy over their work. Therefore, adopting this style of leadership will help you attract employees to your organization and advance your core purpose. To implement this team-oriented style of leadership (what George calls the “I to We” shift), you must **build strong relationships with your employees and use feedback and introspection to increase your self-awareness**.

George says that to strengthen your relationships with team members, you have to **be vulnerable and show mutual respect**. This gives you more credibility as a leader and establishes the supportive and non-hierarchical dynamic that millennial employees prefer. For example, if you’re providing constructive feedback to a team member about their work habits, you might tell them that you _also_ struggled with some of those same behaviors in the past and let them know that you’ll provide any additional support they might need to improve.

> **Leadership Preferences Across Generations**
> 
> George emphasizes the need to shift toward a more team-oriented leadership style to adapt to the needs of millennial employees, implying that they’re the majority or highest-priority cohort in the workforce. Although a 2018 study says that millennials make up the largest proportion of the workforce, another study points out that the workforce generally includes three different generations at a given time, suggesting that a more nuanced approach may be needed.
> 
> Some research supports George’s implication that different generations have distinct workplace preferences. For example, some experts assert that younger generations want their company to have a meaningful mission and prefer service-oriented and empathetic leaders (similar to George’s description of the core purpose and supportive leadership).
> 
> On the other hand, others argue that employees’ biggest priorities are consistent across generations: They want to work for an organization that cares about their well-being and has ethical leadership—priorities that also align with George’s advice to stay true to your ethics and build strong relationships with team members.
> 
> Another expert asserts that the key to managing up to five different generations in the workplace is to _ignore stereotypes about the personality and values of employees based on their age_. They argue that while different upbringings impact people’s preferences in the workplace, managers shouldn’t make assumptions about their employees (which may be false) because this can undermine mutual respect and therefore decrease employees’ performance.

In addition to relationship-building, soliciting feedback is an important way to ensure that you’re supporting your team to the best of your ability. George advises you to **process feedback objectively and follow it up with introspection** about your behavior and how you can genuinely improve your strategies moving forward. He asserts that feedback is necessary to adapt your leadership style to your colleagues and the circumstances. For example, a person who’s newer in your industry may want more guidance, whereas a veteran employee might prefer to work more independently. Therefore, you may need to have one-on-one conversations to get feedback and understand these individual needs.

> **Soliciting and Implementing Feedback**
> 
> In _The Oz Principle_ , Roger Connors, Tom Smith, and Craig Hickman say that to get useful feedback from your coworkers or other people in your life, you must first ensure that the other person feels safe being honest with you. To do this, let them know that you’re looking for the truth—not just praise, explain why you need the feedback, and be specific in your phrasing. For example, instead of asking for general feedback, you might ask the other person if they’ve ever felt like your communication was unclear.
> 
> Other experts emphasize the key steps _after_ you get feedback. In _Thanks for the Feedback_ , Douglas Stone and Sheila Heen recommend starting with small experimental changes to implement the feedback, and they offer tips to increase your motivation to continue to improve. For example, you might find a way to turn your effort into a game by giving yourself a reward when you successfully incorporate the feedback into your behavior.

#### Adapt to the Globalized Business World

George’s next piece of advice for becoming a strong leader is to embrace the needs of a globalized business world. He argues that today, industries need to look toward global markets to expand, and businesses need leaders with specific skills that go beyond those of the past. These include **geopolitical knowledge, awareness of the diverse needs of overseas markets, and the ability to navigate other cultures**.

(Shortform note: This component of George’s advice assumes that your core purpose can be scaled up to the global level, so it may not be as relevant for someone whose organization is focused on a local mission. However, for more locally focused leaders, it may still be important to understand the diverse needs of their community.)

George asserts that one aspect of geopolitical savvy is knowing what regions may experience political unrest that could influence your business prospects there. You may also need to understand how market trends are different in other countries depending on the culture. For example, in some regions, people might be more accustomed to using public transportation to get around, or they might be more environmentally conscious than the average person in the US. Thus, marketing cars in these places may require a different approach, or a new, experimental product instead.

Another skill that’s important for the globalized business world is being able to thrive in new places and cultures. George says that leaders have to be open-minded and flexible about different ways of doing things—for example, tailoring a line of food products to incorporate culturally relevant and locally produced ingredients. George argues that the best way to prepare for these skills is by spending time abroad when you’re young. He says this will help you expand your horizons and learn about navigating cultural diversity.

(Shortform note: In _The Culture Map_ , Erin Meyer echoes George’s statement that the globalized business world requires a new set of skills centered around cultural and geopolitical understanding. Meyer also dives deeper into the many ways that cultural ignorance can lead to misunderstandings in business settings. She defines eight areas in which cultures may differ: communication, feedback, thinking, leadership, decision-making, trust, disagreement, and time perception. Although it’s also important not to overgeneralize cultures, these categories may help leaders identify their cultural knowledge gaps, particularly if they have less geopolitical knowledge or less experience living and working abroad.)

### Nurture a Support System and a Balanced Life

The previous section focused on strategies to become a strong leader by improving the way you work. In the final section, we’ll cover George’s advice on how to **bolster your leadership by maintaining a strong support system _outside_ of work as well as maintaining a balanced life**.

#### Maintain a Support System of Friends and Family

George says that no matter how talented you are as a business leader, it’s essential to have a group of people who will love you for who you are (not for your career success), accompany you through hard times, and keep you on track to pursue your core purpose.

He explains that your support system will not only **provide a loving environment to turn to when things don’t go your way but also help hold you accountable** when you’re not being true to your core purpose or values. For example, if you start missing family dinners and other important events to stay late at the office, you may need your loved ones to intervene and remind you that your productivity isn’t as important as your relationships. George asserts that since this kind of trusting and enduring relationship takes time to build, it’s important to consistently prioritize your family and friends.

> **The Importance of Investing in Relationships**
> 
> Beyond supporting your career by providing solace during difficult times and holding you accountable to your core purpose and values, experts say that having a social support network fulfills a basic human need to feel social connection and a sense of belonging.
> 
> Given these important roles, why do so many leaders struggle to maintain their social support network? In _How Will You Measure Your Life_ , Clayton M. Christensen says there are two key reasons why people tend to invest more in their career than their relationships even though both require consistent attention.
> 
> He explains that your career is more likely to provide immediate, tangible rewards (like a promotion) whereas the payoff for investing in a relationship is dispersed over the long term. Second, your friends and family may be less demanding than your boss, so it’s easier to pay them less attention. Despite these challenges, Christensen warns that you can’t put off investing in your relationships and expect to make it up later.

#### Make Time for Non-Work Activities

George also recommends that you make time for _all_ the things you like to do—including spending time with your family and other hobbies. He says that whether it’s a physical activity or just relaxing in a peaceful place, **having a healthy balance of activities that rejuvenate you will improve your mental health** and therefore help you perform better at work, too.

George describes the experiences of John Donahoe (the former CEO of eBay) to illustrate how a strong personal life can be a boon to your well-being and career. Donahoe was tasked with studying for final exams for business school while his fiancée Eileen was pregnant and due to give birth soon. Realizing that he wouldn’t be able to spend adequate time with Eileen _and_ get top-notch grades, he opted to aim for “OK” grades so that he could fulfill his familial obligations. In the end, because he was less stressed than his colleagues and didn’t try to fill every moment with studying, he worked more efficiently and got all As.

(Shortform note: To manage internal conflicts about how to allocate finite time in a balanced way, some experts recommend distinguishing between essential and non-essential activities. Instead of trying to give equal time to all the areas of your life (professional work, unpaid work, spirituality, family, exercise, and so on), ensure that you’re giving adequate time and effort to the essential areas first and foremost. Donahoe illustrated this principle by intentionally deciding that spending time with his fiancée was essential, while schoolwork would receive just enough effort to get by. This ensured that he would have felt satisfied with his choices even if his grades weren’t the best.)

#### Don’t Compartmentalize

Along with thriving in your non-work life, George argues that you shouldn’t try too hard to keep your work life and personal life separate. This means that **you shouldn’t have to put on a different persona or mask your personality at work** , which will eventually exhaust you. Instead, George says to just be yourself, no matter where you are. He also recommends being honest with your colleagues about what’s important to you, even if that means bringing your personal life into work conversations sometimes.

For example, when Donahoe (from the case study in the previous section) had a scheduling conflict with taking his kids to school and meeting with important clients, he chose to be upfront with his boss about needing to make a change. Instead of being afraid to have an honest conversation with his boss or sacrificing his family’s needs, he discussed it openly. To his surprise, his clients and boss respected him more for being clear about his priorities and found a way to work around the conflict.

> **Gender-Based Challenges of Being Authentic at Work**
> 
> Researcher Brené Brown supports George’s idea that showing up authentically—wherever you are—is key to your mental well-being. In _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brown asserts that hiding your true self can lead to depression, anxiety, and other psychological challenges because it reaffirms the idea that you’re not good enough as you are.
> 
> However, being honest with your boss about your needs and personal life may be more challenging for women than men because of the differences in their home-life responsibilities and common workplace expectations. In _Invisible Women_ , Caroline Criado Perez writes that women are responsible for a disproportionate amount of unpaid domestic labor such as child care, which means they’re less able to stay late at work and are more likely to have to change their schedule last-minute to care for their sick children.
> 
> Perez explains that women pay an economic cost for this because they may be passed over for promotions for not working enough overtime or penalized for changing their schedule. In other words, women are more likely to need job accommodations to fulfill both their professional and familial duties, and they’re also more likely to be penalized for those accommodations. This analysis suggests that Donahoe’s experience of his boss and clients catering to his family’s needs may be more of an exception than a standard practice in business, and his female colleagues may have faced more struggles in this area.
