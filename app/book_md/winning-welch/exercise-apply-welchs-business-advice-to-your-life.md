## Exercise: Apply Welch’s Business Advice to Your Life

Let’s examine how you can apply Welch’s general principles of business, management tips, and advice to your career and life.

* * *

Welch believes candor to be a vital aspect of a company’s culture. Think of a time recently when a lack of candor at your workplace caused an unnecessary problem. For example, maybe you were afraid to speak up at a meeting, allowing an issue to linger longer than it should have. What could your workplace do to encourage a more candid environment? What’s something you might do to make your communication at work more honest and direct?

Whether you’re an executive, a manager, or a junior employee, the ability to adapt is a valuable quality. Consider the industry you work in or wish to work in. How might the industry change in the coming years? What skills or abilities could you cultivate that might help you adapt to these changes?

Consider Welch’s advice on improving your chances of promotion. What’s something you could do to expand your role and make yourself more valuable to the company? Try to think of a way to expand your role that both interests you and complements your current skills.

Consider your values regarding work-life balance. What’s one change you could make that would help you live according to these values? (Perhaps you could set clear boundaries for your coworkers or friends, or you might find that changing to a less demanding career is the best long-term option.)
