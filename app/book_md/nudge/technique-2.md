## Technique 2: Draw a Map

A carefully chosen default combats the human tendency toward inertia and the status quo, but how can a choice designer help _active_ choosers navigate complicated decisions?

One way, according to Thaler and Sunstein, is to **draw the choosers a map** to help connect particular outcomes with particular choices.

To help choice designers effectively draw a map, Thaler and Sunstein advise that regulators mandate transparency programs whereby companies would be required to**provide consumers with more—and more clearly organized—information** about their products so that consumers can better compare choices and make the right decision.

By presenting us with clearer information, a transparency program could **help combat our tendency to use rules of thumb _._**

### Transparency Programs in Personal Finance

From mortgages to student loans to credit cards, Americans are some of the most indebted people on the planet. (Shortform note: **Although not as indebted as some**. As of 2020, according to data from the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), **United States households are in the middle in terms of debt**. Households in Spain, France, Canada, and the United Kingdom hold more debt than American households, while German, Italian, and Brazilian households hold less.)

Thaler and Sunstein note that despite, or perhaps because of, the proliferation of debt products—variable-rate mortgages, specialty credit cards—most of us have no idea what kinds of risks we’re taking on when we borrow. **And so we revert to heuristics** : For example, we might open a new credit line—despite its not being appropriate for us—because a friend opened one (availability heuristic); or we might take out whatever mortgage is on offer because we think they’re all the same (representativeness heuristic).

Thaler and Sunstein examine two areas in particular where, because of their natural complexity, transparency programs can greatly help consumers: mortgages and credit cards.

#### Mortgages

The contemporary mortgage market is dauntingly complex. Mortgage shoppers now have to know the difference between fixed-rate loans (whose interest rate stays the same for the life of the loan) and variable-rate loans (whose interest rate fluctuates with the market), recognize teaser rates (a lower initial rate that often balloons after that initial period ends), and somehow take into account fees (administrative charges by the issuer), points (payments that result in lower interest rates), and penalties (for example, for paying off the loan early).

(Shortform note: _Nudge_ was published in the earliest stages of the 2008 financial crisis and the consequent changes to US financial regulations, many of which were aimed at addressing the very problems Thaler and Sunstein discuss. The most profound change, arguably, was the **Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act**. This law created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which **regulates consumer financial products like credit cards, mortgages, and the like**. It also included the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, which disallows balloon payments and certain penalties and, in certain circumstances, requires financial institutions to provide loan counseling to the mortgagee.)

Thaler and Sunstein argue that one way to reduce the complexity of contemporary mortgages would be to**** implement one of two possible versions of a transparency program:

  * In the simplest version, lenders would have to report the costs of the loan in two categories: fees and interest. 
  * In the slightly more complex version, the fees could be itemized, but they would have to add up to a single number (which could then be used to compare various mortgages across lenders). 



The interest category would include greater detail than is customary now. For example, the report would feature a schedule of payments over the lifetime of the loan so borrowers know exactly _what_ they’ll be paying _when_.

Lenders would also be required to supply borrowers with machine-readable versions of their reports, with all fees and rates included. Thaler and Sunstein predict that with the standardization of these reports, third-party firms will appear that can analyze these reports and compare them.

(Shortform note: In 2011, possibly under the influence of behavioral researchers like Thaler and Sunstein, the CFPB inaugurated the “Know Before You Owe” project to design and implement new mortgage disclosure documents that make it easier “to shop around and compare loan offers” and “avoid costly surprises at the closing table.”)

Thaler and Sunstein also predict that transparency programs will make shopping for mortgages online easier, **a key feature for women and African-American borrowers** : A study of automobile shoppers found that buyers from these two social groups paid less online than they did when they went to a dealership.

(Shortform note: Unfortunately, **it turns out that online lenders discriminate, too.** Although there’s evidence to suggest online lenders approve __ loans for borrowers of color at greater rates, researchers at the University of California found that online borrowers of color paid on average 5.3 basis points more than white borrowers for the same mortgage interest rate.)

#### Credit Cards

Credit cards are a primary vehicle for US indebtedness, and Thaler and Sunstein produce an array of statistics that illustrate their centrality to Americans’ personal finances, including the average number of credit cards per cardholder (8.5) and the average American’s credit card debt ($8,000).

(Shortform note: However, as noted above, **Americans’ debt situation has changed significantly** since _Nudge_ ’s publication (and the corrective of the 2008 financial crisis). Whereas, in 2007, the credit card debt of the average American household was around $8,000, as of March 2021 it was $6,741.)

Thaler and Sunstein’s solution to the spendthrift effects of credit cards is a **credit card-specific transparency program.**

In this system, credit card companies would be required to send cardholders a detailed annual statement featuring not only the year’s purchases **but also the year’s fees, interest charges, and penalties**. This information would make the true cost of our credit card spending clearer to us and allow us to more easily compare cards.

(Shortform note: The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Credit CARD act) outlawed many of credit card companies’ most unsavory practices, including raising interest rates arbitrarily and giving cardholders insufficient time to pay their debt before incurring a penalty. It also nudged credit card companies to provide (1) simpler and more transparent agreements and (2) more information in their statements, including target dates for paying off the card if the cardholder only made minimum payments. In addition, most credit cards’ online banking interfaces **offer annual reports as well as real-time transaction information**.)

Thaler and Sunstein propose another nudge that would alter the default for the credit card’s autopay feature. Whereas most cards default to whatever the minimum payment is for that month—typically a tiny fraction of the total amount owed—a libertarian paternalist approach would set the default at a higher percentage of the total, or even allow cardholders to automatically pay off the entire amount owed every month.

(Shortform note: Most credit cards’ autopay features have the equivalent of a mandated choice step: Users have to opt in to the autopay option. But, once users _have_ opted in, **they have more choices than just paying the minimum**.)

### Transparency Programs in Health Care

Choosing a health insurance plan, like choosing a retirement plan or mortgage, is a decision with high stakes, specialized terminology (PPO, HMO, HSA), and delayed outcomes. **Thus it’s a choice ripe for helpful nudges**.

To illustrate the need for nudges when it comes to choosing a health care plan, Thaler and Sunstein examine the choice structure of Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit for American seniors that passed in 2003 and rolled out in 2005. When the program debuted, it offered beneficiaries a choice of, on average, between 40 and 50 unique plans; its defaults for so-called “dual eligibles”—poor or disabled citizens who qualified for both Medicare and Medicaid—were chosen at random; and its website was so complex that **even the most computer savvy senior would have trouble navigating it**.

In short, Medicare Part D offered too many choices **without adequate information or functionality to help seniors map plans to benefits**.

(Shortform note: When, in 2013, the debut of the health insurance marketplaces instituted by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was marred by technical glitches and minuscule enrollment, commentators frequently invoked the flawed rollout of Medicare Part D eight years before as a comparison.)

In addition to smarter defaults that would automatically assign dual eligibles to plans based on their current prescriptions, Thaler and Sunstein propose a Medicare Part D transparency program. In such a program, **Medicare Part D plans would provide enrollees with an annual report** that included an itemized list of medications used and fees incurred. This report would be available digitally as well as physically, so it could be imported into the Medicare website or a third-party application for comparison with competing plans.

(Shortform note: The digitization of the health care industry has brought about many improvements that Thaler and Sunstein likely approve of, allowing more information to be readily accessible to users. Most insurers now offer **personalized online interfaces** through which customers can access all claims and payment information. Many insurers—and marketplace.gov—also offer comparison tables that illustrate different plans’ benefits.)

> **Are Transparency Programs Actually a Nudge?**
> 
> In some of Thaler and Sunstein’s examples of transparency programs, **they conflate disclosures made before a transaction with those made after it**. For example, Thaler and Sunstein categorize both of the following as transparency:
> 
>   * A cellular service enumerating all of its fees, including real-life examples, _before_ a person purchases the service
> 
>   * A cellular service providing its customers with a detailed report listing all the ways a person _actually used_ the service and the fees that person incurred
> 
> 

> 
> The problem with classifying the second example as a nudge is that **it’s helpful only _after_ the person has already made a choice**. In other words, under that scenario, we might make a terrible initial choice and receive our “nudge” only when we get the detailed report. The transparency, therefore, doesn’t change our behavior during the decision-making process and therefore is not an actual nudge.
> 
> Some critics of the book have pointed out as much, arguing that some of what Thaler and Sunstein press for is merely more transparency, which is hardly a revolutionary idea.
