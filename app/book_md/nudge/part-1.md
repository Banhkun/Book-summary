## Part 1: Overview of Biases, Libertarian Paternalism, and Nudges

In _Nudge_ , Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein propose a series of reforms—“nudges”—that can help policymakers and other choice designers **lead people to make better choices without restricting their freedom to choose**. Thaler and Sunstein’s premise is that no choice is ever neutral because **the way a choice is presented, even if randomly, affects the way people engage with it** —and so governments, private companies, and other entities should frame options in ways that can improve people’s decisions.

In this first part, we’ll examine some common biases that Thaler and Sunstein argue drive people to make poor decisions, we’ll give an overview of libertarian paternalism, and we’ll look at when Thaler and Sunstein think nudges are needed.

### Common Biases

Thaler and Sunstein argue that people have evolved to make snap decisions in a wide variety of areas in order to save time and mental energy—we’re more likely to survive if we rely on rules of thumb (largely accurate guides based on experiences in similar situations) when deciding—for example, whether an animal is a threat (if we spend time carefully analyzing it, we might be eaten before reaching our conclusion).

They note that while such rules of thumb—also called _heuristics_ or _biases_ —can be helpful, they can also mislead us into making poor decisions. Biases can be helpful when we, for example, estimate how often we’ll need to stop for gas on a trip, or when we try a new food because we’ve had good experiences experimenting previously. But, **biases can harm us when they skew our judgments**. For example, we may see that everyone’s buying up a hot stock and might jump to invest without properly assessing the risk (relying on the rule of thumb that if everyone’s doing something, it can’t be wrong)—and we might lose our investment if the stock subsequently tanks.

Some of the biases that Thaler and Sunstein discuss in the book, upon which many of their nudges rely, include:

  * The _anchoring _bias—when we take a fact we know (or think we know) and adjust it to account for a fact we don’t (such as when an auction opens the bidding at a high number because people associate a high price with value and will therefore see that object as valuable (Shortform note: Impulsive decision-making favors anchoring bias, so using a simple checklist can help you overcome it.)
  * The _availability _bias—when we answer questions and make judgments on the basis of whether comparable examples come readily to mind rather than statistical probability (if you hear a story of someone surviving a deadly disease, you’re likely to think it’s less deadly than the statistics show) (Shortform note: In business, you can avoid availability bias by creating diverse teams and seeking broad input.)
  * The _representativeness _bias—when we categorize a phenomenon based on how similar it is to the _stereotype_ of some category (when you believe a lawyer is skilled because she has a fancy office) (Shortform note: To avoid representativeness bias, ask others to point out when you’re relying on it.)
  * The _status quo_ bias—when we stick with our first choice or current situation, just because (when you stick with your current phone service provider even though a different one offers a better deal). This bias leads to inertia—the tendency toward inaction. (Shortform note: Marketers often try to overcome consumers’ status quo bias by framing the current status as a losing proposition.)
  * The _loss aversion_ bias—when we psychologically feel losses more strongly than gains, and therefore try to avoid them, even if it means we pass up opportunities in doing so or make risky decisions to avoid losses (think the stock market). (Shortform note: Studies show that people feel losses more than gains by approximately two to one.) Like the status quo bias, this bias can lead to inertia, because we’re wary of the risks of change. 



(Shortform note: The names of these biases were coined by Kahneman, Tversky, and Thaler, as well as behavioral psychologists William Samuelson and Richard Zeckhauser. They’re widely used today in behavioral economics and are accepted as a basis for many psychology theories in both academic circles and on more informal platforms, like blogs.)

> **Do Cognitive Biases Exist? Kahneman and Tversky vs. Gigerenzer**
> 
> Throughout _Nudge_ , Thaler and Sunstein take the cognitive biases (or, in Kahneman and Tversky’s early formulation, “cognitive illusions”) of heuristics for granted. However, **researchers have challenged at least some of the psychological research on which Thaler and Sunstein rely**.
> 
> The most formidable challenge to heuristics research has been mounted by German psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer. In “How to Make Cognitive Illusions Disappear: Beyond ‘Heuristics and Biases’,” Gigerenzer objects that Kahneman and Tversky (hereafter “K&T”) have adopted a problematically narrow interpretation of probability theory. K&T’s notion of biases (**and the errors of judgment they produce**) depend on norms of statistics and probability—in other words, that the rules of probability produce a “correct” answer, one that people miss because they rely on heuristics. Gigerenzer argues that K&T are misapplying probability theory because **they concentrate on _single events_ rather than the _frequency of events_**.
> 
> To explain what he means, Gigerenzer recounts one of K&T’s most famous survey questions. In the preface to the question, they describe “Linda” as being an outspoken and intelligent former philosophy major, who, as a student, was active in the social justice and anti-nuclear movements. K&T then ask which is more probable:
> 
>   * Linda is a bank teller
> 
>   * Linda is a bank teller and active in the feminist movement
> 
> 

> 
> In the original experiment, a whopping 85% of participants chose (b). According to probability theory, though, the conjunction of two events—that Linda is both bank teller _and_ feminist, for example—**is _always less probable_ than the incidence of _one_ of those events**. In short, the participants were fooled by the representativeness heuristic: Because Linda fit their notion of a feminist, they chose (b), even though there are bound to be more bank tellers than there are bank tellers who are also feminist activists.
> 
> However, for Gigerenzer, **the participants’ choice of (b) isn’t an error.** Because K&T ask for the probability of a _single event_ —that Linda is a bank teller and feminist activist—rather than a _frequency_ of events, K&T aren’t actually testing people’s ability to gauge probabilities at all. (Rather, writes Gigerenzer, they’re asking a question about social psychology.)
> 
> Gigerenzer notes that, when the question asks about frequency rather than a single event**, the representativeness heuristic disappears**. In a different version of the question, participants are told that there are 100 people who fit Linda’s description (philosophy major, active in social justice movements). Then participants are asked how many of them are
> 
>   * bank tellers
> 
>   * bank tellers and active in the feminist movement
> 
> 

> 
> When the question is phrased this way, **the numbers effectively reverse** , with over 80% of participants answering that more people are (a) than (b).
> 
> K&T, for their part, dispute Gigerenzer’s characterization of their findings, noting that a central part of their research program is indeed exploring how the framing __ of a question can affect people’s reasoning ability. (Again, **if we were all _homo economicus_ , the wording or context of a particular question would be immaterial**.) In fact, K&T report _in their own work_ that changing the wording of a question to emphasize frequency mitigates the representativeness heuristic. In other words, they allege that**Gigerenzer’s critique is based on their own results**.
> 
> Gigerenzer’s subsequent research program has focused on the advantages of “fast and frugal” reasoning.)—that is, **the advantages of gut feelings and heuristics**. At the moment, though, **his critique seems to have lost out** : Kahneman and Tversky’s (and so Thaler and Sunstein’s) theories of heuristics are dominant in the fields of behavioral psychology and economics.

### Libertarian Paternalism and Choice Design

Thaler and Sunstein’s object in _Nudge_ isn’t simply to provide solutions to people’s habits of making poor choices for themselves; rather, it’s to introduce an umbrella approach to public policy:**libertarian paternalism**.

Libertarian paternalism describes **a combination of _libertarianism_ (prioritizing personal freedom) and _paternalism_ (limiting choice in order to bring about better results)**. In a world of libertarian paternalism, the public and private entities that present us with choices—**choice designers** —would use subtle techniques to push us toward the “right” choices—the ones we would make for ourselves if we weren’t susceptible to cognitive bias, temptation, or social influence.

**These pushes, so subtle that the average person wouldn’t recognize them as influences, are what Thaler and Sunstein call “nudges.”** An effective nudge _takes advantage of our decision-making weaknesses_ to steer us toward beneficial—or, at least, less harmful—choices.

> **Critiques of Libertarian Paternalism**
> 
> Thaler and Sunstein fashion libertarian paternalism as a happy medium between far-right libertarianism and far-left paternalism. As a result, **libertarian paternalism has come in for critique from both the left and the right**.
> 
> On the right, orthodox libertarians believe that libertarian paternalism is problematic **because _any_ kind of paternalism is problematic**. For example, in his book _The Manipulation of Choice: Ethics and Libertarian Paternalism_ , philosopher Mark D. White argues that presuming to know what the “right” choice is for anyone is a nonstarter; people are too different for there to be any baseline standard of what’s “good” or “bad” for someone. Because libertarian paternalism presumes a universally preferred choice, **it fails to account for the infinite variety of preferences among people**.
> 
> Reviewing _Nudge_ for the Mises Institute, a research organization committed to the free-market thought of economist Ludwig von Mises, scholar David Gordon argues that libertarian paternalism’s **assumption of human irrationality** —our vulnerability to bias, temptation, and other influences—**could be dangerous to human freedom**. For example, if people are incorrigibly prone to bias, **who’s to say that _any_ decision a person makes is the “right” one?** Gordon believes Thaler and Sunstein’s assumptions of human error in decision-making could lead to more paternalistic, and less libertarian, “nudges” down the line.
> 
> On the left, critics have taken issue with the libertarian commitments of libertarian paternalism. For example, in a review of Sunstein’s _How Change Happens (2019) _in _The New Republic_ , Aaron Timms points out that “nudges” are inadequate to large-scale problems like climate change or income inequality that require societal, “paternalistic” regulation and reform.

### Nudges, and When to Nudge

According to Thaler and Sunstein, not all decisions require nudges. (Although it’s important to remember that **all choices feature _some_ sort of design **and so, in effect, **feature nudges, whether on purpose or not**.) The kinds of decisions that most warrant nudges are:

#### Rare and Difficult Decisions

Saving for retirement, buying a house, or choosing a college are each monumental decisions that come around once or rarely in a lifetime. Because we only have one or two cracks at each decision, **we have no opportunity to learn if we make a mistake**. Thus they’re prime candidates for nudges.

(Shortform note: A libertarian counterargument might be that, when it comes to major life decisions, no one, no matter how well intentioned, should be putting their finger on the scale. But, as Thaler and Sunstein note, _all choices, whether purposely or not, already feature nudges_ , **and so it’s acceptable to curate that choice to improve outcomes**.)

#### Decisions With Delayed Outcomes

For many decisions, the results of our choices are immediate and clear. When we use our debit card to buy a gift for a loved one, we see the consequences of that choice reflected almost instantaneously on our account statement.

**For other decisions, however, the outcomes of our choices are delayed or obscure**. For example, someone can smoke for years and experience no negative effects—until the day he or she suffers a stroke. Nudges can help us make better decisions in situations like these, when the consequences of our actions aren’t immediately apparent.

(Shortform note: Thaler and Sunstein’s assumption here is that, although the outcome is delayed for the chooser, it’s immediate—or at least known—to the choice designer. But there are any number of choices where the ultimate outcomes are unknown to all. Take smartphone use, for example. Studies have shown that smartphones boost worker productivity—in addition to providing convenience—yet the long-term health effects of consistent cell phone use remain unclear. In this circumstance, it might be perilous to nudge someone toward or away from using a cell phone.)

#### Decisions Requiring Specialized Knowledge

Many of the most important decisions we face—choosing a retirement or health care plan, for example—are presented to us **using specialized terms that can confuse more than inform**. Most of us—unless we work in finance—would be at a loss when faced with terms like “defined contribution” and “expense ratio.” Given especially complex and unpredictable options, nudges can be vital.

(Shortform note: **These sorts of nudges can also be used to take advantage of the layperson**. For example, a financial firm might nudge a client toward an investment that benefits the firm itself more than the investor.)

> **Decision-Making 101**
> 
> Nudges aren’t the only way to improve people’s decision-making; in fact, there’s a vast literature dedicated to helping us think twice (sometimes literally!) before making a choice.
> 
>   * Tony Robbins’s _Awaken the Giant Within_ teaches readers to take control of their “Master System”—the ideas, emotions, values, beliefs, and experiential reference points that inform any decision.
> 
>   * In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear shows how half of our daily actions (i.e., decisions) are force of habit. Once we become aware of our habits and how to change them, we can also improve our decision-making.
> 
>   * In _Multipliers_ , Liz Wiseman and Greg McKeown break down the personal qualities that result in successful leadership. “Multipliers”—those leaders who add value to whatever situation they find themselves in—consult as many people as possible, especially if they have divergent viewpoints, before coming to a decision.
> 
>   * In _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , author Brené Brown writes that one of the keys to living “wholeheartedly” is to follow your intuition when making a decision. She advises her readers to let go of the need for certainty and simply “go with your gut.”
> 
>   * Daniel Kahneman, in _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ , writes that when it comes to high-stakes decisions, we absolutely must think twice—that is, we have to use our careful and deliberate system of cognition (System 2) to augment our intuitive, automatic system (System 1).
> 
> 

> 
> Which approach to decision-making is the most effective? Is it better to seek out as much advice as you can (Wiseman and McKeown), think twice (Kahneman), or go with your gut (Brown)? There’s evidence to support each, yet Thaler and Sunstein would likely say that the answer is immaterial: Because nudges _rely_ on our tendency to err, **they remove—or at least reduce—the need for improved decision-making skills**.
