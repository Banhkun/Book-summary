## Part 3: Controversial and Miscellaneous Nudges

Toward the end of _Nudge_ , Thaler and Sunstein apply libertarian paternalism to some hot-button issues in American society, including tort reform and the institution of marriage. They also round out the book with a series of miscellaneous nudge ideas, two of which we’ll review below.

### Reducing Health Care Prices

An evergreen topic among health policy researchers is the excessive cost of health care in the United States. (Shortform note: Compared to other economically developed countries, **the US is an outlier in terms of the expense of health care**. For example, in 2019, the US spent 16.8% of GDP on health care while the UK spent 10.2%, Canada spent 10.8%, France spent 11.1%, and Germany spent 11.7%. The UK, Canada, France, and Germany all have robust social insurance programs that include publicly funded health care systems.)

One of the causes of these high costs, claim Thaler and Sunstein, is malpractice insurance. The logic goes something like this: If doctors no longer had to purchase expensive liability insurance to protect themselves from being sued, they could offer their patients—in reality, their patients’ insurance companies—lower prices.

Thaler and Sunstein’s solution is to **allow patients to waive their right to sue** in the case of malpractice—an option currently disallowed under US jurisprudence—**in exchange for lower prices**. (Thaler and Sunstein even explore the possibility of **making the right-to-sue waiver the _default_ option** on health insurance plans. In this scenario, beneficiaries would have to pay a premium to be able to sue their providers for malpractice.) As more and more people waive their right to sue, so the theory goes, **health care prices will decline across the board**.

(Shortform note: The right to waive one’s right to sue satisfies the libertarian half of libertarian paternalism, but the question is: **Would it actually reduce health care costs?** Thaler and Sunstein acknowledge that the research they cite on the cost impact of liability insurance is “controversial and may be exaggerated”; in fact, most researchers have determined that **malpractice insurance costs comprise a tiny portion of total health care spending**. One study published in _Health Affairs_ , for example, found that the medical liability system only accounts for 2.4% of total health care spending.)

### Renaming Marriage

Thaler and Sunstein wade into the then-controversial subject of same-sex marriage. They argue that all sides in the debate of whether to allow it or not could be satisfied if the legal licensing of marriage was separated from the religious aspect of it. They thus propose that the government stop issuing “marriage” licenses and instead issue licenses for _civil unions_ , which would deny no one based on gender or sexuality, thereby leaving _marriage_ to be regulated by religious organizations instead of the government. They contend that this would protect religious freedom while maximizing choice.

Their proposal would ensure that anyone entering into a civil union would have the same legal protections and benefits as anyone in a marriage—including tax, inheritance, and property benefits as well as the ability to make medical decisions. Private and religious organizations could continue to adhere to the marriage norms and rites defined by their beliefs.

The authors then expand their discussion to outline some ways in which people might be encouraged to enter into marriages—or civil unions—with more awareness of the risks and better prepared to manage a possible dissolution of the marriage. They suggest defaults and transparency programs that would encourage people to be less starry-eyed and more realistic about the possibility of future divorce. Their suggestions include:

  * Instituting default laws that provide financial assistance for the primary caregiver of any children involved in the marriage, or that default to joint custody if neither parent was negligent (eliminating some common arguing points in many divorces). 
  * Solidify rules deciding child support and alimony so that they’re based on hard inputs like the age of both spouses, their earning power, and the length of the marriage, so that the number of options available to a judge to decide is limited. 
  * Publicize these rules so that couples are educated about such matters before entering the marriage. 



> **Why Do Thaler and Sunstein Want to Rename Marriage?**
> 
> The socio-historical background to Thaler and Sunstein’s proposal is the debate over same-sex marriage. Before the landmark 2015 Supreme Court decision in _Obergefell v. Hodges_ , which legalized same-sex marriage throughout the US, there existed a patchwork of laws: Some states recognized same-sex marriage, others recognized “civil unions” but not marriages, still others recognized neither.
> 
> For many advocates of marriage equality, civil unions were inherently discriminatory and unequal: They created a “second tier” of domestic partnership that marked same-sex partnerships as somehow different from opposite-sex partnerships. Thaler and Sunstein’s solution is, at least as far as government is concerned, **to separate the “tiers” entirely.** In terms of a couple’s legal status as domestic partners, the only option would be a civil union; **“marriage” ceases to exist in the eyes of the law**.
> 
> Of course, Thaler and Sunstein don’t consider that same-sex couples might _want_ to be “married” in the eyes of the law for the same traditional reasons opposite-sex couples might want to be. Doing away with state-sanctioned marriage creates equality in civil unions, **but it neglects the historical and cultural associations marriage has** for same- and opposite-sex couples alike.
> 
> Further, it’s not clear that their proposed solution of converting all marriages to civil unions is a nudge. From one point of view, it could be considered a change of the default: Rather than legal marriage, **civil unions become the default domestic partnership**. But the more persuasive view is that it’s **simply a reform to improve people’s lives** rather than a nudge to improve their decision-making.
> 
> Their suggestions toward the end of this section, regarding how to make the risks of marriage more clear to those entering it, are more clearly nudges, as they are designed to empower people to make wiser decisions. But it might be said that their thoughts on solving the same-sex marriage debate were simply ideas they wanted to publicize, and that they used their book as a platform to do so even though the ideas were somewhat unrelated to nudges.

### Miscellaneous Nudges

As noted in the introduction to this guide, Thaler and Sunstein offer a smorgasbord of nudges throughout the book. Many of these nudges have proved prescient—whereas, in 2005, they were either pipe dreams or in early development, in 2021 they’re becoming more and more the norm. Examples include:

  * _Civility Warnings_ : In the age of social media and the “hot take,” people are all too susceptible to firing off an angry tweet or text in a fit of passion. A “civility warning” would recognize the sentiment of the message you aim to send and prompt you with a question: “Warning: This appears to be an uncivil message. Do you really wish to send it?” An even stronger iteration of this nudge would force users to wait a day before sending the uncivil message. (Shortform note: Although this precise nudge hasn’t come to fruition, most email clients will prompt you if, for example, you mention an attachment in the body of an email but don’t attach anything _to_ the email. And in 2015, Gmail debuted its “undo send” feature, which gives users up to 30 seconds to recall a just-sent email (if, say, it contained some ill-considered language).) 



_Driver Feedback_ : At the time of _Nudge_ ’s writing, Nissan was developing the ECO pedal, an accelerator pedal that pushed back on the driver’s foot to reduce fuel consumption and increase fuel efficiency. (Shortform note: Since then, Nissan has developed the “E-Pedal,” which allows drivers to accelerate and slow down—and even come to a full stop—using just one pedal. Many hybrid cars feature an “ECO” operating mode, which reduces throttle response and enables the car to run more fuel-efficiently (though, typically, with less accelerating power). Some cars also feature “lane assist” features, which nudge—literally—drifting drivers back into their lane by providing resistance in the steering wheel.)

> Because Thaler and Sunstein define a nudge as anything that “significantly alters the behavior” of people making decisions, almost anything at all might feasibly be classified as a nudge. Thaler and Sunstein themselves acknowledge this by saying that when it comes to choice design, _everything matters_.
> 
> However, critics object that when a term encompasses all manner of phenomena—for example, everything from the placement of a store’s entrance and the color of its shopping bags to the background color of a web page—it loses its descriptive force. This is why critics of Nudge have called many of its proposals common sense or calls for transparency rather than nudges.
