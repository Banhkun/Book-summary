## Chapter 6: Test with the Minimum Viable Product

Your goal is to move through the Build-Measure-Learn loop as quickly as possible. Even though the loop has 3 steps, Build is often the step where you will waste the most time.

The critical question you need to answer is: what is the **MINIMUM product you can build to get reliable data on your hypothesis**?

This product is termed the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and is one of the most important concepts in Lean Startup. This is the product that is the bare minimum to test your hypothesis. Unlike normal product development, **you are NOT aiming for product perfection** – you’re merely trying to start learning as soon as possible.

The value hypothesis is key to most startups – “does anyone want what we’re building?” The typical wrong route many entrepreneurs make is to simply build their full product, then wait for results. Here’s the problem with that approach – **every extra feature you add before testing means wasted time**. You might be pointed entirely in the wrong direction. Building features nobody wants means more wasted time before you test and find out you’re in the wrong direction.

Depending on your business, there are a variety of ways to test your hypothesis in the cheapest, fastest way possible. In the more extreme, you don’t need a product at all - you can simply pretend you have a product and collect user behavior.

We’ll cover a range of such possibilities, from landing pages and videos to manually-serviced technology.

### The Landing Page MVP

Let’s say you wanted to build a new social app where you take a picture of yourself, and the app swaps your face with celebrities. You can then share the hilarious results on social media. Call it CelebrityFaceSwap.

Based on your business model research, you have some assumptions around conversion rates to make the app sustainable – out of 100 people who visit your site, 20 people might sign up, 10 people will stick around for a week, and so on.

Let’s focus on the hypothesis of the 20% sign up rate (20 signups out of 100 visitors). What is the MVP in this situation? Think about it for a second.

A common answer might be: “a simple prototype that’s light in features – instead of all celebrities, you can only swap faces with Kanye West. And you can only post to one social network, Facebook. We’ll market it and track conversion rate for users who land on our page.”

This is much better than building a fully fledged product over the course of a year. But you can go simpler.

You actually don’t even need to have a working, functional app!

Here’s how. Picture a web page that describes the features of your face swapping app. You show mockups of what it looks like when your face is on Kim Kardashian’s body, or when Donald Trump’s face is on your body. At the bottom of the page, you have a Download button. You track clicks on this Download button.

**That’s all you need. You can test your hypothesis without an app at all.** If you funnel in 100 users, you can see how many people enter the page, and how many people click the button. You can tell very quickly whether you’re far off from the 20% hypothesis.

If your idea is a hit, you might get great results – say, a 40% click rate. This gives you confidence to move forward.

But this number might also turn out to be 1%. In this case, a critical assumption you had about your business falls through. If 99% of people don’t even bother to click Download, chances are that people don’t want what you’re building.

And you were able to figure this out without actually building an app! Armed with this data, you can switch your direction quickly, swapping new features into your landing page, or proposing a new product altogether.

If this is a new concept to you, it should be mind-blowing right now. **To test whether customers actually want your product, you don’t actually need the product.**

Here are a few more examples of MVPs.

### The Video MVP

Before building a functional product, you can simply **make a video simulating what the product does**. Even without using the actual product, watching the video will give enough info for viewers to decide whether they want the product shown.

This is what Dropbox did at its beginning. If you haven’t heard of it, Dropbox is a file syncing software that synchronizes your files across your devices. If you upload a Word doc to your Dropbox folder on your laptop, you can then access the same doc on your work computer or your phone.

This is a super-complicated product to build, and also hard to describe in words. In 2007, Dropbox’s founder, Drew Houston, had built an early prototype, but it wasn’t fully functioning, and it wasn’t ready to handle a massive number of users. But Drew still wanted to test whether people wanted his product.

So he recorded a video of his prototype, demonstrating its main features and use cases. At the bottom of the video was a form to join the waiting list for the private beta.

Drew posted this video to online communities Hacker News and Digg, and the response hit a nerve. It drew hundreds of thousands of views and thousands of people joined their beta waiting list. Without having to release his product, Drew was able to prove that people truly faced a file sync problem, and Dropbox was the solution. He could now move forward and build the product with confidence.

### Concierge MVP

Many successful businesses have optimized processes to service at scale. But at your early stage, premature optimization is a huge waste of time. You don’t need to handle 100,000 customers right now. You literally need to make just 1 customer happy.

**With the Concierge MVP, you give each early customer the white-glove treatment.** You deliver the service personally without worrying about how to scale your time. This lets you figure out whether your solution is anywhere near the right direction, without spending the hard work building efficient processes.

Let’s say you want to build the meal service Blue Apron from scratch. Blue Apron sends customers pre-portioned recipes in boxes and minimizes prep time – you only need to cook the ingredients.

At scale, Blue Apron is complicated – you need warehouses to store food, assembly lines to chop and package food, and delivery services. But again, at the start, you only need to make one customer happy at first.

Your Concierge MVP would be bare-bones and manually serviced. First, you ask a potential customer what recipes she wants to prepare for dinner. You then go to the grocery store yourself, buy the ingredients, pre-package them, and give them to her in a box. You give a true concierge treatment – you follow up to learn how the cooking went, and you interview her in detail to see what you can improve about your service.

Clearly this isn’t scalable. But you more than compensate with the **speed with which you can validate your hypothesis** – whether people want your product.

And the Concierge MVP has a special perk - because you’re already spending so much time with your customers, you have an open door to conducting detailed customer interviews. You might find that people don’t want pre-portioned food to cook at all – they just want pre-cooked food like delivery. Or you find that they get bored of recipes really quickly.

Think about it this way – if you can’t make your product work with full human attention, your scalable product wouldn’t work either. In many products and services, it’s unlikely that an automated solution would do a significantly better job than a smart capable human could.

But if your product _does_ work, you can march forward with confidence, converting what the human was doing into an automated, scalable technique.

### Wizard of Oz MVP

Many startup ideas revolve around fancy automated services, especially those involving machine learning/artificial intelligence. In the Wizard of Oz MVP, you don’t build the technology at all - you simply have a human perform what the machine will eventually do.

Let’s use an example of an AI gift recommender. You, the customer, write a few sentences about what the gift recipient’s personality and interests are. The product returns 3 Amazon links with products the recipient is likely to enjoy.

This is a pretty complicated product to build. Once again, **you don’t want to waste time building the algorithms before figuring out if anyone even wants your service**. It might turn out that this concept just doesn’t resonate with people, or that your recommendation strategy is poor.

So how do you test this concept? Once again, you can replace the service with a human. In a Wizard of Oz MVP, the user thinks she’s interacting with an automated product, but in reality behind the curtain a human is pulling the levers. In the case of the AI gift recommender, a user could submit a few sentences on a web form. Behind the curtain, a human looks at the submission, curates a list of suggestions, and emails them to the user, pretending to be an automated service.

This gives the user a faithful representation of what the fully fledged product would act like, and you can gauge their reaction. You save a ton of product development time by using a human, who is quickly adaptable to new situations and quick to train.

This MVP strategy works because, frankly, **the user doesn’t care whether the backend is powered by an algorithm or a human**. She just cares that her problem is being solved – in this case, that the gift recommendations are good and your friend’s going to be happy. If customers love when a human solve their problems, they’ll likely love when a machine solves them the same way.

### What the MVP is NOT

Note that:

  * **The MVP is NOT the smallest product imaginable.** It needs to be _enough to test your hypothesis_. Sometimes this can actually mean a functional product. Sometimes it can just be a web page. It really depends on your hypothesis. But if your MVP seems complex, consider simplifying your hypothesis to focus on the core assumption.
  * **The MVP is NOT an excuse to ignore all quality problems.** Some quality issues really make a difference to the customer. Let’s say you build an engaging video like Dropbox’s example above, but the video takes 10 seconds to load. In response, users bounce away from the page without ever hearing about your product. If you ignore this error, you’ll infer the wrong conclusion – that users don’t want your product – when in fact they never learned what your product does in the first place. You need to design your MVP to make sure it reliably tests your hypothesis.
  * **The MVP is NOT an excuse to “just launch and see what happens.”** Your MVP should be tied to direct quantifiable hypotheses, like “10% of all visitors will sign up for the beta,” or “1% of all active users will pay at least $5.” If you don’t have these hypotheses set in stone, 1) you’ll design a faulty MVP that doesn’t lead to productive learning, 2) as you collect data, you’ll fall into complacence (“well, only 2% of visitors signed up, but that’s still pretty good.”) 
  * **The MVP is NOT a magical product that you have no hope of building.** With all of these MVPs, you should be at least _somewhat_ confident that you can build what’s being promised. If you boast about a breathing device that lets you stay underwater for 30 minutes without scuba gear, you might get a lot of signups. But if you can’t deliver, your company will fail in the long term.



### You Will Likely Overbuild Your MVP

When you build your MVP, you will likely be tempted to overbuild. Your pride as a professional inhibits you from releasing low quality work. You fantasize about a world where your product is commonplace, and you can’t bear to build something that’s just 2% of that final vision.

But keep this in mind: **If you do not know who the customer is, you do not know what quality is**.

In other words, you may spend hundreds of hours polishing a high-quality feature that no one wants. If no one wants it, can you really say it’s high quality, or that it even matters?

In contrast, if you produce a barebones MVP and customers tell you something is low quality, then that’s valuable data on what you should focus on next. Your early adopters care primarily about the core of what you’re offering; without bells and whistles, a promising idea will still show great metrics.

### Why You Will Launch Your MVP Too Late

Finally, you’re likely to launch an MVP too late because you suffer from common fallacies. Here they are, and here’s how to deal with them:

  * **You’re afraid that a competitor will steal your idea**. In reality, there are too many good ideas in the world and not enough good people or time to execute on them. Just _try_ to pitch a product manager or venture capitalist to work on your idea – it’s not going to happen. They have an abundance of ideas to work on and not enough time. You’ll more likely find early on that no customers actually want what you’re offering.
  * **You’re afraid that you’ll lose your “first mover advantage” if you go public earlier.** In reality, if you make it big, competition will come after you, no matter what. And if you aren’t able to fend them off in the long run, you’re dead anyway. Your only long-term winning strategy is to learn faster and be better than the competition, and waiting doesn’t give you any advantage.
  * Ego prevents you from confronting the risk of failure. So you keep building, pushing off negative feedback so you don’t feel the sting of rejection from your target users. 
  * **You’re afraid that a minimally-featured product doesn’t showcase the full potential of your vision,** and customers will reject the MVP when they would otherwise have loved your product. Look at it this way – if customers don’t respond well to your MVP, you can figure out why. If it’s because the MVP’s missing a critical feature that was part of your vision, you can build it in and re-test. You don’t lose much. But if you find that a core part of your vision is mistaken, your MVP will help you find out earlier. You have much to gain and less to lose.
  * If you do fear that a prematurely negative result will make you lose hope, you can promise ahead of time that no matter what happens in the MVP, you will not give up hope until a certain number of iterations or time point. Successful entrepreneurs don’t give up easily. 
  * **You’re afraid of a bad reputation from a bad MVP that will cripple your brand**. In reality, your MVP is unlikely to gain so much attention that this is going to matter in the long run. But if you’re worried about it, just launch the MVP under a different brand. You’ll still be able to test and learn, without any negative consequences transferring over.
  * **You’re afraid of legal intellectual property or patent risk** , since showing your product to the public can complicate patenting your idea. This is a legitimate concern for some companies, and you should consult a lawyer.



As LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman says, “**if you’re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late**.”

Be bold, and savor learning. Don’t be afraid about being wrong or embarrassing yourself. You will thank yourself later.
