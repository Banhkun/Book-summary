## Part 2: Steer | Chapter 5: Form Your Hypothesis

With your startup, your goal is to learn as quickly as you can with disciplined experiments. Central to Lean Startup is the **Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop**.

Let’s step through this loop once:

**First, you set your hypothesis.** What do you believe about your customers that is vital to your business? How are you going to measure this?

Next, you **build the MINIMAL product necessary to test the hypothesis**.

Next, you **run the experiment**. Often this means exposing users to the product and collecting data on their behavior.

Finally, you **analyze the data and reflect** – how far off was your hypothesis? What do you need to change about your strategy? Should you actually change your entire direction?

Then you update the hypothesis or set a new one. Then you build the minimal product to test that hypothesis, and so on.

The faster you move through this loop, the faster you’ll learn, and the more progress you’ll make. Imagine how much you’d learn from 10 steadily improving prototypes vs 1 giant, fully-featured prototype.

### Startup Hypotheses

Every startup begins with a set of hypotheses about how the business will work. As stated above, there are typically two core hypotheses: the Value hypothesis (what your users want), and the Growth hypothesis (how your startup will grow).

Some hypotheses are very un-risky – they’re very likely to be true. If your business will rely on advertising for revenue, for example, chances are good that you’ll be able to procure the same advertising rates as competitors in your industry. Online advertising has matured enough that advertisers know how much they want to pay for which types of ads across the Internet.

**But other hypotheses are much riskier and less likely to be true.** Often, these riskiest hypotheses underlie the reason your business exists. Namely:

  * Do people actually have the problem you believe they have? 
  * Do they actually want what you’re offering? 
  * Are they willing to pay for it?



#### The Dangerous Startup by Analogy

One insidious way to frame your business is by **analogy to other companies**. If there’s a successful company that succeeded because of attribute X, then it’s tempting to say that because you also have attribute X, you’ll naturally succeed.

This superficially looks like sound logic, but in reality **it’s very weak and papers over a lot of assumptions** that may not hold up on closer inspection.

(Shortform example: for example, when Uber paved the way for on-demand services, a litany of companies cropped up to start the “Uber of [blank].” The logic for an on-demand service was as follows:

> We are the Uber of laundry servicing. Uber allows users to request a car on demand using a mobile app, reducing friction far beyond hailing a taxi. Similarly, our users request laundry services on demand, we pick the clothes up and launder in our laundry rooms, and we deliver their laundry to their home 24 hours later. The laundry industry is worth $15 billion. Just as Uber is now larger than the entire taxi industry, we will be larger than the entire laundry industry.

Sound good?

This argument sounds superficially reasonable. In particular, by merely associating with an uber-successful company, your idea looks better.

But this analogy **hides the underlying assumptions** about how the business will work. A more accurate restatement of the pitch is as follows:

> Lots of people who don’t have cars need transportation on demand. Before Uber, getting a car was a huge pain. Hailing a taxi took minutes of standing in the rain, and you might need to call ahead by 30 minutes to get a taxi to drop by. Uber built a mobile app that allows riders to request a car frictionlessly. To service riders, Uber accesses cheap labor through part-time contractors who use their own vehicles (fully paid for by the contractor). This lowers the cost of each ride, creating a virtuous cycle wherein more riders led to more drivers joining, leading to lower costs and faster pickups, leading to more riders. They’re now bigger than the taxi industry because cheaper rides and lower friction encouraged more usage – I certainly use Uber now more than I ever used taxis.
> 
> We’ll do the same for the laundry industry. The friction for laundry is currently high – you either go to a Laundromat, or you have to trudge your laundry across your home to your laundry machines. Then you have to move your clothes to the dryer and fold your clothes. The average laundry load costs $2 at a Laundromat, or $0.50 at home. That’s where we come in. Users can request laundry services in real time. We pick up the laundry and process them in our laundry facilities. We have economies of scale that lower costs below what users pay now. In fact, users will be willing to pay above their cost of laundry because of the time saved. Like Uber, we’ll grow to be larger than the current laundry industry because when users realize how convenient our service is, they’ll do laundry more than they used to.

This more insightful explanation has key assumptions written out. And suddenly the business looks more shaky. First, there are now facts about Uber to confront. Is this really why Uber has succeeded winning? Are they the right company to emulate?

More importantly, there are now a lot of assumptions about the on-demand laundry business to question. Is doing laundry so painful that people would really pay a premium to save the time? Is it possible to get pickup and delivery costs under what users are willing to pay? Will people really do more laundry than they used to, when it’s more convenient?)

Beware of when you compare yourself to successful companies, and on that basis alone believe you’ll succeed. You’re likely making hidden assumptions that need to be validated.

Even before you build a prototype, it’s useful to validate these assumptions, if only to get a quick sanity check. You can do this by talking directly to your target customers.

### Talk to Customers and See for Yourself

Once again, here are the key questions to answer about your product or service:

  * Do people actually have the problem you believe they have? 
  * Do they actually want what you’re offering? 
  * Are they willing to pay for it?



In the last chapter, we discussed how to _robustly_ answer these questions – build a minimal prototype and study real customer behavior using the Build-Measure-Learn loop. We know that real customer actions are the best form of data.

But when you’re starting out, it’s often worthwhile to**do a sanity check by spending time with potential customers**. In Japanese manufacturing, they call this “genchi gembutsu” – “go and see for yourself.”

It’s really easy to see yourself as the next Steve Jobs and assume everyone’s going to love what you’re building. This is wishful thinking. You need to do a reality check. **Leave the building and talk to real people.**

In the worst case, you find out you were exactly on the right track, and you can build with renewed confidence. In the best case, you discover you were totally wrong about what your target customer wanted and switch to a new product strategy.

> **Anecdote: Toyota Sienna**
> 
> The Toyota Sienna minivan’s biggest market is North America. The chief engineer in charge of the 2004 Sienna, Yuji Yokoya, knew woefully little about American habits and problems. In response, he proposed a national road trip spanning 53,000 miles, covering all fifty US states, all thirteen provinces of Canada, and all states of Mexico. He drove a Sienna and talked to real Toyota customers.
> 
> Through this trip, Yokoya found that making kids happy was vital. Even though parents pay for the car, the kids are the most critical customers, particularly on long road trips. As a result, Yokoya revamped the car interior, raising its comfort and convenience levels.

If Yokoya can make a trans-Atlantic, 53,000 mile trip to learn more about his customers, you can pick up the phone and set up coffee meetings.

(Shortform suggestions: here’s more advice on how to get the most out of your customer interviews:

  * Focus on finding early adopters. These are the people who face the biggest pain, who are most likely to use your product first, and who will love you most when you solve their problems. If you interview a later adopter who just doesn’t have the burning problem, you may receive too much discouraging negative feedback. 
  * **Focus on clarifying their problem, not testing your solution.** There are two reasons. 1) People often articulate their problems better than they can envision the solutions. They know what’s painful, but they aren’t sure exactly how to fix it. 2) You need to be open to the possibility that you misunderstand the customer problem. Almost certainly there will be nuances to the problem you hadn’t previously appreciated. If you focus too much on testing your solution, you’ll be too tempted to fit a square peg in a round hole and ignore the underlying problem that might be better to fix. 
  * **Keep your interview procedure the same for every interview.** The key to statistics is collecting enough data points to make good inferences. If one person says your idea is terrible, treat that as just one person and collect more data points without modifying your procedure.)



If you collect sufficient data to feel like you need to change your idea, it’s worth iterating through Build-Measure-Learn a few times at this stage, even without a product. Treat your interview as what you’re building, and modify your interview procedure based on how the feedback is pointing you.

Then, after you’ve talked to potential customers and feel just somewhat convinced that the problem you want to solve exists, it’s time to build and test. You will never have enough data to know for sure that people will want what you build, but you should have some real data to give you confidence that people really want what you need.
