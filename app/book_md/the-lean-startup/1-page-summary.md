## 1-Page Summary

**The goal of a startup is to learn what their customers want and will pay for, as quickly as possible.** Because startups face so much uncertainty, you have to make continuous adjustments to your startup plan, based on the information you get back. This is Build-Measure-Learn.

Think about it like driving a car. When you get on the road, you make constant adjustments to the steering wheel, based on where you see yourself on the road. Veer a little right, and you turn to the left before you go offroad.

A startup’s the same way. You collect information about your customer, just like seeing where you are on the road. Based on this new information, you adjust your strategy, like turning the steering wheel. You keep repeating this and making progress.

But you need to approach learning with discipline, a process called “validated learning.”

Bad learning is executing a plan without much prior thought, seeing it work or fail, and giving a post-hoc rationalization. (“Well of course X didn’t work, that means we should do Y!”)

**Validated learning is having testable hypotheses about the world** , designing experiments to test those hypotheses, and analyzing the data to evaluate your hypotheses. You have real, quantitative data to show what you have learned.

How can you learn what your users want, as quickly as possible, and with as few resources as possible? The strategies of Lean Startup answer this question.

### Build-Measure Learn

**First, you set your hypothesis.** What do you believe about your customers that is vital to your business? How are you going to measure this?

Next, you **build the MINIMAL product necessary to test the hypothesis**.

Next, you **run the experiment**. Often this means exposing users to the product and collecting data on their behavior.

Finally, you **analyze the data and reflect** – how far off was your hypothesis? What do you need to change about your strategy? Should you actually change your entire direction?

Then you update the hypothesis or set a new one. Then you build the minimal product to test that hypothesis, and so on.

The faster you move through this loop, the faster you’ll learn, and the more progress you’ll make. Imagine how much you’d learn from 10 steadily improving prototypes vs 1 giant, fully-featured prototype.

#### Startup Hypotheses

What are hypotheses in a startup? Your hypotheses should revolve around the most important problem of a startup – how to build a sustainable business around your vision.

Commonly, there are two critical hypotheses:

**Value hypothesis** : does the customer have the problem you’re trying to solve? Does the product actually deliver value to the customer?

**Growth hypothesis** : how will the company grow once people start using the product?

#### Principles of Lean Experimentation

**The best way to understand human preferences is to track behavior of real people, not ask for opinions.** People often can’t verbalize what they actually want – cue the classic Henry Ford quote, “If you asked people what they wanted, they’d have said faster horses.” The better way to measure what people want is by their real behavior - what they click on, what they spend time looking at, what they choose to pay for.

**Think about the cheapest, fastest experiment you can run to validate the hypothesis.** Simplify the product to the core essentials needed to run the experiment. Resist the urge to build more than is absolutely necessary – as you’ll learn, sometimes you can fake it ‘til you make it without a real product.

**Launching early gives you customer information earlier.** The earlier you learn if customers actually want what you’re building, the more time you have to change your plan and run more experiments. You also discover customer concerns you couldn’t have predicted in a vacuum.

### The Minimum Viable Product

Your goal is to move through the Build-Measure-Learn loop as quickly as possible. Even though the loop has 3 steps, Build is often the step where you will waste the most time.

The critical question you need to answer is: what is the **MINIMUM product you can build to get reliable data on your hypothesis**?

This product is termed the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and is one of the most important concepts in Lean Startup. This is the product that is the bare minimum to test your hypothesis. Unlike normal product development, **you are NOT aiming for product perfection** – you’re merely trying to start learning as soon as possible.

Depending on your business, there are a variety of ways to test your hypothesis in the cheapest, fastest way possible. In the more extreme, you don’t need a product at all - you can simply pretend you have a product and collect user behavior.

Here are examples of MVP types:

  * **Landing Page MVP** : create a web page describing the features of the product, before a product actually exists. Track clicks and attempted downloads to gauge how much users want it.
  * **Video MVP** : make a video simulating what the product does. Even without using the actual product, watching the video will give enough info for viewers to decide whether they want the product shown.
  * **Concierge MVP** : instead of building processes that scale, run very manual processes dependent on special white-glove treatment. Often the founders themselves deliver the service. This accelerates learning and allows quick iteration on the product.
  * **Wizard of Oz MVP** : if you plan to build fancy automated technology, try to test it with a human behind the scenes. The human performs the service that the technology does, and the user is none the wiser.



### Choosing the Right Metrics

Defining the right metrics that actually matter to your business is critical.

The most insidious kind of metrics, vanity metrics, give you false optimism – it _seems_ like you’re making great progress, but in reality you’re actually stuck. Often, **vanity metrics are metrics that have no choice but to keep increasing over time**. One common example is total user count. Let’s say your app adds 1,000 users every week. At the end of 10 weeks of hard work, you have 10,000 users. This is a big number!

Except you aren’t growing any faster – you’re still adding 1,000 users every week. Your hard work actually didn’t change your _growth rate_.

Instead of looking at cumulative vanity metrics over time, **the more accurate analysis is to _separate_ users into groups based on the time they joined, then measure your metric for each group independently**. Each group of users is called a **cohort**. For instance, you can measure the signup rate for each week separately to see if that’s increasing over time.

### A/B Testing

Let’s say you develop a new feature to your product and you release it to all your users. Suddenly your metrics improve. But how do you know seasonal effects aren’t at play – that the users who joined later aren’t just naturally more engaged? Or that you got a burst of users from an unexpected news article?

**An A/B test avoids bias by splitting users into seeing two different versions of your product.** By analyzing the metric resulting from both groups, you get strong quantitative evidence about which version users like more.

For example, let’s say you have a landing page MVP listing your potential features and a signup form. You’re not sure which of two features your users will like more. So you set up an A/B test – half of visitors see feature A on your landing page; the other half sees feature B. You measure the difference in signup rate. If feature A gets a 5% signup rate, but feature B gets 2%, this is evidence that your users may prefer feature A!

Another benefit of A/B testing is that **it lowers politics**. You don’t have to squabble with your team over which features are better – you can put it to the test with an MVP. A/B testing also lets you assign credit where it’s due.

### Pivoting Your Startup

Now when you’re facing the data, you need to decide what to do. Is there still promise in your direction, and should you keep trying to iterate through the Build-Measure-Learn loop? Or have the metrics come back so disappointing so often that it’s time to change your strategy entirely – to pivot?

The answer is often unclear because you will seldom encounter complete, abject failure. The more likely state is when you’re barely limping along, not plummeting to the earth but also feeling like you’re not really making progress. The decision gets hard here.

**There are two signs of the need to pivot:**

  * Your metrics are not good enough to meet your goals for your startup.
  * Your experiments are leading to less and less progress (which is a sign that you’re out of good ideas)



To make sure your startup is on the right track, have a regular “pivot or persevere” meeting. The frequency should be between once every few weeks and once every few months, depending on your startup - the more volatile your startup and the less time you have, the more frequent this should be.

Pivots come in multiple flavors. Which type you make depends on what you learn in your experiments about customer needs.

Pivot types include:

  * **Zoom-in pivot:** Customers like a specific feature of your product. You pivot so your product now focuses entirely on delivering this feature.
  * **Customer need pivot:** You know your customers well, and the problem you’re solving for them is not very important. You pivot to target a new customer need, which may entail an entirely new product.
  * **Business architecture pivot:** You pivot to change between two types of businesses: high margin and low volume, or low margin and high volume. This roughly matches to a business to business (B2B) model, or a business to consumer (B2C) model. 
  * **Technology pivot:** You want to solve the same problem for the same users, but you pivot to use a different technology to do so. Often, this offers better price or performance.
