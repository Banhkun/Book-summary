## Chapter 10: How Your Startup Grows

A startup is a new company designed to grow. If you’re ambitious about your startup, you want more customers and more revenue sooner. When growth stagnates, it indicates a problem with your growth strategy.

Ideally, you strive for _sustainable growth_ – wherein **new customers come from the actions of past customers**. This contrasts with unsustainable one-time activities, like a publicity stunt or Super Bowl ad.

How exactly your business grows depends on your industry and product. Eric defines three major engines of growth: **Sticky** , **Viral** , and **Paid**. These aren’t mutually exclusive, and often businesses will use all three at once. But it’s likely one of these will dominate the others.

### The Sticky Engine of Growth

The Sticky engine relies on retention of customers to grow. When you acquire the user, you want the user to stick around as much as possible.

As a metaphor, think of a leaky bucket with holes. When you pour water in, water flows out the holes. If you fill the bucket with water at the same rate it’s exiting the holes, the water level stays steady – no growth. This is like a startup that loses customers as fast as it’s gaining them - the total number of active users isn’t growing.

But if you plug up the holes, the funnel will start filling up. Analogously, if users stick around each week, you’ll continue to grow the number of users.

Sticky growth is especially important in a few types of businesses:

  * In a network or marketplace of connected users. Here, the value grows exponentially with the number of users on it.
    * Social networks like Facebook: If Facebook keeps new users on and get existing users to post more, their friends will find Facebook overall more valuable. 
    * Marketplaces like Uber: More riders means more rides for drivers and more earnings. This kicks off a virtuous cycle where more earnings recruit more drivers, which improves the rider experience and recruits more riders
  * When your customer keeps paying you 
    * Merchants like Amazon: Retaining users means they continue to buy from the merchant
    * Subscription companies like Netflix or Salesforce – regular subscriptions means the longer a customer stays engaged, the larger lifetime value you get, the more value they get from your service, and the harder it is to leave



#### Metrics to Care About

  * **Churn rate is the key metric to care about**. This is defined as the fraction of customers who fail to remain engaged with the product in a certain time period. 
  * **Growth rate** : defined as new customer acquisition - churn rate.
    * For example, you may grow by 50% per month, but churn 30% of users per month. On a base of 100 customers, you gain 50 users but lose 30. You end the month with 120 customers for net 20% growth. If you keep the same growth rate, your userbase will compound over time.
  * **Engagement** : can be defined as the core engagement action you care about, like logins per week, time used per week, messages sent per month, etc.
  * **AVOID total number of signups**. This will always increase, but if you’re churning customers, your revenue will flatline. Your metrics need to account for users who leave or stop engaging.



#### How to Improve Sticky Growth

  * Improve the product for existing customers to make it more engaging
  * Send reminders about activity and special promotions
    * Facebook pings you on major activities – someone has added you as a friend, tagged you in a photo, has a birthday today
  * For users who have left, create reminders and incentives to return
    * Subscription businesses like Netflix may offer discounts to return after you’ve unsubscribed



#### How Not to Improve Sticky Growth

Do not invest in sales and marketing if you’re not retaining users. If your funnel is leaky, you’ll be losing customers as quickly as you’re gaining them. Pouring in more users will be very expensive and lead to zero net growth. Fix the leak first.

### The Viral Engine of Growth

The viral engine relies on your existing users to bring in more users directly. Picture exponential growth – one user brings on two users. Each of those users brings on two more users. Like nuclear fission, this leads to explosive growth.

Viral growth is distinct from plain word-of-mouth – in viral growth, the referral mechanism is a **necessary consequence of using the product**. A few examples:

  * 1990’s email service Hotmail added a line at the end of each email sent: “P.S. Get your free email at Hotmail.” Each new email sent was free advertising for Hotmail, and getting more users onboard led to even more emails sent out.
  * PayPal let users send money to people without Paypal accounts. The emails said something like, “John has sent you $20!” Who’s not going to sign up to claim their money?



#### Metrics to Care About

  * Viral coefficient: the number of new customers who join from invites for a single customer. For example a coefficient of 1.2 means that every new user who joins pulls in 1.2 new users on average. 
    * This can be broken down further: viral coefficient = [# of invites per user] * [% of users who sign up from invites]
    * For example, if 1 user sends out 5 invites on average, and 16% of users sign up from invites, then the viral coefficient is 5 * 0.16 = 0.8
  * **A viral coefficient above 1 is viral. 1 is the magic number.**
    * If your viral factor is below 1, the invites peter out. For example, if you have a viral factor of 0.8 and start with 100 users, these 100 users recruit another 80, who recruit 64, who then recruit 51, and so forth as it sizzles down to 0. You do get a bunch of new users, but it won’t explode virally.
    * But if every user invites **more than 1** extra person, then it leads to exponential growth. With a viral factor of 1.1 and starting with 100 users, these 100 recruit another 110, who recruit 121, then 133, and so on.



Here’s what viral growth looks like depending on what your viral factor is:

#### How to Improve Viral Growth

  * Increase # of invites sent per user. Build in more referral mechanisms and incentivize sending more invites per user.
    * Dropbox gave early users free storage space for each new user referred
    * LinkedIn scrapes your email contacts and sends invites to people who haven’t joined (an annoyingly effective feature)
    * Improving stickiness and retention also improves # of invites, since more time on your product means more opportunities to invite users
  * Increase the signup rate from invites. 
    * Lower the friction to signing up for your service. 
      * Make your onboarding super simple so users can see the value from your service quickly.
      * Social networks like Facebook and Snapchat tend not to charge users who sign up because it would slow user growth
    * Add incentives for signing up from an invite link.
      * Many services like Uber give bonuses for both the inviter and the invitee for signing up.



#### How Not to Improve Viral Growth

**Do not add more users to a non-viral process.** If your process isn’t viral, paying for more users won’t make it go viral

There’s an exception if your service requires a critical mass to jumpstart viral growth. But this rarely is required, so don’t deceive yourself.

### The Paid Engine of Growth

This is a relatively straightforward engine of growth. Through ads or sales, you pay to acquire a user. If the user gives you more money than it cost to acquire the user, then you can use the profits to pay for more users, which gives you more profits.

#### Metrics to Care About

  * **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** How much it costs to acquire that user.
  * **Lifetime Value (LTV):** How much the user gives you in value, either in direct revenue or otherwise (eg through selling ads)



Let’s run through an example. An advertisement costs $400 in total, and you get 20 new customers. Each of the customers gives you $25 when they buy your product. This means your CAC is $20, and your LTV is $25. Now you have $500 to acquire 25 new customers, which will in turn give you revenue of $625, and so you keep growing.

#### How to Improve Paid Growth

The higher your profit margin, the more you can spend on more marketing.

  * Increase LTV of users
    * Build a better product that creates more value, so users are willing to pay more
    * For a subscription product, get users to stay for longer
    * For ad-based products, increase engagement
    * Get users to buy add-ons and more products
  * Lower cost of acquisition
    * Increase the conversion rate of users. For a fixed advertising spend, if you convert more users, you lower CAC. This can be done through:
      * Conversion optimization
      * Differentiated value among competitors. If you have a competitive advantage, 
    * Find new, less competitive marketing routes 



**How Not to Improve Paid Growth:**

**Don’t keep plowing money into unprofitable marketing campaigns.** If you put in $100 and get back only $80, you’ll clearly lose money fast. Try to increase the revenue or lower CAC. But also don’t be afraid to abandon the channel – some just don’t work for your product.

#### Shortform Exclusive: Avoid Paid Marketing Problems

Even though paid growth is simple in theory, you should worry about practical problems faced by many startups.

**Don’t lie to yourself about what your CAC is**. Your CAC is not just the literal cost of acquiring the user. If you pay $2 to get a user to signup, but that user also requires a 10-minute call by someone paid $30/hr to signup, the CAC is actually $7.

**Be clear about your real LTV**. If your LTV takes a long time to capture, don’t overestimate it. Don’t assume that users will love your product so much that they stick around for 24 months. Deluding yourself now will result in pain later. Negative “unit economics” have caused many startups to fail. Because modeling user value and acquisition cost can be very complex, don’t deceive yourself into thinking you’re profitable per user when you’re not.

**Keep watching the metrics.** Your LTV and CAC are very likely to change over time, especially as you exhaust a marketing channel or explore new ones. As channels become unprofitable, you may have to scale them back.

**Understand market competition conditions.** Your competitors have likely already saturated your marketing channels and are paying at market equilibrium. If you come in and offer exactly the same product, you’ll be paying the same CAC and getting the same LTVs. Over time this tends to drive toward zero profits, as competition is strong. To overcome this, you need a **competitive advantage** – a better product, lower costs, higher efficiency, etc. This allows you to pay more for a user through the same marketing channel because you get more out of the user. Out of scope, but competitive advantage covers this well.

### Choosing the Right Growth Engine

In Eric Ries’s experience, most startups have one engine that works especially well for them. This is particular to their product, market, and customers.

**Focus on the one engine that really makes a difference for you.** If it stops growing through your iteration cycles, you may need to pivot to another. But try not to maximize multiple engines at once or you’ll lose focus.

**None of these engines of growth will run forever.** Each category of users is finite and will be depleted, and you’ll have to expand to new categories of users. If you start with your early adopters, as you go mainstream, your new users’ preferences will change and you’ll need to adjust your product and metrics expectations.

(Shortform example: Facebook started with college students, but when it moved to high school kids and parents, it needed to change its product to encourage virality. It’s a testament to their product and growth teams that they were able to take over the world – it’s nowhere near as easy or pre-ordained as it seems.)

**To avoid getting stuck, incubate startups within the company to provide new sources of growth.** Don’t start this too late, or your company may be flung into a crisis.
