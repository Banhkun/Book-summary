## Chapter 8: Pivot or Persevere

Now when you’re facing the data, you need to decide what to do. Is there still promise in your direction, and should you keep trying to iterate through the Build-Measure-Learn loop? Or have the metrics come back so disappointing so often that it’s time to change your strategy entirely – to pivot? 

The answer is often unclear because you will seldom encounter complete, abject failure. The more likely state is when you’re barely limping along, not plummeting to the earth but also feeling like you’re not really making progress. The decision gets hard here. 

**There are two signs of the need to pivot:**

  * Your metrics are not good enough to meet your goals for your startup. 
  * Your experiments are leading to less and less progress (which is a sign that you’re out of good ideas) 



###  Startup Example: Votizen 

Lean Startup gives the example of Votizen, a company founded to boost participation in politics. Their first product was a social network where voters could unite around causes and mobilize action. They formed hypotheses around 4 metrics: signing up (registration), verifying voters (activation), sticking around and using Votizen (retention), and recruiting friends to join (referral). 

Votizen built an MVP in 3 months and got their baseline metrics. Then they spent 2 more months and $5,000 to get a second set of metrics. Then they spent another 8 months and $20,000 to get a third set of metrics. Let’s take a look: 

|  MVP  (3 months, $1,200)  |  Optimization 1  (2 months, $5,000)  |  Optimization 2  (8 months, $20,000)   
---|---|---|---  
Registration  |  5%  |  17%  |  17%   
Activation  |  17%  |  90%  |  90%   
Retention  |  Too low to measure  |  5%  |  8%   
Referral  |  Too low to measure  |  4%  |  6%   
  
Starting with just the MVP, Votizen was at a good starting point, and without a chance to improve the metrics, it was too early to pivot. The first round of optimization led to major improvements in every single metric. But the second period of optimization, costing much more time and money, led to barely a bump in metrics. 

**This is a sign to pivot – they had taken the current idea as far as they could go.**

From user interviews, Votizen got another idea – pivot to a way to let voters contact their elected representatives easily. Users could write an email or tweet, and Votizen would print a paper letter and send it to their Congressional representative or Senator. Even better, they could charge for this service and start funding the company through revenue. 

They called this @2gov, and spent another 4 months and $30,000 to build the prototype. Here were the metrics: 

|  MVP  (3 months, $1,200)  |  Optimization 1  (2 months, $5,000)  |  Optimization 2  (8 months, $20,000)  |  @2Gov Pivot MVP  (4 months, $30,000)   
---|---|---|---|---  
Registration  |  5%  |  17%  |  17%  |  42%   
Activation  |  17%  |  90%  |  90%  |  83%   
Retention  |  Too low to measure  |  5%  |  8%  |  21%   
Referral  |  Too low to measure  |  4%  |  6%  |  54%   
Payment  |  N/A  |  N/A  |  N/A  |  1%   
  
Fantastic! Even though their new product was just an MVP, they still showed huge improvements over the most optimized version of their last product. They still had a lot of room to go to become a sustainable business, but they knew they were now on a better track. 

###  Pivot or Persevere Meeting 

To make sure your startup is on the right track, have a regular “pivot or persevere” meeting. The frequency should be between once every few weeks and once every few months, depending on your startup - the more volatile your startup and the less time you have, the more frequent this should be. 

Pivot or Persevere meetings should involve product development and business leadership teams. The product team must report on its product optimization efforts over time, and the business team must report on their conversations with customers. 

###  Why You’ll Pivot Too Late 

Because your startup has limited money and time, pivots are necessary to find a new direction when you’re failing. **Your startup’s runway is the number of pivots it can make** – so it’s in your interest to get to the pivot point faster. 

Yet many entrepreneurs who successfully pivoted wish they had done so earlier. Why is it so hard to pivot? It’s mainly about mindset and psychology: 

  * Vanity metrics delude entrepreneurs on how much progress they’re making, giving false confidence to keep going. 
  * Startups lack clear hypotheses about what metrics they need to hit. This causes a “launch and see” approach that leads to complacency around whatever results you get. Eventually you realize that the business metrics aren’t enough to meet your goals, but in the meantime the metrics seem promising enough. 
  * Entrepreneurs are afraid to reject an idea before it had a real chance to prove itself. It’s tempting to believe that the next iteration will be the major breakthrough that will turn the tides. 



And yet the alternative to not pivoting is much worse – you run out of money and your company goes bankrupt. 

Instead, **you need to define what failure is in the context of your startup.** Then, when you hit this definition, you need to pivot. 

###  Types of Pivots 

Pivots come in multiple flavors. Which type you make depends on what you learn in your experiments about customer needs. (Shortform note: The book doesn’t give examples for these, so we’ve provided modern startup examples here.) 

####  Zoom-in Pivot 

Customers like a specific feature of your product. You pivot so your product now focuses entirely on delivering this feature. 

**Shortform Example** : Justin.tv was a general live-streaming site, where anyone could stream whatever they were doing to an audience. They found that the most passionate users on their product were gamers streaming themselves playing videogames. Justin.tv pivoted to Twitch, a live-streaming site focused entirely on gaming. 

####  Zoom-out Pivot 

Your customers aren’t satisfied with the bare features in your product. You pivot to expand the scope of your product and add many more features. 

####  Customer Segment Pivot 

You have the right product, but you’re solving it for the wrong people. You pivot to target this new type of customer. This can happen when you deplete your early adopter userbase and expand to mainstream users, who have different preferences. 

**Shortform Example:** Foursquare is an app that lets users check into locations like restaurants and leave reviews. It was popular in the early 2010’s but fell out of favor with consumers. It  pivoted to cater to enterprise customers and developers  , who can use the trove of check-in data to run business analytics or power their own apps. 

####  Customer Need Pivot 

You know your customers well, and the problem you’re solving for them is not very important. You pivot to target a new customer need, which may entail an entirely new product. 

**Example:** Potbelly Sandwich Shop started as an antique furniture store that sold sandwiches to generate traffic. It realized that more people wanted their sandwiches than their furniture. 

**Shortform Example:** Odeo was a podcasting platform company. As Odeo was failing, the staff held a last-ditch hackathon, where Twitter caught fire and spun out into its own company. 

####  Platform Pivot 

This can work in two directions. You have an application, but you realize you’d rather become a platform on which others can build their own products and applications. Or, you have a platform, but you realize you’d rather create a dedicated application that solves the end-user’s needs directly. 

**Shortform Example:** Knewton was an education technology company building test prep programs that customized to the student. It pivoted to launch a general customization platform for schools developing their own online courses. 

####  Business Architecture Pivot 

You pivot to change between two types of businesses: high margin and low volume, or low margin and high volume. This roughly matches to a business to business (B2B) model, or a business to consumer (B2C) model. 

**Shortform Example:** In the 1970s IBM was the leader in enterprise mainframe computers, but the personal computer began disrupting the industry. After failing to dominate the PC market, IBM pivoted from hardware to provide software and consulting services, including the Watson AI platform. 

####  Value Capture Pivot 

You pivot to make money a different way. For example, you realize that instead of selling your product, you can offer it for free and make money on ads or partnerships. 

**Shortform Example:** Duolingo, a language learning app, was previously entirely free and made money through offering crowdsourced translation services. It  introduced a subscription service  that removes ads and allows offline use. 

####  Engine of Growth Pivot 

You pivot to change how you grow – through virality, engagement, or paying to get users. Commonly, changing the engine of growth also requires a change in the way you capture value - for instance, going from a viral strategy to a paid marketing strategy may necessitate that you go from a free model to a paid model, to fund the marketing. 

####  Channel Pivot 

A channel is how customers get your product. For example, Johnson & Johnson uses pharmacies to reach customers, and app developers use Apple and Google’s app stores to reach users. 

You pivot to deliver your product to users through a different channel. For example, at first you might think of building a product and listing it on Amazon to reach customers. You pivot to sell to customers directly through your own website, once you have the traction. 

**Shortform Example:** Television shows were previously broadcast only on TV networks, which had specific properties limiting the content: advertisers were the main revenue source, so the shows couldn’t be too edgy; the network had limited time slots, so shows had to cater to the widest audience possible, diluting quality. With streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon, show producers now have new channels to bring their content. Furthermore, because Netflix is supported by subscriptions and not advertisers, shows are not beholden to the same restrictions as in TV. 

####  Technology Pivot 

You want to solve the same problem for the same users, but you pivot to use a different technology to do so. Often, this offers better price or performance. 

**Shortform Example:** Netflix started out by shipping DVDs in the mail. When bandwidth increased, they pivoted to offering streaming of content over the Internet. 

Example: Wealthfront started as a virtual trading league for amateur investors. The idea was to identify the best traders through their virtual portfolios, and get customers to invest in those traders. After failures on both fronts, Wealthfront pivoted to build a platform for professional managers instead of amateurs. (This wasn’t their last pivot, either – in a move taking place after  The Lean Startup  was published, Wealthfront is now a wealth manager itself, taking money directly from customers and investing it automatically through “robo-traders.”)

Pivots are a natural part of business. You will almost certainly face less promising metrics than you had envisioned, and if you aren’t able to improve these, you will have to choose to pivot or die. Even when you reach success, you need to stay vigilant for changing market conditions that necessitate a pivot. 

Pivots are not willy-nilly changes in direction. They are grounded in strategic hypotheses about how to build a better business, requiring target metrics and new minimum viable products.
