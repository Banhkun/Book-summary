## Chapter 3: Learn What Your Users Want

Remember that a startup is trying to build a new product or service in conditions of extreme uncertainty. There are a lot of things you know that you don’t know, and a lot of things you don’t know that you don’t know.

Therefore, **a startup’s most important function is learning** – in particular, learning what the customers really want and what will lead to a sustainable business.

But you need to approach learning with discipline, a process called “validated learning.”

Bad learning is executing a plan without much prior thought, seeing it work or fail, and giving a post-hoc rationalization. (“Well of course X didn’t work, that means we should do Y!”)

**Validated learning is having testable hypotheses about the world** , designing experiments to test those hypotheses, and analyzing the data to evaluate your hypotheses. You have real, quantitative data to show what you have learned.

### Startup Example: IMVU

In 2004, author Eric Ries and his co-founders at IMVU wanted to build a social network around instant messaging (IM), which seemed attractive for its network effects – the more people who join, the more valuable the network is, which makes even more people join.

Because of network effects, the top IM products owned the vast majority of the industry. It was commonly accepted, almost obvious, that it’d be extremely difficult to make a new IM network succeed. If you’re already on a network with all your friends, you don’t want to switch to a new network without all your friends joining too. (Shortform note: think about how hard it’d be to build a rival to Facebook today – how would you get Facebook users to join your network when all their friends are on Facebook? Would they really want to join yet another social network?)

To avoid competing with incumbents head-on, IMVU decided not to start their own new IM network. Instead, they built a new 3D video game layer on **top** of IM networks. Users would first join IMVU, a 3D virtual world where they could create avatars and buy virtual goods. Then they would connect their IM accounts and message people on their existing IM networks to join IMVU too. Critically, this meant users wouldn’t have to switch to a whole new IM network – it already works with the IM networks they belong to. Ingenious!

The IMVU team labored for 6 months on their prototype product. They worried constantly about the details of their implementation – “how many IM networks should we support?” (over a dozen) “How buggy can the prototype be? Will it make us look bad?”

Finally, with their pride on the line, they launched the product.

**And no one joined.**

They thought it was a quality problem at first, so they worked on fixing bugs and adding features. This didn’t budge the needle.

Finally, **they decided to bring in potential users for interviews**. This is where their epiphany happened. IMVU had built the whole game around getting new users to bring in their friends from other IM networks. But users didn’t actually _want_ to invite their friends over before they had a chance to really test it out – if the game was uncool, they’d look bad.

Even more importantly, **IMVU found that users actually _didn’t mind_ joining a new IM network**. Just like people today have different lives on different social networks (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, etc.), IMVU found that their target customer wanted a separate IM network dedicated to this new virtual world. They wanted to make new friends, not bring their existing friends over.

When Eric and his team realized this, they realized their product direction was totally misguided and counter to what their users wanted. This forced them to throw away almost a year of hard work, which was painful. But it needed to happen. When IMVU started building a product that their customers actually wanted, they started getting traction.

### How to Learn Earlier and Faster

This story represents the critical lesson of Lean Startup – if you don’t understand what your customer actually wants, you’ll waste a lot of time building something no one will buy. This will be painful, and the more time you spend on this, the harder it’ll be to throw it all away.

Put more proactively – **how could IMVU have learned what customers wanted earlier** , without 6 months of hard engineering? Did they really need to support a dozen IM clients at launch? Probably not – even connecting just **one** IM network could have led to the same conclusion, and it would have taken a lot less work.

But what if they had tried something even more extreme – what if they _pretended_ to have a working product on their website with a download button, and they measured what features users actually wanted by download clicks?

This question haunted him for a while. What if there were a way to avoid wasting months, years of work while also making significantly more progress in the business?

Eric’s experience running IMVU was the inspiration for Lean Startup. The rest of the book teaches a method for you to avoid what IMVU did.
