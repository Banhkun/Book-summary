## Chapter 12: Startups in Big Organizations

The final substantive chapter of Lean Startup discusses innovation in a large company and internal startups.

If growth is your goal and you achieve it, you’ll keep growing your startup to 10, 100, 1,000 people. How do you keep innovating to grow new lines of business while keeping existing products competitive? How do you prevent yourself from being bogged down by process?

The solution is to **manage lines of innovation in parallel**.

Each product has a life cycle:

  * new product
  * growth and scaling
  * optimization, operational excellence, and fighting newcomers
  * legacy support and cutting costs



Once a company grows past its early stages, it needs to think about what comes next. This means managing multiple products at different stages of the cycle at once. Earlier projects will be sunsetting and losing revenue just as the next major innovation breaks new ground.

#### Match People with the Product Stage

Who is the best person to run a product through its lifecycle? A typical answer is to tie the original product team through the entire life cycle of the product. After all, they built it, so they seem like natural candidates to scale it up and to sunset the product.

This may be sub-optimal. **People tend to be specialists at one of the phases in the life cycle.** Some people are natural early-stage innovators and don’t have the energy or conscientiousness for optimization. Others like the rigor of operational excellence, but can’t stomach the variability in the earliest stages.

Instead of keeping the original team with the product, **keep people in the stage they’re good at. Then transfer products between teams** \- once a product matures past the growth phase team, move it to the operational maintenance team.**** This means some people’s roles may focus on spinning up new early-stage startups, and others inherit those startups and grow it to scale.

### The Three Attributes of Successful Startup Teams

The author suggests that successful innovation requires three structural attributes:

  * **Limited but secure resources.** By their nature, startups are high risk and thus deserve less resources than surefire investments. This is a good thing, since it forces startups to focus on the right questions or perish. But because a sudden change in resources can be catastrophic, internal startups need their funding secured and immune from tampering by other managers.
  * **Independent decision-making authority.** To move faster, startups need to be able to run and execute experiments without passing each one by a review board. Building cross-functional startup teams allows representatives from each stakeholder department to partake in the innovation and sign off quickly on decisions. Of course, this independence needs to be balanced with safeguards – internal startups shouldn’t do anything that can damage the entire brand or hurt customers, for example.
  * **Incentive in success.** Entrepreneurs, internal or independent, are motivated by tying their personal success to their startup’s success. Typically this means equity or ownership, and in an internal startup this might be bonuses or profit sharing. But the stake doesn’t have to be financial – it can be public recognition and career advantages. It’s important that the rewards be given fairly, or other internal entrepreneurs will lose trust in the system.



### An Innovation Sandbox

It’s natural for internal startups to threaten the existing parent organization. They may offer new products that cannibalize customers of the incumbent product or offer different pricing structures. The startup might even endanger the entire current business.

These fears are all reasonable, but they lead internal stakeholders to delay decisions and obfuscate data.

The common solution is to hide internal startups in a secret skunkworks team, which will work in the short-term but is counterproductive in the long run. When the innovation is finally shared with the main company managers, they’ll feel deceived and resist future innovation. This leads to politics and paranoia, where people will question new projects and seek out threats to their standing.

So how do you achieve the right balance of freedom and risk control? **Create an innovation sandbox** where the startup team’s impact will be insulated from the main company, but where they can have more autonomy. The sandbox has these components:

  * Any team can create an A/B test of limited scope
  * One team must see the experiment through from beginning to end
  * The experiment is limited in calendar time
  * The experiment is limited in number or % of customers affected
  * Every experiment is evaluated on the same standard 5-10 actionable metrics
  * The team must monitor metrics and customer reactions live. If something catastrophic happens, abort the experiment.



This structure limits the damage to the larger company, while giving startup teams autonomy to iterate quickly. If the experiment shows improved metrics in this limited scope, the innovation can expand its reach and ultimately be reintegrated into the main company.
