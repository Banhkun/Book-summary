## Part 1: Vision | Chapter 1: Startups Need Managing

‘Management’ is often a dirty word in startups because it conjures images of grey suits, bureaucracy, and TPS reports. Startups are worried management will squash energy and creativity.

**The problem is, startups go too far in the other direction into chaos.** They often take a shoot-from-the-hip, hail-Mary, undisciplined approach to company development. This unfortunately often leads to failure, spending years of your life building something no one cares about or remembers.

Startups really _do_ need management, but a new kind of management catering to high-risk innovation - a kind of Entrepreneurial Management. By using this management method, you will be confident you’re moving in the right direction and learning more about your company. Surprise – that method is the Lean Startup.

### Startups Need to Learn as Quickly as Possible

**The goal of a startup is to learn what their customers want and will pay for, as quickly as possible.** Thus the real metric you should care about is the amount you learn – not the number of hours you work, the lines of code you’ve written, or the number of times you’ve banged your head against the wall.

Because startups face so much uncertainty, you have to make continuous adjustments to your startup plan, based on the information you get back. This is Build-Measure-Learn.

Think about it like driving a car. When you get on the road, you make constant adjustments to the steering wheel, based on where you see yourself on the road. Veer a little right, and you turn to the left before you go offroad.

A startup’s the same way. You collect information about your customer, just like seeing where you are on the road. Based on this new information, you adjust your strategy, like turning the steering wheel. You keep repeating this and making progress.

Unfortunately, some startups avoid this learning cycle. Instead, they essentially point themselves in one direction, put on a blindfold, and then slam their foot on the pedal. To no one’s surprise, they end up in a ditch by the side of the road.

(Shortform example: The failed online grocery company Webvan in the 2000 dot-com bubble is a classic example of this – before fully validating their customer, they spent over a billion dollars building out their infrastructure and delivery fleet. To their chagrin, there weren’t enough customers to justify the investment, and the company folded.)
