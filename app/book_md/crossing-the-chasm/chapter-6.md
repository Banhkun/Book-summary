## Chapter 6: Strategy Step 3—Position Your Product

Once you’ve selected your target niche market, you can begin to develop your marketing strategy. Product positioning drives your marketing strategy because, according to Moore, **positioning is the most significant factor in a customer’s decision to buy your product.**

Recall from Chapter 1 that “positioning” refers to where potential customers place your product on the market landscape, or how they view it in relation to the competition. Also recall that innovators and early adopters tend to position your product based on its technical qualities, while the early majority position it based on its reputation and market share.

Thus, as you enter the mainstream market, your product’s positioning will depend substantially on its reputation with key influencers and on the perceived competition. In this chapter, we’ll discuss Moore’s advice on how to identify your competition, develop a clear positioning statement, provide evidence to back up your claims, and communicate your message to your target customers or the key influencers who can reach them.

> **The Dynamic Positioning Cycle**
> 
> Regis McKenna echoes Moore’s assertion that positioning is the most important factor in marketing, and goes on to define a “Dynamic Positioning Cycle.” 
> 
> In the first stage of this cycle, you decide how to present and market your product. Then, in the second stage, the market reacts to your product and marketing campaign, and people form their opinions about your product.
> 
> In the third stage, your product’s position in the market reflects on your company, establishing your company’s position. Finally, your company’s positioning affects how people view your products, completing the cycle.
> 
> McKenna points out that because of the cyclical nature of dynamic positioning, problems at any stage of the cycle affect every other stage. This highlights the importance of getting the positioning cycle going in the right direction from the outset, which is the focus of Moore’s advice in this chapter.

### Step 1: Identify Your Competitors

According to Moore, early majority customers position your product mostly based on how it compares to competing alternatives. Thus, he remarks that if your product is so revolutionary that you cannot identify any clear competitors, you’re probably not ready to cross the chasm.

(Shortform note: The general premise of _Blue Ocean Strategy _is that finding new, un-competed markets through innovation is the key to success in business. However, if Moore is right that mainstream customers won’t register your product in a position on the market landscape until they can compare it to a competing product, then, strictly speaking, blue ocean strategy only works in the early market.)

Moore classifies competing products into two categories, both of which play important roles in your product positioning:

  1. A **market alternative** is what your target customers are currently using, the product you intend to displace.
  2. A **product alternative** is a product that is based on similar technology but used in a different application.



Moore explains that market alternatives provide something for your customers to compare your product to. If you can show them that your product is better than the alternatives, you can establish yourself as the market leader. In the case of innovative products, you can often argue that your product is better than the market alternatives because it’s based on a new technological breakthrough.

However, Moore notes that while breakthrough technology can provide a convincing argument, it can also backfire because the early majority don’t like to take chances with unproven technology. This is where the product alternative comes into play: **If the same new technology is also being used in other applications, that implies that other people trust it.**

> **Worthy Rivals**
> 
> In _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek argues that you should view competing companies not as enemies, but as “worthy rivals,” because competition drives you to be better at what you do, and helps you define your own company identity more clearly by comparison.
> 
> This reinforces Moore’s assertion that your customers will assess your positioning based on the competition: By highlighting differences, competition makes the unique elements of your product and company stand out, both to you and to your customers.
> 
> By extension, if you have no visible competition, customers may assume your product is poorly designed and overpriced, just because you have no competitors to keep you accountable.

### Step 2: State Your Positioning Claim

Moore points out that to design an effective marketing campaign, you need to know what you want to communicate. Moreover, he advises that your message should be concise enough to pass the “elevator test,” that is, to explain to a stranger during an elevator ride.

As Moore notes, a successful elevator pitch implies your message can be conveyed effectively by word of mouth. Furthermore, it’s simple enough to give customers and partner companies a clear picture of your product, so customers know what to expect and partners can see how your product would complement theirs.

> **Has the Elevator Pitch Become Irrelevant?**
> 
> In contrast to Moore, in his book _To Sell is Human_ , Daniel Pink argues that the “elevator sales pitch” is no longer relevant. If Pink is right, then Moore’s elevator test becomes more of a hypothetical test instead of a practical one.
> 
> Pink argues that the elevator pitch was designed to present condensed information to influential people who were difficult to gain a formal audience with long enough for a full sales presentation. However, according to Pink, executives are more accessible today but are also overloaded with information. Thus, modern executives find impromptu, information-dense presentations both unnecessary and overwhelming.
> 
> This does not undermine Moore’s point that your message needs to be simple and clear enough to be communicated by word of mouth, but if the format of effective word-of-mouth messages is changing, that could have implications for how you present your message.

#### Create a Product Positioning Statement

Moore advises you to make a simple and definitive positioning claim for your product. He clarifies that your claim is not a slogan for your ad campaign, but rather a reference message that you design all of your marketing communications to agree with. He suggests you develop your claim by answering the following questions, expressing your answers in two or three sentences.

  1. What is your product name?
  2. Who are your target customers?
  3. What is your target customer’s compelling reason to buy your product?
  4. What is the market alternative you are seeking to displace?
  5. What is the product alternative?
  6. How are you as a company credible and reliable?



> **Template for Positioning Statements**
> 
> In _Pitch Anything_ , Oren Klaff recommends introducing your product with a standardized statement to the effect of “For [you target customers] who are unsatisfied with [the market alternative], [your product name] provides [the customer’s compelling reason to buy]. Unlike [the product alternative], [your product name] provides [these key features].”
> 
> A statement like this concisely captures your answers to Moore’s position questions, and Moore’s theory tracks closely to this template, providing a straightforward and clear way to communicate the most important aspects of your product.
> 
> In _The One-Page Marketing Plan_ , Allan Dib provides a similar template for creating what he calls a “Unique Selling Proposition,” or USP. Dib emphasizes that a concise problem-solution statement that compares your product to the alternative is important for effective positioning.

### Step 3: Substantiate Your Claim

As Moore points out, once you have stated your claim, you need to identify evidence that makes it indisputable. As we discussed in Chapter 1, each psychographic category of customer looks for a different type of evidence to position your product.

In this case, your target customer is in the early majority. Recall that the early majority places a lot of weight on reputation and market share. Moore advises that since you don’t have the largest market share yet, the evidence that you soon will is your commitment to delivering the whole product through alliances with other companies. This becomes especially convincing if your allies are among the leading vendors that your target customer already respects.

> **Financial Success Is Strong Positioning Evidence**
> 
> Regis McKenna asserts that the strongest evidence for a positioning claim of market leadership is financial success, corroborating Moore’s assertion about market share. Like Moore, he also advises partnering with leading vendors to substantiate your positioning claim.
> 
> However, building on the theme of financial success, McKenna also points out that some customers will consider the reputation of your financial backers when assessing your positioning. Thus, relationships with prominent venture capitalists can be another piece of evidence to support your positioning claim.

### Step 4: Communicate Your Claim and Evidence

Now that you’ve formulated a clear message and identified evidence to support it, you need to communicate that message to your target customers.

In discussing how to communicate your message, **Moore warns against using manipulative tactics**. This could involve bombarding potential customers with every possible reason they should buy your product through an overbearing ad campaign, or selectively comparing your product to alternatives that make it look good, while omitting other alternatives. However, as Moore points out, people tend to recognize these tactics for what they are.

(Shortform note: In _Start with Why,_ Simon Sinek similarly condemns manipulative advertising, saying that it may generate sales in the short term, but it prompts the customer to make poor decisions, which results in poor customer relations for the company. He points out that in some cases, these poor decisions can also have serious consequences for the industry or even the economy in general. As an example, Sinek argues that the “Great Recession” of 2008 was ultimately caused by manipulative advertising on the part of banks, which led people to take out excessive loans and make poor financial investments.)

Instead, **Moore advises building mutually beneficial relationships with key influencers in your target market** , so that their positive impressions will build a “word-of-mouth campaign” within your industry. He acknowledges that it takes time to identify these people and establish an ongoing dialogue with them. However, he argues that once these relationships are in place, they help to secure your position, because the early majority prefer to do business with people they know.

(Shortform note: In _Perennial Seller_ , Ryan Holiday says the key to effectively influencing the influencers in your industry is to see things from their perspective: Influencers are typically people who have earned a reputation by being the first to recommend products that are genuinely valuable. They want to maintain that reputation. Thus, if you can present them with sample products that exceed their expectations, or show them how your product provides a better solution to _their followers’_ compelling problem, you can turn them into advocates for your product.)

#### Communication Channels

According to Moore, you have two primary channels available to you for communicating your message, or for reaching the key influencers in your industry to get word-of-mouth started.

**The first channel is the business press.** Moore points out that the established business press has a strong reputation with the early majority, and they are careful to safeguard it. As such, it’s harder to get their attention as a startup, but doing so boosts your reputation significantly.

Moore’s strategy for garnering the attention of the business press relies on leveraging your whole-product partnerships. He says that when companies come together to supply an emerging market or address a market issue, the business press is often interested in covering these stories. As such, he recommends holding a press conference or sponsoring a trade conference with representatives from your partner companies, as well as customers and independent analysts all present, to initiate relationships with business press editors over your whole-product story.

**The second channel is what Moore calls “vertical media,”** which includes publications for the specific industry niche you are targeting, as well as conferences and trade shows where vendors can participate almost like consultants, presenting solutions to customers’ needs. Establishing a presence within the “vertical media” of your target niche allows you to connect with influencers in your industry.

> **Additional Communication Channels**
> 
> Like Moore, McKenna discusses the business press and direct interaction with potential customers at trade shows. Additionally, he points out that the venture capitalists backing your company are often influential people, whose word can be indispensable for getting your word-of-mouth campaign started.
> 
> He also advises getting the people in your distribution network on board with your positioning claims, as they can influence customers directly.
> 
> Finally, he points out that everyone who interacts with your company in any way will develop an impression of your company, which will ultimately influence your positioning. This could include people who provide services to you, interview for jobs, or visit the company for some other reason. He says that all these people can become advocates for your company’s positioning if you treat them right.
> 
> Since Moore and McKenna published their advice, online social media has opened up new communication channels as well. For example, your company can start a YouTube channel to tell your own story in your own words. If you make content that’s in the same vein as what your target customers are already watching, YouTube’s video suggestion algorithms will help them find it. Similarly, you can tell your story on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, or any number of other sites.
> 
> And on almost any platform, if people like the content you post, they can share it with their friends just by pressing a button. That said, in _Contagious_ , Jonah Berger cautions that even today, only about 7% of word-of-mouth communication takes place online, with the remaining 93% resulting from in-person contact. Thus, even with social media communication channels, it’s important to make sure your message is clear and simple enough to be passed on by traditional word of mouth.
