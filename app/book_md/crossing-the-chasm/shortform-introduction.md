## Shortform Introduction

Periodically, a new high-tech innovation will transform the way we live or do business and propel its inventors to wealth and fame. More often, though, new high-tech products seem to stagnate and die instead.

In _Crossing the Chasm,_ Geoffrey Moore provides an explanation for this and presents a strategy for introducing your product effectively into the mainstream market. First, he discusses the different categories of buyers who become interested in a product at different stages of its technological maturity. Then he shows how their different perspectives create a gap, or “chasm” between the early market and the mainstream market.

Moore outlines a strategy that companies can use to move their products across this “chasm” to enter the mainstream market. He notes that his strategy is intended only for business-to-business products, as opposed to consumer products, although some of the principles he presents are applicable to consumer products as well.

Moore aimed his theories at business executives, to help them act decisively when they reach the chasm. Since the book’s publication, it has become a standard text for managers, engineers, and students, as well.

### The Book’s Publication

_Crossing the Chasm_ was first published by HarperCollins Publishers, using the Harper imprint, in 1991. A Revised edition was published in 1999, and a third edition was published in 2014. Each new edition updated the examples and case studies in the book to more recent ones, and the third edition added two appendices. This guide covers the third edition.

_Crossing the Chasm_ was the first of seven books that Moore has written, and remains his most popular book. All his books deal in some way with the relationship between innovation and market dynamics.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

In the latter part of the 20th century and the first part of the 21st, countless startup companies have formed around innovative high-tech products. Some of these products profoundly transform the way we live, or at least the way a certain industry conducts its business, but most of them seem to stagnate and die instead of taking off. The timely relevance of Moore’s explanation for this may have contributed to the book’s success.

#### Intellectual Context

_Crossing the Chasm_ is grounded in the concept of “diffusion of innovation,” which explains how innovations are adopted by society. This concept was originated in 1956 by George Beal and Joe Bohlen of Iowa State College, who studied farmers’ adoption of agricultural technologies.

Six years later, a communications professor at Ohio State University named Everett Rogers expanded upon Beal and Bohlen’s research in a book titled _Diffusion of Innovations_ , which was influential in popularizing the concept and making it relevant to industries beyond the farming community. Diffusion of innovations also came to be known as the “Technology Adoption Life Cycle” as the pace of technological advancement accelerated and the concept was increasingly applied to high-tech products.

In _Crossing the Chasm,_ Moore first discusses the “Technology Adoption Life Cycle,” then points out a flaw in the model, which gives rise to the “chasm” that the remainder of the book deals with. Some sources assert that the “chasm” concept was originated by Lee James of the Regis McKenna consultant company, and there are a number of common elements between Moore’s business strategy and the strategies published by Regis McKenna in 1985.

#### The Book’s Impact

The success of _Crossing the Chasm_ was unexpected. Moore notes in his foreword to the third edition that he originally estimated his target audience to consist of about 5,000 readers, specifically marketing executives in high-tech startup companies. However, the book has now sold over a million copies.

In addition to its business executive audience, it has become a reference for managers, engineers, and students. The second and third editions of the book kept its case studies up to date, and demonstrate that the ideas it presents remain influential.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

As noted above, _Crossing the Chasm_ was well received by readers. Reviewers praised the book for presenting a clear theoretical model to explain the period of transition from early to mainstream markets. Many of its more recent reviewers emphasize the book’s value as a teaching tool for industry terminology over its original purpose as a strategy guide for making the transition to the mainstream market.

However, the book was not without its critics. Some reviewers said the book was too verbose and didn’t have enough in-text citations. Others expressed concern that Moore’s strategy was oversimplified, and that Moore didn’t attribute the chasm concept to Lee James or his colleagues at Regis McKenna. More than a few reviewers complained that the book introduced too much technical jargon. Finally, some reviewers felt that the book inappropriately elevated the role of the marketing department in the hierarchy of a business.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

The message of _Crossing the Chasm_ is two-fold: First, it helps you understand the market dynamics that create the chasm. Then it tells you how to pilot a company across the chasm.

In explaining the theory, Moore starts by presenting the Technology Adoption Life Cycle (TALC). Then he discusses the flaw in this model, namely that it portrays the market as a continuous population of people who can be grouped according to their buying practices, when there are actually gaps between the different groups. Moore then explains how he has modified the model to make it accurate. He spends the first two chapters comparing and contrasting the original TALC with his modified version.

While this presentation is adequate, jumping back and forth between the two models can make Moore’s critique of the original model hard to follow. As evidence of this difficulty, when Seth Godin quotes Moore’s model in Purple Cow, he actually presents the original TALC, mistakenly attributing it to Moore and omitting the modification that Moore introduced to correct the model.

In explaining how to cross the chasm, Moore uses the D-Day invasion strategy of World War II as an illustration of his strategy for entering the mainstream market with an innovative product. He breaks the strategy down into four major steps, which he then elaborates upon, continually revisiting the D-Day analogy.

The D-Day analogy works well for illustrating Moore’s strategy at a high level, but like every analogy, it eventually breaks down when scrutinized in sufficient detail. Thus, as Moore elaborates on the details of his strategy, the continued references to D-Day arguably become more distracting than illustrative.

#### Our Approach in This Guide

Part 1 of this guide spans the first two chapters and introduces concepts that set the stage for understanding the “chasm” between the early and mainstream markets and the market dynamics that create the chasm.

Part 2 spans chapters 3-7 and presents Moore’s strategy for crossing the chasm. Specifically, chapter 3 gives an overview of his strategy, breaking it down into four steps. Each respective step is covered in more detail in one of the remaining four chapters.

In addition to providing commentary, we’ve reorganized the book’s material. In Part 1, Moore jumps back and forth between discussing the original TALC (technology adoption life cycle), his improved version of it, and strategy considerations for the early market. For clarity, we’ve separated these topics.

We’ve also added commentary comparing Moore’s presentation of the TALC with Beal and Bohlen’s original presentation and contrasting Moore’s strategy with _Blue Ocean Strategy_ and the approach of pioneering marketer Regis McKenna.
