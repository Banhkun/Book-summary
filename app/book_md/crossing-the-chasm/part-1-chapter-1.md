## Part 1 | Chapter 1: The Technology Adoption Life Cycle

According to Moore, there is a “chasm” between the early market and the mainstream market. Innovative products often flourish in the early market and then stagnate and die in the chasm instead of succeeding in the mainstream market as well.

To understand Moore’s strategy for crossing the chasm and entering the mainstream market successfully, you need to understand the chasm between the early and mainstream markets. And to understand the chasm, you first need to understand the Technology Adoption Life Cycle (TALC).

(Shortform note: The TALC, also known as “diffusion of innovation,” was developed by Beal and Bohlen, two agricultural extension agents working for Iowa State College in the 1950s. They developed the model based on studies of when farmers started using new agricultural innovations, such as fertilizer and hybrid seed corn. Others soon generalized the model to technological innovations outside of agriculture.)

As Moore explains, the TALC predicts that as a technology matures, the number of potential new buyers first increases (as the technology starts to catch on) and then decreases (as you run out of potential customers who haven’t already bought it), following the profile of a bell curve. The area under the curve represents the total number of customers for the new technology. This area is divided into five psychographic categories (classifications by psychological and demographic criteria) of prospective customers, as shown in the figure below.

![crossingthechasm-talc1.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/crossingthechasm-talc1.png)

> **Measuring Technological Maturity**
> 
> Technology does not become more mature by itself. It takes investment in R&D to refine it. This is why the horizontal axis of the TALC graph is “technological maturity,” and not simply time.
> 
> How do you measure technological maturity? There are a number of metrics that can be used to quantify it, of which the most common is the “Technology Readiness Level,” or TRL system. That said, the TRL system only partially overlaps with the scale of technological maturity shown in the TALC:
> 
>   * TRL-1 through TRL-3 denote levels of preliminary scientific research and development. At this point, there is no product to sell, so this region of technological maturity lies completely to the left of the TALC curve.
> 
>   * TRL-4 through TRL-6 represent stages of laboratory R&D, component development, and proof-of-concept prototype testing. It is possible that you might work with a few innovators outside the company (under an NDA) during this period, but even at TRL-6 your product is only ready for preliminary proof-of-concept demonstrations. Thus, the technology maturity scale on the TALC graph starts at about TRL-6.
> 
>   * TRL-7 and TRL-8 represent increasingly sophisticated prototypes, such as beta versions that you might sell to innovators or demonstrate to early adopters to get an order for a custom solution tailored to their application.
> 
>   * The official TRL system ends at TRL-9, which denotes a technology that has been used successfully in the field. Thus, by the time you have completed your first full system installation for an early adopter, your product should be at TRL-9.
> 
> 

> 
> Perhaps the TRL-system could be extended to cover the rest of the TALC. For example:
> 
>   * TRL-10 could denote the point where the technology is recognized in industry standards. On the graph, this would be near where the early majority section begins.
> 
>   * TRL-11 could denote widespread proliferation of the technology, or more precisely, the point under the peak of the curve, where at least half of the potential customers have already adopted it.
> 
>   * TRL-12 could denote the point where the technology is considered essential for routine operations in its applicable context. On the graph, this would be in the laggard region.
> 
> 


> **Category Boundaries**
> 
> Moore states that the boundaries between these five psychographic categories lie approximately at the standard deviation intervals on the bell curve. (Most of the area under a normal bell curve lies within three standard deviations of the center, so in this case, the standard deviation intervals essentially divide the graph into six equally spaced regions along the horizontal axis.)
> 
> However, the graph that Moore presents in _Crossing the Chasm_ depicts the boundaries considerably further from the center of the curve than standard deviation intervals would be. This makes the early and late majorities appear to represent a larger proportion of the overall population. Moore provides no explanation for the discrepancy in the graph, so presumably, his graphic artist simply didn’t draw it to scale.
> 
> In our figure above, the boundaries are marked at the standard deviation intervals, consistent with Moore’s assertion. However, other analysts have challenged the proportions of the population allotted to each category. Some argue that with the accelerating pace of technological innovation, the peak of the bell curve has shifted to the left, meaning that today there are proportionately more people in the early majority and early adopter categories, and fewer people in the late majority.

In the remainder of this chapter, we'll discuss the characteristics of the people in each category in terms of their population size, motive for buying new technology, technical competence, quality requirements, price sensitivity, perspective on the whole product, and perspective on product positioning.

(Shortform note: Moore’s strategy is intended specifically for business-to-business marketing, so he depicts the people of each category in this light, though others have applied the TALC concept to individual consumers as well.)

However, to understand the two final characteristics, you first need to understand the “whole product model” and the concept of “positioning” as Moore uses these terms.

#### The Whole Product Model

As Moore explains, the premise of the “whole product” concept is that a product has to interface with other products, services, or infrastructure in order to perform its intended function. For example, if you buy a smartphone, your “whole product” might consist of the phone itself plus a data plan, electricity to charge the phone, and some third-party apps.

(Shortform note: The “whole product” concept is also called the “total product.” Most sources credit Theodore Levitt for developing the concept in his book The Marketing Imagination. However, in his book, Levitt attributes the concept to Harvard Business School professor Raymond Corey. Moore introduces a “simplified whole-product model” that differs from Levitt’s model, as we will discuss in Chapter 6.)

#### The Concept of Positioning

Moore uses the word “positioning” to describe how potential customers view a product or company and where they place it on the market landscape in relation to competing products or companies.

He also uses it to describe what you do to help customers establish your product’s positioning. However, he emphasizes that positioning is ultimately determined by the customers, not the company. For example, you could run a great advertising campaign extolling the reliability of your product, but if customers encounter problems with it, then people may still regard it as an unreliable knock-off.

(Shortform note: The term “positioning” is used differently by different sources. For example, one online business glossary defines product positioning as the process by which you identify the critical function your product will perform for your prospective customers and communicate it to them. Another defines it similarly and emphasizes that the key to doing this is understanding your customers. While Moore’s perspective still prompts these kinds of actions, his definition contrasts with these definitions at a theoretical level, because he insists that positioning ultimately takes place in the customer’s mind, not in your marketing department.)

### Innovators

The first category of customers represented in the TALC is made up of “innovators.” Moore also calls them “technology enthusiasts,” or “techies,” because they value innovative technology for its own sake. They buy new or experimental products just to try them out because they want to be on the cutting edge and participate in advancing the state of the art. Moore characterizes innovators as follows:

  * **Population size:** About 2% of the total population.
  * **Technical Competence:** Extremely high. Moore observes that innovators can get by with minimal operating instructions, and they’ll often invest their own time in debugging your product. 
  * **Quality Requirements for your product:** Low. They are used to working with products that don’t have all the bugs worked out of them yet.
  * **Price Sensitivity:** High. Moore notes that innovators typically operate on a limited budget, and some of them believe that technology should be free or provided at-cost. (Shortform note: It seems likely that most innovators would be in technical rather than executive roles in a company. This would limit their budget and their ability to place large orders for their company, consistent with Moore’s characterization.)
  * **Whole-Product Perspective:** Innovators don’t need whole products, because they take pleasure in assembling components into working systems for themselves.
  * **Product Positioning Perspective:** According to Moore, innovators assess your product’s positioning on a purely technical basis. To help them evaluate where it fits relative to other technology, they look for schematics, demonstrations or user trials, and endorsements from respected technology gurus. They tend to communicate broadly, both within and outside of their own industry or community, to keep abreast of new technological developments.



> **Beal and Bohlen’s Perspective on Innovators**
> 
> According to Beal and Bohlen’s original characterization, innovators, by definition, are the first people in their respective communities to adopt new technology.
> 
> They report that there are usually only one or two of them in a local community, corroborating Moore’s assessment of their population size.
> 
> Beal and Bohlen report that innovators typically have high net worth, and most importantly, they have large amounts of “risk capital.” They can afford to buy new technology just to try it out. This contradicts Moore’s assertion that innovators are more price-sensitive. Perhaps the price sensitivity of innovators is context-specific. An engineer working in industry might have a limited budget for assessing experimental technologies, while a self-employed farmer would only be able to experiment with new agricultural technologies if he had the money to do so.
> 
> According to Beal and Bohlen, innovators are typically influential people in their communities, with many connections outside their local community as well. This description corroborates Moore’s assertion that innovators tend to communicate broadly.

### Early Adopters

The second category consists of “early adopters.” Moore prefers to call them “visionaries,” because most of them are ambitious leaders looking to gain a strategic advantage or make a quantum leap forward by leveraging new technological breakthroughs. Unlike the innovators, they are not interested in new technology for its own sake, but rather in the new advantages it may afford.

  * **Population size:** About one-sixth of the population. 
  * **Technical Competence:** High. Moore observes that a typical early adopter has the technical insight to identify and implement strategic technologies, as well as the charisma to rally his company around the project.
  * **Quality Requirements for your product:** Moderate. Moore describes early adopters as being comfortable accepting the risk of unproven technology because they envision it providing great benefits. However, he also notes that their expectations often exceed the product’s actual capabilities, making them difficult customers to please in the long run.
  * **Price Sensitivity:** Lowest. Moore asserts that early adopters are usually corporate executives with resources to fund ambitious projects.
  * **Whole-Product Perspective:** According to Moore, early adopters are willing to take responsibility for assembling the whole product because they want to be the first to leverage its capabilities.
  * **Product Positioning Perspective:** According to Moore, early adopters assess your product’s positioning based on how it fits into their vision for the future or could help them realize their ambitions. They communicate broadly to keep an eye out for new technologies with strategic applications and evaluate them based on technical benchmarks, product reviews, initial sales metrics, and trade press coverage.



> **Beal and Bohlen’s Perspective on Early Adopters**
> 
> According to Beal and Bohlen’s original characterization, early adopters tend to be younger and more highly educated than members of the early and late majority. They are well-read and stay well-informed, receiving more technical or agricultural publications than the majority do.
> 
> Moore echoes Beal’s assertion that early adopters are well-informed and communicate broadly, especially through publications, but he does not address their average age or level of education. Perhaps these characteristics were more pronounced in the population that Beal and Bohlen studied.
> 
> For example, perhaps in a farming community, the average farmer has a two-year degree or equivalent, while early-adopter farmers have graduate-level degrees. Meanwhile, the average office worker of a Silicon Valley manufacturing company has a graduate-level degree, and so highly-educated early adopters don’t stand out as being significantly more educated than the rest of the population.
> 
> Beal and Bohlen state that early adopters are also the most likely to hold public office or otherwise be formally involved in the institutions of their respective communities. Moore makes no mention of this but does say that early adopters usually hold executive positions in their respective companies. Perhaps early adopters in rural farming communities tend to be more involved in _municipal_ politics, while early adopters in advanced manufacturing companies tend to be more involved in _corporate_ politics.
> 
> After commenting that innovators tend to have large amounts of risk capital available, Beal and Bohlen offer no comment on the financial status of early adopters. This contrasts with Moore’s description, since Moore identifies early adopters as having the most funding available to spend on cutting-edge technology, while innovators are much more price sensitive.

### Early Majority

The third category is made up of the “early majority.” Moore prefers to call them “pragmatists,” because they are interested in taking advantage of new technology, but they’re also averse to the risks of pioneering a new technology.

  * **Population size:** About one-third of the population. Moore identifies them as the largest of all the categories.
  * **Technical Competence:** Moderately high. According to Moore, they are willing and able to learn how to use new technology, but they expect good documentation and technical support.
  * **Quality Requirements for your product:** High. Moore observes that they’re not interested in buying a product until it’s fully debugged. Moreover, they only buy from companies that have established a reputation for delivering a high-quality product and standing behind it. 
  * **Price Sensitivity:** Moderate. Typically they are looking for good value at the upper end of the performance spectrum.
  * **Whole-Product Perspective:** According to Moore, the early majority will only buy your product if they can’t see that everything they need to benefit from it is readily available. They consider whole-product features such as compatibility and long-term support when evaluating the quality of your product. 
  * **Product Positioning Perspective:** According to Moore, the early majority assess your product’s positioning based on how it compares to alternatives. They tend to communicate narrowly within their own industry. To assess where your product fits into the landscape of their industry, they consider your market share, the industry standards or certifications that your product meets, press coverage, and endorsements from other users within their community.



> **Beal and Bohlen’s Perspective on the Early Majority**
> 
> According to Beal and Bohlen’s original characterization, members of the early majority tend to have fewer resources than innovators and early adopters, such that they cannot afford to take risks with unproven technology. Thus, when a new innovation comes out, they wait until they can be sure it works before they adopt it.
> 
> Moore echoes this perspective but emphasizes that the early majority tend to base their evaluation of products heavily upon the reputation of the manufacturer and/or distributor.
> 
> Beal and Bohlen further observe that early adopters tend to be slightly more educated than the general population. Again, Moore does not mention education as a distinguishing characteristic of this group. As we discussed in the case of early adopters, the educational difference may have been more pronounced for the farming population that Beal and Bohlen were studying than for the industrial customers that Moore describes.
> 
> According to Beal and Bohlen, the early majority tend to be “informal leaders'' in their communities, in the sense that they do not hold public office or other positions of formal leadership, but their peers admire them and respect their opinions. They tend to place a high value on their peers’ respect and are careful to maintain their reputation. They tend to communicate closely within their own community, but not outside of it.
> 
> These observations corroborate Moore’s assertions about the close-knit nature of early majority communities, whether rural or industrial, and the value that the early majority place on reputation. Although Beal and Bohlen don’t explicitly extend the importance of reputation to the manufacturer or distributor as Moore does, their description of the early majority makes this a natural extrapolation.
> 
> Moreover, as we will see in the next chapter, these two qualities play a pivotal role in generating the “chasm” between early adopters and the early majority. Beal and Bohlen did not identify Moore’s “chasm,” but it arguably _could_ be identified based solely on analysis of their original characterizations of the different categories of adopters.

### Late Majority

The fourth category is made up of the “late majority.” Moore prefers to call them “conservatives,” because they tend to value stability over progress. They are not interested in new technology or the advantages it affords, but as it becomes standard and the technology that it replaces becomes obsolete, they will eventually upgrade to mitigate risk.

  * **Population size:** About one-third of the population. More says they are almost as numerous as the early majority.
  * **Technical Competence:** Moderately low. Moore says they tend to value simplicity and convenience over performance because they are less confident than the early majority in their ability to implement new technologies. 
  * **Quality Requirements for your product:** High. Moore observes that they require a product that is well-proven, thoroughly debugged, and widely supported across the industry.
  * **Price Sensitivity:** High. As Moore points out, the early majority aren’t willing to spend much on new technology because they don’t expect to benefit from it. 
  * **Whole-Product Perspective:** According to Moore, the late majority are even more sensitive to missing parts of the whole product than the early majority are, because they are less competent at putting together the whole product.
  * **Product Positioning Perspective:** Moore asserts that, because they value stability, the late majority tend to assess your product’s positioning based on how long they think it will be supported. To evaluate this, they consider its performance in industry to date, who else is using it, who is distributing and supporting it, and analysis provided by the business press.



> **Beal and Bohlen’s Perspective on the Late Majority**
> 
> Beal and Bohlen’s original characterization refers to this category simply as the “majority,” rather than the “late majority.” Perhaps, where Moore identified the late majority as being slightly smaller than the early majority, Beal and Bohlen saw it as being slightly larger.
> 
> Then again, their nomenclature could also be a product of their method of analysis. When your product passes the peak of the bell curve into the region of the late majority, that implies that more than half of the total customers have adopted it. Thus, in a cumulative sense, selling to the late majority means your product has been adopted by the majority of the market. Beal and Bohlen displayed their customer categories on an S-shaped cumulative distribution curve, instead of on the bell curve that other analysts, such as Moore, used later. This could imply that they applied the term “majority” to the late majority in a cumulative sense.
> 
> In any case, Beal and Bohlen describe the late majority as typically being older and less educated than members of the preceding categories. They also describe them as less likely to read technical publications, hold positions of leadership within their communities, or communicate outside of their own community.
> 
> Their observations about technical publications and leadership positions is consistent with Moore’s assertion that they tend to be less technically competent and less confident in their ability to implement new solutions.
> 
> Moore does not discuss the relative age of the different categories. It may be that age became less relevant between the time of Beal and Bohlen’s research and the time of Moore’s writing. Perhaps generations that had experienced periods of technological stasis were more likely to be late adopters. Then, as the pace of technological advancement accelerated and the generation that was old enough to remember times of technological stasis died off, age would have ceased to be a defining quality of the late majority.

### Laggards

The fifth category is made up of the “laggards.” Moore also calls them “skeptics,” because they tend to be skeptical of new developments and often criticize new technologies publicly. In their view, every new technology introduces new risks, and the alleged benefits of new innovations simply aren’t worth the risks.

  * **Population size:** About one-sixth of the population.
  * **Technical Competence:** Low. Moore asserts they are either unable or unwilling to learn how to use new technologies.
  * **Quality Requirements for your product:** Very High. They probably won’t buy your product, but as it proliferates throughout the industry, they are adept at identifying discrepancies between your marketing claims and actual performance. 
  * **Price Sensitivity:** Not applicable, since they’re not likely to buy new technology at any price.
  * **Whole-Product Perspective:** Not applicable, since they avoid implementing new technologies.
  * **Product Positioning Perspective:** Moore does not describe how laggards assess the positioning of your product. However, from what he does say, we may infer that they tend to position products and companies based on risk, and they tend to assess the risk primarily based on product history, especially their own usage history or that of their immediate colleagues.



> **Beal and Bohlen’s Perspective on Laggards**
> 
> Beal and Bohlen referred to this category as the “non-adopters.” They describe them as being the oldest, the least educated, and the least likely to read technical publications.
> 
> Moore does not characterize laggards in terms of age or education, per se. The age factor might have been less significant by the time of Moore’s writing, as we discussed in the case of the late majority. Moore identifies them as unable or unwilling to learn new technologies, which seems consistent with a lower level of education, even though Moore doesn’t bring it up.
> 
> Then again, Moore also notes that laggards tend to express criticism of new technologies and point out discrepancies in marketing claims. In order to do this, they would need some level of familiarity with both the technological basis of the product and the publications where it is advertised.
> 
> This dichotomy suggests that perhaps laggards are a more diverse category, or are not as thoroughly characterized as the other categories. The unifying characteristic of the laggard category is that they resist adopting new technologies, but perhaps different laggards have different motives. Neither Beal and Bohlen nor Moore spend much time discussing laggards, and it stands to reason that they have been studied less, because they are not regarded as having the potential to generate significant sales. Why spend time and money trying to understand a group that won’t buy your product anyway?
