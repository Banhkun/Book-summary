## Exercise: What’s Your Psychographic Category?

Recall the psychographic categories of the TALC (technology adoption life cycle):

  * Innovators love new technology for its own sake.
  * Early adopters want to gain an advantage with new technology.
  * The early majority look to how others around them feel about a new technology.
  * The late majority want to keep up with the status quo.
  * Laggards are skeptical.

Think of the last time you bought (or downloaded, subscribed to, etc.) a high-tech product, such as a new software program, an electronic gadget or other tool you didn’t have before, or a medical treatment/drug that recently became available. What did you purchase, and what were your motives for buying it? Which category do you think you were in when you made that purchase?

Think of an advertisement you’ve recently seen for something that you’ve decided **_not_** to buy, at least for now. What was the product or service? What were your motives for deciding not to get it? Which category does this put you in for this situation?
