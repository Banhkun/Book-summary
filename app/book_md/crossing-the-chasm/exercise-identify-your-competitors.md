## Exercise: Identify Your Competitors

Recall that Moore identifies two types of competitors: A _market alternative_ is a product that directly competes with yours for a share of the same market. A _product alternative_ is a product based on the same core technology, but not being used for the same purpose or competing in the same market.

For this exercise, think of the product your company most recently started selling. If youâ€™re not involved in selling anything, then think of a product that you recently purchased.

* * *

Briefly describe the product.

Name at least one market alternative. What else could someone buy in place of your product?

Name at least one product alternative. What other kinds of products rely on the same basic technology as yours?

How might you position your product against either of these competitors to showcase its advantages?
