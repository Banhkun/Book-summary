## Exercise: Identify Your Whole Product

Recall Moore’s simplified whole product model, which shows the core product in the center, with the outer circle divided into sectors, each of which represents another piece of the whole solution. Think about the most recent product your company started selling. If you’re not involved in selling anything, think about a product you recently purchased.

* * *

Briefly describe your core product.

Now make a list of sectors that you would show on a whole product diagram. What other products or services does your customer need in order to make your product work?

Think about how the product might be improved by adding or adjusting sectors in the outer circle. Are there elements of the product that customers (or you, if you’re thinking of another company’s product) have noted are missing, or is there any aspect of the user experience that could be enhanced by partnering with another company or adding another product?
