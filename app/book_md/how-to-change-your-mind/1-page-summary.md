## 1-Page Summary

Did magic mushrooms contribute to making us human? In _How to Change Your Mind_ , Michael Pollan explores the potential of psychedelics for mental health treatment and discusses the cultural and social implications of these substances. He traces their history, from their use by indigenous cultures for spiritual and healing purposes to their prohibition by the US government in 1970. Pollan focuses most of his attention on two specific psychedelics—LSD and psilocybin, also known as “acid” and “magic mushrooms,” since these two substances have had the biggest impact on modern Western culture.

After exploring the complex and troubled history of these substances, Pollan examines the recent resurgence of scientific interest in psychedelics, as researchers have begun to explore their potential to treat depression, addiction, and other mental health issues. He also delves into the complex legal and cultural issues surrounding psychedelics and considers what their re-emergence might mean for our society as a whole.

Michael Pollan is an author, journalist, and professor of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. He is best known for his books _The Omnivore’s Dilemma_ and _In Defense of Food_ , as well as his articles in The New York Times, which have helped shape the public’s understanding of the modern food system. Pollan became intrigued by the topic of psychedelics after learning about research on terminal cancer patients who were given psilocybin to help ease their fears around death.

During the course of interviews for this book, Pollan decided that in order to fully comprehend the topic he would need to partake in psychedelics himself—this would be a new and revelatory experience for him. In the book, he recounts his own personal journey of experimentation with LSD, psilocybin, and 5-MeO-DMT. He ultimately argues that **psychedelics can be used not only to treat psychological disorders, but also to reduce the fear of death and to help people become more creative and open to new ideas.**

In addition to exploring the potential benefits of psychedelics, Pollan also examines the risks associated with their use, including the possibility of adverse reactions, flashbacks, and other unpleasant experiences. He argues that these risks can be mitigated by professional guidance and attention to context and that the benefits are worth the risk.

This guide is divided into three parts: Part 1 explores the history of psychedelics, including their use in indigenous cultures and their emergence as a popular recreational drug in 1960s America. Part 2 describes the psychedelic experience and delves into the science behind these substances, explaining what scientists have learned about their effects on the brain. Part 3 examines the cultural and social implications of the re-emergence of psychedelics as a tool for growth and healing.

Throughout the guide we’ll look at current research in psychedelics, including some of the guidelines for mitigating the dangers of psychedelic research. We’ll also probe ancient history to provide further context for humans’ complex and enduring relationship with these substances.

### Part 1: The History of Psychedelics

First, we’ll begin with a definition and brief history of psychedelics. **The word “psychedelic” means “mind manifesting.”** Coined in 1957, it’s a relatively recent term, but humans' relationship with these substances is hardly new. Psychedelics are sometimes referred to by anthropologists as _entheogens,_ which is derived from the Greek “god within,” and they are also commonly called “hallucinogens.” Pollan explains that anthropologists and other scholars generally shun the latter term, however, because of its implication that the experiences caused by these substances are not real.

> **What Are Psychedelics and How Are They Used?**
> 
> The term “psychedelics” is typically used to refer to chemicals or plants that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when ingested by humans. These substances can create profound changes in perception, thought patterns, and mood. Examples include psilocybin (found in “magic mushrooms”), LSD, DMT, ayahuasca, mescaline, and many others—some of which are synthetic while others occur naturally.
> 
> Although psychedelics are generally safer than most other types of recreational drugs, they come with risks since they alter your perception. Users can have extremely negative “trips” that can have long-lasting effects on their mental health. This is why experts stress the crucial importance of context for psychedelic experiences.

In this section, we’ll summarize the history of psychedelics, as Pollan explains it, in three phases:

  1. **Psychedelics have a rich history of use in indigenous cultures** for spiritual and healing purposes, dating back to ancient times.
  2. **LSD and psilocybin made their way into American and European cultures** in the 1950s. Their widespread recreational use in the 1960s, as well as some serious missteps with early psychedelic research, led to their criminalization and stigmatization for several decades.
  3. In recent years, research into the **use of psychedelics for mental health treatment** has been revived.



#### History of Psychedelics in the Ancient World

Humans’ relationship with psychedelics is longer than recorded history. Pollan tells us that**indigenous cultures all over the world have developed unique relationships with natural consciousness-altering substances and have used them in healing and spiritual practices for thousands of years.**

Archaeologists have found evidence of the use of psychedelic substances well into prehistoric times, and written documentation of their use goes as far back as ancient Greece. Some scholars believe the earliest Christian eucharist rituals in Greece were carry-overs from ancient Dionysian rituals revolving around a psychedelic brew. And cultures throughout Mesoamerica used mushrooms and other psychedelics in their religious practices.

But these practices would all come under attack by the Roman Catholic Church, first in ancient Greece and then later in the 16th and 17th centuries during the Spanish colonial conquest of the Americas. Pollan says Spanish priests who missionized the Aztecs in modern-day Mexico declared that the Aztecs’ consumption of mushrooms was a communion with the devil. These kinds of assumptions resulted in deliberate suppression of the use of psychedelics by native peoples, including the Aztecs—who used psychedelic mushrooms and morning glory seeds—and Native American tribes, some of whom use a psychedelic cactus called _peyote_. The Church quickly sought to eradicate these practices because they undermined the Church’s authority and threatened the spread of Christianity.

Despite repeated efforts by ruling powers to stamp out psychedelic use, Pollan says the ancient and enduring history of humans’ relationship with these substances suggests that they must serve important functions. Some scholars even suggest that**psychedelics may be the most important historical driver of the development of religion and of the evolution of human consciousness.** We’ll discuss this more in Part 3.

> **Psychedelics vs. the Church—a 2,000-Year Power Struggle**
> 
> In his book _The Immortality Key_ , Brian Muraresku argues that the longstanding opposition to psychedelics by the Christian church is not simply a matter of preference or prejudice. He says it’s **a 2,000-year deliberate effort to restrict the population’s access to a transcendental awareness that might liberate them from the need for scriptural dogma.** In other words, if people have a direct line to God, they won’t need the church.
> 
> In this book, Muraresku presents evidence that Greeks and Romans during the time of early Christianity were mixing potent psychoactive herbs into their wine as part of religious rituals—these rituals, he argues, are likely the origin of the Christian eucharist.
> 
> By the fourth century, however, religious traditions in the region had become deeply fractured. On one hand, there were the “proto-Christians,” who practiced these psychedelic-inspired mystical traditions; on the other, there was a growing number of powerful leaders who wanted to establish a hierarchical church, within which only the _leaders_ had access to power and divinity. This would become Orthodox Christianity.
> 
> According to Muraresku, the problem for the Orthodox church was that psychedelics made people realize they could directly commune with the divine. This undermined the church leaders’ power since those who “tasted the forbidden fruit” would not submit to Orthodox teachings. So, Muraresku contends that **the Christian church has an explicit agenda to eradicate psychedelics specifically because they make people impossible to convert and control.** And he points out that this “anti-drug” campaign is evident throughout history, including in the colonialist suppression of psychedelics and the observable attitudes of Christianity toward drugs—including psychedelics—today.

#### History of Psychedelics in the Modern Western World

Next, we’ll take a look at the complicated role of psychedelics—most importantly LSD and psilocybin—in modern Western culture. As we’ll see,**** this too is a history fraught with tension between experimenters and authority figures, a conflict between freedom and control.****

##### The Accidental Invention of LSD

Pollan explains that the history of LSD begins in a Swiss laboratory in 1938. A chemist named Albert Hofman was working on medical research that involved creating synthetic compounds from ergot, a toxic fungus that grows on grains. He identified an alkaloid in ergot called _lysergic acid_ and began to create derivatives of it, looking for medical treatments for respiratory and circulatory ailments. The 25th derivative would be a revolutionary invention called _lysergic acid diethylamide-25_ (LSD-25).

Five years into his experimentation with these compounds, Hofman accidentally absorbed a minute amount of LSD-25 through his skin. He had the world’s first acid trip that afternoon, which he documented in detail, and this discovery had some extraordinary effects on the world.

> **LSD: Hofman’s Problem Child**
> 
> Hofman’s famous first trip occurred on April 19, 1943. He was so astounded by that first experience that he decided to experiment more with this mysterious compound. He did this by intentionally dosing himself and by testing it on animals. This substance would change the trajectory of Hofman’s life and career, and he went on to take LSD hundreds of times.
> 
> Hofman became an enthusiastic environmentalist, and he argued that LSD could repair humans’ dysfunctional relationship with nature by awakening a renewed sense of oneness and connection with the natural world. On his 100th birthday in 2006, he described LSD as “a tool to turn us into what we are supposed to be.” But he also recognized the dangers of the drug—his 1980 memoir is titled “LSD — My Problem Child.” In it, **he warns against the careless recreational use of this substance, advocating for a more carefully ritualized use, in the way that indigenous cultures treat psychedelics as a ritual sacrament.**
> 
> Hofman died in 2008 at the age of 102. Because his first trip began as he was bicycling home from his lab, April 19 is now celebrated annually by psychedelic enthusiasts and referred to as “Bicycle Day.”

As medical researchers learned about LSD in the 1940s and 50s, some believed the LSD experience sounded like it mimicked psychosis. **This prompted psychiatrists to question whether mental illness might have a biochemical basis, whereas it had previously been understood to be purely psychological.** Pollan explains that the effect this shift in thinking had on psychiatric research was revolutionary. Some psychiatrists even undertook personal experimentation with LSD, thinking it would allow them to better understand the experience of their psychotic patients and improve their ability to treat them. By the 1950s, research testing LSD on psychiatric patients was ongoing in medical centers and universities in Europe, America, and Canada.

Because researchers initially used LSD to intentionally induce temporary psychosis, they were surprised when, after more widespread experimentation, most subjects reported _positive_ experiences.**While some subjects reported paranoia and anxiety, many described feelings of transcendence, oneness with the world, heightened sensory experiences, and profound new philosophical or spiritual understandings.** This led researchers to consider much broader applications for the drug, and it was eventually tested for treatment of a variety of conditions, such as depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, and addiction (most notably alcoholism).

(Shortform note: The co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Bill Wilson, believed that LSD could help alcoholics recover from addiction, and he proposed using it in the program in the 1950s. Wilson had taken LSD as a subject in psychiatric experiments and had found relief from his debilitating depression. He began to consider how the spiritual awakening experienced by many users could be helpful for alcoholics in the 12-step program, specifically by fostering a connection with a higher power—an essential step in the program. Other members of the organization opposed Wilson’s proposition, however, and in 1958 he stepped down from the governing body because of it.)

##### Psilocybin Takes Root in America

Along with LSD, Pollan tells us that Westerners were also discovering psilocybin mushrooms in the 1950s. In 1957, a researcher named R. Gordon Wasson published an article in the widely read _Life_ magazine __ documenting his experience participating in a psychedelic ceremony with the indigenous Mazatec people of Mexico. Pollan explains that**this article brought the potential of psilocybin to the attention of both researchers and mainstream America, where the adventurous youth began to seek it out enthusiastically.**

(Shortform note: R. Gordon Wasson's _Life_ magazine article "Seeking the Magic Mushroom" was the first popular account of the use of psychedelic mushrooms in the Western world, and was the first to introduce the term “magic mushrooms.” But it was not simply an amateur mycologist’s adventure. It was later revealed that Wasson’s psychedelic exploration trip to Mexico was funded by the CIA under the auspices of “medical research.” In truth, though unbeknownst to Wasson himself, the CIA was funding this research as part of its covert MK-Ultra project, a notorious experimental program that explored the potential of using mind-altering drugs, including LSD and psilocybin, as chemical weapons.)

Beginning in the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, prestigious American institutions like Harvard, Stanford, and MIT tested psychedelics on both volunteer subjects and themselves. Pollan tells us that **more than 1,000 scientific papers were published on psychedelics during these two decades** , and the substances were used with considerable success to treat a variety of mental health conditions.

**The best-known psychedelic researcher of this era was Timothy Leary** , who along with his colleague Richard Alpert, began running the Harvard Psilocybin Project in 1960. Over the next two years, Leary and Alpert would administer psilocybin to hundreds of student volunteers, in addition to taking it themselves. But Pollan explains that **the lack of scientific control and rigor, as well as the fact that the experimenters were also under the influence, ultimately caused the experiments to be shut down.** Both Leary and Alpert were let go from Harvard in 1963, but their influence wouldn’t end there.

Alpert went to India and came back spiritually transformed—having changed his name to **Ram Dass** , he wrote the best-selling 1960s counterculture manual _Be Here Now_ , and he became a major guru in the movement. Leary went on to found his own experimental project called the International Federation for Internal Freedom (IFIF) with the goal of making psychedelics as widely available to as many Americans as possible. He believed that once a crucial mass of Americans was “turned on,” the whole society would shift toward a more enlightened state.

So, two of the leading pro-psychedelic voices left academia and entered the mainstream. The effects on both academia and America as a whole were profound. As Pollan explains, **Leary was known for advocating that young people “tune in, turn on, and drop out,” and many of them did** —large portions of young Americans refused to participate in corporate culture and evaded conscription in the Vietnam war. This did not escape the attention of the power elite and would have consequences.

> **Acid Test Parties Spawn Psychedelic Music**
> 
> _The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_ , written by Tom Wolfe in 1968, delves more deeply into the 1960s counterculture movement in the US, as well as the wider influence of prominent figures like Leary and Alpert. The book centers on the experiences of author Ken Kesey and his group of followers, known as the Merry Pranksters, as they embark on a cross-country trip in a brightly painted bus called "Further."
> 
> In 1964 the group traveled from California to the East Coast, spreading their message of liberation, psychedelic experimentation, and the pursuit of a new consciousness. **They embraced the use of LSD and other mind-altering substances, viewing them as tools for expanding perception and breaking away from societal norms.**
> 
> Wolfe also documents the Merry Pranksters’ relationships with iconic Beat Generation figures like Neal Cassady and Jack Kerouac, and he describes the “Acid Test” parties that capped off these adventures in 1965-1966. The Acid Tests were a series of LSD-saturated parties hosted by Kesey in San Francisco. Friends of Kesey who played in a band called The Warlocks became the “house band” of these parties, writing music specifically to facilitate the psychedelic experience—this band would go on to change their name to the Grateful Dead and become the major musical icon of the psychedelic movement.

##### Moral Panic Leads to the Banning of Psychedelics

Pollan tells us that**the socio-cultural effects of psychedelic use—particularly LSD—in the counterculture scene were eventually perceived to be too disruptive to society, so the US government began to crack down on it.** He says that President Richard Nixon once referred to Leary as “the most dangerous man in America.”

By the mid-1960s, propaganda focusing on the dangers of psychedelics—which Pollan says were mostly exaggerated or entirely fictitious—began to circulate heavily in the media, and a moral panic ensued.**** University researchers were ordered to cease experimentation with psychedelics in 1966, and by the end of the decade, the substances were made federally illegal. **The Controlled Substances Act, passed in 1970, classified LSD and psilocybin as Schedule I substances, which means they’re deemed to have high potential for abuse and no recognized medical value** , despite evidence to the contrary. They remain classified as such today.

Pollan explains that some researchers he spoke with pointed out that this moral panic was not unlike the earlier colonial powers’ suppression of the use of psychedelics by indigenous cultures. Many believe that **power figures object to a population’s exposure to these mystical states because it undermines hierarchical structures—in other words, it makes people harder to control.**

> **Nixon’s “War on Drugs” Was a Culture War**
> 
> President Nixon's "War on Drugs" campaign intensified the crackdown on all drug use, including psychedelics. The administration emphasized criminalizing drug offenders rather than pursuing treatment or prevention strategies. Nixon declared drugs "public enemy number one." Anti-drug messages were disseminated through various media channels, including television, print media, and public service announcements. **This campaign successfully created a negative public perception of psychedelics through fear tactics and demonization.**
> 
> And it’s no coincidence that the “War on Drugs” historically coincides with the civil rights and antiwar counterculture movements—it was a direct response to those. **One of Nixon’s closest advisers, John Ehrlichman,acknowledged in a 1994 interview that Nixon was specifically targeting the antiwar left and Black people with this campaign.** He says “We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or Black,” so instead they focused on getting the public to associate hippies and Black people with drugs—like marijuana, LSD, and heroin—and then criminalizing those drugs.

While Leary and others like him can be partially blamed for the widespread banning of psychedelics in both academia and society as a whole, Pollan points out that their haphazard and unruly approach to experimentation was probably necessary. This was uncharted territory, and they could only have learned how context-dependent psychedelic experiences are by trying out different methods. They ultimately learned that**psychedelic-assisted therapy works best in a controlled and guided setting, and the current phase of research is taking those findings seriously and implementing them.**

#### Research on Psychedelics is Revived

After a decades-long ban, a few researchers attempted in the 1990s to resurrect interest in the study of psychedelics for mental health and spirituality. But it was only in 2006 that a new renaissance of psychedelic research was kicked off with another Johns Hopkins study. It was described in a paper titled “Psilocybin Can Occasion Mystical-Type Experiences Having Substantial and Sustained Personal Meaning and Spiritual Significance.” Pollan tells us that this work made a few crucially important contributions to the history and understanding of psychedelics:

  * It opened up a new dialogue and interest in the scientific study of psychedelics.
  * It started a conversation about the distinction between psychedelics and other types of “drugs,” leading to a wider recognition that psychedelics are generally much safer, have therapeutic use, and are non-addictive.
  * It bridged a gap between science and spirituality. This study looked at the spiritual experiences of _healthy_ participants, acknowledging that **psychedelic experiences can have inherent value for humanity as a whole, not just for treatment of illness.**



(Shortform note: Several similar studies have been conducted since the 2006 Johns Hopkins one, with consistent results. A 2011 study showed that while 39% of volunteers experienced extreme anxiety or fear while taking the drug, 72% reported having mystical experiences. At follow-ups one month and 14 months later, volunteers said that these experiences had substantial personal and spiritual significance, and they reported sustained positive changes in mood, attitudes, and behaviors.)

### Part 2: The Science of Psychedelics

Let’s turn now to a discussion of what recent research has found about how psychedelics work, both in terms of the subjective psychological experiences they trigger and their physiological effects on the brain.

There is now mounting scientific evidence that **psychedelics have the potential to treat mental health problems that can be otherwise treatment-resistant.** Pollan tells us that two recent studies have shown an 80% success rate in the alleviation of anxiety and depression among cancer patients. Similar results have been achieved with studies using psychedelics to treat addiction. These kinds of success rates, he says, are unprecedented with any other form of treatment. But how do they work?

Unlike other pharmaceutical treatments, Pollan explains that with psychedelics**it may not necessarily be the chemical reaction in the brain that’s therapeutic but the _experience_ resulting from it. **And that experience isn’t centered on the “visions” the subject has, but on the revelations they have from those visions. In this section, we’ll look at how psychedelic experiences are described, as well as what researchers have learned about what’s going on in subjects’ brains to produce these experiences.

(Shortform note: A 2021 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins examined the question of whether psychedelics could be useful from a solely biochemical standpoint, or whether the subjective experience of the trip is necessary. The study concludes the latter, stating that the neurobiological mechanisms are “likely necessary but not sufficient” to confer lasting therapeutic benefits.)

#### How Is This Research Conducted?

In reviewing the large volume of psychedelic research from the 1950s through today, Pollan notes that there have been a number of conflicting conclusions—some studies have had significantly higher success rates than others. He suggests that **one factor contributing to disparities in results is the difference in “set and setting,” a crucial factor in psychedelic experimentation.** “Set” refers to the mindset of the person at the time they take the psychedelic, and “setting” to the space and context within which the drug is taken. Leary stressed the vital importance of these factors for the outcome of the experience, and they remain central to the approach to psychedelics in research today.

(Shortform note: A long-recognized important element of set and setting in psychedelic therapy is music. Using principles from music psychology, University of Copenhagen researchers have developed their own playlist specifically designed to facilitate psychedelic therapy. They used four criteria in the selection of musical pieces: 1. An intensity appropriate to the psychedelic experience, 2. Culturally diverse styles and genres, 3. Any vocals should be in unfamiliar languages, and 4. No obvious religious references. The playlist—The Copenhagen Music Program for Psilocybin—is available on Spotify.)

Pollan describes how these studies are conducted in clinical settings. He says participants are put in a comfortable room at the research center with a guide who is trained to direct the subject’s experience. The rooms are generally created to be pleasant, tranquil spaces, with soothing music playing. Guides may give the subject a description beforehand of what they’re likely to experience, and the subjects are always asked to relax and allow the experience to unfold. Having a guide there to remind the subject of this mitigates the risk of them becoming too fearful and going into a negative trip.

According to Pollan, **subjects may be primed to expect to feel like they may be dying, dissolving, or losing themselves, and reassured that they shouldn’t be afraid because they _will_ come back to reality**. They should just let it happen, in order to get the fullest experience. They may also be told to expect mystical experiences and to fully embrace them.

Pollan points out that some have challenged the scientific nature of these methods, pointing out that **this priming creates an _expectancy effect_ —in other words, the researchers telling subjects what to expect necessarily influences what they'll experience.** Pollan explains, however, that most researchers dismiss this concern, because (a) it’s unavoidable—they have to do this for the safety of the subjects, to ensure that they don’t have “bad trips,” and (b) this research is specifically about how psychedelics might be used to bring about healing and/or these mystical experiences, so specifically trying to induce that is within the objectives of the study.

> **Guidelines for Clinical Psychedelic Trials**
> 
> The Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, launched in 2019, is the first research center of its kind in the US and the largest in the world. This center is at the forefront of current psychedelic research, and it received its first federal grant from the National Institutes of Health in 2021—the first federal grant for this kind of research awarded in more than 50 years.
> 
> The Johns Hopkins team has developed a set of guidelines for safety in testing psychedelics on human subjects. This guide addresses several potential measures of risk associated with psychedelics:
> 
>   * **Physiological toxicity:** There is no evidence for neurotoxic effects from LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline. MDMA, which is in a different class of drug, has the potential for some neurotoxic effects at high doses, but at therapeutic doses is considered safe.
> 
>   * **Abuse and dependence:** Psychedelics have low potential for addiction and are considered safe to administer without risk of dependency.
> 
>   * **Psychological distress and dangerous behavior during the experience:** The greatest risk associated with psychedelics is the risk of a “bad trip”—an experience characterized by acute psychological distress, anxiety, fear, and paranoia. This distress can potentially lead to dangerous behaviors, and although this is rare, researchers must be prepared to mitigate this risk and ensure the safety of the subject.
> 
>   * **Prolonged psychosis:** In extremely rare cases, a psychedelic session could trigger a state of psychosis lasting for days or even months. This only happens in approximately 1.8 out of every 1,000 cases and has been associated with prior serious mental health conditions. For this reason, people with certain conditions, such as schizophrenia and bipolar I or II disorder, are now excluded from participation in psychedelic trials.
> 
>   * **Lasting perceptual abnormalities:** Sometimes referred to as “flashbacks,” some subjects can experience a degree of altered perception after the psychedelic session is over. Recreational users of psychedelics report having these experiences more often than research subjects, and many report them as mild and not unpleasant. Research subjects should be made aware of the possibility, although with careful screening of subjects, it’s rare.
>

#### The Indescribability of the Psychedelic State

One of the biggest challenges with understanding how psychedelics work is that**the experiences themselves are notoriously difficult to describe** —participants almost always express a lack of ability to put the experiences into words. When they do describe them, the experiences tend to sound like hallucinatory or dream-like events, or even like spiritual clichés—for example, the description that “everything is love” or the sense of “oneness with the universe.”

Other common descriptions of psychedelic experience include:

  * The feeling that one communicated with God, or became a god oneself
  * The dissolving of one’s sense of self and/or the merging of self with others/everything
  * The realization that death is an illusion and that consciousness survives it
  * The sense that one is being born or giving birth (in one of his trips, Pollan experienced the feeling that he was giving birth to himself)
  * A deep sense of connectedness with, and reverence for, nature 
  * Encounters with loved ones, alive or dead



These trips are usually accompanied by vivid sensory experiences of the outer and/or inner world. Psychedelic-assisted therapy often takes place with a mask covering the subject’s eyes, so the subject experiences all of their “visions” in their mind. But those who have psychedelic experiences in a non-clinical setting, without their eyes covered, tend to experience the outer world, especially nature, as particularly colorful, beautiful, and awe-inspiring.

Pollan presents two possible explanations for what happens when one undergoes a psychedelic experience:

  1. The chemicals act on the brain to trigger activity that produces hallucinatory experiences. Or,
  2. The chemicals open up our perception to real things that we don’t perceive in our normal waking consciousness. 



But, upon reflecting on these two possible explanations, he asks: Does the distinction really matter? When talking about experiences like “oneness with the universe,” how can you distinguish between whether it was a “real” experience or a drug-induced hallucination? Pollan ultimately concludes that **it’s an irrelevant question, because whatever chemical reaction is happening, the insights, revelations, and psychological effects are undoubtedly as real as anything else—and maybe more so.**

> **The Ancient Greek Secret of Dying Before Dying**
> 
> In _The Immortality Key_ , Brian Muraresku makes a connection between the descriptions of modern psychedelic research subjects and those of the Eleusinian Mysteries in ancient Greek literature. The Mysteries were a secret cult practice at the heart of the religious tradition in Greece that existed for almost 2,000 continuous years. According to Muraresku’s research, **in descriptions of the Eleusinian Mysteries, it’s said that the ancient secret was that _one must die before dying_. **Initiates reported undergoing a transformative experience involving a metaphorical death and rebirth and emerged with a sense of their own immortality.
> 
> These descriptions are among Muraresku’s evidence supporting his argument that participants in the Mysteries were consuming psychedelics. The theme of death, rebirth, and immortality resurface often in descriptions of psychedelic experiences, from cultures around the world and throughout history. He also points to ancient Greek sources stating that the ritual wine was a “drug against grief” and a “treatment for misery,” and that without these rituals life would be unlivable. This is consistent with modern-day psychiatric research such as that at Johns Hopkins, which suggests these treatments have great potential for healing psychological trauma and easing end-of-life suffering and fear of death. Muraresku believes **we could be on the verge of rediscovering the secrets that ancient Greeks believed made life worth living.**

#### What Do Psychedelics Do to the Brain?

While research into the neurological effects of psychedelics is young, and researchers haven’t yet pieced it all together, some theorize that the substances may affect the way our brains filter or interpret information. Pollan says this research challenges conventional notions that the experiences are “hallucinations.”

Researchers at Imperial College in London in 2009 looked at brain scans of people undergoing psychedelic experiences with psilocybin. They expected to see _increased_ brain activity, and that was the case for some regions, including those associated with emotions and memories—particularly otherwise subconscious ones. Considering the experiences people describe, this was not surprising. But what _was_ surprising was the**_reduced_ activity in the “default mode network”—a network of brain regions responsible for our sense of self as a distinct individual. **

(Shortform note: Higher connectivity in the default mode network is also seen in depressed and lonely people. This is because these regions are associated with rumination, or mentally fixating on oneself and one’s problems, rather than being fully in the present. Relaxation techniques like mindfulness meditation quiet down this network, and experienced meditators have consistently less active default mode networks.)

This network is also responsible for filtering information from the outside world. Pollan says this filter allows us to operate more efficiently by allowing only the most important pieces of information in at any given time. So, he explains, because this default mode network is suppressed during a psychedelic experience, that means the brain is letting in sensory input that’s normally restricted. We know, for example, that people see colors differently (often perceiving them as brighter) and hear music in a more intense and nuanced way under the influence of psychedelics.

So, Pollan says the brain research suggests that the way we perceive things in the altered state could be the _unfiltered_ reality, while our brains usually act as filters—weeding out all the “unnecessary” information—to simplify our everyday experience. In other words, he says one could argue that**our everyday consciousness is essentially a hallucination in itself—it’s composed only of the information the brain lets in and is processed against our prior experiences.** And Pollan says it’s likely that this one particular mode of consciousness evolved to be our default one because it best allows us to efficiently complete tasks necessary for survival. But he says it’s only one of multiple possible modes of perception.

> **Psychedelics Increase Entropy in the Brain**
> 
> Entropic Brain Theory says that the degree of entropy—or, disorder—in our brains determines how we experience life. While it would seem that a disordered brain would be dysfunctional, this theory says that **many mental health conditions involve too much _rigidity_ in the brain**. It posits that consciousness exists in two forms: a primary mode and a secondary mode. Primary consciousness is associated with an instinctual state, like that of early humans, young children, and those suffering from psychosis. Secondary consciousness is associated with our normal waking consciousness, in which we have a strong sense of self and our brains are filtering out information that’s considered unnecessary.
> 
> Psychedelics shift our brains temporarily into primary consciousness mode. This is why **they can shake people out of the habitual ways of thinking associated with trauma, depression, anxiety, and addiction.** And it’s also why they can also be highly destructive for people with psychotic tendencies or other forms of mental illness that involve disordered states of mind.

#### Pollan Goes on Trips of His Own

In the course of research for this book, Pollan decided to undertake his own personal experimentation with psychedelics. As an American man in his 60s, he’d long been aware of psychedelics but had never tried them. **After interviewing dozens of people, and hearing so many stories of transformation, healing, and realization, Pollan was driven to see if he could also derive some benefit from these substances.** He knew this would be the only way to truly understand the subject. So he confronted his fears and used his connections from this book’s research to arrange some trips for himself.

Pollan’s experiences mirror those described in the research. For example:

  * **Trip #1—Psilocybin mushroom tea:** For his first experiment, Pollan made a relatively mild brew of mushroom tea. This trip was unguided at his home. He describes a heart-opening feeling of being one with nature. 
  * **Trip #2—LSD:** Pollan undertook this trip with a professional guide, who gave him a relatively mild, but significant, dose of LSD. During this experience, he was able to process some deep emotional issues around his loved ones. Afterward, he felt like he’d had several years of therapy in just a few hours.
  * **Trip #3—Psilocybin mushrooms:** In this experiment, Pollan ate a large psilocybin mushroom under the guidance of an experienced healer. He had a calm and serene experience that revealed to him that “there is life after ego death.” In this state, he describes being free from fear, desire, expectation, and judgment. It gave him a sense of reconciliation with death—both his own and that of his loved ones.
  * **Trip #4—“The Toad”:** For his fourth psychedelic experience, Pollan braved one of the most powerful psychoactive agents—a substance called 5-MeO-DMT, which is obtained from the secretion of a toad. Under the guidance of an expert in the substance, he experienced a period of extreme terror and dissolution of self, followed by equally intense bliss and the feeling of being reborn into the world with immense gratitude for his existence. 



Reflecting on his varied psychedelic experiences, one of Pollan’s major revelations was that **our consciousness exists beyond our sense of self.** He realized there is nothing to fear from the loss of one’s ego or sense of separate self, as it was not a frightening experience (apart from the initial fear during the toad experience). He realized that this explains why psychedelic therapy can be so beneficial for patients facing terminal illnesses.

(Shortform note: Psychedelic therapy shows great promise for addressing the fear and depression experienced by terminally ill individuals. By facilitating psychological well-being, promoting meaning-making, and inducing transformative experiences, psychedelics offer a unique avenue for dealing with existential crises. A 2016 study found that psilocybin-assisted therapy led to significant reductions in depression, anxiety, and existential distress in cancer patients, which was sustained at a six-month follow-up. In 2023, however, the only place psilocybin can be legally used for palliative care is in the state of Oregon, which will be implementing training programs for psychedelic facilitators.)

### Part 3: The Social and Cultural Implications of Psychedelics

Pollan explains that, in addition to individual mental health uses, psychedelics have important social and cultural implications for human society—in the past, present, and future. **Psychedelics may have contributed to our cognitive and spiritual evolution and have the potential to better our world.** In this section, we’ll discuss the ways that psychedelics could have helped early hominids to evolve into the self-aware homo sapiens we are today, as well as how these substances could help get us out of some of our modern messes.

(Shortform note: The oldest known evidence of humans using psychedelic mushrooms comes from a cave painting at Tassili N’Ajjer in Algeria, dating from around 7,000 to 9,000 years ago. Known as the Tassili Mushroom Figure, this artwork depicts what scholars believe to be a shaman dancing with hands full of mushrooms. This indicates the use of these mushrooms for ceremonial purposes, providing further evidence that they were likely a psychoactive variety.)

#### The Stoned Ape Theory

One question posed by Pollan, and which other researchers have pondered, is: Why would these plants and fungi evolve with properties that affect the human mind this way? Some researchers believe that**the production of these chemicals by plants and fungi is in service to a symbiotic relationship with humans.** And some researchers even suggest that these altered states of consciousness may have been crucial for humanity’s evolution.

In 1992, ethnobotanist Terence McKenna proposed the “Stoned Ape Theory.” His hypothesis was that **the cognitive development of hominids was due to their consumption of psilocybin mushrooms, which caused an evolutionary leap in consciousness.** The theory suggests that this leap allowed for the development of language, religion, and other forms of symbolic thought—traits that distinguish humans from any other species. Pollan points out, though, that the theory has been contested by other researchers, who argue that there’s no concrete evidence to support it.

The effect of these chemicals on humans could be explainable by arguing that they’re toxins, meant to “poison” predators as a self-defense mechanism. However, Pollan learned from mycologist Paul Stamets that human ingestion of mushrooms actually _helps_ the fungi, as the consumer will eventually eliminate their spores elsewhere. Stamets argues that the **psilocybin is more likely an _attractant_ for hosts rather than a _deterrent_ to predators**. And more than just a reproductive strategy, Stamets believes there’s a higher intelligence on Earth that’s attempting to communicate with us through fungi. He argues that**fungi are intelligent and that they offer their mind-altering properties to us in exchange for our spreading of their spores.**

Although Pollan is skeptical of some of Stamets’s more radical claims, he admits that his own psychedelic experiences have inspired a feeling of a connective consciousness pervading all of nature.

> **Are Psychoactive Compounds Attractants or Repellents?**
> 
> Scholars don’t necessarily agree with Stamets’s hypothesis that fungi developed psychoactive properties to attract humans. Some argue that the psilocybin is meant to deter insect predators. Because these fungi tend to grow in environments with many insects, typically in animal dung and rotting wood,**they may have developed these properties to interfere with the insects’ neurotransmitters.** Scientists have shown that interference with flies’ neurotransmitters in this way decreases their appetite.
> 
> However, even if psychoactive fungi didn’t intentionally co-evolve symbiotically with humans,**there’s scholarly evidence to support the claim thatthey may have facilitated our ancestors’ evolution and survival in several ways**, including:
> 
>   * Helping them cope with challenges and think more flexibly, contributing to creative problem-solving in challenging times
> 
>   * Helping them manage psychological distress and health problems
> 
>   * Improving social interactions and relationships by creating prosocial bonds through the use of psychedelics in ritual
> 
>   * Contributing to the development of music, storytelling, and religion—some of the very traits that make us distinctly human

#### “Depatterning” Could Save the World

During Pollan’s research, he found that many experts involved in studying psychedelics have eventually shifted their emphasis from the treatment of individuals to the potential for the treatment of society as a whole. He explains that this is because**the benefits of psychedelics may contribute to greater empathy, a deeper sense of connection with others, and a reconnection to nature.** On this last point, many argue this could be a key to solving the growing environmental crisis.

(Shortform note: A 2019 study examined the correlation between psychedelic use and “nature relatedness” and found a positive association. They found an increase in nature relatedness after a single psychedelic session that persisted for two years after that use, _and_ noted a “strong relationship” between the amount of lifetime use of psychedelics and nature relatedness.)

As we saw in the 1960s, psychedelics can also be disruptive to society. They can cause a shift in perspective that has the **potential to subvert power structures, undermine established social institutions, and dissolve boundaries—such as those between the body and mind, the spiritual and material, and healer and patient**. But, Pollan asks, are some of those disruptions exactly what we _need_ in society right now? He and other scholars suggest that**the timing of this psychedelic renaissance is no coincidence.**

Ethnobotanist Giorgio Samorini says that psychedelic experiences disrupt our deeply ingrained patterns of thought and allow us to develop new creative ways of thinking. He calls this “depatterning” and says **when societies are in rapid states of change or high-challenge situations, this ability to think in novel ways is crucial for adaptation and survival.** So he concludes that**** psychedelics can be a tool for survival that humans turn to during specific time periods, such as when they’re facing challenges that need out-of-the-box thinking.

Pollan suggests that humanity as a whole is presently facing such a crisis, calling for a widespread depatterning. The enthusiasm around psychedelics in the 1960s may have been the first signs of this call to action. And of course, when there’s any movement toward social change, the established powers will attempt to stop it, to preserve the existing institutions and hierarchies. Pollan explains that we saw this happen with the ban on psychedelics in the 1970s, and we see it with the continued resistance today. This is why Pollan believes we must, as a society, “change our minds” about psychedelics, by making them widely accessible for use in mental health care.

> **Psychedelics Could Help Create a More Just and Equitable World**
> 
> The anthology _Psychedelic Justice: Toward a Diverse and Equitable Psychedelic Culture_ addresses ways that psychedelics might contribute to a more just and equitable world. Essays in the book suggest that social justice advocates today may be unintentionally creating more division by focusing on so many different issues of inequality as though they were separate phenomena. The complexities involved with many intersecting dimensions of inequality in the 21st century may require a novel approach, and the book argues that psychedelics could offer that.
> 
> It hearkens back to the counterculture movement of the 1960s, pointing out that prominent figures in that movement recognized the value of psychedelics as being in the potential to _change minds_. This reinforces the premise that Pollan has embedded in the title of the book: _How to Change Your Mind_.
> 
> So, the collection of essays in this book suggests that **rather than simply trying to fight every systemic issue at the level of policy, we should be confronting the root of the issue: the way people think.** And psychedelics could help to change the attitudes that created the systems of inequality in the first place. This could address issues like sexism, patriarchy, homophobia, and binary thinking that harm individuals.
> 
> The book argues, overall, that we should be working to integrate psychedelics into society as a whole, and it offers some guidance on how to do that while respecting indigenous communities and mitigating the potential risks and dangers.
