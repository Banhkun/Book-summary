## Exercise: Improve Your Interview Process

Most interviews follow the same predictable, often awkward format as they did 40 years ago. They focus on answers to stock questions that donâ€™t tell you whether the person is a team player.

* * *

As a manager, what is your process for interviewing job candidates? What does it tell you about candidates?

How could you change your process to make it more revealing (such as incorporating group interviews or holding part of the interview outside the office)?

What specific questions could you add to your repertoire to help you assess whether a candidate is humble, hungry, and smart? Add your favorites from the previous chapter.
