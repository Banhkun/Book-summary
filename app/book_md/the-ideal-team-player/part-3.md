## Part 3: Applying the Model | Chapter 7: Hiring Team Players

There are four ways to use the ideal team player model to strengthen your organization:

  1. Hiring
  2. Assessing current employees 
  3. Developing employees
  4. Embedding the model in your culture 



**The first way to strengthen teamwork is to make sure everyone you hire is an ideal team player**. There’s no perfect tool for identifying them, but through focused interviewing and reference checking you can usually identify and hire team players.

### The Interview Process

Focus your interview process on asking behavioral questions that uncover the three virtues as well as reveal red flags. There are many guides available for framing behavioral questions. Beyond that, here are a few ways to structure the interview process:

#### Be Specific

**Ask specific questions that uncover whether the candidate has the qualities and behaviors of a team player** (examples to come). Typical interviews follow a generic format and questions that provide only a general sense of the candidate—for instance, you come away thinking, “She seems capable.”

#### Compare Notes

**Debrief managers immediately after an interview on whether the candidate seemed humble, hungry, and smart**. Then use the next interview to ask follow-up questions on concerns or issues raised in the first. For example, if the first two interviewers agree that the candidate is hungry and smart, the third interviewer should focus on assessing humility. In many companies, various managers interview the candidate separately, and they don’t discuss what they learned until the interview process has ended.

#### Incorporate Group Interviews

**Including group interviews in your process allows multiple people on the hiring team to hear the same things and compare their perspectives** —for example, “How did you interpret what he said …” Group interviews also reveal how a candidate behaves in a group, which is a requirement for teamwork. Some people are better one-on-one than they are in groups, which isn’t necessarily a problem, but it’s something you should be aware of.

#### Be Nontraditional

**To get a better sense of a candidate, have someone take her out of the office to see how she acts in an unstructured environment** —for instance, take her along on an errand. Remember to look for indications that she is humble, hungry, and smart.

In contrast, most interviews follow the same predictable, often awkward format as they did 40 years ago. They focus on answers to stock questions that don’t tell you whether the person is a good fit for the company.

#### Repeat Questions

The first time you ask a question, you often get a generic answer. If you ask again in a different way, you may get more details or a different answer. **If you ask a third time, but you’re more pointed, you may get the most honest response.**

#### Ask What Others Would Say

Ask candidates what others would say about them—for instance, **instead of asking someone if he considers himself a hard worker, ask how colleagues would describe his work ethic or his level of humility**. Candidates tend to give more honest answers to questions framed this way, perhaps because they think you might ask their colleagues the same question and compare answers.

#### Pay Attention to Hunches

If you have a hunch that a candidate isn’t humble, hungry, or smart, **keep digging until you resolve your doubt**. Looking back on an interview, managers often recall red flags and regret ignoring them or not exploring them more fully.

#### Be Clear About Your Commitment

At the end of the interview process, **tell candidates that you’re looking only for people who are humble, hungry, smart**. Stress that if a candidate lacking one of these critical qualities is hired, they’ll be miserable working for you if they don’t change. However, if they’re an ideal team player, they’ll love the job and the company’s culture. People often try to gloss over their weaknesses in an interview, but they may be less likely to do so if you stress that your company holds people accountable.

### Interview Questions

Here are some sample interview questions for assessing each team player virtue.

#### Humble

  * “Describe your most important career accomplishments.” 
    * Look for use of the word “we” more than “I.”
  * “What was your biggest failure?” 
    * Humble people don’t hesitate to answer because they know they’re not perfect. They take responsibility and learn from failure.
  * **“What’s your biggest weakness?”** This is a cliche question, but it can be revealing. Candidates who spin weaknesses as strengths may be afraid to acknowledge shortcomings. Counter this by asking people what they’d like to change about themselves.



#### Hungry

  * “Describe a time when you worked really hard on something.” Look for passion and excitement for the project, rather than complaints about workload.
  * “What do you like to do outside of your job?” A long list of outside interests might indicate the person will put those interests ahead of team interests or be reluctant to step up and do extra work at key times.
  * “What work did you do as a teenager?” A work ethic forms early in life.
  * “What hours do you usually work?” Highly motivated people don’t usually limit their hours to 9 to 5. Emphasizing predictable hours or “balance” may suggest a candidate lacks drive, although this isn’t always the case.



#### Smart

Observing a person’s behavior in different situations is a better way to gauge interpersonal skills than asking questions—for instance, noticing how she deals with waiters, receptionists, and potential coworkers. However, questions like the following can add information:

  * “How would you describe your personality?” The person should be introspective and the description should jibe with your observations. If he has trouble answering the question, he might lack self-awareness and therefore be bad at dealing with people. 
  * “What kind of people bother you the most and how do you respond to them?” Look for a willingness to work constructively with others.
  * “Would others describe you as empathic?” Or, “Can you give an example of when you showed empathy at work?” The answer should indicate an awareness of and concern for others’ feelings.



#### Ask Yourself

After the interview, ask yourself whether you’d want to work with the person every day. People with strong interpersonal skills obviously are easy and fun to work with. This question doesn’t fully address whether the person is humble or hungry, but it tells you your gut feeling about them.

### Candidate References

Reference checks that merely verify employment aren’t usually useful. But if a reference seems willing to go beyond rote answers, you may get valuable information, especially concerning hunches. Here are some things to keep in mind:

  * **Put people at ease** by assuring them that their answers won’t be your determining factor. References tend to be overly positive or cautious when they feel their answers will make or break a candidate. Describe your company culture and stress that you’re just trying to determine whether the candidate would be a good fit—and whether both she and the company would benefit from the hire.
  * **Seek specifics** : Besides the typical approach of asking for adjectives describing the candidate, ask for examples of specific behaviors, or how the candidate acted in certain situations. Adapt some of your interview questions and see how the reference’s responses compare with the candidate’s.
  * **Focus on qualities you have doubts about** or are unsure of. Again, try to get specific examples of behavior.
  * **Ask what others would say** about the candidate’s humility, hunger, and people skills. Ask the same questions you asked the candidate for comparison purposes. This gives references a chance to offer valuable information without being the one to personally bring up something negative about the candidate.
  * **Note when references don’t respond**. Most people who have something positive to say don't hesitate to do so; a failure to respond may indicate a problem (although this isn’t always the case).
