## Part 1: The Fable | Chapter 1: Learning the Ropes

Bob Shanley, founder and owner of Valley Builders, a large Napa Valley construction firm, was approaching retirement and looking for someone to take over his business. His nephew, Jeff Shanley, who’d spent two decades in marketing in Silicon Valley, was looking for a new challenge.

None of Bob’s siblings or children was involved in or interested in running the 200-employee company. Meanwhile, Jeff had done some successful consulting work with Valley Builders’ executive team—he and Bob liked and respected each other. So Bob agreed to train his nephew as his successor. Jeff, his wife Maurine, and their children moved to Napa Valley, and Jeff focused on learning the construction business.

Jeff’s education in the construction business was short-circuited, however, when Bob developed heart problems; he needed immediate surgery and had to step down. Jeff suddenly found himself becoming the new CEO.

Adding to Jeff’s challenges, Valley Builders had just landed two large projects—a hospital and a hotel. The company had done projects like these before, but it had never done two major projects at the same time. Bob assured Jeff they had the capability—they just needed to significantly increase staff.

Valley Builders’ top executives, besides Bob, were Clare Massick, head of administration, finance, legal, and HR; and Bobby Brady, vice president of field operations. Jeff had a frank discussion with them. While they acknowledged concerns about Jeff’s inexperience, they felt he was trustworthy and, as a Shanley, would be personally invested in the company’s success. Further, Bobby said he liked the fact that Jeff listened and wasn’t a “jackass” to work with. They agreed to work as a team.

### Challenges

The biggest issue immediately facing the company was labor. For the new hospital and hotel projects, they’d need to add 60 people in the next two months. In addition, progress was stalling on the Oak Ridge building site, a problematic shopping center project that Valley Builders was trying to finish.

Feeling the pressure, Jeff talked one evening with his wife Maurine, who expressed confidence that Jeff could handle the challenges. Still, Jeff worried that the job could affect his relationship with his family if he screwed it up. Maurine advised him to just tackle one issue at a time.

Jeff learned more from Clare and Bobby about their staffing issues. The company had been experiencing significant turnover (33%) on its projects, so Bobby advised that they hire 80 people to get 60, since 20 would likely quit.

They’d be able to fill the lower-level jobs without a problem, Clare said, but finding a manager for the hospital project and three foremen would be more difficult—they’d lost two foremen a few months ago, so they were already behind. The foremen had quit because one of the two managers for the Oak Ridge project, Nancy Morris, was difficult to get along with and allowed problems to fester.

As the founder of Valley Builders, Bob had always stressed teamwork (he’d hired Jeff in the past to do teamwork training with his executives), but the concept hadn’t been pushed beyond the management team. So the company was being hamstrung by morale and turnover problems.

In fact, when Jeff questioned Clare and Bobby, he realized they couldn’t define what teamwork meant at Valley Builders or how they knew whether potential hires would be team players.

The only criterion seemed to be the one Bobby had used in describing Jeff: they tried to avoid hiring “jackasses” that others wouldn’t like working with. They couldn’t define jackass, however, and acknowledged they had relied on Bob’s intuition for who would be a good fit for the company.

Jeff knew he had a lot to learn about construction, but he was clear on one thing: **they needed to only hire team players. Also, they had to find out how many non-team players they had working for them** and get them to change or leave. Otherwise, they wouldn’t complete the hospital and hotel projects—or even keep Valley Builders in business in the long term.
