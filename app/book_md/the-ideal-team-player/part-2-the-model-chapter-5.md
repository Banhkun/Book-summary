## Part 2: The Model | Chapter 5: The Three Virtues of a Team Player

This section of the book further explains the ideal team player model and how to use it in your organization.

In the book _Good to Great_ , author Jim Collins writes that successful companies prioritize hiring the “right” people—those who fit the company’s culture. (Shortform note: Read our summary of Good to Great here.) But instead, many leaders hire for skills and competence.

### Defining the Three Virtues

For organizations committed to a teamwork culture, the right people are ideal team players who are humble, hungry, and smart.

#### 1) Humble

**Great team players focus on the success of the team rather than personal interests.** They**** lack overbearing egos or an obsession with status. They don’t try to get attention and readily give credit to others.

Humility is the most important team player attribute, yet many managers put up with self-centered people because of their skills, and don’t call out their arrogance even though it undermines the team’s performance.

There are **two kinds of non-humble people** , who seem different but who have a common underlying issue: insecurity.

1) **Arrogant, ego-driven people who try to make themselves the center of attention**. They are less confident than they appear, so they try to overcompensate with bluster. They undermine teamwork by stirring resentment, creating division, and playing politics.

2) **People who lack self-confidence and downplay their contributions and abilities**. Others may see them as humble because they’re self-effacing, but people who are truly humble neither overrate nor underrate themselves. People with low self-worth deprive teams of their ideas and insights.

#### 2) Hungry

**People who are hungry are driven to seek more work and responsibility.** They’re always looking ahead to the next step or opportunity. They’re committed to the work and willing to go above and beyond—for instance, working outside regular hours—when necessary. Managers don’t have to push or monitor them because they’re self-motivated and conscientious.

Nonetheless, some types of hunger can be negative. **Some highly motivated people are driven by self-interest rather than a desire to support the team’s mission**. Their interests may conflict with the team’s. Or, work can become all-consuming and become a person’s identity and life.

A lack of hunger or drive on someone’s part is usually obvious because they produce less, which creates frustrations among other team members who have to pick up the slack. So leaders have to spend time pushing and monitoring them.

#### 3) Smart

Being smart in a team context doesn’t refer to intelligence but to having common sense when it comes to dealing with people. **Those with people skills understand where others are coming from**. They ask questions and listen attentively. They are aware of group dynamics and of the impact of their words and actions on others, and they act appropriately.

**Some smart people can be dangerous when they use interpersonal skills to manipulate or mislead others for their own purposes**. So it’s important for hiring managers to look beyond what candidates say and take note of how they behave around others.

#### The Three Virtues Together

The three virtues may seem simple in and of themselves, but their combination in a team player makes that person unique and uniquely effective. **If a team member is substantially lacking in even one area, they can hold back or detail the team**.

The three virtues aren’t inherent or permanent characteristics. They’re developed through work and life experiences, choices, training, and coaching.
