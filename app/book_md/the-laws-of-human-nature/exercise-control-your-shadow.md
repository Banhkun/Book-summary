## Exercise: Control Your Shadow

There are four strategies to control your Shadow: Describe it, redirect it, channel it into creativity, and occasionally release it.

* * *

Describe your Shadow. (Consider what you’re sensitive about, what you project, what other people have said about you, and so on.)

How could you direct your Shadow qualities towards something productive? (For example, if you’re aggressive, you might do well in a competitive sport.)

What’s something you’re repressing so hard you don’t even let yourself think about it? Try thinking about it for a moment. What new ideas does it generate?

Where and how could you safely release your Shadow? (For example, you might be more assertive when asking for a raise.)
