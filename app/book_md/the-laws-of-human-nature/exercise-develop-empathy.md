## Exercise: Develop Empathy

There are four skills associated with being empathetic: changing your attitude, mirroring, analyzing, and seeking feedback.

* * *

Think of someone you’d like to better empathize with. What’s your attitude towards her currently? What could you do to change your attitude? (For example, you might try giving her the benefit of the doubt.)

What nonverbal cues does this person give off? (For example, she might tense her neck and shoulders.) Try doing the nonverbal cue right now. What emotions does it make you feel?

How could you learn more about this person so you could analyze her? (For example, you might ask her about her childhood.)

How might you get feedback on your execution of the above three skills? (For example, you might reflect on whether or not your rapport is improving.)
