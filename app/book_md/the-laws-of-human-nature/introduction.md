## Introduction

In _The Laws of Human Nature_ , author Robert Greene lays out 16 laws that will help us understand and predict the behavior of ourselves and others. **Typically, we have no idea why anyone (including ourselves) does anything, and if it even occurs to us to wonder about motivations, we tend to come up with simple explanations,** such as “they were drunk.”

This is because **our feelings and actions aren’t nearly as conscious as we’d like to think.** In the earliest times, organisms evolved to sense danger and respond instinctively, with no cognitive delay. Later, in some organisms, this sensing of danger developed into the emotion fear. Fear served the same purpose of arousing and alerting animals to danger but gave them a few seconds to _choose_ a response. Eventually, in social animals, fear developed into more complicated emotions and emotions became a form of communication. (For example, hissing showed anger.) Finally, humans developed the ability to think and use language.

This process of evolution resulted in the creation of three different parts of the human brain:

  1. Reptilian, which is responsible for instincts and automatic responses.
  2. Limbic/mammalian, which is responsible for emotion.
  3. Neocortex, which is responsible for thinking and language.



Because **emotions and thinking are controlled by different parts of the brain, we can’t consciously access the source of an emotion or mood; all we can do is feel the mood and then try to express it with language or action.** Emotion doesn't translate very well into language, so often we mistranslate, oversimply, or are confused. This is why it’s so hard to learn from emotions and change our behavior. (Animals don’t have this problem because they never need to go from emotion to language.)

Human nature is a complex mix of evolutionary, genetic, and developmental factors that we’re rarely aware of. **In fact, our emotions, thoughts, and behavior are _responses_ , not drivers.** For example, when we get angry, we might think it’s because someone just cut us off in traffic, but it could actually be because of something in our childhood that the cut-off reminded us of.

If, however, we can look deeper at human nature, we can learn to:

  1. **Stop taking things personally.** Whenever we’re in the presence of others, we tend to worry about what they think of us. Because emotions were originally related to communication, when they’re directed at us, whether or not we’re the source, we tend to take them personally. For example, if you’re angry about missing your bus, the people you encounter don’t have this background and think you’re angry at them. However, once we learn the laws, we’ll realize that most people aren’t actually that interested in us. When they get angry or judgmental, it’s usually not because we offended them; we just crossed their path at the wrong moment. 
  2. **Manage toxic types.** The laws will help us interpret people’s non-verbal cues and behavior patterns to see what kind of dangerous thoughts and feelings they might be hiding. This will help us identify and avoid bad apples before they get dangerously close to us.
  3. **Control our own nature.** The laws will help us understand our characters, our repressions, our patterns, and other elements of self that we might want to improve or change.
  4. **Make us more empathetic.** The laws will help us form stronger connections with other people.
  5. **Make people like us.** The laws will help use lower people’s resistance, encourage them to think and feel the same way we do, and make us likable.



This summary is divided into five parts, one for each of the following overarching elements of human nature: self-images, the hiding of feelings, group behavior, self-sabotage, and our desire for the wrong things.

(Shortform note: _The Laws of Human Nature_ contains 18 laws. We’ve rearranged and combined some of the laws (Laws 3 and 9, and Laws 13 and 15) for conciseness and clarity.)
