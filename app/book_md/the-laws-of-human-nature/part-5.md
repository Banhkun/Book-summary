## Part 5: People Want the Wrong Things | Law #15: People Want What They Don’t Have

In this last set of laws, we’ll study our inability to want what’s actually good for us. Armed with this knowledge, we’ll be able to control our own nature and make people like us.

### The Grass-Is-Greener Syndrome

By nature, people are unable to be content with their current situation. **As soon as we get something we want, we want something else, a phenomenon that’s known as the grass-is-always-greener syndrome.** And even though getting what we want is never satisfying, we still pursue our next want, hoping that one will make us happy. Desire motivates us, not possession.

  * For example, many people search for the perfect romantic partner. However, no one’s perfect, so always searching for someone new isn’t going to bring satisfaction. 



**The farther away or more difficult our want, the more we want it** —people want things that are taboo and elusive. For example, older adults who have a lot of distance from their childhoods often wish they could be kids again, which is impossible.

The grass-is-greener syndrome is wired into the human brain and comes from three sources:

  1. **Survival instinct.** By nature, the brain considers the worst possible outcome of any situation because if people were content with their surroundings, they might not have noticed dangers.
  2. **Imagination.** Our mental conjurings don’t feel that different from reality. Studies have found that when we imagine an experience, our brain reacts almost the same way that it would if we were actually having that experience. As a result, when we imagine getting something we covet, it’s almost as pleasing as if we actually get it.
  3. **Induction.** This is using contrast in order to understand something. When presented with something, the brain always conjures up the opposite to amplify our perception of the original. (For example, when we see a red object, we sometimes see a green halo around it, because green is the opposite of red.) This means that whenever something is taboo or forbidden, the taboo itself makes us realize what we’re lacking.
     * For example, the pornography industry didn’t flourish until it was outlawed. 



**Even though the grass-is-always-greener syndrome will always exist, people don’t always take advantage of it.** For example, advertisements are heavy-handed, and politicians might be good at riling us up in the moment, but none of this is persuasive in the long term because it doesn’t present a future.

In this law, we’ll first look at how to control our own nature. Then, we’ll look at how to make people like us.

### Control Your Own Nature: Escape This Law’s Thrall

**To avoid being enthralled by this law, reflect on what you sincerely want and like** so that when you do feel pulled towards something, you can tell if it’s because you actually want it or if it’s because someone or something (such as the grass-is-green syndrome) is influencing you.

Additionally, **you can redirect this law to motivate yourself. A feeling of dissatisfaction can spur you** out of the complacency you develop as you age.

Finally, you can escape this law by channeling your syndrome into coveting a deeper connection with what you already have:

  * **People.** You can never know everything about another person. Consider what depths your friends and family have.
  * **Location**. Your physical location has a long history you’re probably unaware of. 
  * **Yourself.** You’ll never fully know yourself.
  * **Work.** Your work will have lots of challenges, opportunities, and unknowns.



### Make People Like You: Become Desirable

Now that we know how to escape this law, we can learn to use it on others. When we want people to like us or our work, we often reveal everything about it, leaving no room for imagination. **We might think we’re being honest, but in fact, we’re being lazy and self-absorbed. It’s easy to be ourselves because it requires no effort.**

To make yourself or your work desirable, **instead of defaulting to honesty, imagine what other people want.** If you can figure out how they see you and your creations, this will let you create an image that’s imaginative, fantastic, and alluring.

There are three strategies to making yourself or your products desirable:

**Strategy #1: Be strategically absent.** If people see you regularly, they’ll understand you and what you want, and this will make them lose interest. There are a few ways to be absent:

  * **Be slightly cold.** Act as if you don’t like others, which implies that you respect yourself. This will make others value and chase you.
  * **Be vague about yourself,** and create mystery. Never say exactly what you want, think, or like. That way, people can project whatever they want and use their imaginations. 
    * For example, Michael Jackon never talked about what his songs meant in interviews and never confirmed or denied rumors about himself.
  * **Physically stay away from others.** This makes others miss you and think about you when you’re gone. 
    * For example, Jackson carefully scheduled his performances and interviews so he was always available less than people wanted him to be.



**Strategy #2: Create the impression that others want you or your work.** People want things that other people want and fear missing out, so if you can make yourself appear desirable to some people, others will start to find you desirable as well. There are a few ways to do this:

  * **Release stories (subtly) about how people have admired you in the past.** Stay out of the conversation yourself to maintain your air of mystery.
    * (Shortform example: Ask a friend to tell someone a positive story about you while you’re absent.) 
  * In negotiations for your services, **create the impression that people will have to compete for you** by bringing in many potential buyers.
  * If you’re selling a product, **get your work into the public eye by spreading rumors, giving out samples, getting important people to talk about it, or even encouraging piracy.** Negative publicity can be more effective than positive publicity since people are attracted to transgression. 



**Strategy #3: Associate your work or yourself with something transgressive or unconventional to harness induction.** Today’s world full of constraints—everyone’s every move in the digital sphere is monitored—and people want things that aren’t allowed. Here are some options:

  * **Use generational conflict.** As we learned in Law #9: People Are Influenced by Their Generation, generations have built-in conflict between them, and the younger generation tends to like things the older generation condemns.
    * For example, John F. Kennedy positioned himself as young and vigorous, which was in opposition to the conformity of the Eisenhower era.
  * **Use voyeurism.** Almost everyone wants to breach other people’s privacy and learn secrets. You can create secrets about yourself or about other powerful people.
  * **Offer the impossible.** Position your work as a tool that people can use to achieve, or at least pursue, their fantasies.



**You need to constantly use these strategies because as soon as people get what they want, they’ll want something else,** so you need to constantly keep yourself and your work out of reach.

> **Extended Example: Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel**
> 
> Gabrielle (Coco) Chanel spent most of her early life coveting what she didn’t have and then being disappointed when she got it. Later, she learned how to use this phenomenon to make people covet _her_.
> 
> Growing up in a convent, **Coco secretly read romance novels and dreamed of being rescued by a prince. After leaving the convent, she became a courtesan for a man named Balsan and lived in a chateau, but even though she’d gotten what she wanted, she still wasn’t happy**. She felt restless and envied the more high-class or beautiful courtesans. She tried seducing other people’s boyfriends or husbands, but even when she was successful, she wasn’t satisfied.
> 
> One day, she stole some of Balsan’s clothes and mixed and matched them with her own. The other courtesans were envious of her androgynous, transgressive style and Balsan found the outfit so charming he got his tailor to make one of her designs. Now, people coveted Coco and she became a successful fashion designer.
> 
> To maintain her and her fashions’ desirability, she used these strategies:
> 
>   * She created an air of mystery around her perfume by making it smell like a bouquet rather than a single flower so no one could tell exactly what it smelled like. She sprayed it in her store but pretended she didn’t know what it was when shoppers asked. She also slipped unlabelled bottles into her most prominent clients’ bags.
> 
>   * She harnessed transgression by including masculine elements in her designs for women’s clothes. This made the wearers feel like they were breaking out of gender conventions.
> 
>   * She let photographers into her shows and let seamstresses make sketches of her work, encouraging piracy because it would put her work into the public eye.
