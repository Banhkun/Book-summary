## Exercise: Gain Power in Groups

There are three ways to gain power in groups: Flatter the leader, be useful, and manage other group members.

* * *

Think of a group you belong to that you’d like more power in. How might you flatter the leader? (For example, what are they insecure or uncertain about that you could praise them for?)

How could you make yourself useful (but not threateningly useful) to the leader? (For example, you might offer to take over a task that they don’t like doing.)

Think of a member of the group you’d like to get on your side. How might you make her like you? (For example, you might listen to her or give her credit.)
