## Exercise: Plan Your Potty Training

Reflect on your plans for approaching potty training.

* * *

Has your child signaled that they’re ready for potty training? If not, do you think they’re ready? Explain your answer.

How can you apply Glowacki’s three C’s to potty training your child? Provide one method each for keeping your training clear, consistent, and confident. (For example: You might list specific moments in the day when you should prompt toilet use, so you keep potty training consistent.)
