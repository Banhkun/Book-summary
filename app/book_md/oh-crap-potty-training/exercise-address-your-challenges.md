## Exercise: Address Your Challenges

Make a list of potty training challenges your child is facing or might face, and try to understand why.

* * *

Has your child encountered any of Glowacki’s listed challenges? Or, if they haven’t started potty training yet, are there any challenges you’re particularly worried about?

When does your child encounter this obstacle in particular? Why do you think it’s a challenge for them? (For example: If your child is making a genuine attempt to poop but cannot, they might have constipation.)

Based on your answer to the question above, identify how you might ease this difficulty for your child.
