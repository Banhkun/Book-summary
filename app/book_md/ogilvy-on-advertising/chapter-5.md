## Chapter 5: TV and Radio Advertising

Like print, TV and radio ads are effective for advertising to both consumers and businesses. (Many businesspeople watch sports and news.)

There are two specific things to keep in mind when advertising to businesses on TV:

  1. If the product is too complicated to explain in 30 seconds, make a longer commercial and air it less frequently.
     * For example, one IBM computer ad was three minutes long.
  2. Inexpensive commercials can be just as effective as expensive ones.



### TV Advertising

In this section, we’ll first look at some effective and ineffective types of commercials before moving on to tips. There are two ways to measure effectiveness—Ogilvy uses the first because it’s more accurate:

**1\. Changes in brand preference**(which brand someone chooses to buy). Ads that make people change their brand preference increase sales three times more than those that don’t.

**2\. Recall**(how well someone remembers an ad). Most advertisers test for recall, but this measure has several flaws:

  * Recall doesn’t affect brand preference or sales—people can remember ads but still choose not to buy a product.
  * Copywriters can influence recall scores. For example, showing something outlandish, like a gorilla in a jockstrap, will probably make people remember the ad, but it may not encourage them to buy the product.
  * Recall tests are better at measuring people’s ability to _articulate_ their memories than measuring what they _actually_ remember.



#### Effective Commercials

Ten types of commercials are more effective than average at changing brand preference:

**Type #1: *Funny commercials.** In the past, humor didn’t sell because people were more interested in what benefits they could get from a product, but at the time of writing, as long as humor supported the product’s promise, it was becoming effective. However, it’s very hard to write funny commercials, and botched attempts are so clumsy that if you’re not an expert, you shouldn’t try.

**Type #2: “Slice of life.”** In these commercials, two actors argue about a product, and by the end of the commercial, one has convinced the other that the product has merit. Slices of life are common and often cheesy, but they work.

**Type #3: Testimonials.** In these commercials, someone talks about how good your product is or how it has changed their life. The best testimonials are given by consumers who don’t know they’re being filmed, and you can encourage a vehement response by asking your actor to criticize your product.

  * For example, in one Shell commercial, an announcer explains that an actor is going to discourage customers from buying Super Shell. Then, the actor bad-mouths Super Shell to a customer named Mrs. Longo. He says that she probably gets bad mileage, and she counters that she gets great mileage.



**Type #4: *Demonstrations.** These commercials show how well your product works. (Note: If you want to demonstrate that your product is better than competitors’, that’s fine, but don’t name their brands. People are less likely to believe your ad and more likely to be confused about which company the ad is actually for.)

  * For example, in a commercial for paperboard, International Paper built a canyon bridge out of paperboard and drove a truck over it. This demonstrated how strong the board was.



**Type #5: Problem-solve.** These commercials show a problem and how your product will fix it.

  * For example, in a commercial for Train matches, a man tries to strike “regular” matches in a humid climate and they don’t catch. Then, his wife gives him Train matches, and they strike perfectly.



**Type #6: “Talking heads.”** In these commercials, an announcer talks about how wonderful a product is. This type of commercial is especially good for introducing new products and while adpeople think they’re uncreative, they work.

**Type #7: Unusual characters.** Characters are recognizable people who symbolize your product.

  * For example, the baker “Titus Moody” was once a recognizable character in Pepperidge Farm commercials.



**Type #8: Fact-based.** These commercials objectively explain the benefits of a product.

  * For example, Maxim Instant Coffee used a fact-based commercial to explain that their coffee was excellent because it was freeze-dried. Freeze-drying intrigued many people.



**Type #9: *News.** These commercials share new or updated information, such as the release of a new product, or an update of an old one.

**Type #10: Sentimentality.** These commercials use charm and nostalgia and are especially effective for products that aren’t unique. However, they must be accompanied by a reason why a viewer should let their emotions make a decision.

  * For example, one beer commercial talked about brewing in the traditional way and showed images of a traditional ranching lifestyle to create a positive feeling of nostalgia.



#### Ineffective Commercials

Three types of commercials are below average when it comes to causing people to change brands:

**Type #1: Celebrity endorsements.** In these commercials, celebrities talk about why they like products. These are ineffective for two reasons: 1) people remember the celebrity, not the product, and 2) people suspect that the celebrity has been paid to say nice things about a product, so they may not be objective.

  * For example, when Ogilvy hired Eleanor Roosevelt to make a margarine commercial for $35,000, the public sent mail telling her she’d damaged her reputation. 



**Type #2: Cartoons.** While animated commercials can work on children, they’re ineffective on adults because they’re less attention-grabbing and convincing than real people.

  * For example, a fabric-softener company ran two commercials, one that was animated and one that used live-action. The live-action one increased sales while the cartoon one had no effect.



**Type #3: Vignettes accompanied by music.** These might be visually entertaining, but they don’t sell.

#### Fifteen Tips for Creating Effective Commercials

In addition to choosing an effective structure and format for your commercials, you can improve their reach and pull using the following tips:

**Tip #1: Emphasize your brand’s name.** It’s very possible (and common) for people to remember commercials but not what they were for. Often, they even think the commercial was for a competing brand. To emphasize your brand’s name:

  * Mention it within the first 10 seconds of the commercial and repeat it. For example, one approximately five-and-a-half-minute commercial mentioned the brand name 20 times.
  * Spell the brand’s name. For example, in a commercial for Cresta Blanca, a blind pianist spelled out the name as he played.



**Tip #2: Show the package on-screen.** At the end of the commercial, show the product.

**Tip #3: In food commercials, make the food look appetizing.** You can do this by showing food in motion (for example, pouring syrup over waffles) or using close-ups.

**Tip #4: Start strong.** Show something exciting in the very first frame to grab people’s attention.

  * For example, if the commercial is for fire extinguishers, the first frame might show fire.



**Tip #5: Music isn’t necessary.** Background music has no measurable effect on changing brand preference, and while some consumers like jingles, research shows that they’re below average in effectiveness. If you do choose to use a jingle (perhaps you have nothing to say about your product), test it on people to make sure the enunciation is clear enough to understand.

**Tip #6: Use sound effects.** These increase effectiveness.

  * For example, a Maxwell House commercial that used percolating sound effects was so successful it ran for five years.



**Tip #7: Avoid voiceovers.** People stay more engaged if actors talk on camera.

**Tip #8: Use supers**(text overlaid on the video). This reiterates your message. Make sure that the titling matches the soundtrack word-for-word.

**Tip #9: Use images that stand out.** Happy families and sunsets are overused, and people are exposed to so many commercials that if they don’t see something fresh, they’ll just tune it out.

  * For example, one Merrill Lynch commercial featured a novel scene—a herd of bulls charging at the camera.



**Tip #10: Don’t change scenes too often.** This can confuse viewers.

**Tip #11: Use a motif.** Repeat an image in multiple commercials to associate it with your brand. This will help people remember your commercials, brand, and promise.

  * For example, in Shell commercials, cars drove through paper barriers.



**Tip #12: Show someone using the product** , and ideally, the results that product will produce.

  * (Shortform example: If you’re selling vacuums, show how well they clean up a mess.)



**Tip #13: Use your imagination.** You can do almost anything on TV because of special effects, so think big.

**Tip #14: Be clear.** One study of 25 commercials found that none of them was understood by more than 81% of viewers. Make sure your commercial says what you think it does.

**Tip #15: Reduce costs by cutting actors, unnecessary complications, and things that won’t be visible to the audience.** While Ogilvy didn’t conduct any research on costs, he believes that the more money that’s spent on commercials, the less powerful they are.

  * Example #1: Cutting an actor will save between $350-$10,000.
  * (Shortform Example #2: If a table isn’t quite right for a scene, don’t spend money on a new one—cover it with a tablecloth so it won’t be visible to the audience.)



### Radio Advertising

At the time of the book’s publication, 6% of U.S. advertising was via radio, and there was no way to measure the effectiveness of radio commercials. Ogilvy offers the following five tips from a pilot study and his observations:

  1. Make people listen and pay attention by being surprising, funny, or charming.
  2. Talk to the audience as if you were having a conversation in person.
  3. Mention the brand name and what the brand will do early in the commercial.
  4. Repeat the brand name and the promise throughout the commercial.
  5. Make multiple commercials because people typically listen to the radio for long periods and get annoyed when they hear the same thing over and over.
