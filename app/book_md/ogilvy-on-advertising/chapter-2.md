## Chapter 2: Research

Now that we know the basics of marketing, we’ll look at using research to check if we’ve successfully applied them. We’ll also use this research to inform our advertising in Part 2.

### Factors to Research

There are two things research _can’t_ tell you, so you’ll have to use your judgment:

  1. How to price your product. (At the time of writing, marketers just picked numbers and hoped they worked.)
  2. Which campaigns will be most effective in the long term.



However, when it comes to other factors, research can tell you a lot:

#### Product Factors

**Factor #1: Product development**. Studying your competitors’ test markets, profit margin, and cost of goods can tell you what kinds of products do well.

**Factor #2: Early consumer feedback.** Research can tell you what people think of a product before you manufacture it. If there’s little interest, you can abandon the project before investing too much money into it.

**Factor #3: Product quality.** Once your product is available for sale, research can tell you what consumers think of it compared to the competitor’s products. If they don’t like your product best, you can ask your R&D to improve it.

**Factor #4: Important features.** Research will tell you what people consider when deciding whether or not to buy your product.

**Factor #5: Extras.** Research can predict which smells, colors, flavors, and recipes will be most popular.

**Factor #6: Packaging.** Research will tell you which package designs are likely to attract the most attention. Additionally, it can tell you if your package is so hard to open that it discourages people from buying it.

**Factor #7: Vocabulary.** Research can find out what vocabulary people use when talking about products in your category.

**Factor #8: Line extension.** Research will tell you what additional products might do well under the same brand name.

  * For example, after Dove became a successful body soap, Lever Brothers considered what else they might associate the brand name with. Their research accurately discovered that dish soap was most likely to be successful.



**Factor #9: Fall from grace.** Research can alert you when customers lose interest in your product.

  * For example, if you change an ingredient and public opinion of your product drops, research will alert you.



#### Company Factors

**Factor #1: Reputation.** Research will tell you what consumers, politicians, media, and groups think of your company.

#### Economic Factors

**Factor #1: Projected sales and advertising expenses.** Mathematical models can tell you how much you’ll need to spend on advertising to make the most profit.

**Factor #2: Premiums**. Research will tell you which premiums (promotional items) people prefer.

  * For example, Shell considered 35 different premiums, and their research revealed that steak knives would be most popular. 



#### Advertising Factors

Some adpeople dislike research because they think it stifles creativity. Ogilvy, on the other hand, found that it inspired good ideas and legitimized the most outlandish ones.

  * For example, when Ogilvy wanted to write headlines that advertised France in French, everyone thought this would be a disaster, but research showed that it would be effective.



Here are the advertising factors to consider researching:

**Factor #1: Promise.** Promise is what people most want your product to help them achieve. It’s one of the most important parts of advertising, and Ogilvy believes determining it is the most valuable contribution research can make. You can research promise in two ways:

  1. In a survey, show consumers a list of promises for new products and ask which they think are most important and unique.
  2. Use a split-run test: Write two ads with two different promises. At the end of both, offer a free sample. Run the ad somewhere that allows you to show one ad to half the circulation and the other ad to the other half. Whichever promise results in more requests for free samples is the more effective one.



**Factor #2: Target audience.** Research can tell you if you’ve successfully predicted who will be most interested in your product.

**Factor #3: Clarity.** Research will tell you if your ads are saying what you think they are.

**Factor #4: Readership and recall.** Research will tell you what parts of your ads people read and remember.

**Factor #5: Expiration.** Research will tell you when consumers are tired of hearing about a particular theme.

  * For example, for five years, Shell advertised good mileage. When research indicated people were no longer interested in mileage, Shell switched to giving testimonials.



### Using Research

**Research not only helps you create good marketing and advertising—it can also help you win arguments.** For example, when Ogilvy was working with British Travel, the chairman wanted to feature trout fishing in a tourism ad. Ogilvy got him to change his mind by showing him research that had determined American tourists weren’t interested in trout fishing in the slightest.

Sometimes, however, **people can be resistant to research, particularly if they don’t like what it says.** (For example, one of Ogilvy’s clients spent $600,000 developing a product before having research done. Research revealed that the target audience wasn’t interested. The client called Ogilvy a “dry hole” and left the meeting). You can make research look more official and weighty by involving a graphic designer and printing a hard copy of the report rather than sending a typewritten memo listing the findings.

Finally, **sometimes research falls victim to confirmation bias—people only pay attention to the research that supports their existing position.**

### Effective Surveying

Much marketing and advertising research comes from surveying, and there are three things to keep in mind to get accurate results:

#### Consideration #1: Sample Sizes

**In some cases, small samples and ballpark findings are all you need.** (Shortform example: If you want to know how many people understand the word “pyrrhic,” if the first five people you ask don’t, you’ve got your answer—you don’t need anything statistically significant to determine that you should choose a more common word.)

**In other cases, particularly for trends, you do need large samples, strict methodology, and statistically significant results.**

#### Consideration #2: Dishonesty

Some interviewers don’t like talking to strangers and instead fill out the surveys themselves. Other times, **respondents lie to interviewers.** To manage the second problem:

1\. Ask a potential interviewee a question to judge their honesty.

  * For example, Ogilvy always asked people what they’d rather hear on the radio, a Shakespeare play or Jack Benny. Anyone who answered Shakespeare wasn’t interviewed because she was likely a liar.



2\. Frame the question in a way that doesn’t prompt a particular response.

  * For example, when _Gone With the Wind_ became a bestselling book, it was difficult to find out how many people had read it because almost everyone who was asked said yes because it was embarrassing to admit they hadn’t read it. Asking people if they _planned_ to read it, however, made the results more accurate—anyone who answered that they planned to read it hadn’t already done so, and the people who _had_ read it would say so.



#### Consideration #3: Children

**Children can be difficult to survey and include in research** because they don’t understand complicated questions, have trouble speaking articulately, and tend to give you the answer they think you want. There are three ways to more accurately get their opinions:

**1\. Use games.** Show a commercial to children, and then ask them to play games that demonstrate what they understood from it. For example, ask them to act like the characters in the commercial or describe the commercial on a toy telephone. This will help you find out what they thought the commercial was trying to say and what they liked or disliked about the characters.

**2\. Compare the product and commercial.** Show a commercial to children, and ask them what they liked about the product. Then, show them the physical product, and ask what they like. If the answers are wildly different, you probably have a communication problem.

  * (Shortform example: Say you show children a water gun commercial and 10% of them say they like how far the gun can shoot. When actually given the gun to play with, 70% of them like how far it can shoot. Your commercial isn’t effectively communicating this attractive feature.)



**3\. Circle test.** Give children a piece of paper that shows four toys and get them to circle the one they want. Then, show them your commercial. Then, tell them some children forgot to put their names on the first piece of paper, so you’d like them to redo the circling. If your product is circled more the second time, then you know your commercial is persuasive.

### Nine Pitfalls

There are nine pitfalls to avoid when it comes to doing or directing research:

  1. **Taking too long.** To be useful, research must produce data within days or weeks, not months. Don’t be so scared of making a mistake that your work drags on. For example, when Ogilvy ran the Audience Research Institute, statisticians wanted two months to complete a report. Ogilvy made them do it in two days because he needed the information fast.
  2. **Disputing methodology.** This is a waste of time. For example, 21 agencies took two years to decide on the principles for copy-testing.
  3. **Getting distracted.** Researchers tend to be intellectual and more interested in other subjects besides advertising. Keep them focused on advertising.
  4. **Bad filing.** If people can’t find research that’s been conducted (or even remember it was conducted, if the players have left the company), then people waste time redoing the same research.
  5. **Focusing on fads.** Fads can be useful, but they never last, so focus on information that will be useful long term.
  6. **Making reports too long and complicated.** The average person can’t understand many researchers’ graphs.
  7. **Being perfectionists.** Researchers tend to refuse projects they can’t do perfectly.
  8. **Not taking initiative.** Most researchers need a constant stream of orders and directions to get anything done.
  9. **Use of jargon.** Avoid words such as “sub-optimal” or “attitudinal paradigms.” Not only will people not know what you mean, but they’ll also be annoyed at the pretentiousness.
