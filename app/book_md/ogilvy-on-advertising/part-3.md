## Part 3: Industry Overview | Chapter 8: Advertising Jobs

In the previous part, we looked at the craft of advertising. Now we’ll zoom out and look at the domestic advertising industry as a whole from the point of view of employees, heads of agencies, clients, and the public. Then, we’ll look at international advertising.

At the time of the book’s writing, fewer than 100,000 people worked in advertising in the U.S. and 15,000 in Britain, but the industry wasn’t as unstable as newspapers would have you believe—papers reported only on accounts that moved, not the ones that stayed. Only 4% of accounts changed agencies per year, and of the 25 biggest agencies in 1972, 24 were still the biggest agencies in 1983.

### Employees

First: If you’re not passionate about advertising, go do something else. Advertising pays well, but so do plenty of other professions that are easier and don’t require as much passion.

If you’re sure you want to work in advertising, it’s important to consider education, employers, positions, how to properly apply for a job, and how to keep it once you have it.

#### Education

At the time of the book’s writing, 87 U.S. universities offered undergraduate courses in advertising and some offered degree programs. However, **many of the instructors didn’t have practical experience in advertising and didn’t do research, and the textbooks were bad. Therefore, the big agencies preferred to hire smart people with degrees in other fields** , such as economics, and the people who studied advertising ended up at smaller firms.

#### Employers

There are four types of employers in advertising:

  1. **Media outlets** , such as radio stations that sell advertising space or time.
  2. **Retailers** , such as Sears, that have their own marketing departments and hire for jobs such as art director or copywriter.
  3. **Manufacturing companies** , such as Proctor & Gamble, that need brand managers.
  4. **Advertising agencies** , such as Ogilvy & Mather, that hire for a variety of positions. 



Ogilvy only ever worked in agencies, so this is the only category his book covers in detail. Agencies tend to be interesting places to work—you can move internally, the culture is stimulating, and agencies often have an international presence, so you can work anywhere in the world (it helps if you speak the local language).

**When you start your career, prioritize learning opportunities over salary.** Look for an agency at which the top people teach interns, and the established employees are still open to professional development.

#### Positions

Advertising agencies hire for a variety of positions:

##### Copywriters

**Copywriters write the prose that appears in ads or the dialogue in TV commercials.** They’re the most important (if not the most visible) people in agencies, but at most agencies, there are half as many copywriters as account executives. (Copywriters usually dislike account executives, and the feeling is mutual. Copywriters think account executives are bullheaded and stupid. Account executives tend to think copywriters are divas.)

To be a successful copywriter, you need the following:

  * Curiosity about advertising, psychology, and products
  * A sense of humor
  * Interest in advertising
  * Good writing skills
  * Good visual skills (for writing for TV)
  * Ambition to succeed (Ogilvy believes most copywriters don’t try hard enough)
  * Ability to work hard
  * Ability to see an ad as both an art form and a means to selling something
  * Ability to manage deadlines and pressure (copywriters have to come up with good ideas quickly)



##### Art Directors

**Art directors are responsible for the images and visuals in advertising.** Art director is both a rising and dying job. Rising, because art director skills can transfer to creative director or television production skills, and dying because print is less popular.

To be an art director, you need:

  * Formal training in graphic design, photography, and/or film
  * Good taste (a bonus)



##### Account Executives

**Account executives act as a liaison with clients and make sure that everyone else in the agency is doing their jobs.** They travel and entertain clients (which is less fun than it sounds when they have to deliver bad news).

There are two types of account executives:

  1. **Custodians.** These types mainly coordinate—they don’t write ads, do research, find new clients themselves, or come up with ideas.
  2. **Contributors.** Contributors are hands-on and come up with ideas.



To be a good account executive, you need the following skills:

  * Ability to write and deliver good presentations
  * Ability to write clear, concise memos—clients are busy, and if your memos are long and confusing, they might go unread
  * Ability to give good, honest advice but let the client make their own choices
  * Ability to strategically surrender—let your clients have their way on small things so that, when something big comes up, it’s your turn to get your way
  * Respect and keep your distance from your clients—be their friends and buy their companies’ shares, but stay out of their companies’ politics
  * Be discreet—maintain confidentiality and don’t talk about your clients in public places
  * Resist anxiety—when the agency makes a mistake, clients blame the account executive; when the client make outrageous demands, the agency blames the account executive



It takes years to reach the position and very few people achieve it before they’re 30. To become a successful account executive, Ogilvy recommends the following progression:

  * Work for P&G in brand management for two years.
  * Work for a consumer research company for a year, aiming to learn how to influence people.
  * Join an agency. Learn everything you can about your account. For example, if your account is oil and gas, read books and trade journals, tour facilities, and talk to people in the field.
  * Use your knowledge at the opportune moment. For example, when Lever Brothers asked its agencies for a paper on how to use television, most agencies submitted five- to six-page papers, but one account executive prepared a detailed 170-page report. He was quickly elected to the agency’s board of directors.



##### Researchers

**Researchers study what makes people read, watch, or remember ads, and what makes ads sell.**

To be a successful researcher, you need the following:

  * Formal training (probably a degree) in psychology or statistics
  * An analytical mind
  * Report-writing ability
  * An ability to work with people who don’t like you (creative people tend to dislike research)
  * Honesty—your reports can’t be biased



##### Media Buyers

**People who work in the media department buy and negotiate for time and space** in media outlets.

To succeed in the media department of an agency, you need:

  * An analytical mind
  * An ability to negotiate
  * An ability to make data accessible
  * Resilience



##### Creative Directors

**Creative directors oversee the production of ads.**

To be a good creative director, you need the following:

  * Psychology skills
  * Administrative skills
  * Strategic skills
  * HR skills
  * Good presentation skills
  * Graphic design skills
  * Proficiency in all media
  * Ability to work fast and hard
  * Ability to use research
  * Ability to maintain composure
  * Ability to share credit and take blame
  * Enthusiasm
  * High standards



#### Applying for a Job

When you apply for a job in advertising, mail your resume and letter to agencies (don’t phone them). Here are some tips for writing a strong letter:

  * Type it.
  * Spell the agency’s name right.
  * Write clearly and lucidly.
  * Right at the beginning of the letter, state the position you’re applying for and whether you’re responding to a help-wanted ad or recommendation.
  * Talk about your qualifications (Shortform example: Cite your degree in graphic design) rather than abstractions (ambition).
  * Be polite but personal. Your letter should have the same tone you would use if speaking to someone in a professional context.
  * End the letter by saying that you’ll call the agency to set up an interview if they’re interested. Don’t make the agency get in touch with you—people are busy. Make it as easy as possible for them to interview you.



#### Keeping Your Job

Previously, it was very easy to get fired from an advertising agency. For example, one year, Stirling Getchel had a turnover rate of 137%. At the time of writing, however, most people who left agencies did so voluntarily.
