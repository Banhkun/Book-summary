## Chapter 7: Direct-Response Advertising

Now that you know the basics of creating good ads, how can you check if you’ve successfully applied them? And where and when should you display the ads?

To answer all of these questions, consider experimenting with direct-response advertising (ads that encourage consumers to contact a company directly to make a purchase) because **there’s a clear relationship between advertising and sales—the _only_ factor that affected someone’s decision to buy a product was the ad. **(Companies that advertise in multiple media and sell products via wholesalers and retailers don’t know if people are buying their products because the advertising is good, or if it’s for some other reason.)

### Experimenting With Variables

**Direct-response advertising allows you to individually test advertising and product variables.** The most important variables are positioning, premiums, pricing, terms of payment, and format (for example, a page and a reply card, versus simply a page).

  * For example, one magazine created three ads, each offering different payment terms for subscriptions. The ad that offered $29.95 for 29 issues received more response than higher numbers of issues for higher prices, so the magazine ran this offer exclusively.



Ogilvy experimented for years and offers the following tips on variables:

  * Free premiums (such as free samples or cash prizes in sweepstakes) create a good initial response but don't always attract long-term customers.
  * Asking for cash and full price will reduce response, but the people who do respond may become long-term customers.
  * Long letters are more effective than short ones.
  * If one testimonial seems to be creating a good response, try including a second one.
  * Gimmicks can be effective, but they need to be tested before rolling them out on a large scale. For example, one of Ogilvy’s campaigns was to send live homing pigeons to people who might buy a business jet. If interested in a free ride in the jet, the recipients were to tie their addresses to the pigeon’s leg and then release it. Some people ate the pigeons, but some people returned them, and at least one person bought the $600,000 jet.



**Even once you create a profitable campaign, keep testing variables to try to come up with something even more profitable.** You can do this both by adding new elements to your campaigns (such as adding a personalized letter from the head of the company to your direct-mail campaign), or eliminating elements (such as no longer including a brochure with your letters).

### Testing Media

**Direct-response ads can also help you figure out the most effective media outlets in which to place your ads.** For example, if you get low response from your ads in one publication, you might stop advertising there and put the money towards advertising in a different publication.

When considering media:

  * Look at where your competitors place their ads. Likely, they get good responses from the outlets they use on a regular basis.
  * Be aware of editorial changes in magazines. This may change audience and readership.
  * Note that people buy less when TV programming is good because their minds aren’t free to wander—they’re focused on the show, not the commercials. 
  * On TV, advertise in January, February, and March, and on weekends, late evenings, and early mornings, because these are usually effective time slots.
  * Remember that it’s normal for response rates to drop when you advertise regularly in the same media. Experiment to find out which publications can run your ads for longer before the response stops, and use these long-lived publications more often.



### Direct-Reponse Mail Advertising

At the time of writing, **direct mail was responsible for a hundred-billion dollars of sales a year.** Its main users were record and book clubs, food and department stores, catalog houses, and magazines. Direct mail was becoming easier due to computers, which allowed advertisers to more easily create targeted mailing lists by filtering by demographic, purchasing history, and so on. However,**in spite of its effectiveness, direct mail was unpopular and regarded as low-brow.** (This may be due to the fact that direct mail is the easiest entry point for scammers, but for the most part, scammers are few and far between)

To create good mail-order copy, follow the guidelines for creating good print ads in Chapter 4.

### Direct-Response TV Advertising

To create good direct-response TV advertising, such as infomercials, follow the guidelines for creating good TV ads in Chapter 6 and additionally:

  * Use a demonstration that promises _more than one_ benefit.
  * Include the price.
  * Include a money-back guarantee.
  * Ask for the sale. 
  * Last longer than two minutes. People find fewer, longer commercials less annoying than lots of shorter commercials.
  * Budget at least 20 seconds explaining how to order. Give the phone number at least twice and include the address. Additionally, use supers.



**Measure and test the effectiveness of your commercials by the number of orders you receive after the commercial plays,** rather than the number of viewers reached. (It doesn’t matter how many people you reach if none of them buys anything.)
