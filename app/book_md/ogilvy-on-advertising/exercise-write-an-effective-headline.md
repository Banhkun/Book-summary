## Exercise: Write an Effective Headline

Because 80% of people read only the headline of advertisements, not the copy, the headline must communicate well.

* * *

Think of a product you’re about to start advertising (if nothing comes to mind, imagine you’re advertising a Volkswagen Beetle). What benefit could this product offer the consumer?

What useful, product-associated information could your headline offer? (For example, an ad for the cleaning product Rinso gave instructions on how to remove stains.)

Who is your target audience? What vocabulary could you use to catch their attention? (For example, if you sell asthma inhalers, put the word “asthma” in the headline.)

How could you make your headline more specific? (For example, when advertising Sears’s low prices, Ogilvy wrote that Sears’s profit was less than 5%, rather than “lower than you’d think.”)
