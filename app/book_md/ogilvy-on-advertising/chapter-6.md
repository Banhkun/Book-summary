## Chapter 6: Specific Types of Advertising

In the previous chapters, we looked at some general guidelines for advertising in different media. Now, we’ll look at advertising some types of products, services, and companies that require a special touch.

### Type #1: Corporate Advertising

Corporate advertising is advertising a company separately from its products or services. This type of advertising can help companies:

  * **Increase employee morale**. People like it when other people have heard of the company they work for.
  * **Improve public opinion.** People who know more about companies are likely to have better opinions of them.
  * **Recruit top talent.** People need to know your company exists to want to work for it.
  * **Win takeover bids.** Companies with good images are more likely to be chosen.
  * **Impress investors.** For example, a Northwestern University study found that on average, corporate advertising improved stock prices by 2%.



Getting these benefits requires a long-term commitment.

  * Example #1: When public opinion of Texaco dropped because someone accused them of selling to Nazis, they ran radio ads that told people they sponsored the Metropolitan Opera. It took a long time to change their image from conspirators to arts supporters.
  * Example #2: DuPont has been advertising itself for 47 years.



When creating corporate advertising, use the guidelines in previous chapters, and avoid the following specific pitfalls:

  * **Bad crafting.** Many companies choose interchangeable slogans and place them at the bottom of ads, where no one looks.
    * For example, the slogan “THE company” could refer to any company in the world. (It belonged to Textron.)
  * **Underfunding.** Often, the CEO is the only person at a company who supports corporate advertising, and everyone else wants to spend its budget for advertising products instead. The best way to allocate funding is to first figure out a goal and then figure out how much it will cost to achieve.
  * **Under-researching.** Many corporate campaigns don’t receive the same amount of research as product campaigns.
  * **Limited media.** Some companies don’t use TV, and this decreases their reach.
  * **CEO appearances.** CEOs aren’t trained announcers and may not be as well-spoken as an actor.
  * **Use of initials.** If you reduce your company name to initials, people won’t know what the letters stand for or might mistake your company for someone else. 
    * For example, both Brown Boveri and British Broadcasting use BBC.



#### Influencing Legislation

**It’s possible to use corporate advertising to influence the public to support legislation, but it’s difficult** for two reasons:

  1. People don’t trust companies. In TV shows, two-thirds of businesspeople are portrayed as bad people (greedy, stupid, selfish, and so on).
  2. Many businesspeople aren’t aware of the opinions of non-businesspeople. For example, some businesspeople didn’t realize that some people don’t like capitalism.



Additionally, there are limitations on advertising that aims to change legislation:

  * It’s not considered a business expense by the IRS.
  * Many TV networks won’t run this type of advertising, so you have to use local television.



To successfully influence public opinion:

**Tip #1: Simplify the issue (but don’t distort it).** When there’s too much complicated information, people feel lost and don’t know what to do.

  * For example, in 1981, when there was conflicting, confusing information about how to eat healthily, General Foods wrote an ad with simple advice.



**Tip #2: Harness self-interest.** Tell the reader why your position would benefit them.

  * For example, when the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway and the Nickel Plate Road wanted to establish transcontinental service at Chicago, St. Louis, and New Orleans, they ran an ad that explained that a hog could cross the U.S. without changing trains, but people had to stop in one of three cities. The ad explained that if the rules changed, people’s travel would be less inconvenient.



**Tip #3: Be honest.** Acknowledge mistakes and explain how your company is fixing them. If applicable, present both perspectives.

  * For example, ARMCO was known as a major polluter. They ran an ad that explained how they were cleaning up the environment.



**Tip #4: Target everyone.** There’s little point in advertising to Congresspeople or the government because they’ll ignore you if they don’t think you have their constituents on your side. Additionally, while some people think that they only need to reach influential members of the public, who will then influence their followers, influential people are hard to identify and target.

  * For example, when oil companies were trying to avoid a windfall profits tax, they advertised to members of Congress. The politicians were more pressured by social and political factors and the bill went through.



**Tip #5: Use TV advertising.** Most people form their opinions based on the information they get from TV, particularly from folk heroes.

  * For example, when Jane Fonda referred to “the black shadow of oil,” people took a stance against oil.



**Tip #6: Commit for the long term.** It takes a long time to change people’s opinions.

### Type #2: Travel Advertising

Like corporate advertising, advertising travel to foreign countries requires navigating some specific pitfalls and opportunities.

Travel advertising has the following challenges:

**Challenge #1: Politics.** Advertising travel can be fraught with politics because often the country that’s being advertised wants to present a different image than what tourists are most interested in.

  * For example, when Ogilvy was advertising Britain to American tourists, his research found that Americans were most interested in culture and history. To entice them, he created ads that showed Westminster Abbey and the Changing of the Guard. However, the British press criticized the ads for presenting the country as behind the times—they would have preferred to see new nuclear power stations in the advertising.



**Challenge #2: Underfunding.** Even though tourism is a huge source of income for many countries, often tourism departments aren’t given a large enough budget to operate effectively.

**Challenge #3: Misconceptions.** Some places have negative connotations or stereotypes associated with them. Often these are inaccurate, so the advertising must show the place as it really is to overcome these preconceptions.

  * For example, in the past, Americans who had never been to Puerto Rico thought it was squalid. Ogilvy’s advertisements showed that in reality, the region was beautiful.



To create effective tourism advertising:

**Tip #1: Advertise exclusivity.** Feature attractions that don’t exist in the country being targeted by the ads.

  * (Shortform example: If you’re advertising Switzerland to Canadians, don’t tell them about ski resorts, tell them about the medieval-era attractions.)



**Tip #2: Target the type of tourists the country wants.** Some countries are rightly concerned that increasing tourism will affect their culture.

  * For example, Bermuda targeted its ads at young American couples. Had it been less specific, it could have attracted all sorts of tourists and turned into an overcrowded Miami Beach.



**Tip #3: Feature culture.** Most travelers are educated and interested in culture.

**Tip #4: Provide instructions,** especially for less well-known countries.

  * For example, when advertising Singapore, Ogilvy’s ad featured an appealing photo and information about how much it cost to travel there, the weather, the food, and so on.



**Tip #5: Soothe fears.** After cost, fear is the main reason people choose not to travel. In your ads, reassure people that they will be able to communicate, the country is safe, the locals are nice, and the food isn’t too unusual.

**Tip #6: Be strategically timeless or newsworthy.** Most travel advertisements should be timeless, but there are cases where newsworthiness can be effective.

  * For example, in 1974, there were electricity shortages in Britain, which discouraged Americans from visiting. When the shortages ended, Ogilvy reported this news in ads (the press didn’t report it at all), and people were no longer anxious about traveling to Britain.



**Tip #7: Position the country as a trend.** People tend to travel according to fashion.

  * (Shortform example: Use a headline like, “The island everyone’s visiting in 2005.”)



**Tip #8: Use both magazine and TV advertising.**

**Tip #9: Use charm or be unique.** This will make your ads stand out.

  * For example, when advertising France, Ogilvy wrote a headline in French (which was very unconventional) with a translation underneath.



### Type #3: Causes

When advertising for causes or charities, ads rarely bring in enough money to even pay for the space or time (though the government and some media outlets often provide free space or time). **Advertising for causes is more effective at raising awareness, which makes personal solicitation more likely to succeed.**

  * (Shortform example: If a person has already heard of the Red Cross, they’re more likely to donate when a volunteer comes to their door.)



### Type #4: Commodity Products and B2B

The last type of specialized advertising is for commodity industrial products, such as bolts or washers, that have nothing unique about them. **The best way to advertise these is to differentiate from the competitor’s versions** by offering the product or service at a lower cost and providing better quality.

  * For example, when fuel prices went up in 1972, Owens-Corning advertised their insulation as the insulation of choice for lowering the fuel costs of old houses.



To effectively advertise commodity products:

**Tip #1: Make it as easy as possible to contact your company.** To do this:

  * Include a toll-free number in your ads.
  * In your print ads, include both a coupon for requesting additional information and a business reply card (a postcard with prepaid postage).
  * Put your offer, phone number, and address at the end of your ad. Business publications are read by more than one person, so this ensures that even if someone has already sent off the coupon or reply card, your contact information is still available for the next reader.



**Tip #2: Keep data on who responds to your ads.** To do this:

  * Ask responders why they got in touch—do they want your product right now, in the future, or do they want a salesperson to contact them?
  * Ask the salespeople who speak with the respondents whether they ultimately made a sale or think they’ll make a sale in the future. Also ask how many respondents are existing customers, or new customers who are likely to become regulars.
  * Keep track of where the responses are coming from so you can better manage your advertising budget. (Shortform example: If you’re receiving many response cards from a magazine ad, but none from a newspaper ad, consider skipping the newspaper advertising, and put the money towards something else.)



**Tip #3: Consider creating two sets of advertising, one targeted at specifiers and one targeted at the executives** who will approve the purchases. These groups of people have different interests—specifiers want the details about a product, while executives have bigger-picture concerns, such as cost savings.
