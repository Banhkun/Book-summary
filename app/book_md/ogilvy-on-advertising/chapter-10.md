## Chapter 10: Finding Clients

In the previous chapter, we looked at some basics of how to manage an agency. Now, we’ll look at how to make the agency successful by finding new clients. You used to be able to get clients by bringing them along when you left your job to start a new agency. At the time of writing, however, this was no longer possible because you would get sued.

Now, to get clients, you have to find new ones.

### How Clients Look for Agencies

At the time of publishing, companies were starting to change how they looked for agencies. This was their process:

  * Send a long questionnaire to the agencies they’re interested in.
  * Short-list agencies based on the questionnaire.
  * Visit the agencies and ask about the commission.
  * Invite the agencies to make a commercial for them.
  * Compare the commercials and choose the agency that makes the best one.



This process is flawed for several reasons:

  * The questionnaires ask irrelevant questions. For example, one asked how many people worked in the print production department.
  * Commission shouldn’t be given so much weight—an agency’s competence is more important.
  * The process doesn’t consider past work or track record.
  * Skilled agencies that don’t have the time and money to jump through hoops don’t win accounts, which is bad for both the agency and the client.
  * It doesn’t consider the leader. There aren’t that many differences between agencies—most of them successfully increase their clients’ sales and have competent staff—so the leader is often the major factor. For example, many accounts chose Foote, Cone & Belding because they liked Fax Cone. 



### Winning Clients

**The best and easiest way to get new clients is to produce good advertising for the clients you already have.** Then, you can show your successful work to other potential clients.

  * For example, during a seven-year period, Ogilvy got every single account he competed for just by showing them the campaigns he’d done for his other clients. In fact, clients even came to him—one day, a man came into the office and _offered_ him the IBM account.



There are three other ways to attract new clients:

#### Option #1: Presentations

When a client is interested in your agency, give them a presentation to convince them they want to hire you.

Here are some tips for a successful presentation:

  * Keep the presentation budget reasonable. Some agencies spend up to half a million dollars presenting to clients, and they’d need to keep the account for 20 years to recover this.
  * Mix up the seating so that your team and the client’s team are integrated.
  * Practice your presentation.
  * Don’t read off your notes.
  * Listen to the client. You’re evaluating the client as much as they’re evaluating you—you don’t want to take on someone who will be difficult.
    * For example, Ogilvy was lectured for two hours by a Magnavox head and decided he didn’t want to work with him.
  * Admit your weaknesses before the client notices them. This will make it seem like you’re being honest about your strengths.
  * Don’t talk too much about stats—they won’t interest your client.
  * The day after the presentation, send a three-page letter that summarizes why the client should choose your agency.



#### Option #2: Advertising Your Agency

Interestingly, few advertising agencies actually advertise their own services. (Ogilvy thought that this might be because the partners have conflicting ideas of what to emphasize.)

The most effective way to advertise an agency is by mailing ads directly to clients. Space advertising can work too, but it needs to be done consistently to have any effect. (For example, Young & Rubicam advertised in _Fortune_ for four decades.)

Remember that your existing clients will see these ads, and if your house ads are better than what you produce for them, you’ll hear about it.

#### Option #3: Multinational Accounts

If you can get an account that also advertises in foreign countries, you might be able to get it worldwide.

  * For example, when Ogilvy got the Shell account, the president of Shell asked if he wanted the Canadian account. Ogilvy didn’t have an office in Canada but started one.



However, some countries don’t allow foreign agencies to operate in order to protect their culture from foreign influence. (For example, Nigeria once expelled all foreign agencies.) This logic is unsound, according to Ogilvy, because many of the people who work for foreign agencies are locals, not Americans, so there’s no chance of them projecting American culture.

#### If All Else Fails

If you struggle to win clients, you can try buying accounts by buying agencies, but this doesn’t always lead to results. For example, Lennan & Newell bought enough agencies to increase its billings by 500%, but the company became so unwieldy and combative that it went bankrupt.

No matter how many difficulties you have attracting clients, **don’t give outsiders commissions for getting you clients—you’ll lose too much money.** For example, when Ogilvy’s agency was just starting out and he was desperate, he offered a man 10% of the company’s stock if he could get a vacuum-cleaner account to sign with his company. The man didn’t accept the offer, which was fortunate for Ogilvy, because by the time of writing, 10% of his stock was worth $19 million.

### Dealing With Bad Clients

Everyone wants good clients, such as “first-class” businesses, but when you’re first starting your agency or in a dry spell, you might feel like you can’t be picky. However, **bad clients can do huge damage to your agency, so don’t take on just anyone, no matter how desperate you are.**

Be cautious of, avoid, or drop the following types of clients:

  * Those who won’t be able to pay you. Profit margins in advertising are slim, so you can’t afford to not be paid.
  * Those with different company cultures that would be incompatible with yours.
  * Those with potential but no current clout. These accounts could take off, but few of them do.
  * Those who make the people working on their account miserable. Your staff’s morale is more important than one client.
  * Those who are failing, because they sometimes switch agencies often. For example, when Pan American started to struggle, they switched agencies five times in approximately 10 years. (Most major accounts keep their agencies for decades. For example, General Motors used the same agency for 70 years.)



### Public Opinion on Your Agency

No one’s going to say anything negative about you or your agency to your face, so **pay a research organization to do a survey and find out what companies think of you.** If the survey turns something up, even if you fix the problem quickly, it will take some time for your reputation to change.

### Conflicts of Interest

**It’s common practice that agencies don’t take on more than one client in one category.** (Shortform example: If you already advertise for a shoe company, you wouldn’t sign up Keds.)

However, conflicts of interest can become complicated quickly. For example, if you have two clients in different businesses but one decides to expand, do you have to drop one of them? If you have two clients in the same business but in different cities, is that a problem? Additionally, **some clients don’t want their agencies to represent anyone who might even _indirectly_ affect their sales.**

McKinsey’s Marvin Bower thinks that there’s no harm in advertising agencies representing competing clients. He says that even if the agency staff responsible for competing accounts shared all their knowledge, it wouldn’t negatively impact the sales of either company because companies are so different.

Whether or not representing more than one client in a category will actually affect either’s sales, don’t do it because it will make your clients unhappy.
