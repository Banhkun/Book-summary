## A Break from Self

Susannah and her mom visit Sarah Levin, the psychiatrist recommended by Dr. Bailey. Susannah makes the case for her being bipolar. Levin concludes that Susannah is experiencing manic and depressive states, and she prescribes a drug commonly used for mood and thought disorders.

Susannah’s mom has doubts. She calls Susannah’s younger brother, James, and asks him if he thinks Bailey’s diagnosis of alcoholism and Levin’s diagnosis of bipolar disorder are correct. James says no to both. Susannah’s mom agrees with him.

Later that night, Susannah becomes convinced that all her problems are caused by her anti-seizure medication. Her mother begs her to stay on the drug. **In one of her last moments as the old, compassionate Susannah who doesn’t want to cause her mother pain, Susannah takes the pill.** Later that night, she makes herself throw up to get the drug out of her body.

In the morning, Susannah writes the first document that would later function as a diary of this period—a suggestion made by Allen. Writing things down makes Susannah feel like she’s piecing together what’s wrong with her. “I’m bipolar,” she writes. “That’s why I’m me. I love work. I have to break up with Stephen. I’m jumbly. Work takes too much out of my life.”

That night Susannah wanders into the sitting room to tell her mom and Allen that she wants to leave Stephen. She wanders out of the room but comes back to tell them she wants to leave her job at the _Post_. She leaves again and returns to tell them she’s figured it out: She wants to leave New York City. She leaves the room once more. This time, when she returns, she has another seizure. Frantic, Susannah’s mom calls Dr. Bailey, who tells them to come in in three days for another EEG.

Susannah is getting worse by the hour. Over the next few days, she smacks her lips together, trails off mid-sentence, and stares off into space before continuing her conversation. At these moments, a childlike state replaces her paranoid aggression.**** She continues to keep a diary, desperately attempting to express a deep, dark part of herself, piecing together what’s wrong with her. Many of these entries will remain incomprehensible to Susannah even after the disease has passed, but **some of the entries provide insight into parts of her life Susannah has never before examined.** “I read people well but I’m jumbly,” she writes. “Who gives a crap what they thing [sic] of me.”

> **Medical Aside**
> 
> Complex partial seizures can produce trance-like states, repetitive mouth movements, and foggy consciousness.

The night before Susannah is to see Dr. Bailey, Stephen comes to New Jersey to take Susannah out to dinner. Susannah’s family has told him about her condition, but he believes she needs to maintain some semblance of normalcy. When they enter the crowded restaurant, Susannah feels everyone is staring at her. She hears them whispering, “Susannah, Susannah.” Her breathing gets shallow and she begins to sweat. Stephen grabs her hand and they leave. At the next restaurant, she can’t eat. On their way back to the car, Susannah has two conflicting thoughts: She either has to break up with Stephen, or she has to tell him she loves him.

She tells him she loves him, and he says he loves her too.

The next day, stomping her feet like a two-year-old, Susannah refuses to go to Dr. Bailey’s for her EEG. Finally, Stephen convinces her to go. On the way to the doctor’s fancy office in New York City, Susannah has a hallucination: Allen is speaking without moving his lips. She thinks he says, “You’re a slut and Stephen should know.”

Enraged, she tries to throw herself out of the moving car.

Stephen tells her that her behavior is not okay. She notices that he’s using a new tone of voice and obeys him. After settling down, she goes into panic mode again and flings herself against the locked car door. Finally, she falls asleep on Stephen’s shoulder.

When she wakes up, she insists on being fed. They stop at a diner, where Susannah pushes her way past the long line and shouts, “Get me coffee and an egg sandwich!”

“To go,” Stephen quietly tells the man behind the counter.

Sandwich and coffee in hand, Susannah saunters out of the diner, feeling powerful for making things happen. She then throws the food on the floor of the car, saying she’s not hungry anymore.

At Dr. Bailey’s, Susannah undergoes a rigorous EEG. The technician tells Susannah nothing is wrong with her—it’s in her head, just like those stressed-out Wall Street bankers. Susannah laughs bitterly, because now she knows the truth: her family has set up this EEG to punish her for her bad behavior.

### A Fast Downward Slide

Allen and Susannah’s mom agree to let Susannah return to Manhattan under her father and stepmother’s care. All goes well at first, but as Susannah and her dad head for the subway, Susannah’s paranoia returns. She starts screaming on the street, and her father has to push her into a cab to get her to his home in Brooklyn. “They’re kidnapping me!” Susannah yells at the cabbie. She tells her dad she’s calling the police. She’s convinced she isn’t safe in his care.

Exhausted by the time they get to her dad’s place, Susannah just sits on the couch and stares as her dad and stepmom, Giselle, prepare her favorite meal, pasta. When they set it before her, though, Susannah has another hallucination; the tomato sauce is too bright. The basil pulsates. The cheese glistens. Susannah refuses to eat. After dinner, she has another hallucination like the one she had in the car with Allen. She thinks she hears Giselle saying, “You’re a spoiled brat,” even though Giselle’s lips don’t move.

Susannah has other hallucinations that night. A painting comes alive. A bust of Lincoln follows her with its eyes. Her childhood dollhouse is haunted. Her father is beating Giselle.

Convinced her father is going to kill her, Susannah is desperate to get out. She runs to the front door of the brownstone and bangs her fists against the door, screaming, “Let me out! Help!”

She hears her father run downstairs, and she scoots into the bathroom, locking herself in. She’s about to jump out the window when she spots a statue of Buddha on the bathroom counter. It convinces her that everything will be all right, and she smiles.

It takes Susannah’s dad an hour to coax her out of the bathroom. When Susannah falls asleep in his lap, he calls Susannah’s mom; they both agree she must be admitted to a hospital. However, both insist that she not be put in a psych ward.

Allen and Susannah’s mom drive in from New Jersey the next morning to take Susannah to Dr. Bailey’s, where they ask him to draw up admittance papers. He refuses, insisting that her EEG was normal, along with her MRI, exam, and bloodwork. He repeats that Susannah drinks too much and refuses their request.

Her mom won’t buy it. Under pressure, Bailey gives in and secures Susannah a room at NYU, on a floor that has 24-hour EEG monitoring.

As soon as they arrive at the hospital, Susannah has a seizure in the Admitting Room.

**From here on in, Susannah has no memories of the next month. No longer are there any glimmers of the “I” she had been for twenty-four years. She is unable to access her rational consciousness, and the break with her self is complete.**
