## Exercise: Rejecting Authority

Dr. Bailey believes that Susannah is in bad health because she drinks too much. In spite of Dr. Bailey’s reputation as a top neurologist, Susannah’s mom refuses to accept his diagnosis.

What gave you the confidence to reject their opinion?

What did you learn from this experience that you can apply in the future? Under what conditions would you do the same in the future?
