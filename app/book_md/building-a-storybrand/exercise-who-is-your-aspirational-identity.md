## Exercise: Who Is Your Aspirational Identity?

An aspirational identity is the type of person you would become if you owned a certain product.

* * *

How would you want your friends to describe you? Why?

What’s one product that’s owned by the type of person you described above?

What specific brands do you know of that make this product?

Probably, the brands that come to mind are employing aspirational identities. How do they display the identities? (For example, do their taglines and slogan describe the identity, or do their ads show photos of certain types of people?)
