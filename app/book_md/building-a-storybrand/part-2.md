## Part 2: Create Your BrandScript | Chapters 2-4: The Hero

In Part 1, we learned that the best way to transmit a message is via story. There are many different ways to write stories—just think about how many books and movies there are out there—but **there’s one tried-and-true formula that’s been tested throughout thousands of years of human history.**

The author, who founded a company called StoryBrand, has streamlined this formula into a process called the StoryBrand 7-Part Framework (SB7). Using this framework, **you’ll follow a step-by-step process to create a BrandScript, which is a document similar to the grids or storyboards that storytellers use to create movies or books.** Once you’ve created your BrandScript, you’ll be able to draw on its ideas to write copy and create content you can use in your marketing materials.

**The BrandScript is universal and will work for any size of company anywhere in the world.** For example, after implementing the framework, in just four years, the author’s company doubled its revenue.

You can create multiple BrandScripts for your company at the overall, divisional, and product levels, and/or for different customer segments.

#### SB7

**There are seven elements to the SB7 formula:**

  1. The _hero (customer) wants something_ and 
  2. Encounters a _problem_ that stops her from getting it. 
  3. She needs the help of a _guide (your brand)_ who has
  4. A _plan_ to help her solve the problem. 
  5. The guide (brand) must _call on her to act_. 
  6. The stakes must be clear—what does she stand to _lose if she doesn’t act_ and 
  7. What she might _gain if she does act_?



Here’s an example of how the formula looks in a story: In _Star Wars: A New Hope_ , hero Luke Skywalker wants the Rebellion to defeat the Empire and restore peace in the universe (1). His problem is that the Empire is very powerful (2). Guide Obi-Wan Kenobi (3) trains Luke to use a lightsaber and trust in the Force (4) and then pushes him to go help the Rebellion take on the Empire (5). If Luke fails, the Rebellion will be destroyed and the Empire will maintain power (6). If Luke succeeds, the Rebellion will avoid defeat (7) and eventually save the universe in the next movies in the series.

Here’s an example of how the formula looks for a brand: (Shortform example: A college student wants study snacks (1) but doesn’t have any free time in which to cook (2). SnackCrate (3) is a company that mails crates of snacks to subscribers once a month (4). The “Subscribe” button on the SnackCrate website calls the student to sign up (5). If the student doesn’t order the snacks, she’ll be hungry (6). If she does, she’ll feel full and she’ll have more free brainpower to put towards studying (7).)

**This seven-part story arc is common and popular because it captures the human condition so well.** Everyone doubts themselves and wants to save the day and be a hero.

#### Prioritize the Plot

**When creating your script, avoid including anything that doesn’t advance the plot.** Companies are complicated, but customers aren’t interested in detail. You need to distill everything you do into a quickly digestible message to keep people hooked.

In a movie, there are three things that the audience should learn within the first 20 minutes. If they were to pause the movie at any point thereafter, they should also know the same three things:

  1. The hero’s goal
  2. The opposition—what’s in the way of the hero achieving her goal?
  3. The stakes—what happens to the hero’s life if she does or doesn’t reach the goal?



The rules are similar for marketing—**the customer should learn the following three things within five seconds of looking at your material:**

  1. What the product (or service) is.
  2. Why the product will improve her life.
  3. How she can get the product.



#### Deviations

When you come across a book, movie, or brand that appears to break from the formula, look closer. Often, the story _is_ using the formula but is avoiding cliche, so the formula is less obvious. For example, in the play _Romeo and Juliet_ , Romeo doesn’t have an obvious guide. In fact, his guide is Juliet, who guides him in how to love. **When SB7 is done well, you don’t even notice it’s being employed.**

If a book, movie, or brand truly does break the formula, it’s usually to their detriment. (Shortform example: Literary novels sometimes step away from this formula, and while critics might praise them, the general public doesn’t want something different or edgy—they want a story they can understand.)

### Element #1: The Hero (Customer) Wants Something

The first of the seven story elements is a hero who wants something. **In a narrative, the hero is the main character and the center of attention.**

**In branding, the hero is the customer (_not_ your brand) and you need to come up with something she wants that’s survival-related and associated with your product.** (Shortform example: If you sell hand soap, you can suggest the customer wants clean hands, which is related to survival because clean hands help prevent illness.)

First, we’ll discuss why wants are so compelling and how to choose them. Then, we'll discuss how to write these wants into your BrandScript.

#### Story Gaps

**The distance between the hero and what she wants is called a story gap.** Story gaps are inherently interesting because the human brain craves resolution. For example, try singing “Happy Birthday” but leaving off the last note—it’ll drive you crazy.

The goal of element 1 is to open a story gap to hook your customer’s attention. The gap will stay open, maintaining your customers’ attention, until the story ends.

#### Keep It Simple

**Even if your product satisfies several wants, focus on only one.** Otherwise, you risk being confusing, overloading the customer’s brain, and having her turn to a different company.

  * (Shortform story example: Imagine if, in the movie _Sleeping Beauty_ , in addition to rescuing the princess, the prince also wanted to start a business, go to college, release a hit single, and save the whales.) **If there’s too much going on, it becomes too much work for the brain to organize, and it gives up.**
  * (Shortform brand example: Imagine if a brand that sold dishwashers told customers that the appliance would not only clean their dishes, but could be used to cook a meal, increase the value of their home, and save their marriage.) 



**Different levels of the company can focus on different wants.** Start by choosing a desire for your whole brand, which must be relevant and simple. Then, each division or product can have its own desire. These lower desires are like subplots—surprises and bonuses within something they already liked.

  * (Shortform example: If your company offers both book and corporate editing services, the overall desire could be the need for final, clean content. The book customer might desire novels with interesting plots, while the corporate customer might desire clear, engaging website copy.) 



### Writing Your BrandScript

To write your BrandScript:

1\. Create an online StoryBrand BrandScript (requires you to create an account) or create your own on a blank sheet of paper. To create your own, first, divide the sheet into eight sections. You’ll use seven of these for the SB7 Framework elements and the last for an exercise in Chapter 9. Then, label the sections as follows:

**1\. Hero** The hero wants: ____  ↓ | **3\. Guide** Evidence of empathy: ____ Evidence of competence: ____ ↓ | **5\. Call to Action** Direct: ____ Transitional: ____ ↓ | **7\. Positive stakes** Top positive stakes: ____ ↓  
---|---|---|---  
**2\. Problems** Villains:____ External problems: ____ Internal problems: ____ Philosophical problems: ____ ↗ | **4\. Plan** Process plan: ____ Agreement plan: ____ ↗ | **6\. Negative stakes** Top three negative stakes: ____ ↗ | **8\. Aspirational identity** From: ____  To: ____  
  
  1. Brainstorm what your brand offers and how you can translate this into customer desires.
  2. Write the top wants on your script or sheet of paper.
