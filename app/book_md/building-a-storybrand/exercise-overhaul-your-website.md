## Exercise: Overhaul Your Website

There are five effective ways to improve your website.

* * *

Picture (or navigate to) your current website. What’s currently above the fold? How could you bolster the content in that area?

What calls to action, both direct and transitional, are currently part of your site? How could you make them more effective? (If you don’t have any, how would you add some?)

What images are currently on your site? What more effective images (that show transformation) could you replace them with?

If your company has multiple revenue streams, what do they have in common? What explanation could you use to unite them? If they’re too diverse to unite, what are their individual messages?

What text is currently on your website? How could you pare it down by at least 50%? Consider replacing text with images, transforming paragraphs into bullet points, and shortening sentences to soundbites.
