## Five More Steps of Implementation

Fixing up your website was the first step to implementing your BrandScript. Now, it’s time to look at five further steps. **These five steps are appropriate for any size or type of business and are almost free.**

It may take up to a year to implement all five steps, but you’ll start seeing growth right after implementing the first one. You can hire a StoryBrand guide to help you with these steps if you like. (StoryBrand doesn’t take a percentage from guides or any other certified agents.)

### Step 1: Write a Brand Logline

**A logline is a short, often one-sentence description of a movie that summarizes the story and hooks in a potential viewer.** (Shortform example: The logline for _The Hunger Games_ could be: “To save her sister, a girl enters a life-or-death competition in her place.”) A brand logline does the same thing—it summarizes your brand’s story and invites customers to star as the hero.

Loglines are important because **most people who work at a company, even the senior leaders, can’t succinctly explain what the brand does, and they lose people’s interest the moment they try.** If everyone memorizes the logline, there’s a go-to, standardized, intriguing answer. Everyone who works at the company becomes a salesperson, and customers who are given an easy-to-remember line repeat it to others.

#### Create Your Logline

To create your logline (which can be longer than a single line), you’ll use four of the elements from your BrandScript:

  * **Hero (customer).** The goal is to make members of your target demographic think, “That describes me.”
    * (Shortform example: If your customers are students and you sell exam prep courses, your line might start with: “ _We help students_...”)
  * **Problem.** The goal is to make customers think, “Yes, that’s a problem I have—maybe this brand can help solve it.”
    * (“We help students who are _confronted with tough exams_ …”)
  * **Plan.** Loglines are short, so you can’t go into detail about your plan, but you need to imply there is one. The goal is to make customers think, “Maybe that will work.”
    * (“We help students who are confronted with tough exams _improve their study habits_...”)
  * **Positive stakes.** The goal is to make customers think, “I like the sound of that result and I want it.”
    * (“We help students who are confronted with tough exams improve their study habits to _achieve high grades_.”)



#### Test Your Logline

Say your logline to everyone you meet and gauge their interest and comprehension level. **If people respond by asking you for more information, you know you’ve created an effective logline.**

#### Use Your Logline

There are several ways to employ your logline:

  * **Say it to people yourself.** Memorize the logline and repeat it to everyone you encounter.
  * **Train your team members to say it to people.** Print the logline on things that your team members see every day, such as on coffee cups or wall posters, and quiz team members regularly. If they recite the logline back to you perfectly, give them $5. This will cost you some money, but the author says it’s well worth it.
  * **Post it on your website.** You don’t need to put it front and center, but make it obvious.
  * **Include it on every single one of your marketing materials** from emails to social media bios. This might feel heavy-handed, but your customers won’t read or process it every single time they encounter it.



### Step 2: Use a Lead Generator to Create Email Lists

**A lead generator is something that interests customers in your brand and encourages them to interact with you.** In this step (which is one of the most important in the book), you’re specifically using your lead generator to collect email addresses. Email is the most effective way to share information about your brand. For example, the author has hundreds of thousands of connections on social media, but even combined, they can’t compete with email.

Email marketing is also economical—you don’t need a huge budget to make use of it.

#### Create Your Lead Generator

Lead generators need to do at least one of the following:

  * Give your customers something valuable (_not_ a newsletter, no one wants those)
  * Demonstrate your authoritativeness in the industry



Here are five suggestions for possible lead generators, all of which can also be used as transitional calls to action. For all of them, the potential customer exchanges their email address for access to:

  * **Downloadable guides.** A downloadable guide should teach your customers about your field. PDF guides are economical and easy, and should be around three pages long.
    * (Shortform example: If you sell tomato plants, you might give out a guide about how to choose appropriate soil for your garden.)
  * **Web series or online videos.** Videos are more involved than downloadable guides, but they do a great job demonstrating your expertise in the field.
    * (Shortform example: if you’re a plumber, release a video that shows how to clean a drain.)
  * **Free trials or demos.** There’s no risk for the customer in a free trial—they can test something before they have to pay for it. If they enjoy it during the test, they might buy it.
    * (Shortform example: Adobe Creative Suite offers a free week-long trial of their software.)
  * **Free samples.** Like free trials, free samples give the customer a risk-free way to learn more about a product.
    * For example, Blue Apron gives existing customers coupons to give to their friends. The coupons entitle people to free samples.
  * **Free events.** Free events attract people to your place of business where they’re introduced to your products and services.
    * For example, some pet stores offer free dog training classes.



**If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the possibilities, start with a PDF guide** because it’s the easiest. If you need help creating it, you can hire a writer or designer.

#### Title Your Lead Generator

**Lead generators are more enticing when they have good titles.** Consider some of the following:

  * “Common Mistakes People Make With [problem you can help them solve]”
    * (Shortform example: A realtor might release a guide called “7 Mistakes People Make When Buying Their First Home.”)
  * “The Most Important Things You Can Do With [product].”
    * (Shortform example: A web designer might title a video called “The 4 Most Important Things You Can Do to Increase the Effectiveness of Your Website.”)
  * “Learn to Make [something related to your product] Once a [time period].”
    * (Shortform example: A craft store might host a crochet class once a month called: “Learn to Crochet a New Doily Once Every Thirty Days.”)
  * “Become a [aspirational identity]”
    * (Shortform example: A tutoring company might title a free trial of their educational software: “Become an Honor Roll Student.”)



#### Use Your Lead Generator

**You should display your lead generator on your website.** The author recommends that you offer it in a pop-up that displays after ten seconds of landing on the site. Though everyone says they hate pop-ups, according to stats, they’re a very effective form of marketing.

#### How Much Is Too Much?

You might worry about giving out so much valuable content for free, which goes against the marketing adage, give away the why (inform the customer why they need to know about a problem) and sell the how (your product which solves the problem). However, **the author encourages you to be generous and writes that he’s never lost money from doing so.** Customers look at your free content while they’re in the midst of other things, and when they’re ready to sit down and learn it properly, they’ll be willing to pay.

#### How Many Email Addresses Do I Need to Collect?

Depending on the size of your company, you’ll need differing amounts of email addresses before you move on to the next step. **A big business might need hundreds of thousands** that they then divide into categories based on demographics. **If your business makes less than $5 million, then you probably only need to collect 250 email addresses to get results.** (Note that email addresses need to belong to qualified customers—customers who have the potential to buy from you.)

### Step 3: Build an Automated Email Campaign

An automated email campaign is a series of prewritten emails that are sent on a schedule to anyone who signs up for your lead generator. **The goal of this kind of campaign is to remind your customers that your business exists.** They may not need whatever product or service you’re offering when they first hear of you, or the next few times they next think of you, but when they do need something, you want them to remember you and how they can contact you.

Even if no one actually reads your emails (20% open rate is the industry average), in the time it takes someone to delete them, she’ll have reread your brand’s name and possibly seen your logo.

**Don’t worry if people unsubscribe from your list. This is actually a good thing—they’re self-identifying as unqualified customers who will probably never buy anything from you.** If they’re never going to buy, you don’t need to be paying your email service provider to send messages to them.

#### Create a Nurturing Campaign

**A nurturing campaign is a series of emails that offer valuable information related to your brand.** The goal of a nurturing campaign isn’t to get people to buy; it’s to create reciprocity and trust, and to establish authority. Once in a while during the campaign, you can remind people what you offer and ask for a sale.

Typically in a nurturing campaign, emails go out once a week. **The first three emails are nurturing—they share information—and the fourth is a call to action.** Then, the pattern repeats.

##### The Nurturing Email

To create the nurturing email, follow the formula below and use the ideas and content you came up with in your BrandScript:

  1. Bring up a problem.
  2. Lay out a plan for fixing the problem.
  3. Explain how life will be improved after the problem is fixed.
  4. Include a P.S. because if people read any part of your email, it’s this part.
  5. Put your logline and contact information in the email signature so that if anyone does want to buy from you at this early stage, they have all the information they need.



**Shortform Example**

Email Subject: The Best Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe

P.S. Next time you’re in our neck of the woods, pop into the store and tell us about your favorite dessert—we have recipe recommendations for everything! (4)

##### The Call to Action Email

To create the call to action email, follow the formula below and use the ideas and content you came up with in your BrandScript. (Steps 1 and 3 are the same as for the nurturing email.)

  1. Bring up a problem.
  2. Mention a product you sell that fixes the problem.
  3. Explain how life will be improved after the problem is fixed.
  4. Call the customer to action directly. (Don’t be passive—as discussed earlier, passivity suggests weakness or a lack of confidence in your product.)



**Shortform Example**

Email Subject: A solution for stuck cakes

Dear [customer name],

At some point or another, every baker encounters a cake that sticks to the bottom of the pan (1). No matter how well you greased or floured the pan, your cake is stuck, and it’s nearly inevitable that it’ll break as you try to get it out. We hate this so much we developed a special non-stick cake pan that makes cakes slide right out the pan (2). No more banging on pans or cutting cakes out of them! (3)

Right now, we’re offering this cake pan at half price. Call us today at 123-4567 to reserve yours. (4)

Happy baking!

Sincerely,

Yummy Cooking Store

We equip amateur bakers with the tools they need to pull off even the toughest recipes and impress their family and friends.

P.S. Make sure to call today—the pans are going fast! (4)

#### Email Campaign Software

There are many different kinds of email campaign software, and the author recommends:

  * If you work with an ad agency or designer, let them use whatever system they’re already familiar with.
  * If you have a small email list, use MailChimp, which is simple and reliable.
  * If you have a large list that you need to segment, or you want advanced features, use Infusionsoft. 



### Step 4: Collect Testimonials About Transformation

**Testimonials are statements from previous customers that endorse your brand or product.** As we learned in Chapter 4 (Guide), testimonials establish authority. Additionally, they can act as transitional calls to action because they encourage customers to connect with your brand—when a customer sees that you’ve helped someone else get a happy ending, she wants the same ending for herself.

For example, one episode of a StoryBrand podcast included a testimonial interview with someone who achieved good results using the StoryBrand framework. After the episode was released, the number of new registrations for marketing workshops immediately and substantially increased.

#### Collect Your Testimonials

The best testimonials show that:

  * Your brand is valuable.
  * A customer had a positive experience working with you that culminated in results.



**Left to their own devices, customers might write general or unhelpful testimonials** (“My daughter is a wonderful artist! I recommend her paintings!”) either because they’re too busy to wordsmith or they’re not good at communicating. **To point them in the right direction, ask them questions that will lead them towards addressing the material you want:**

  * Before you encountered our product, what problem were you experiencing?
  * How did you feel while you were wrestling with this problem? Frustrated?
  * How is our product unique?
  * Describe the moment when you started to see the first signs of problem resolution due to our product.
  * Now that your problem is fixed, how has your life changed?



You can ask these questions in a form or a video interview. Once you have your answers, cut the questions and splice together the answers to create a testimonial.

**Once you have your testimonials, splash them on all your marketing material,** from email campaigns to events. (Shortform example: Zendesk has an entire page dedicated to testimonials.)

### Step 5: Build a Referral System

**A referral system encourages satisfied customers to recommend your brand to others.** According to studies by the American Marketing Association, recommendations and referrals are up to 250% more effective than other marketing efforts, and anecdotally, many business owners say that they get most of their new customers via word of mouth.

(To learn more about harnessing word of mouth, read our summary of Jonah Berger’s Contagious.)

#### Create Your Referral System

There’s a step-by-step process to creating a referral system:

**Step #1: Assemble a database of existing customers.** In order to help your current customers tell their friends about you, you need to know who your current customers are and how to contact them.

  * For example, Domino’s Pizza invites customers to create an account on their website through which they can order and pay for their pizzas online. Domino’s collects their contact information and can get in touch with them about anything from reorder reminders before sports events to a potential referral campaign.



**Step #2: Create a transitional call to action,** specifically a video or PDF, that customers can pass on to their friends. The video should show the solution to a problem.

  * For example, after finishing a project with a customer, you might send an email with a link to a video that says something along the lines of: We know many people experience this problem. You can pass this video along to anyone trying to fix this problem, and if they need more help, feel free to give them our contact information.



**Step #3: Reward customers for referrals (optional).** You can reward customers either: 1) by giving them a gift or discount if they recommend your brand and someone purchases as a result or 2) creating an affiliate program. An affiliate program gives a customer a percentage of the sale that resulted from them directing someone to you.

  * Reward example: A wedding photographer offered couples a free anniversary photo shoot if the couple could give her three referrals when they got married.
  * (Shortform example of an affiliate program: The Amazon Affiliate program works like this: Website owners place links to Amazon on their sites. When someone clicks through the link and buys something on Amazon, the website owner earns a small percentage of the sale.)



#### Automate Your Referral System

**You can use your email campaign software to set up an automatic referral system.** Whenever a customer places an order, set up a campaign that sends them a transitional call to action to share or notifies them about a potential reward if they make a referral. Make sure you set up the system so it stops sending these emails after a customer places multiple orders so they don’t get annoyed.
