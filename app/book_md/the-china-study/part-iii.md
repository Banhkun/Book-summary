## Part III: Guide to Good Nutrition | Chapter 11: Principles

Part III makes the findings from the studies detailed in Parts I and II actionable. A more comprehensive guide to nutrition, with meal plans and recipes, is available in Thomas M. Campbell’s companion book, _The China Study Solution_ , but this section also offers guidance on how to make a whole foods, plant-based diet work for you. The Campbells start by outlining eight key principles.

### The Eight Principles

#### Principle #1

**Various nutrients work together to achieve health.**

No single nutrient is responsible, on its own, for good health. The way food chemicals function in the body and the way they interact with each other are too complex to ever fully understand. The sum of all these chemicals working together is greater than the actions of each individual chemical.

This is why the “whole foods” part of the whole foods, plant-based diet is important. How nutrients are packaged together in food matters more than the specific nutrients themselves. This brings us to Principle #2.

#### Principle #2

**Avoid supplements—get your nutrients from food, not pills.**

Supplements are problematic for a variety of reasons. First of all, the whole concept of a supplement ignores Principle #1—it’s the whole food, not a particular nutrient, that provides the most benefit.

Additionally, supplements are poorly regulated, so you don’t really know what you’re getting when you buy them. They may have unforeseen side effects and some can cause harm. For example, many researchers caution against taking beta-carotene supplements because they’ve been shown to increase lung cancer risk.

Another problem is that supplements encourage people to eat poorly and “compensate” by taking pills.

##### Exceptions to Principle #2

**Vitamin B 12:** A WFPB diet doesn’t contain B12, which is found only in animal products. Supplements of this vitamin have been shown to be effective in resolving deficiencies and there’s no evidence they cause health problems.

**Vitamin D:** While we can usually get the vitamin D we need easily from the sun, some people living in northern climates won’t see enough daylight to meet their needs. Studies on the benefits of vitamin D supplements are inconclusive. Sunlight is still the best way to get your vitamin D.

We’ll discuss supplements in greater depth in Chapter 12.

#### Principle #3

**Almost any nutrient you can find in animal-based foods, you can find in a healthier form in plant-based foods.**

Plant foods have more of almost every nutrient, including fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Most animal foods lack these nutrients. In their place, they contain cholesterol and fat.

Animal foods do tend to have a little more protein than plant foods, but plant proteins are healthier.

##### Possible Exceptions to Principle #3

Nuts and seeds are high in fat. But these fats are healthier than animal fats and are accompanied by antioxidants.

Many dairy products are made low-fat using artificial processes. But this still leaves behind unhealthy proteins.

Many animal foods contain vitamin A, which most plant foods lack. But our bodies can easily make vitamin A from beta-carotene, found in plants.

Animal foods contain vitamin D, which plant foods don’t. But we can get all the vitamin D we need from sunlight. Further, vitamin D is toxic in high doses, so we’re in danger of getting too much from animal products.

**Vitamin B 12 is the only true exception.** As detailed in Principle #2, consider a vitamin B12 supplement if you eat a WFPB diet.

#### Principle #4

**Genes alone don’t cause disease—we have considerable control over which genes are expressed.**

Dormant genes, genes that aren’t expressed, have no effect on our health. Genes only affect us when they’re activated, and diet is one of the biggest triggers of gene activation.

As demonstrated by the cancer research discussed in Chapter 3, researchers can turn “bad” genes on and off by altering the amount of animal protein they give to mice.

The idea of dietary triggers explains why, in populations made up of people who share a genetic heritage, disease rates vary widely.

Further, genes evolve slowly, changing minimally, or not at all, over hundreds of years. But disease rates change at a much faster rate, sometimes in a period as short as a year. Therefore, we can’t blame changing genes for increasing disease rates.

In summary, genes give us dispositions, but they don’t dictate what diseases we’ll get.

#### Principle #5

**Good nutrition can counter carcinogens.**

As a society, we’re under the impression that carcinogens like DDT, Red Dye Number 2, and artificial sweeteners cause cancer (that is, when we’re not under the impression that genes cause cancer).

We like to blame carcinogens because, in some cases, they’re easier to avoid than whole food groups. But, like genes, carcinogens are often activated by diets high in animal protein.

Conversely, antioxidant-rich plant foods can diminish the potency of carcinogens.

#### Principle #6

**The same principles that prevent disease can reverse it.**

A WFPB diet can prevent heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. It’s also been shown to _reverse_ these diseases.

There are some exceptions, of course. Autoimmune diseases are largely irreversible. Still, a WFPB diet has been shown to slow the progress of even incurable diseases like Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.

#### Principle #7

**Nutrition that prevents one disease is probably beneficial for health in general.**

Regardless of _how_ whole, plant foods function to reduce your risk of various diseases, they seem to reduce risk across the board. Therefore, if you know that a WFPB diet is good for your heart, you can be pretty sure it’s also good for your brain, liver, kidneys, and nervous system.

#### Principle #8

**Good nutrition works holistically with physical activity, mental and emotional health, and our environments.**

Positive lifestyle changes work together and build off of one another to promote health. It jump-starts a cycle: Eating well gives us more energy. Having more energy makes it easier to exercise more. Exercising more promotes mental and emotional health. When we’re in a better mood, we eat healthier meals. Each lifestyle change reinforces the cycle of good health.

Eating a WFPB diet is also good for the planet. It allows us to use less water, less land, and fewer resources. Growing plants also generates far less pollution than raising livestock. Consequently, eating what’s best for our physical, mental, and emotional health is also what’s best for the planet.

* * *

With these principles in mind, let’s remind ourselves of just a few of **the benefits of a WFPB diet:**

  * Live a longer life
  * Look and feel younger and more energetic
  * Lose weight
  * Lower cholesterol and blood pressure
  * Prevent and reverse disease
  * Reduce the need for expensive surgeries
  * Decrease the chances that your child will develop an autoimmune disease



### A Note on Carbs and the Atkins Diet

As you may have noticed by now, the WFPB diet contains a lot of carbohydrates. The word “carbs” strikes fear in some hearts.

Even though the high-fat, high-protein, low-carb diet espoused by Robert Atkins has been widely discredited (more research coming next), our food culture remains highly influenced by it. Books like _The Zone Diet, The South Beach Diet, Grain Brain,_ and _The Paleo Diet_ continue to tell us that carbs are bad and fat is good.

A common argument in these books is that the low-fat diets of the past didn’t work. But Americans ate 13 more pounds of fat, _per person_ , in 1997 than they did in 1970. Although we spent much of the 90s reading and talking about low-fat diets, we never really _tried_ them.

Let’s look at the research on low-carb diets to quell our fear of carbohydrates.

#### Studies

A meta-analysis of 17 studies (with a total of 272,216 subjects) showed a 31% increase in deaths for people eating a low-carb diet.

Studies performed by the Atkins Center itself showed that 68% of people on its diet reported constipation, 63% had bad breath, and 10% experienced hair loss. The center also found **increases in kidney stones, vomiting, missed periods, high cholesterol, vitamin deficiencies, and calcium in the urine.**

How did Dr. Atkins address these known side effects of his diet? He recommended his patients each take over 30 supplements a day to rectify these “common” dieting issues.

Further, Paleo subjects, who also eat a high-fat, low-carb diet (they eliminate carbs from grains and legumes), show increased blood cholesterol and triglycerides.

Conversely, **_high_ -carb diets have been shown to reverse heart disease and diabetes, aid in weight loss, and prevent chronic diseases.** This may be because complex carbohydrates contain large amounts of vitamins, minerals, and accessible energy.

But these benefits only come from complex carbohydrates from whole foods like vegetables, fruits, and whole wheat pasta. Eating refined carbs in white pasta, white bread, candy, and desserts clearly won’t make you healthier.

#### Summary of Recommendations

  * Eat whole foods.
  * Avoid supplements, except for vitamin B12, if you eat a WFPB diet, and vitamin D, if you live in an area with limited daylight hours.
  * Eat high-carb, rather than low-carb, diets. But make sure you’re getting your carbohydrates from whole, not refined, foods.
