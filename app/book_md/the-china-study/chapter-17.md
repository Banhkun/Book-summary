## Chapter 17: Medicine as an Institution

Doctors rarely give nutrition or dietary advice. Why not? The Campbells cite ego, bias, inadequate training, incorrect assumptions, and the influence of the drug industry as potential issues.

### The Problems with Medicine as an Insititution

**Problem #1: Many doctors see a plant-based diet as too “extreme” to recommend.** Presumably, they don’t feel the same way about chemotherapy or life-threatening surgeries.

**Problem #2: Many doctors don’t think their patients will actually adopt a plant-based diet** , so they don’t suggest it, or they suggest it in passing. It’s not offered as a serious recommendation.

**Problem #3: Many doctors feel threatened** by the idea that foods can cure as well as (or better than) they can. They’ve spent years developing their skills and learning how to execute extremely complicated procedures. **It’s demoralizing to think that a patient could choose between eating more greens and having bypass surgery, and eating more greens might be the more effective choice.**

**Problem #4: Medical students get almost no training in nutrition.**

In 2010, medical students got an average of 20 hours of nutrition education. This is miniscule compared to their total hours of medical school coursework. Many of these “nutrition” hours focus on biochemistry and the metabolism rather than using food to prevent and treat illnesses. One survey found that **some students finish these courses and don’t even realize nutrition was covered in them.**

Aggravating the problem, **much of the educational material related to food and disease is supplied by the food industry** , including the Dannon Institute, the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, the National Dairy Council, and Nestlé. In 2003, 112 medical schools used nutrition curricula sponsored by food and drug companies.

Consequently, many doctors prescribe meal-replacement shakes for diabetics, milk for patients with osteoporosis, and high-fat, high-meat diets for people who want to lose weight. They don’t have the training to know better. There’s also little knowledge among doctors that diseases are reversible.

**Problem #5:** Traditionally, **drug companies paid many of the expenses of medical schools** , including education and research.

Although there’s evidence that direct marketing from drug companies in medical schools is decreasing, there are still many doctors who learned from pharmaceutical reps at their schools that there’s a pill for every problem.

Drug companies may influence medical students and schools by:

  * Giving students free gifts like paid entertainment and travel expenses.
  * Sponsoring “lectures” that are actually advertisements for the company’s products.
  * Designing the research conducted in medical schools and retaining the power to bury results they don’t like.
  * Using PR firms to write scientific articles, then attaching the names of willing students and doctors.
  * Providing the majority of the revenue of medical journals, which depend financially on drug advertisements.



The bias of doctors toward drug solutions is dangerous. 20% of new drugs will either be pulled from the market within 25 years or get a “black box warning,” meaning one of its side effects could result in death or serious injury. **100,000 patients in the U.S. die every year from taking their prescribed medications _correctly_.**

### Case Studies

The Campbells use the careers of two doctors, Dr. Esselstyn and Dr. McDougall, to demonstrate how being a doctor who departs from the norm and prescribes a plant-based diet can damage your medical career.

> **Dr. Esselstyn’s Story**
> 
> Surgeon Dr. Esselstyn, discussed in Chapter 5, has earned numerous accolades in his long career: He was President of Staff at the Cleveland Clinic, one of the best medical centers in the world, was president of the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, authored over 100 scientific articles, and was named one of the best doctors in America in the mid-90s.
> 
> Despite these honors, **many of Dr. Esselstyn’s patients failed to get better, and he didn’t understand why. He was doing everything right** , according to what he’d been taught in medical school.
> 
> When he decided to try treating his heart disease patients with a plant-based diet (detailed in Chapter 5), he got the most impressive results of any study on reversing heart disease. You’d think that the medical community would be thrilled by Esselstyn’s success, but **his treatment of heart disease with a plant-based diet alienated him from his peers.**
> 
> When Esselstyn and his wife (whose grandfather was the founder of the Cleveland Clinic) developed an economical program for treating heart disease patients with a plant-based diet, **the Cleveland Clinic wanted nothing to do with it.**
> 
> Esselstyn had had a long career with the clinic as one of its star surgeons. Now, the head of the hospital and the department head wouldn’t even return his calls.
> 
> Oddly, many of the Cleveland Clinic’s senior staff members had used Esselstyn’s diet-based treatment to reverse their own heart disease. They knew it worked. But **they weren’t willing to offer a program that competed with their traditional menu of medical options (and, presumably, the money these options brought to the clinic).**
> 
> Update: Since the book’s first publication, the Cleveland Clinic _has_ accepted Esselstyn’s proposal for a program that fights heart disease with lifestyle changes.

> **Dr. McDougall’s Story**
> 
> Like Dr. Esselstyn, Dr. John McDougall discovered the power of a plant-based diet after being continually frustrated by his inability to heal people using traditional methods. McDougall decided his failure was the result of not enough education, so he began a residency in Hawaii, hoping to discover what he was doing wrong.
> 
> However, what he discovered was that **the most experienced doctors did no better than he did** when it came to healing patients**.** Consequently, he started to explore alternative options.
> 
> One alternative option was using diet to heal illness. At the medical center, doctors considered the science linking diet and heart disease controversial at best. But McDougall read the literature and couldn’t find anything controversial about it.
> 
> But McDougall quickly learned that **dietary treatments weren’t valid options where he worked in Hawaii.** When McDougall told one man that changing his diet might reverse his heart disease, the Chief of Medicine made it clear that if he continued to give this information to patients, his job, and, consequently, the rest of his medical career, would be in serious jeopardy.
> 
> In Hawaii, McDougall had to stop talking about diet with patients. But then he accepted a job in California where he ran a program treating patients with lifestyle changes, including a plant-based diet. **He successfully treated over 2,000 patients over sixteen years.**
> 
> However, the program didn’t have the support of the hospital administrators or McDougall’s colleagues, making it hard for him to do his job and widen his impact.
> 
> For example, McDougall would refer some of his patients to cardiologists at the hospital (they never reciprocated and referred their patients to McDougall). **These cardiologists repeatedly recommended unnecessary bypass surgeries** to McDougall’s patients. When McDougall asked one of the doctors why, the doctor wouldn’t (or couldn’t) explain his decision to recommend surgery.
> 
> The final straw for McDougall was when the hospital had the chance to head a major program involving diet and multiple sclerosis. Administrators said people with MS weren’t “desirable” patients, presumably because they couldn’t be cured. McDougall realized that doing whatever it could to promote the health of _all_ patients wasn’t one of the hospital’s priorities.
> 
> McDougall left the program in California and now runs his own. Despite his vast experience and his phenomenal record, the medical establishment doesn’t seem to be interested in what he has to offer.

#### Signs of Progress Since the First Publication of _The China Study_ :

  * In the last decade, many medical schools have placed limits on how drug companies market their products to medical students.
  * The Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute has partnered with Dr. Esselstyn to offer a seminar on lifestyle changes to treat heart disease.
  * Conferences focused on plant-based nutrition have proliferated across the country.
  * One of the largest health systems in America, Kaiser Permanente, recommends that doctors encourage all their patients to adopt plant-based diets.
  * Some major medical centers now have nutrition programs for patients who’d like to try dietary changes before resorting to surgery or drugs.



### Summary of Recommendations

When in need of treatment, explore your options. Although highly trained, your doctor may not have the nutrition knowledge to recommend lifestyle changes that could serve as alternatives to surgery or drugs.
