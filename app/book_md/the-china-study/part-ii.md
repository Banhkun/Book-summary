## Part II: Diseases of Affluence | Chapter 5: Heart Disease

Part II dives into the diseases of affluence that afflict Westerners in particular: heart disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and autoimmune diseases. Each chapter discusses the ways in which the rich diets of our Western privilege are killing us. These chapters also detail how a whole foods, plant-based diet can heal us.

### Heart Disease

The first disease of affluence discussed is heart disease. **Heart disease has been the leading cause of death in the U.S. for almost 100 years, killing 40% of Americans** and leading to 3,000 heart attacks in America every day.

Still, women tend to worry more about breast cancer, even though they’re eight times more likely to die of heart disease. Young people should also be vigilant—heart disease exists even in those who are in their 20s and seemingly healthy. One study examined 300 soldiers killed in the Korean War, none of whom had been diagnosed with heart problems. Their average age was 22. When researchers dissected their hearts, they found that 77.3% had major evidence of heart disease.

#### The Risk Factors and Mechanisms of Heart Disease

High cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity are all risk factors for heart disease. Almost all of these risk factors contribute in some way to plaque buildup in the arteries.

##### The Role of Plaque in Heart Disease

Plaque is made up of cholesterol, proteins, and immune system cells, among other components. Together, they create a greasy layer lining the walls of the coronary arteries.

You can think of the coronary arteries like garden hoses. Plaque accumulating in an artery is like putting an increasingly acute kink in the hose. Blood flow turns to a trickle. Plaque buildup leads to angina, or chest pain.

##### Heart Attacks

Counterintuitively, having more plaque buildup doesn’t necessarily mean you have a higher heart attack risk. **Heart attacks are more likely to happen when plaque blocks _less_ than 50% of the artery.**

This is because thinner layers of plaque have weaker caps. Caps are layers of cells that can separate from the core of the plaque.

Blood surging through the arteries can cause a cap to rupture. When this happens, some of the contents of the plaque mix with the blood, and a clot forms at the rupture site. The clot can get so big that it blocks the whole artery.

Consequently, the heart doesn’t get enough blood (or the oxygen it carries), and cells in the heart start to die. This is a heart attack. **One-third of heart attacks are fatal.**

Because we can’t know when caps will rupture, heart attacks are hard to predict. But because we know the risk factors of heart disease, Westerners are finally starting to view it as one of the few diseases we have some control over.

#### The Drawbacks of Technological Advances

As a society, we’ve become savvier about the impact on heart disease of lifestyle choices like smoking and exercise. But lifestyle choices haven’t been the primary focus of scientists and medical centers.

As heart disease has remained the primary killer in America, doctors, researchers, and institutions have devoted huge amounts of time, money, and energy to developing new surgeries, drugs, and devices to save lives.

In some ways, this push for better technology and medicine has been effective. For example, emergency room treatment has improved dramatically. From 1970, the chance of dying in the ER from a heart attack has fallen from 38% to 15%. Drug and surgery advances, combined with decreasing smoking rates, have resulted in a 58% decline in the disease’s death rate.

But while heart disease isn’t as fatal as it once was, **we’re still getting heart disease at the same rate we were in the 1970s.** And it still kills 2,000 Americans every day.

Let’s look at one revolutionary surgery that actually may do more harm than good.

##### The Limits of Bypass Surgery

During bypass surgery, surgeons restore blood flow to the heart by cutting out a chest artery or leg vein and connecting it to the heart, bypassing the clogged artery. In 1990, 1 out of every 750 Americans underwent a bypass surgery.

While bypass surgery was a major medical development, it’s not without its problems:

**Problem #1: It can be fatal.** 1 in 50 people die of complications.

**Problem #2: It’s expensive.** In 2011, a single bypass surgery cost between $70,000 and $200,000. The American Heart Association predicts a rise in the total cost of treating heart disease in America from $273 billion in 2011 to $818 billion in 2030.

**Problem #3: There are dangerous side effects,** including respiratory issues, infection, heart attacks, high blood pressure, and strokes. Clamping the vessels shut during the operation causes plaque debris to travel to the brain. This results in a series of mini-strokes. 79% of patients are cognitively impaired a week after surgery and may experience impairment long after that.

**Problem #4: It’s ineffective.** Within 3 years of the surgery, chest pain returns for one-third of patients. Within 10 years, half of bypass patients have chest pain, have had a heart attack, or have died. Additionally, studies show that people who have bypass surgeries don’t have fewer heart attacks than those who don’t.

#### The Advantages of Diet as Prevention and Treatment

Many studies over the past 50 years have demonstrated that the U.S. has some of the highest rates of heart disease in the world, even compared with other Western countries. (Since the first publication of the book, a few Western countries have surpassed the U.S. in heart disease deaths.)

Surgery and drugs are not the only ways to treat this ubiquitous disease of affluence.

When compared with societies that eat a traditional (non-Westernized) diet, the difference is dramatic. These studies generally demonstrate that **the countries whose citizens eat the least saturated fat and animal protein and the most plant foods have the lowest risk of heart disease.**

If you’re a heart disease patient, there are many reasons you might try changing your diet to manage your disease before taking prescription medications or having surgery.

**Benefit #1: Diet is a safer treatment than surgery or medication.** There are no known detrimental effects of eating a WFPB diet.

**Benefit #2: Diet is a cheaper treatment than surgery or medication.** Compared to the cost of bypass surgery, which can set individuals and insurance companies back $200,000, dietary counseling costs about $900, and year-long diet and lifestyle intervention programs cost around $7,000.

**Benefit #3:** As we’ll see in the Esselstyn and Ornish studies below, **diet is a more effective treatment than surgery or medication.**

#### Research

Two studies, one recent and one conducted over half a century ago, demonstrate the impact of diet on heart disease.

> **Research Study #1: The Impact of Genes, Smoking, and Diet on Heart Disease**
> 
> One study looked at Japanese men living in Hawaii, California, and Japan. Those living in Hawaii and California had far higher rates of coronary heart disease than their counterparts living in Japan.
> 
>   * **The Impact of Genes:** Because these men shared a genetic heritage, genes were not the primary determining factor in developing heart disease.
> 

>   * **The Impact of Smoking:** Men in Japan smoked _more_ than Japanese men in Hawaii and California, and they still experienced fewer incidences of heart disease. This indicates that smoking is also not the most important factor in determining heart disease risk.
> 

> 
> The researchers concluded that **diet had the most impact on heart disease risk.** They found that the study participants who had a diet high in saturated fats, animal protein, and dietary cholesterol had higher blood cholesterol levels, a risk factor of heart disease.

> **Research Study #2: 1946 Los Angeles Study**
> 
> In 1946, it was already clear that diet had a major impact on heart disease. One doctor conducted a study in which he asked 50 of his patients (Group A), all heart attack survivors, to continue eating as they normally would, and another 50 patients (Group B), also heart attack survivors, to eat a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.
> 
> Group B was allowed only 4 ounces of meat a day. They weren’t allowed to eat pork, animal fats, cream, butter, egg yolks, whole milk, or anything made with these ingredients.
> 
> **Results:**
> 
> 8 years out:
> 
>   * Only 24% of Group A patients, those eating the standard American diet, were alive.
> 
>   * 56% of Group B patients, those eating a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, were alive.
> 
> 

> 
> 12 years out:
> 
>   * 0% of Group A patients were still alive.
> 
>   * 38% of Group B patients were still alive.
> 
> 

> 
> Group B’s low-fat, low-cholesterol diet severely limited their intake of animal foods, and dramatically increased their potential lifespans.

##### Fat and Cholesterol—The Main Culprits?

Early research studies like the one above focused on the roles of fat and cholesterol in heart disease. No one considered that the amount of fat and cholesterol you consumed might merely be indicative of how much animal-based food you were eating.

More recent studies have indicated that, **in addition to fat and cholesterol consumption, eating animal protein increases your risk of heart disease.**

In one study, researchers fed casein (a milk protein) to rats, rabbits, and pigs. They found that casein alone, independent of fat and dietary cholesterol, raised the animals’ blood cholesterol levels.

Conversely, feeding animals soy protein dramatically decreased their blood cholesterol levels, and human studies have indicated that **eating plant protein has even more power to decrease cholesterol levels than decreasing fat or dietary cholesterol intake.**

#### Pioneers in the Use of Diet to Prevent and Treat Heart Disease

Some of the most impressive recent research on the subject of diet and heart disease has come from doctors and researchers Caldwell B. Esselstyn, Jr. and Dean Ornish.

> **Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn**
> 
> A Yale graduate and former army surgeon, Esselstyn has held many leadership positions at the Cleveland Clinic, the best center for cardiac care in the country, and in the 1990s he was named one of the best doctors in America.
> 
> Esselstyn’s prescription of **small amounts of cholesterol-lowering medication combined with a plant-based diet has gotten some of the best results ever recorded in the treatment of this disease.**
> 
> In a study he began in 1985, Esselstyn instructed his patients with advanced heart disease to avoid meat, fish, oil and most dairy products. (Five years into the program, Esselstyn changed his recommendation to no dairy products.)
> 
> For five years, Esselstyn met with his patients every two weeks to discuss their diet and measure blood cholesterol, blood pressure, and weight. In the evening, Esselstyn would call the patient to discuss the test results.
> 
> **Results:**
> 
> Over five years, **cholesterol dropped** from an average of 246 mg/dL to 132 mg/dL, far below the generally recommended 150 mg/dL target.
> 
> **Clogged arteries opened** in 70% of the patients, effectively reversing their disease.
> 
> In the eight years prior to the start of the study, the 18 participants had had a combined 49 coronary events, including bypass surgery, angioplasty, strokes, and heart attacks. But in the 11 years after the start of the study, **there was only _one_ coronary event among the 18 patients**, and the patient who experienced that event had strayed from the dietary recommendations for two years. (When he started to experience chest pain, the single “coronary event” in the study, the patient went back to the plant-based diet and the chest pain disappeared.)
> 
> In contrast, the five participants who dropped out of the program near its start had a combined ten new coronary events in ten years.
> 
> 17 years out, **only one patient in the study had died.** 25 years out, all but five of the original participants were still alive (and the five who passed hadn’t died from coronary heart disease).
> 
> In a larger study published in 2014, Esselstyn tracked 198 patients. 177 patients stuck to his dietary program. 21 did not. Over about four years, **only one of the 177 compliant patients had a stroke.** Among the 21 noncompliant patients, 62% suffered strokes.
> 
> Dr. Esselstyn’s results, <1% stroke rate versus 62%, seem to indicate that he’s found a cure to heart disease. However, as we’ll see in Part III, many doctors still hesitate to seriously recommend this dietary cure to their patients.

> **Dr. Dean Ornish**
> 
> A graduate of Harvard Medical School and a popular figure in the media, Dean Ornish is also a pioneer in the field of treating heart disease with dietary changes. We have Dr. Ornish to thank for some insurance companies covering diet-based disease prevention programs.
> 
> **The Lifestyle Heart Trial**
> 
> In this well-known study, Ornish treated Group A with only lifestyle changes. He put Group B on a standard treatment plan.
> 
> **The Diet of Group A**
> 
>   * A low-fat, plant-based diet
> 
>   * Up to 10% of their calories could come from fat
> 
>   * They could eat as much as they wanted of the foods on their list, which included fruits, vegetables, and grains.
> 
>   * The only animal products allowed were egg whites and one cup of nonfat milk or yogurt.
> 
> 

> 
> Group A also practiced a form of stress relief like meditation or relaxation exercises for at least an hour a day.
> 
> **Results:**
> 
> Group A:
> 
>   * **Cholesterol dropped** from an average of 227 mg/dL to 172 mg/dL. “Bad” LDL cholesterol decreased from 152 mg/dL to 95 mg/dL.
> 
>   * Patients experienced a **91% reduction in chest pain.**
> 
>   * **Artery blockage decreased** by an average of 4%, which is a huge result after only a year.
> 
>   * Over one year, **82% reversed their heart disease** , indicated by a reduction in artery blockage.
> 
> 

> 
> Group B:
> 
>   * Patients experienced a **162% increase in chest pain.**
> 
>   * **Artery blockage increased** by an average of 8%.
> 
> 

> 
> In 1993, Ornish brought the program to eight sites, and by 1998, 40 insurance programs were covering the costs for many of its patients.

#### Why Don’t Doctors Recommend the Diet Treatment?

Some doctors have criticized Esselstyn and Ornish, saying their treatments are extreme and that patients won’t adopt these diets. **This can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.**

If doctors don’t believe patients will follow a plant-based diet, they won’t recommend it, or they’ll mention it in a disparaging, glib way. If this is how the diet is presented to patients (if it’s presented to them at all), they aren’t likely to follow through with it.

When doctors let their personal biases regarding diet affect their recommendations, they disrespect the patient. In doing so, they make several often-incorrect assumptions:

  * **Assumption #1:** That the patient doesn’t want to know lifesaving information.
  * **Assumption #2:** That the patient isn’t willing to do whatever it takes to treat his or her disease.
  * **Assumption #3:** That a plant-based diet is more extreme than invasive surgeries that open a patient’s chest, cut out veins or arteries, and reroute blood flow.



Health organizations such as the American Heart Association and the National Cholesterol Education Program make the same assumptions. **They withhold information in favor of recommending “moderation.”** They appear to worry that if they recommend the diets that are actually proven to prevent and reverse heart disease, no one will listen to them.

For instance, these organizations tell us that a cholesterol level of 200 mg/dL should be our target, even though **studies show that 35% of heart attacks happen to people whose cholesterol is well below 200 mg/dL.**

They also tell us that 30% or fewer of our calories should come from fat when studies show that **we only make real progress in preventing and reversing heart disease when fat is less than 10% of our total calories.**

Finally, they tell us that even if we adopt these dietary changes, we’ll probably need to be on medication for the rest of our lives anyway. This discourages patients from even trying to alter their diets.

### Summary of Recommendations

  * To prevent or treat heart disease, get less than 10% of your calories from fat. Cutting out animal foods makes this easier.
  * Cut out foods containing dietary cholesterol (this comes almost solely from animal foods).
  * Reduce your intake of milk products—casein has been shown to increase cholesterol levels.
