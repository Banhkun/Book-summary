## Chapter 2: Chasing Leads

After hearing from McGowan in February, Farrow was on a mission. He realized that the Weinstein story was explosive—a Hollywood mogul who operated openly as a sexual predator and whose crimes were widely known and sanctioned by seemingly everyone in the entertainment industry.

He was chasing leads, talking to people throughout the film world who knew Weinstein or had worked with him. The stories were always the same: Weinstein committing sexual assault against women and then using his money and power to bully them into silence. Yet almost no one was willing to go on record and use Weinstein’s name in a published piece of reporting. His stranglehold seemed unbreakable.

Several names kept popping up during the course of his conversations with sources, including actresses Rosanna Arquette and Annabella Sciorra. But**Farrow was particularly interested in the only Weinstein assault survivor whose account had actually made it into the legal system: Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.**

### Ambra Battilana Gutierrez

In 2015, Gutierrez had filed a report with the New York City Police Department against Weinstein, claiming that he had groped her at his Tribeca hotel. This had resulted in Weinstein being brought in for questioning by the detectives, but nothing ever came of the incident. **He was never charged, and story, strangely,** **received almost no press coverage.** Knowing that he would need testimony in addition to McGowan’s for the story, Farrow set out to talk to Gutierrez.

He met with her in New York, where she described what had happened between her and Weinstein. Gutierrez was an Italian model who had been invited to see the _New York Spring Spectacular_ at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, a show produced by Weinstein. At a reception after the show, Weinstein asked to meet with her, claiming that Gutierrez looked like actress Mila Kunis and that he wanted to discuss next steps in her career.

When she arrived at his Tribeca office the next morning, Weinstein leered at her body, asking if her breasts were real. **He then proceeded to grope her breasts and tried to force his hand up her skirt** —behavior which Gutierrez made abundantly clear to Weinstein was unwanted. After she protested, he backed off, but insisted that Gutierrez meet him at the bar at his hotel the next evening.

Traumatized by her experience at Weinstein’s office, Gutierrez went to the police and told them what Weinstein had attempted to do. Officers from the NYPD’s Special Victims Division came up with a plan for Gutierrez to meet with Weinstein that evening, wearing a recording device that she could use to extract a confession from him. She was frightened, but determined. She knew that going after Weinstein could mean the end of her career, but she was willing to take that risk if it meant stopping him from committing more sexual assaults.

When she met with Weinstein the next night at the hotel bar, he suddenly insisted that they go to his penthouse suite (another echo of his operating procedure with McGowan nearly two decades before). Although she was wearing a recording device and there were undercover agents posted at the hotel, she was terrified at the thought of going up to the suite alone with him.

On the elevator ride up, however, she extracted a confession from him. As she protested going up to the room, she demanded to know why he had groped her the day before. His response, caught on tape, was, “Oh, please, I’m sorry, just come on in. I’m used to that. Come on. Please.” **With these few words, Weinstein had admitted that he’d assaulted Gutierrez the day before, and that it was part of a longstanding pattern of abuse of women—“I’m used to that.”**

#### A Miscarriage of Justice

After this admission from Weinstein, Gutierrez managed to extricate herself from going up to his suite. When they arrived back in the lobby, the undercover officers (who had been listening to the whole exchange) insisted that Weinstein accompany them back to the police station for questioning, although he was not formally charged.

What he had admitted to on tape was punishable by up to three months in jail. With the audio recording, it seemed like an open-and-shut case for the Manhattan District Attorney’s office. But it wasn’t. When Gutierrez was questioned by the Sex Crimes Unit of the DA’s office, they seemed more interested in _her_ personal sexual history and career as a lingerie model than they were about the incident with Weinstein.

This was similar to the response McGowan had faced, when she was told that she would be unsuccessful bringing criminal charges against Weinstein because of work she had done in her acting career. **Two weeks later, the Manhattan DA (notably, a recipient of campaign money from David Boies, a key member of Weinstein’s legal team) announced that he would _not_ be bringing charges against Weinstein. **

While the legal case evaporated, the tabloids began running with salacious and untrue stories about Gutierrez: that she had a promiscuous sex life (as if that were somehow relevant), that she had been the mistress of disgraced former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Burlusconi, and even that she had once been a prostitute. These magazines—the _Enquirer_ chief among them—were waging a full-on smear campaign against Gutierrez. Meanwhile, coverage of the Weinstein incident itself simply dried up. The much-feared Weinstein PR machine had gone into full gear.

Just a few weeks later, the seriously intimidated and frightened Gutierrez joined the ranks of women who signed NDAs following an assault at the hands of Weinstein. **In exchange for a $1 million payment, she was prohibited from speaking about what happened to her** as well as her attempt to bring him to justice. She was also ordered to hand over to Weinstein’s attorneys all copies of the audio recording from the attempted sting operation, who would then destroy them.

#### Recovering the Recording

**Luckily for Farrow, Gutierrez did _not_ fully comply with the demand that she hand over all copies of the audio** in which Weinstein admitted to groping her. She had wanted to preserve some record of her ordeal. Before handing over the audio to Weinstein’s legal team, she emailed the file to herself at a throwaway email account, then cleared her sent folder. She then downloaded the file onto an old laptop that the attorneys never found, before deactivating the throwaway email account as well. Through this resourceful maneuvering, she had kept the record of her story alive.

When she told Farrow about the existence of this audio, he was cautious. His bosses at NBC News warned him that he could land the network (and himself) in legal trouble if Gutierrez transferred the file to him, as he would be encouraging her to illegally violate the NDA she had signed.

But Gutierrez and Farrow found a way around this roadblock. She played him the recording from the old laptop, which he then recorded on his own phone. This technically did not violate the NDA, because no files were transferred. It wasn’t the same recording that Gutierrez had been ordered to destroy—it was a _recording_ of that recording, which made it an entirely new piece of intellectual property, one that was not covered by the NDA. **Farrow now had concrete and undeniable proof of Weinstein’s predatory behavior.**

But Weinstein wouldn’t go down that easily. He had vast wealth, power, and influence that he could bring to bear to stop any attempt to expose his crimes. As Farrow would learn, Weinstein was fully prepared to fight back—by any means necessary.

### The Weinstein Machine

**Harvey Weinstein had vast connections throughout the world of media and entertainment that he could use to snuff out any negative story**. He was often boastful about his ability to stamp out damaging press coverage and shape the news cycle with a few well-placed phone calls to his contacts. He had at his disposal a powerful and well-oiled intelligence-gathering operation that would tell him which sources were talking to which reporters and which news organizations were working on stories about him. Through his network of attorneys, PR officers, agents, producers, and even hired spies, Weinstein had, for decades, successfully strangled all attempts to bring his misconduct to light.

NBC News was hardly immune to this pressure campaign. Very early on in Farrow’s investigation, Weinstein’s contacts at the network had informed him that Farrow was working on a story and even identified his sources. **In October 2016, he had engaged the services of Israeli private security firm Black Cube—founded and run by former agents of the Mossad, Israel’s national intelligence service.** Under contract for Weinstein, they would later be tasked with surveilling Farrow and tracking his cell phone. The purpose of this espionage was to find any possible dirt on the journalist that could be used to blackmail him and discredit his story. Farrow also received cryptic death threats through text messages to his personal phone. It was all part of the Weinstein strategy of intimidation, blackmail, and deception.

And, indeed, the deception was all-encompassing. Early in his process of investigating the story, for example, Farrow reached out to the attorney Lisa Bloom. Bloom was a powerful attorney who was well-known for defending survivors of sexual assault and, crucially, had been a vocal defender of Farrow’s sister Dylan when the latter accused her father of molestation. Bloom was, to Farrow, a close friend.

But even _she_ could not be trusted—for Bloom, too, was on the Weinstein payroll. Bloom was advising the serial rapist on the best tactics to use to smear and discredit his accusers, while publicly presenting herself as a champion and defender of women. In a chilling display of treachery, she used her relationship with Farrow to try and get him to kill his own story, on behalf of her true client, Harvey Weinstein.

Black Cube also used double agents to infiltrate Farrow’s _sources_ , forging friendships with these women by posing as journalists, activists, or philanthropists who were ostensibly interested in their experiences as survivors of sexual assault. One spy, using the alias Diana Filip, claimed to be a representative from a financial services company called Reuben Capital Partners (which did not exist). In this capacity, she targeted Rose McGowan and befriended the actress, telling McGowan that her firm was interested in honoring her for her advocacy work. **Through this “friendship,” McGowan unwittingly revealed crucial information about her sexual assault and Farrow’s story to a hired agent of Weinstein.**

### Pressure at NBC

**Weinstein was also able to exert significant pressure at NBC** , through his connections with Noah Oppenheim, president of NBC News; Phil Griffin, president of MSNBC; and Andy Lack, chairman of NBC News and MSNBC. These were the three most senior figures at NBC News and had the power to stop any story dead in its tracks, and Weinstein had easy and regular contact with all of them. In fact, Weinstein’s brusque demands to his assistants to, “Get me Phil, get me Andy, get me Noah” were so common that the assistants began to dub them “the triumvirate.”

After securing the Gutierrez audio, Farrow and his producer, Rich McHugh, thought they had the smoking gun on Weinstein. Backed by the interviews they had already done with dozens of Weinstein associates and McGowan’s story, the facts of Weinstein’s behavior over the years were beyond any reasonable doubt. It was a thoroughly corroborated, well-researched, bombshell story about a public figure. It easily met the standards of both credibility and newsworthiness.

**But, from the outset, Farrow encountered a strange reluctance on the part of his bosses to explore the story.** Although they hadn’t known that Weinstein was McGowan’s rapist when they suggested Farrow investigate her accusatory tweet, they had a very different attitude now that they _did_ know. They demanded evidence well above and beyond the standard that would have typically been applied for such a news story. They cast doubt on the credibility of Farrow’s sources, particularly McGowan. Even when he played the audio of Weinstein admitting to a pattern of sexual assault, Oppenheim hedged and split hairs, asking, “What does this really prove?”

The president of NBC News also repeatedly questioned the newsworthiness of the story, even going so far as to argue (absurdly) that Weinstein was an obscure figure who most _Today_ viewers had barely heard of. Oppenheim even argued that Farrow had a personal vendetta against Weinstein because the latter had worked with Farrow’s estranged father (a ridiculous claim, as Weinstein had worked with nearly _everyone_ in Hollywood). He claimed that Farrow was acting more as a crusader against sexual abuse than an objective reporter.

**Farrow and McHugh were ordered several times to halt their investigation** , with the justifications for the order always changing, from fact-checking concerns, to a need to run the story by the NBC legal team. Approvals that would normally have come from within NBC News were suddenly being kicked upstairs to NBC corporate and even to the network’s parent company, Comcast. This was all highly unusual, especially for a story with as much solid evidence as Farrow’s. Unbeknownst to Farrow, Phil Griffin, president of MSNBC, had already personally promised Weinstein that the story had been nixed.

#### Interference with Contract

**Oppenheim also used dubious reasoning to question the legality of some of the reporting**. He claimed that airing a news piece acknowledging the existence of the NDAs could put NBC in legal jeopardy. Farrow (who was also a lawyer) found this to be a weak argument: as a news organization, they aired stories from government and corporate whistleblowers all the time, sources who were almost certainly violating some sort of contract they had signed. By Oppenheim’s reasoning, most investigative journalism—most _journalism_ , period—would be impossible.

As Farrow was assembling pieces of the story, he also knew that he needed Rose McGowan on video, describing her experiences and specifically naming Harvey Weinstein as her rapist. Although McGowan was reluctant to take the risk to go on camera, she agreed to book time to shoot the interview with Farrow in Los Angeles.

But before he set to fly out there, **NBC ordered Farrow to put a “pause” on the story, while the news division sought approval from Comcast—NBC’s parent company**. Weinstein had infiltrated the network through his contacts and was using his influence to get Farrow’s bosses to kill the story. The shoddy rationale they offered to Farrow was that shooting the McGowan interview would constitute tortious interference (encouraging McGowan to violate her NDA).

Again, this made no sense. If there was potential legal trouble for NBC with McGowan, the liability would be in _airing_ her interview, not in merely _shooting_ it. They could always decide to cut it before the package went to air. But NBC was insistent that the story come to a halt until these “issues” could be resolved.

To McGowan, the wavering, uncertainty, and delays on NBC’s part proved her fears correct: she wasn’t being taken seriously. Distraught, she cancelled the interview with Farrow and declared that she could not speak to him or appear in the segment. The damage had been done and NBC had killed a major part of its own story.

From Farrow’s point of view, the situation was absurd: **he was sitting on a major story and his own news network was handicapping his efforts to bring it to light.** He and McHugh decided to go against the wishes of their bosses, continuing to schedule further interviews with Weinstein’s accusers. Farrow was committed to the story and was willing to go rogue to see it through.
