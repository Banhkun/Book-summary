## Exercise: Highlighting Exploitation

Think about how authority can turn to abuse.

* * *

Have you ever been in a professional setting where someone abused their authority over subordinates in some way? Describe the situation.

Why do you think this boss felt that they could get away with this?

In thinking about this situation, what do you think you would do in the future if you saw a boss abusing their authority this way?
