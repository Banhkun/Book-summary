## Exercise: Decide What You Want to Improve First

In _The Unplugged Alpha_ , Cooper suggests that if you want to become dominant, you must start by evaluating your current level on a scale of 1-10. If you have a score below eight, you’re not yet a dominant and need to improve yourself in several areas. In this section, we’ll help you decide _where_ to start improving yourself.

* * *

Briefly describe your current level and why you gave yourself that score. Relevant factors might include your salary and your looks.

Which area has the most room for improvement? For example, it might be your masculinity, your finances, your social skills, or how much respect you command.

Imagine what an eight in that area would look like for you, and set a goal that would help you achieve it. For example, if you’re not happy with your masculinity, reaching an eight might mean getting to a certain skill level in a martial art of your choosing.

What is an actionable step you can take today to reach that goal? For example, if you want to get good at a martial art, you could sign up for a trial class at a nearby dojo.
