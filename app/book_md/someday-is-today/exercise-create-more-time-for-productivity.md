## Exercise: Create More Time for Productivity

Dicks recommends boosting your chances of success by using every spare moment to do something productive. But to have more spare time, you must maximize your time and efficiency. In this exercise, we’ll identify the time-wasters that you can eliminate and tasks that you can complete efficiently to create more spare time for working toward your goals.

* * *

Record five to 10 routine tasks that you perform daily and the amount of time you spend completing each one: for example, scrolling on your phone before getting out of bed—10 minutes, making breakfast—15 minutes, reading your email—10 minutes, and so on.

Identify whether each task you listed is necessary. Cross the unnecessary tasks off your task list and stop doing them. For the necessary tasks, estimate the minimum amount of time you can complete them in and make this your new goal. (For example, scrolling on your phone is unnecessary, so stop doing it; making breakfast is necessary, but you can probably get it done in five minutes rather than 15.)

Now that you’ve eliminated unnecessary tasks and minimized the time allotted to complete necessary ones, consider whether you can combine any tasks (multitask) to get things done faster. (For example, rather than taking five minutes to eat breakfast and five minutes to check your email, combine these tasks and check your email _while_ you eat breakfast.)

At this point, you’ve gotten rid of unnecessary tasks, minimized time spent on necessary tasks, and identified areas where you can multitask. Record how much time you’ve now saved and how you’ll use that extra time to make progress toward your goals. (For example, if you’ve gotten rid of three unnecessary tasks that typically take 10 minutes each, reduced two 10-minute tasks to 5 minutes, and then combined those two tasks, you’ve saved 45 minutes each morning. You can now use this time to send in audition tapes to progress toward your goal of being an actor.)
