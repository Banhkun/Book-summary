## 1-Page Summary

In _Order from Chaos_ , Jaclyn Paul argues that people with ADHD face organizational challenges that can make their lives feel chaotic and frustrating. By implementing Paul’s strategies and systems, though, ADHDers can gain control over their lives and find greater peace. The process of getting organized starts with learning about yourself and how your brain works, and then using this understanding to identify your unique needs and preferences. After that, you can take concrete steps toward improving your organization by finding ways to contain your current mess and then finding the right system for managing any new task or project that comes into your life.

Paul is a best-selling author and blogger with ADHD. She has written for such publications as _ADHD Roller Coaster_ and _Houston Family Magazine_. She’s also published the novel _She’s Not Home_ under the pen name Lena George.

In this guide, we’ll first explain what ADHD is and how it affects cognitive functioning. Then, we’ll move on to the first step of getting organized, which is to get to know yourself and how your ADHD affects you personally. Then, we’ll discuss the second step, which is to contain your current state of disorganization, and finally the third step, which is to implement your organizational system. We’ll add information about how ADHD works and the other traits that accompany it, as well as advice from other experts on how to stay organized.

### What is ADHD and How Does It Affect Functioning?

ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a neurobiological condition that impairs working memory and executive function, among other things. Working memory is the capacity to hold information in our brains for immediate use in the short term, such as remembering what you need to retrieve when you walk into another room. Executive functioning refers to a set of skills related to planning ahead and making decisions. Everyone struggles with working memory and executive function from time to time, but for people with ADHD, these deficits occur at a severity and frequency that substantially interferes with their daily lives.

(Shortform note: An estimated 2.8% of adults have ADHD. As Paul’s definition of the condition suggests, ADHD is not characterized by a lack of understanding of what you’re supposed to do, but rather an inability to perform the skills expected of you. While Paul’s definition of ADHD frames executive function and working memory as separate functions, other experts suggest that working memory is a subset of executive functioning, alongside mental flexibility and self-control (both of which are also affected by ADHD).)

According to Paul, ADHD can cause you to be constantly distracted by both your own thoughts and your environment. It can also cause you to make impulsive decisions, struggle to stop a task once you’ve begun it, and have difficulty conforming to common organizational methods. These and other traits can make you disorganized, and being disorganized can then make your symptoms worse, creating a negative cycle.

(Shortform note: The feeling of being perpetually disorganized can make you feel overwhelmed, leading some experts to refer to this negative cycle as “The Cycle of Overwhelm.” This cycle often leads to and is reinforced by ADHD burnout, a state of exhaustion and hopelessness brought on by the struggle to do things others can do easily (such as regulating decisions and behavior and staying organized).)

What’s more, ADHD can have negative impacts on your personal, professional, and social life. People often view ADHDers as lazy and irresponsible, but their behavior is the result of actual differences in their brains, not the result of a character flaw, explains Paul. These differences make certain aspects of life that are easy for most people nearly impossible for ADHDers.

As you work to get more organized, it’s important to avoid judging yourself for the things you struggle with, any more than you would with a physical ailment. Just like you wouldn’t judge a person with epilepsy for taking medication or needing to avoid flashing lights, you shouldn’t judge yourself or other ADHDers for the way their atypical brains affect them.

(Shortform note: The negative view of ADHD traits can be particularly painful for people with ADHD because they often suffer from rejection sensitive dysphoria, an extreme emotional reaction to rejection and criticism characterized by shame, guilt, and even physical pain. This pain is caused and exacerbated by both negative judgment from others and negative self-talk. Thus, understanding that ADHD is not a character flaw is important for both ADHDers and non-ADHDers in order to reduce the stigma around the disorder and make it easier for ADHDers to understand and cope with their symptoms.)

#### Before You Begin: Get Your Symptoms Under Control

According to Paul, the first thing you must do to get organized is to get your ADHD symptoms under control so that you can begin the work of managing the ways in which ADHD affects your life. No matter how strong your organizational system is, it won’t do you any good if your symptoms are so severe that you can’t follow it. For some people, this involves getting on stimulant medication to reduce the severity of their symptoms. Medication will not make your symptoms go away, nor will it make your life easy, but it can help mitigate your symptoms and make your life more manageable. Paul explains that less than a tenth of ADHDers who try stimulant medication are unable to benefit from any of them.

> **Types of ADHD Medication**
> 
> To effectively get your symptoms under control, you have to be on the right kind of medication. ADHD medication works by increasing the levels of certain neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain. Paul discusses stimulant medications, which primarily target dopamine, but there are also non-stimulant medications available for ADHD, and these primarily target norepinephrine. Non-stimulants generally have a lower success rate than stimulants but can be very effective for people who don’t respond well to stimulant medications.
> 
> In addition to medication, lifestyle changes like daily exercise, therapy, adequate sleep, and a healthy diet can help some people better manage their symptoms. However, depending on the type and severity of your symptoms, some of these lifestyle changes may work better as part of your organizational system than as precursors to it.

Once you have a handle on your symptoms, you can begin working toward better organization. This starts with understanding _how_ ADHD affects your life, which we’ll discuss next.

### Step 1: Getting to Know Yourself

Every person with ADHD is different, and their ADHD affects them differently. There’s no cookie-cutter method for organization that will work perfectly for everyone, so you have to form an understanding of how your ADHD affects you personally in order to devise the best organizational system to manage it.

(Shortform note: Some experts distinguish between different types of ADHD, identifying anywhere between three and seven subtypes of the condition. These are defined by the dominance of either symptoms of attention dysregulation or hyperactivity. Some distinguish between inattentive ADHD, hyperactive/impulsive ADHD, and combined ADHD. Others include additional subtypes based on traits like mood and emotional regulation, including temporal lobe ADHD, limbic ADHD, and anxious ADHD. Exploring the different subtypes of ADHD may help you better understand how the condition impacts you personally.)

#### Understand Your Purpose

An essential part of Paul’s recommendations for better organization is to identify the reason you want to get organized and keep that front of mind as you begin implementing her tips. Staying motivated is particularly difficult for people with ADHD, so you’ll need to have a purpose for organizing that you can come back to any time it starts to feel too difficult. This purpose should be unique to you and related to the values that are important to you. It also can’t stem from the belief that you _should_ be able to do something. That comes from a place of judgment and external pressure, and your purpose needs to provide you with internal motivation. Your purpose should help you nurture your genuine self so you can live the life you want to live.

For example, you may want to get organized because you value time with your friends and family, and better organization would give you more time to enjoy their company. You may value the serenity of an uncluttered workspace, or the freedom to take time off from work when you need it without feeling like you’re falling behind.

> **Using Happiness to Find Your Purpose**
> 
> Other experts also identify purpose as an important motivator in life. In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield explains that finding your life’s purpose helps you direct your actions toward a specific goal and achieve what you want. To identify your purpose, he recommends that you reflect on what makes you happy in life and what you like about yourself and distill these into a purpose statement you can refer back to whenever you need to remind yourself of your motivation.
> 
> If you identify your purpose by reflecting on what makes you happy, you’re less likely to come up with a purpose that stems from a place of judgment. For example, if you know that being creative makes you happy, your purpose statement could be that you want to get more organized so you have more time for creative pursuits.

#### Understand Your Limitations

Another part of getting to know yourself is understanding your capabilities and limitations. Organizing becomes much easier when you only have to organize a manageable number of items. This means you need to be able to say no to people and commitments, let go of things in your life that don’t serve your purpose, and only use as much physical space and belongings as you can reasonably manage.

Paul explains that ADHD brains have less dopamine—the neurotransmitter that drives the body’s reward system—available to them. This means ADHDers seek stimulation and novelty, which can lead them to take on more obligations and commitments than they can handle. While it may be frustrating to accept, sometimes you need to demand less of yourself so you can consistently meet expectations. You may simply have a lower threshold for what you can reasonably take on than someone without ADHD.

> **Don’t Expect Yourself to Be Perfect**
> 
> Setting reasonable expectations can be especially hard for ADHDers because they often have perfectionistic tendencies. These may result from always feeling like you’re not doing enough or from a belief that you’ll perform better under unreasonably high expectations, but in any case, they tend to lead to procrastination and frustration.
> 
> It can help to remember that you don’t have to do things the way everyone else does—if you find you can’t take on as many commitments as your peers can, don’t force yourself to. It can also help to reverse the adage “Anything worth doing is worth doing well” by understanding that “Anything worth doing is worth doing poorly.” Making some progress on a task or expectation—and getting the resulting dopamine boost—is better than not doing it at all just because you won’t accept anything less than perfection.

#### Understand How You Learn

According to Paul, understanding your learning style will help you on your journey to better organization. Getting organized is a process of teaching yourself new habits, so it’s important to understand the best way to accommodate your learning needs. Paul describes three types of learning styles: auditory, visual, and tactile.

  * **Auditory learners** learn best from hearing information. They may read out loud rather than silently, and they often benefit from discussing information with others in order to better comprehend it.
  * **Visual learners** learn best by seeing. They benefit from pictures and graphics, and they’re good at visualizing, so they’re especially engaged by imagery in stories. Visual learners are particularly prone to the pitfall of “out of sight, out of mind,” which means that once something is no longer in their sight, they forget about it.
  * **Tactile learners** learn best by doing. They benefit from activities like building and drawing, and they may be particularly expressive with their hands and bodies. They may struggle to sit still and focus for long periods without something physical to do. 



Your learning style will affect what organizational system works best for you, explains Paul. If you’re a visual learner, you may respond well to a system that incorporates color and sequence (like file folders with the tabs arranged sequentially) to help you keep track of different things. If you’re an auditory learner, you may do your best organizing with a podcast or music playing in the background. If you’re a tactile learner, you’ll need to pause from your organizing now and then to move your body around. You likely have a combination of preferred learning styles, with one or two being dominant. You can use online quizzes to identify your learning styles and then tailor your organizational system to suit your learning style.

> **The Reading/Writing Learning Style and Learning Disabilities**
> 
> Some experts identify other learning styles besides those Paul listed. Specifically, many sources include “reading/writing” as a separate learning style. These learners do best when they’re able to read information or write it down. Some view this learning style as simply a sub-type of the visual style, but some people who learn well through reading and writing don’t learn well from other visual stimuli like graphs and images.
> 
> These distinctions become particularly relevant in discussions of ADHD because as many as 60% of ADHDers also have a learning disability, and some of these disabilities directly impair one or more of the learning styles Paul describes, as well as the reading/writing style. A common learning disability that manifests alongside ADHD is dyslexia, which impairs reading ability. An ADHDer with dyslexia might be a visual learner who does _not_ learn well from reading and writing, suggesting that these should be considered separate learning styles.
> 
> Other common learning disabilities that can co-occur with ADHD include dyspraxia, which affects motor control and may make it harder to learn tactilely. Auditory processing disorder could impair the ability to learn from hearing information, and a visual processing disorder could interfere with visual learning. If you’re an ADHDer who also has a learning disability, you should take that into account when designing your organizational system.
> 
> Other ways for visual learners to tap into their learning style could be to create charts that help them keep track of their files or other visual aids like chore wheels. For auditory learners, talking out loud to others or themselves about your organization could help, while tactile learners may benefit from a variety of textures in materials (such as card stock, construction paper, or fabric) that correspond to different parts of their system. Reading/writing learners may do particularly well with lists.

#### Understand Your Scheduling Needs

Finally, identify your ideal daily schedule based on your energy and focus levels, writes Paul. Do you function best if you go to bed early and get up early, or are you more productive if you stay up later and sleep in? What types of work are easiest for you to complete at various times in the day? You may want to reserve your physical organization tasks for the time of day when you have the most energy, and do the ones that require little thought for the time of day when you may have less mental energy.

(Shortform note: One way to determine when you’re most productive and when you need rest is to figure out your circadian rhythm. Different people have different circadian rhythms, meaning the hours of the day during which they sleep best and work best are different. In particular, people with ADHD often have circadian rhythms that cause them to sleep and wake up later, making them more productive in the afternoons or evenings than in the mornings.)

Once you’ve identified your purpose, limitations, learning style, and ideal schedule, you can begin the work of containing your current mess.

### Step 2: Contain Your Current Mess

According to Paul, if you’re already behind on your organization, you won’t be able to jump right into a new system. You need to get a handle on your current state of disorganization first. ADHDers can become disorganized more easily because they tend to quickly be overwhelmed by new input, and we’re all constantly receiving various types of input: Much of it is informational like ideas and obligations, and much of it is physical like mail and belongings. For ADHDers, the overwhelm from all this input often leads to piles.

(Shortform note: ADHDers may not even realize how messy their environment has gotten because they often experience _clutter blindness_ , which is when they become so accustomed to the mess around them that it no longer looks messy. Sometimes it can help to ask a friend or loved one to help you identify cluttered areas in your environment so you know where to start containing your mess.)

Piles accumulate when we have no system for dealing with incoming stuff. We get a piece of mail or find a dirty sock on the floor and put it in a pile for us to deal with later, which grows and grows until it feels too big to manage. These piles feel necessary—particularly for those who suffer from “out of sight, out of mind” tendencies—so that we don’t lose track of important items, but ultimately these things tend to get lost in the piles anyway.

Organizing piles starts with containing them, which means designating a specific location to keep those items until you’re ready to deal with them.

(Shortform note: Some ADHDers use piles as an important part of their organizing system, often referring to them as “DOOM” piles (“Didn’t Organize, Only Moved). They may come in other forms than piles, including bags, boxes, drawers, or other containers. DOOM piles can be useful when you’re organizing on limited time or energy and need to get rid of clutter or mess. However, as with other piles, they need to be managed regularly—perhaps in one of the ways we’re about to describe—so they don’t get out of control.)

#### Containing Physical Items

To contain physical items that you struggle to keep organized, Paul recommends using baskets. While it may seem similar to a pile, a basket provides physical boundaries for a pile, which will help keep it more manageable. Each basket should only contain one type of item. That way, as soon as you find an item that needs to be stored, you know exactly where to put it, and you know exactly where to look for it the next time you need it.

(Shortform note: You can continue to tap into your learning styles and needs as you create your containment system. If you’re a visual learner, color-coding your baskets—say, using a red basket for household items, a blue basket for important documents, and so on—may help you keep track of them. Tactile learners may benefit from having to perform an additional physical step to put something in a basket (perhaps unlatching and opening the basket’s lid), and auditory learners could talk through their organizational choices with someone to solidify them in their minds.)

Also, remember your learning style (and those of any ADHDers with whom you may share your space): If you know you have “out of sight, out of mind” tendencies, putting items in a place where you can’t see them won’t be sustainable. If you don’t use the items frequently, you’ll forget about them. If you _do_ use them frequently, you’ll never be able to keep up with a system that hides them from your sight because you’ll inevitably start leaving them outside of their container due to your need to keep visual track of them. To beat your “out of sight, out of mind” tendencies, use open containers that will help you use those items as visual reminders without them being strewn all over the place.

> **Organizing by What You Use Most Often**
> 
> If you’re using baskets to contain a particular _type_ of item, you might find your frequently used items keep getting mixed in with items you don’t need that much. For example, if you have a basket filled with office supplies, but you rarely use any of them except the stapler, you might get frustrated always having to dig past the tape dispensers, scissors, boxes of paper clips, and other items to get to the stapler.
> 
> In _Algorithms to Live By_ , Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths suggest sorting your belongings based on what you use the most often. If you sort through your basket and find items that you almost never use or haven’t used in a long time, consider putting those items in a less accessible but more organized space, or even getting rid of them entirely.

#### Containing Email and Calendar Reminders

You may also have different “piles,” such as thousands of unread emails, mountains of written reminders, or digital calendars filled with things you may or may not do. These are also things that need to be contained, insists Paul.

To better contain your emails and calendar reminders, be ruthless about what you keep and what you don’t. If you have what feels like an overwhelming amount of unread emails, consider deleting all emails received before a certain date to clear out the current clutter. Then downsize: Unsubscribe from any newsletters, promotional emails, or other things you don’t use. Similarly, with your calendar, only include items that have to be done and are time sensitive. Filling your calendar with things you may or may not do is a recipe for an abandoned calendar.

> **Other Tips for Managing Email and Calendar**
> 
> Other organization experts offer tips for general email and calendar maintenance that ADHDers could consider combining with Paul’s recommendations: For email, they suggest only checking your email during certain times of the day, dealing with an email as soon as you read it instead of leaving it marked as “read,” and using email templates to help you save time on drafting emails that you send regularly. When you deal with emails right away, you prevent an overwhelming amount of unread emails from accumulating, and thus may not even have to downsize.
> 
> For your calendar, they recommend color-coding your different activities based on the type of activity. For example, you could code all your work commitments in red, your free time in blue, and your errands in green—then you can see at a glance if your time commitments are way out of balance. They also recommend being judicious about which calendar invites you choose to accept and making sure your calendar is synced across all your devices.

#### Thought Containers

ADHDers also have trouble remembering things without concrete reminders. Rather than assuming you’ll remember something, Paul recommends creating thought containers by finding a way to record your thoughts immediately, before they can slip out of your mind, and storing those thoughts in a way that will make them easy to access later. This might mean keeping a dry-erase board in every room of your house or always having a pad of sticky notes on hand that you then store in a physical container.

This can also be helpful when other people need to ask you to do something. If your child needs a permission slip signed, or your coworker needs you to take the lead on a new project, they can put a note into your thought container to ensure you attend to it.

> **Additional Ways to Organize Your Thoughts**
> 
> Sometimes you may not make it to your thought container before you lose your thought. Research shows that talking to yourself can help your concentration and processing. It also helps you remember and establish mental associations between your thoughts and a specific visual target, so saying your thought out loud can help you keep it in your memory until you can either write it down or perform the action it requires.
> 
> To avoid forgetting what you were about to do before you walked into a room, try using the P-L-R technique: Pause for 10 seconds, then use that time to Link your intended action to a verbal description and a visual image of the task. Finally, Rehearse the image and description in your mind so it will stick long enough for you to get it done.

### Step 3: Implement an Organizational System

Once you’ve got your current situation contained, you can implement a system for managing your incoming items, tasks, and projects. The most important part of establishing a system for organization is to find one that works for you. It should be both simple and sustainable, meaning it should require as little work from you as possible and should be something you can reasonably do every week in perpetuity.

Paul doesn’t explicitly describe many organizational systems, but she highly recommends reading David Allen’s _Getting Things Done_ and using his tips to design your own system.

(Shortform note: The guide to Allen’s _Getting Things Done_ is available in our Shortform library. The five steps he describes for a strong organizational system are: 1) Capture your items and ideas, 2) Clarify what you need to do about each item, 3) Organize the decisions you’ve made about your next actions, 4) Reflect on what you should do next, and 5) Engage (complete the task). Paul’s system is heavily based on Allen’s _Getting Things Done_ system, but she adds tips specifically for people with ADHD.)

#### Funneling Containers Into Inboxes

All of the containers you created in Step 2 represent a source of incoming tasks that require you to act on them. Paul suggests funneling these different incoming sources into as few inboxes as possible to make it easier to process them. For example, instead of having separate inboxes for your voicemails, your physical mail, and your emails, you might print out your emails and voicemails and consolidate them into one “communication” inbox. Paul recommends using as many containers as you need, but then putting those items into as few inboxes as you can get by with. This way, when it comes time to sort through those inboxes, you only have a few to manage, which, as we’ll discuss next, is the next step in organizing.

(Shortform note: This step corresponds to Allen’s first step, “Capture.” Allen makes many of the same recommendations as Paul, but he differs in his suggestion that you shouldn’t add your emails to your physical communications inbox. He suggests that since we receive so many emails, and since email servers have their own organizational tools, you should leave them in their digital form and deal with them separately. You should decide if it’s worth it to have two separate inboxes for communications or if you would benefit more from having them all in one physical place even at the risk of clogging it with all your email correspondence.)

#### Managing Tasks

Each item that goes into one of your inboxes is a potential task, and you need to sort through these regularly to keep them from overwhelming you. To empty an inbox, it’s important to take out one item at a time and to not put anything back in after you’ve taken it out. Then assess that item and decide if it’s something you can take care of in less than five minutes (or less than two if you know that a five-minute task will distract you too much from your management process). If it’s a short task, complete it immediately. If it’s a larger task, it needs to be logged in your project management system, which we’ll discuss next.

(Shortform note: This step corresponds to Allen’s second step, clarifying. Paul explains what to do with actionable items (tasks and projects), but Allen adds that some of the items you sort through may not be actionable. He recommends placing these in a separate pile designated for reference materials—such as reminders and instruction manuals—so they don’t get mixed up in your tasks and projects. He also explains why you shouldn’t put items back in your inbox once you’ve taken them out: Every decision you make contributes to _decision fatigue_ —the gradual loss of energy that comes from making decisions—and leaving an item in the “undecided” category drains your energy more than making the decision quickly and being done with it.)

#### Managing Projects

Paul explains that a task is an individual, discrete activity that has to be done to accomplish something. A project is anything that requires two or more tasks to complete. As you come across potential projects while emptying your inboxes, it’s highly tempting to drop what you’re doing and immediately start working on these larger activities. However, this will derail your organizational system and result in an overflowing inbox because you’ll be too distracted to tend to it. Instead of starting them immediately, you need to establish a way to record such projects so you can come back to them later.

(Shortform note: Paul recommends not diving right into big projects because it can be distracting, but according to other experts, it can also help because you may realize the project isn’t worth completing at all: In _Rework_ , Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson explain that it’s better to drop a project that’s not going anywhere than to keep pursuing it and wasting your time and energy, though this can be difficult if you’ve already spent a lot of time on it. If you’ve been working on a project that seems to be going nowhere, consider running it by a friend or colleague to see if they think it’s worth continuing.)

Paul uses an app to keep track of her projects, and there are many such apps available. You can also use a paper system if that works better for you. Whatever system you choose should allow you to record projects and then break them down into smaller tasks, and it should allow you to note whether you can complete these tasks now or if they’re dependent on something else (like if they can only be done after another task is completed, or you’re waiting on someone else to do something so you can complete the task).

> **Making the Best Use of Your Projects List**
> 
> This step corresponds to Allen’s third step, organizing. However, he recommends using your projects list purely as an index rather than a place to keep track of descriptions of the projects, tasks, or materials you need to complete them. Instead, such materials should go in a separate file that corresponds to your project list.
> 
> Also, remember to consider what you learned about yourself in step 1 to decide what organizational system to use. If you know you learn better by reading and writing by hand, consider a paper list instead of a digital app. Writing things down by hand can improve your retention of information, but if you have trouble keeping up with a notebook, or you want to be able to share your list with others easily, a digital app may work better for you. If you’re an auditory learner, you may want to use an app that can log voice memos so you can listen back to them.

#### Keeping a To-do List

To keep track of the very next tasks you need to complete for your various projects, you can keep a to-do list. A to-do list is _not_ for projects; it’s only for specific, single tasks that don’t require any preceding steps to be completed first. Something like “renew vehicle registration” may seem like a simple task, but it’s actually a project that requires several tasks, such as making an appointment to have your car inspected, then submitting the renewal application, and later applying those little stickers to your vehicle’s license plate.

So activities like “renew vehicle registration” shouldn’t go on your to-do list, but instead in your project management system, and the next task required to make progress on that project (like “make appointment to get car inspected”) should go on the to-do list.

(Shortform note: Paul and Allen don’t specify how many to-do lists you should keep, and this will depend on your unique needs and preferences: You may want separate to-do lists for various projects, or one master to-do list with all of your important next tasks listed. While one list may be easier to keep up with, some experts suggest that one list isn’t sufficient for managing the busy lives we lead today and recommend keeping two or three—and possibly even a “not-to-do list” to remind yourself of things you’ve decided you don’t want to spend your time doing.)

#### Keeping Track of Future Projects

Paul also recommends keeping a list of things you’d like to do if you ever get the time but don’t want to act on currently. ADHDers have a lot of ideas, and they often have difficulty prioritizing them. It’s easy to get so excited about a project you can’t currently accomplish that you end up neglecting the things you need to do now. Recording these future projects and ideas gives you the relief of not having to keep up with them mentally, and also the freedom to say, “I’m not going to work on this right now, but maybe I will someday.”

(Shortform note: Taking things off your immediate projects list can be particularly difficult for ADHDers because they often experience the fear of missing out (or FOMO). By comparing yourself to others and the goals you see them achieving, you might find yourself adding so many projects to the list of things you want to complete that you’re unable to make progress on any of them. Being aware of when you’re experiencing FOMO (when you want to do something because someone else did it instead of because _you_ want to do it) and focusing on enjoying what you’re doing now can make it easier to postpone some of those projects that you don’t have time for at the moment.)
