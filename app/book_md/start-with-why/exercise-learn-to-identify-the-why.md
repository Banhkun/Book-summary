## Exercise: Learn to Identify the WHY

Now that you’ve had a brief introduction to why a person, movement, or company’s WHY is important, let’s think of some other examples.

* * *

We’ve seen three examples of people and companies that start with WHY, i.e. a core idea that motivates them and inspires others. Can you think of another example of a person, movement, or company that starts with WHY? What is their WHY?

Now let’s think a little bit more about the WHY and its function. For the company or person you identified above, list at least two ways their WHY sets them apart from their competition. (Some reasons might be loyal employees, a world-changing vision, or radical authenticity.)
