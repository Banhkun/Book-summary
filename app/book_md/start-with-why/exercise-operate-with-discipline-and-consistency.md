## Exercise: Operate with Discipline and Consistency

Is your business operating with a balanced circle in mind?

* * *

Now that you know your organization’s WHY, do you think your company _clearly_ and _consistently_ articulates its WHY? Why or why not?

It takes _discipline_ to start with WHY, which involves articulating your values as verbs or actions. List two of your organization’s values below, then rephrase them as actions. (For example, if one of your company's’ values is “honesty,” you can rephrase it as “do the right thing.”)

When has your organization contradicted its own WHY? What caused the departure from what the organization stands for?
