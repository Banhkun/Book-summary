## Exercise: Trust Your Gut

When has your gut triumphed over your rational brain?

* * *

Think about a time when your gut instinct triumphed over the more logical, rational choice when making a purchase. What was the outcome? How would the outcome have changed if you went with your neocortex (or rational brain) instead?
