## Exercise: Apply The Golden Circle to Your Organization

Apply The Golden Circle to what you do. Start with WHY, go to HOW, then to WHAT.

* * *

Think about your business, organization, or your personal work. What is your WHY?

What is the HOW? How do you achieve your WHY?

Finally, what is the WHAT? What are you actually producing thatâ€™s of value to others? Does this match your HOW and your WHY?

Now, take a step back. Do you feel WHY is the center of how your organization thinks about work, or how you think about your work? What changes could you make to put WHY first?
