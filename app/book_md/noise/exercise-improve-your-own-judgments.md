## Exercise: Improve Your Own Judgments

Let’s explore how you might apply the ideas in _Noise_ to improve the quality of your judgments.

* * *

Think of a situation where you make judgments with important stakes. Maybe it’s your job to make professional judgments. If not, you might think of a major personal decision involving a prediction or an evaluation, like how to invest your money, or where to live. Describe the judgment and its context.

Now, identify some kinds of noise that affect the judgment.

Which techniques or strategies could you use to improve your judgment(s)? How would they help, and how would you implement them?
