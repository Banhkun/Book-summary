## Exercise: Plan Your Weight Loss Diet

Greger argues that adopting a plant-based diet helps to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. In this exercise, consider how you might implement his advice.

* * *

Consider _what_ you eat. Recall Greger’s explanation of what causes weight gain—processed foods and animal products—and list anything in your regular diet that might lead to unintentional weight gain. (For example, maybe you eat candy, white bread, or ham.)

Pick an item on your list and write down at least one plant-based substitute for it. (For example, you might replace candy with carrot sticks, or white bread with whole wheat bread.)

Consider _when_ you consume your calories. Recall Greger’s explanation of how the amount of time and effort your body spends digesting food decreases during the day, and write a brief reflection on when you tend to eat most of your calories. (For example, perhaps you skip breakfast, eat a small lunch, and eat high-calorie snacks before eating a large dinner.)

Recall Greger’s advice to eat your largest meal in the morning and your smallest meal in the evening. List one way you could adapt your schedule to accommodate this. (For example, you might wake up half an hour earlier to make time for a large breakfast, or plan your daily meals in advance so that you don’t end up reaching for high-calorie foods in the evening.)
