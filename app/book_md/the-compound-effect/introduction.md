## Introduction

Marketing claims in the media dupe us into believing there are easy fixes for our lives, offering up the “secrets” to getting rich, looking younger, losing weight, and achieving our goals. But the truth is, there’s no quick fix to success—and there are no secrets.

Success means getting back to the profound, simple fundamentals of achievement; the key is harnessing the power of the Compound Effect, which author Darren Hardy calls the “operating system of your life.” Simply put, **the Compound Effect is the principle that the effects of small, everyday choices will compound over time, leading you to great success—or disaster.**

Hardy’s personal experience and research gave rise to the Compound Effect. He’s applied the principles in this book to his life and has seen great success. As a student of success and personal achievement and a leader in the personal development industry, he has seen, heard, and read uncountable self-improvement tips and gimmicks. He has tested thousands of different philosophies and trained many entrepreneurs. Ultimately, he realized that all the new ideas boil down to a few important fundamental ideas, comprising the Compound Effect.

We all know what it takes to succeed; the tricky part is creating a plan of action. There’s no quick fix to changing your life. Success will require hard work, discipline and commitment.

Each chapter in this book explores a fundamental tenet of the Compound Effect that will help you generate new behaviors and habits to propel you toward success.
