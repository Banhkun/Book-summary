## Exercise: Build Momentum with Small Changes

When we gain momentum, there’s no stopping us.

* * *

This chapter discussed how inconsistency is the momentum-killer. What is a change you wanted to make in the past, but applied it inconsistently and eventually lost all momentum?

Think about why you were inconsistent. Did you bite off more than you could chew? Was the change unsustainable?

If you wanted to redo the change, what is a smaller change that you’re confident you can do consistently for months?
