## Exercise: Putting Habits to Work for You

Changing your habits will change your life.

* * *

Think about your most important current goal. What is the most significant bad habit that is holding you back from achieving this goal?

What is the long-term, negative ramification of indulging this habit over a year? (Remember that a plane flying cross-country that’s 1% off course will be 150 miles off target.)

Your “why” will fuel your motivation to change. What is your “why” to reach your goal?

Who or what are your enemies? Who can you think about to get constructive energy to defeat your bad habit?

Who would you like to be? Describe who you must become to meet your goal.
