## Chapter 3: Habits and Goals

Habits are acquired behaviors that have become nearly involuntary; they put us on “autopilot” in many aspects of our day-to-day lives. Think about how little thought you put into brushing your teeth, strapping on a seatbelt, or driving to work. Because habits require little conscious energy, they can free us to focus our mental energy on more creative endeavors.

Habits can be good or bad. At their worst, habits can run you in the wrong direction without you even realizing what’s happening. It’s like the story of a man on a horse rapidly galloping by. Someone asks him where he’s going, and he says he doesn’t know—ask the horse. Your habits are like the horse, steering the direction of your life.

**Good habits, however, take you in a positive direction—and you control the ride.** If you are a healthy eater, you probably have very healthy food-choice habits. If you’re fit, you likely have good exercise habits. In fact, successful people all seem to share the common trait of good habits in many aspects of their lives. Successful people aren’t any smarter or better than anyone else, but their habits drive them toward more knowledge, competence and skills.

> **Be Like Larry**
> 
> Basketball great Larry Bird is an example of good habits launching an ordinary person into an extraordinary success. Bird wasn’t the most gifted athlete, but still managed to lead the Boston Celtics to three world championships. His habits drove him to greatness. For example, growing up, he had the habit of shooting 500 free-throw shots every morning. This preparation led him to become one of the most successful and consistent free-throw shooters in the NBA. Through habit, he conditioned himself to have the automatic responses of a champion.

### Changing Your Destructive Habits

The goal is to get off autopilot and change the unconscious habits that are holding us back. Though these habits were created unconsciously, we can consciously change them and craft new, positive habits that serve our lives well. We can prepare ourselves to do this by:

  * Resisting the lure of instant gratification
  * Finding your “why”—your motivation for change
  * Defining and calibrating your “core values”
  * Finding out who and what you’re fighting
  * Setting and achieving goals
  * Becoming the person you want to be



#### Resist the Lure of Instant Gratification

We all know the “right” things to do to live a healthy life. We _know_ we shouldn’t have Pop-Tarts for dinner or watch reality TV for 3 hours a night. So why do we allow these bad habits to continue? The problem is our need for instant gratification.

Often, **the payoff you receive from instant gratification obliterates any concern in your conscious mind for long-term ramifications**. For example, if eating a piece of cake instantly put 50 pounds on you, you’d put the fork down. If making one less sales call at work got you immediately fired, you’d pick up that phone. But since the consequences of these small actions can take years to show up, courtesy of the Compound Effect, it’s easy to choose instant gratification over the correct behavior.

**The first step is to wake up and realize the true ramifications of the bad habits we indulge in and know that even the smallest changes can drastically affect the outcomes in your life**.

Think of a plane traveling cross-country; if the nose is even 1 percent off course, the plane will end up 150 miles off course in the end. This is like a bad habit; the behaviour doesn’t seem like a big deal in the moment, but it can ultimately lead you way off course in your life.

#### Finding Your Why

Changing ingrained bad habits takes more than willpower. Willpower has likely failed you in the past. Think of resolutions that were abandoned and diets that went by the wayside. **Willpower is not strong enough to keep you from sliding back into your ingrained bad habits.**

Instead of willpower, Hardy suggests you draw upon what he calls “why-power.” You’ve got to figure out what you want and _why_ you want it or you’ll give up too easily. Your “why” has to be incredibly motivating because it must ignite your enthusiasm and passion—emotions that will fuel your persistence. Knowing your “why” helps you stick through the hard stuff.

> **Example:** **Your “Why-Power”**
> 
> Think about a wooden plank lying on the ground. If someone offered you $20 to walk across it, you’d do it in a heartbeat—easy money. But if that same plank were lying across two 100-story buildings, you wouldn’t even consider the $20 offer. If your child, however, was on the opposite building from you and was in danger, you would walk that plank without thinking —and without caring about the $20. When your why is big enough—in this case, saving your child—you can perform any action.

Your true “why” won’t be about money or material goals. It has to come from a deeper place that gets your heart and soul into the endeavor. Many successful people with all the material wealth they could want are deeply unhappy, dealing with fear and frustration. This is because focusing on achievement without fulfillment leaves you empty. **Finding your core motivation is key because only a very powerful why will bring your true fulfillment.**

#### Defining Your Core Values

Your core values lead to your “why power.” Defining your core values is a critical step when you’re trying to change your life; without clearly defined values, you could fall victim to making choices that are in conflict with what you want. For example, if you value integrity but hang out with people who lie and cheat, this creates a conflict.

When you have clearly defined core values, making decisions is easier because you can simply ask yourself which choice aligns with those values. If something doesn’t align, you can forget about it.

#### Identifying Who or What You’re Fighting—Your “Enemies”

A motivating fight can give you strength and purpose. Throughout history, fighting an enemy has led to innovation and transformation. Think about David and Goliath, Rocky and Apollo Creed, or Microsoft and Apple.

Motivation doesn’t always come from a noble place; a negative emotion or experience can fuel your “why-power” and bring about successful results. We all have the ability to take hurtful experiences from our past and use them to fuel constructive change. For example, the great football coach Pete Carroll grew up with a chip on his shoulder because he was so small. He felt the need to fight and prove his worth and was rewarded with great success.

#### Setting and Achieving Goals

**To achieve success, It is important to learn how to set and achieve goals effectively**.

Clearly defined goals in all areas of your life—business, wealth, health, and relationships—are important because, once achieved, they can fill your life with abundance. The Compound Effect is always working, but without a clearly defined goal, it cannot bring you to a better life.

When you define your goals, you give your brain something to focus on and look for, invoking the Law of Attraction. To many of us, the Law of Attraction seems mysterious and esoteric, but in reality, it’s quite logical. We only see, hear, and experience a fraction of the things going on around us. So when you clearly define, picture, and focus on a goal, you are able to draw it into your life. It wasn’t accessible or visible to you until your thoughts were able to focus on it and lead your brain to see it.

For example, say you are considering buying a new type of car. Suddenly you see that make and model everywhere around you when you had never noticed them before. Did they just appear? Of course not—they were always there, but you weren’t paying attention. **They were there but they didn’t “exist” for you.**

When you clearly define your goals, you experience the world very differently, attracting the opportunities, people and resources you need to achieve that goal. These things were there all along, but they were invisible to you.

#### Become the Person You Want to Be

Once you have clearly defined a goal, the next step isn’t figuring out what you need to do to achieve it, but rather _who you must become_ to achieve your goal.

Jim Rohn perfectly captures this idea: “If you want to have more, you have to become more...Success is something you attract by the person you become.”

Think about the attributes you need to have to achieve your goal. Without these, you can do all the right things but still never succeed.

> **Example: Becoming Yourself**
> 
> Hardy came to understand this philosophy when he felt ready to settle down and find a wife. He made a long list of traits he wanted in a wife, filling more than 40 pages with details, including her personality, character, values, and even physical characteristics. He wrote about his vision of what their life looked like together. Next, rather than ask what he had to _do_ to find this woman, he asked himself if he possessed these traits himself. He listed qualities and behaviors that he needed to work on and set to work becoming the man he wanted to be. It worked—he met his wife, who was exactly what he had dreamed of.

### Lose the Old Habits and Find New Ones

Your behavior is all that stands between you and your goal. You need to figure out what you need to _stop_ doing so the Compound Effect doesn’t drag you down, and you need to figure out what you must _start_ doing, so the Compound Effect can take you in the right direction.

What habits do you need to lose, and what habits do you need to start crafting? When assessing your negative habits, the first step is to become aware of what you’re doing. As stated earlier, tracking is key.

> **Tracking Self-Defeating Habits**
> 
> Hardy once mentored a successful businessman who wanted to boost his productivity. Hardy had him track his time for a week and found that the exec spent an inordinate amount of time absorbing news—reading the newspaper, listening to news on his commute, checking websites throughout the day, and watching the news on TV at home. He spent almost four hours a day with news—much more than he needed.
> 
> Hardy had the man cancel his newspaper and keep his TV and radio off, and set up an RSS feed so he could see only the most pertinent news. With his newfound time, he found himself exercising, listening to inspirational material, and spending more time with his family. Without the constant barrage of negative news, his mood and stress level were much better. A small habit change yielded great results in productivity and an overall better life.

To become aware of your bad habits, list your top three goals and write down the habits that are keeping you from achieving them. For example, if you want to get healthy but eat a bag of chips every night, that would be a habit you need to change.

The next step is to list positive habits you will need to help you reach your goal. By replacing your self-defeating habits with positive habits, you’re on your way to reaching your goals.

#### 5 Strategies to Get Rid of Bad Habits

Since your habits are learned, they can be unlearned. These five strategies will help you overcome your urge for instant gratification and eliminate bad habits:

  * **Know your triggers**. What situations trigger bad habits? Do you drink too much with a certain group of friends? Do you crave chocolate at a certain time of day? It’s also important to look at emotional triggers. Do you eat too much when you’re stressed or bored? Do certain situations prompt your bad habits? 
  * **Get rid of it**. The next step is to throw out—literally—the objects enabling your bad habits. If you want to quit drinking, get rid of not only the alcohol, but all the items related to it, like special glasses and accessories. If you want to eat better, throw out all the junk food and stop buying it entirely. 
  * **Find replacements**. Think about something healthy and positive that can replace the bad habit. For example, Hardy loves to eat something sweet after a meal, but rather than a banana split, he has two Hershey’s Kisses. If you enjoy eating crunchy snacks while watching TV, try munching on celery and carrot sticks instead.
  * **Take it easy**. You don’t have to go cold turkey. Since they are so entrenched, you may need to take small steps toward unwinding your bad habits. For example, when Hardy and his wife cut out caffeine, they started out with half-decaf coffee, then moved to full decaf, followed by decaf Earl Gray tea, and finally to decaf green tea. 
  * **Or don’t take it easy**. While it’s probably the exception and not the rule, some people actually do better changing a lot of bad habits at once. Think about getting into a cold lake or pool. Sometimes it’s easier to jump right in rather than wait and dread the cold.



You don’t have to cut out every bit of enjoyment in life; some “bad” things are perfectly fine in moderation. What’s important is making sure you are in charge of your vice and it doesn’t have you in its grips. For example, every three months, Hardy picks one of his vices—ice cream, wine, movies—and abstains for 30 days, proving to himself that he’s still in charge.

#### Six Strategies to Instill Good Habits

After eliminating bad habits, it’s time to construct new, positive behaviors. Here’s how:

  * **Help yourself succeed**. Make your new habit easier to instill by setting yourself up for success. If you want to eat healthier, keep healthy snacks available so you don’t reach for a bag of chips. If you want to go to the gym regularly, make sure it’s not far away.
  * **Focus on what you _can_ have or do**. Instead of feeling deprived, focus on the new things you are bringing into your life. For example, instead of focusing on how you can’t have fast food, think about the delicious fish and vegetables you are going to have. Don’t focus on what you have to sacrifice—focus on what you’re getting.
  * **Accountability is key**. Becoming accountable is a sure way to cement a new habit. Hardy once helped a co-worker quit smoking by announcing it to the entire company and installing a calendar outside her desk. At the end of every day she didn’t smoke, she got to mark the calendar with a red X. 
  * **Find a partner**. Hardy calls this a “success buddy.” A partner in your endeavor, whether it’s losing weight, exercising, or improving your career, boosts your accountability and lends support. 
  * **Friendly competition**. Competition can help you immerse yourself in a new habit. For example, Hardy’s company held a step competition, where employees would track their steps with pedometers. Even people who didn’t exercise got out there, walking miles a day. The competitive nature of the exercise was motivation.
  * **Enjoy**. Instilling new habits doesn’t have to be drudgery. Finding rewards along the way can keep you motivated and help you celebrate your success in implementing new behaviors. Celebrate with anything from a relaxing bath to a nice dinner.



### Change Is Hard, so Be Patient

Many people remain unhappy and unhealthy, unable to change their bad habits because it’s not easy to do. Remember that **successful people don’t like doing the hard stuff either, but they do it anyway.**

Be patient with yourself as you embark on the process of changing your life. Some of your ingrained behaviors have been with you for decades, and it will take time and effort before you see lasting results. If you mess up, try again. Pressing forward brings huge payoffs.
