## Chapter 1: How We See

Berger begins with an in-depth look at how we see, arguing that before we can analyze how we see _art_ , we must first understand how we see _images_ in general. The concepts in this section are the vocabulary and foundation for Berger’s overall thesis, so in addition to the basics of how we see, we’ve added an explanation of Marxist feminism and mystification.

### What Is an Image?

Foundational to art analysis is the concept of what an image is. Berger makes a clear distinction between a _sight_ and an _image_.

An object, living being, or landscape that exists before your eyes in real life is a sight. The couch you are about to sit on, the floor beneath your feet, and the flowers you see in the garden outside your window—these are all sights.

An _image_ is a sight that has been reproduced or recreated. The sight becomes an image when it is separated from the place and time in which it truly exists (or existed). A painting, a video, even a photograph—these are images.

Berger says that once a sight becomes an image, it’s no longer an exact record of what was. The act of reproducing a sight inherently adds a subjective value to the image. Rather than being a historical record of the sight, it’s now a record of how someone _saw_ the sight…and how you are seeing the image now.

(Shortform note: When an image is continuously reproduced, you might imagine the meaning being skewed each time—similar to the childhood game of _Telephone._ With each iteration, a nuance is added or a distortion takes place.)

### Seeing Is Subjective

Images are inherently subjective—a human reproduced the sight (creating an image), another human is viewing the image, and no human can be completely objective. Berger explains that even with a photograph, which is generally considered a more accurate reproduction than a painting, the photographer makes dozens of conscious and subconscious decisions that affect the message conveyed—lighting, positioning, filters, focus, and so on. The viewer then looks at the photograph and interprets what he sees based on a lifetime of experiences that inform his perspective.

(Shortform note: The fact that seeing is subjective is beneficial to the industry of art itself. The phrase “It’s an art, not a science” is a direct reflection of the subjective nature of art.)

#### Our Experiences and Beliefs Influence What We See

Berger argues that our beliefs, experiences, and knowledge strongly influence what we see.

Imagine three people are looking at the same image of an iceberg. The person who is concerned with climate change will instantly assign a symbolic meaning and see a melting iceberg within a rapidly heating planet. The person who has been to Alaska will see a landscape that is familiar and majestic. The third person, a history buff, will see what caused the sinking of the Titanic. In each case, the belief, experience, or knowledge influences what the person sees.

(Shortform note: One study found that the amount of context we receive influences how we interpret visual information. Particularly, when there is little to no context, we tend to fill in the blanks ourselves and think more critically. When given context, our brains naturally move toward it (also known as confirmation bias) and we’re less likely to diverge from the information given. This supports Berger’s argument that what we believe influences what we see.)

### To See Is to Place Yourself Within the Image

Berger argues that when you see an image, you place yourself within it. If you look at an advertisement for a Hawaiian resort, for example, you’ll imagine what it would feel like to be there. You generate ideas about how it would feel, smell, look, and so on, based on your beliefs, experiences, and knowledge. This act of inserting yourself into the image can happen in the blink of an eye and without your consent. It’s the reason we wince when we see a movie character break a bone—we don’t always _want_ to place ourselves in the image, but we do it anyway.

Berger warns that if we’re manipulated into believing an image has a certain meaning, we place ourselves into _that_ meaning. And if the meaning is obscured (mystified) altogether, then we’re deprived of the history that may benefit us in our present. He argues that the elite have been doing this to the working class since the Renaissance, and in later chapters, we’ll take a look at the examples he uses to illustrate this argument.

(Shortform note: Placing yourself within the image doesn’t necessarily mean that you agree with the message that’s being communicated. A famous quote from F. Scott Fitzgerald tells us that “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time…” Perhaps Berger doesn’t give the public enough credit to believe they can experience the image without becoming swept away by its belief system.)

### Marxist Feminism and Mystification

Berger’s arguments are complex, and though he references them, he doesn’t provide concrete background information about Marxism or feminism, or a clear definition of mystification. For those reasons, it’s helpful to have an overview of these themes before diving in.

> **Marxist Feminism**
> 
> Marxist-feminist theory is based upon the belief that gender inequality and capitalism are inextricably linked, and that women are the greatest sufferers of capitalistic societies. In _The Communist Manifesto_ (originally published in 1848), Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels detail how the Bourgeoisie treated women as both property and a means for production.
> 
> The book was written at the tail-end of the Industrial Revolution, which gave rise to capitalistic society. The roles of women drastically changed during this time period—women and children commonly worked alongside men in factories (at one-third to one-half the salary of men), and women were expected to perform unpaid labor at home as well. The machines of capitalism could keep running as long as women remained financially dependent upon their working husbands and continued to produce more workers (children) via procreation.
> 
> Fast forward 124 years to 1972, when Berger wrote _Ways of Seeing_. Feminism took center stage during the 1960s and 1970s, and the public had a renewed interest in Marxist and socialist theories. Berger was an active member of the British New Left and kept close ties with the Communist Party of Great Britain, both of which were heavily involved in the feminist movement. Although a great deal of this book analyzes works produced hundreds of years before _The Communist Manifesto_ was written, Berger uses his political point of view and art history knowledge to draw direct comparisons between the class stratification of that time period and the capitalism of modern advertisements: Specifically, how they both objectify and oppress women.

> **The Meaning of Mystification**
> 
> Berger uses the term _mystification_ throughout _Ways of Seeing_ , and though there are contextual clues as to the implications of the word, he speaks as if the reader is already familiar and provides only one line of definition: “Mystification is the process of explaining away what might otherwise be evident” (found on page 15-16).
> 
> Because this term is used so heavily in the text _,_ we’ve added a breakdown of mystification, from its literal definition to the economic context in which it’s used:
> 
>   * **Dictionary definition of _mystify_ :** “to perplex the mind; to make obscure”
> 
>   * **Dictionary definition of _mystification: _**“an obscuring especially of capitalist or social dynamics (as by making them equivalent to natural laws) that is seen in Marxist thought as an impediment to critical consciousness.”
> 
> 

> 
> In Marxism, mystification refers to the intentional deceiving of the majority working class (proletariat) by the minority upper/middle class (bourgeoisie) to preserve their wealth. In a commodity society such as capitalism, products are made by workers but owned by the workers’ boss, who can sell them for however much he wants. All of the profit from the sale goes to the boss (owner) while the worker receives a set wage. The worker, the labor that goes into the creation of these commodities, and the disparity between his wage and the profit that he generates for his boss, are all invisible—hidden, mystified—to the consumer. This mystification ensures that the rich will get richer and the poor will remain poor.
> 
> Berger takes this framework of mystification and applies it to the way art is critiqued and owned—particularly the idea that throughout history, art historians and the wealthy elite have obscured ideologies hidden within the art. Though he doesn’t use the term in a strictly Marxist sense, there are clear parallels between the two and it can be inferred that Berger’s Marxist beliefs influenced his perception.
