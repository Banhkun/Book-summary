## Exercise: Manipulate Meaning Using Reproduction

In this chapter, we covered four ways that reproduction can be used to change the meaning of an image: removal from its original home, breaking the whole into parts, proximity to words, and proximity to another image. Test Berger’s theory by imagining how someone might manipulate an image.

* * *

Take a look at the image below. Using Berger’s theory, how could someone use words to manipulate the meaning of this image? Give an example. ![ways-heli.jpg](https://media.shortform.com/images/ways-heli.jpg)

Using the same painting above, describe another image that could be placed beside it that would affect its meaning. What new meaning would the side-by-side presentation give?
