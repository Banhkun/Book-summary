## Exercise: Start Saving F-You Money

“F-You Money” is a financial cushion that gives you the ability to make choices about what _you_ want to do rather than being a victim of your circumstances. For example, having F-You Money allows you to walk away from a job you hate.

* * *

Do you have any F-You Money saved at this point? Why or why not?

What options would having F-You Money give you? (For example, how would having the financial freedom to do what _you_ want change your life right now?)

How much F-You Money would you need to save to make the options you want a reality? What steps can you take to get closer to meeting this savings goal?
