## Chapter 33: Conclusion

Encapsulating the principles in this book, here is the initial 10-year investment path that Collins recommended for his daughter:

  * Avoid debt.
  * Spend the first decade of your career working hard to build your skills and reputation.
  * Take time for (inexpensive) adventures.
  * Don’t increase your spending as your income increases. ( Remember, financial independence is not only about building wealth, but also about controlling your spending.)
  * Invest half of your income. Put it in VTSAX or a similar fund.
  * Make the maximum contribution to your 401(k) plan if it offers an employer match.
  * Fund a Roth IRA when your income and taxes are low; when your income rises, fund a traditional IRA.
  * Take advantage of market drops by investing more, but never try to time the market.



Collins told his daughter that if she did these things for the next decade, she’d approach financial independence in her early-to-mid-30s.

Once you’ve achieved financial independence and can live on 4% of your investments, continue your career or try something new. If you keep working, invest _all_ of your income (which will increase the amount 4% represents). Consider buying a house, having children, and giving to charity. The reason you save and invest is to create options and opportunities to enrich your life.
