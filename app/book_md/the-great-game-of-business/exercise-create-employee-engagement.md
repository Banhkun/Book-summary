## Exercise: Create Employee Engagement

According to Stack and Burlingham, providing an engaging work environment is one of the keys to encouraging employee ownership and creating a successful company. An engaging environment helps employees to be active and interested in their jobs, which encourages them to work harder for the good of the company.

Describe your employees’ current level of engagement with their work. To determine this, consider the following: How efficiently are they completing their tasks? What—if anything—are they doing to improve the company? (Be realistic: Most employees aren’t engaged at work.)

Now that you have an estimate of how engaged—or unengaged—your employees are, consider why they aren’t _more_ engaged. How deeply do they understand the company? How concrete are their goals? Identify the biggest threat to your employees’ engagement and explain why it exists. (For example, employees might be unengaged because they can’t see how influential they are to the company’s success.)

Finally, make a plan to counter the biggest threat to your employees’ engagement. Be specific and set concrete goals. (For example, you could put charts in every department to track progress toward goals and to show employees how their work contributes to the company’s success.)
