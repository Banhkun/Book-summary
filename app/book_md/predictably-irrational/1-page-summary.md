## 1-Page Summary

Standard economic theory relies on the idea that humans use infallible logic when making decisions, and even when we make wrong decisions, we quickly realize and remedy them. On the other hand, behavioral economics argues that humans _frequently_ act irrationally, and we often don’t realize our errors at all. Instead, we continue making the same mistakes—we’re not only irrational but _predictably_ so.

The good news is, it doesn’t need to be this way—here, we’ll discuss common pitfalls of human logic, and explore the forces that _really_ drive your actions.**Armed with this knowledge and awareness, you can consciously avoid the triggers of irrationality and improve your decision-making skills.**

### Irrationality Trigger #1: Relativity

It’s human nature to make comparisons to find guidance toward the “right” choice. We don’t have an inherent sense of the value of things, so we resort to surmising the value of an item by considering its relative advantage or disadvantage over another. **Because of our need for guidance, relativity has a powerful influence on how we make decisions.**

Many advertisers play into this need using _the decoy effect_. That is, they present you with options, including a clearly unfavorable option—the “decoy”—to trigger a comparison that will guide you toward a specific choice.****

  * For example, an advertisement for magazine subscription bundles might include three options: internet only for $59/year; print only for $125/year; and an internet and print bundle for $125/year. You’ll likely conclude that the print-only option—the decoy—is a rip-off. It’s _much_ more expensive than the internet option, even though both options include only one medium. Instead, you’ll choose the bundle, which appears to offer two media for the price of one. However, if the print-only option weren’t included, you’d likely choose the cheapest option, internet-only.



**We compound the decoy effect by making irrational comparisons—we tend to focus on similar, easily comparable products and reject products that are different and thus less easily comparable.**

  * Salespeople know this and play into it. When you’re deciding between two options (A and B) and their accompanying attributes, you’ll likely be presented with a decoy third option (-A). This option is similar to—but worse than—one of the options. Because the two “A” options are more easily comparable than A and B, you’ll quickly reject option B. Then, because the -A option is clearly worse than the A option, A will be your final decision—just as the salesperson intended.



Relativity doesn’t just drive irrational decision-making—it makes us miserable. We measure our possessions against others’ due to our comparative nature, which leads us into a trap of comparative consumption. There are two ways to avoid this trap.

  * First, you can diminish your comparison opportunities. By controlling what products you see, you can exercise control over how tempted you are to make comparisons. For example, if you’re car shopping, _only_ look at options within your means instead of browsing expensive, unwise choices. 
  * Second, change your focus.**** Think about your choices in a larger context—you may realize that your money will be better spent on something more rewarding in the future.



### Irrationality Trigger #2: Anchoring

Often, you’ll find that your idea of a fair price for a product doesn’t match another person’s idea of a fair price. This is because of _arbitrary coherence_ —your “right” price for an item is completely _arbitrary_ , usually just the first price you saw that product listed for. Once you have a price in mind, it becomes a benchmark for all other prices for that product (_coherence_).

  * For example, if you grew up in Hawaii, your idea of a fair price for a gallon of milk would be around $7—but for a Wisconsinite, a fair price would be around $2.95. The product is the same, but the idea of what’s a _reasonable_ price depends on wherever you happened to grow up. 



**This process of establishing a product’s price as “normal” and making it the benchmark by which you judge all other prices for that product is called _anchoring._** You’re constantly influenced by prices—advertisements, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP), a car salesman explaining a car’s value. A price “sticks” as an anchor as soon as you consider buying a product at that price.**** Though you may _rationally_ be aware that prices must change depending on environment and circumstances, your anchors will irrationally inform your choices.

An anchor can easily develop into a long-term habit, through a process called _self-herding_ —that is, if you have a positive first impression (your anchor, in a sense) of a decision you’ve made, such as trying a new product or restaurant, you’ll later make the same decision based on your memory of your first impression. Over time, you start to think that this behavior is a _preference_ when it’s simply a habit built on that first impression.**__**

These “preferences” often cost time and money—ask yourself what pleasure you’re getting from the habit.

  * Is it worth the money you’re spending on it, or is it just a habitual decision? 
  * Would it be possible to cut back or spend your money elsewhere? 



### Irrationality Trigger #3: “Free”

“Free” is a powerful marketing tool because we’re inherently attracted to things that are free. Every transaction has an upside and a downside—you gain something, but you may have spent money on a dissatisfying purchase. **“Free” eliminates the possibility of this downside, and does away with rational cost-benefit analysis.**

  * If you were offered a Belgian chocolate for 15 cents or a dollar-store chocolate for 1 cent, you’d likely do a quick cost-benefit analysis (as the standard economic model predicts) and choose the Belgian chocolate. It’s a very low price for a far superior product. 
  * If the price of each chocolate was lowered by 1 cent, there should be no difference to your choice because both prices are reduced by the same amount. But, instead of doing a cost-benefit analysis, you’ll choose the dollar-store chocolate, which is now free—pushing rational decision-making aside in favor of a transaction with no downside.



“Free” influences your choices even when it comes to products that _must_ have a price (and therefore, a downside). **By attaching “free” to a purchase, advertisers can trigger an irrational reaction that costs you more money.** Online retailers practice this by offering free shipping on orders over a certain amount. This often costs you extra money in the end.

  * For example, you’re shopping online and your total comes to $23.75. A notification pops up—you’re just $1.25 away from qualifying for FREE shipping. You add one more book to your order to snag the deal. That book cost you an extra $11, whereas paying for shipping would have cost just $4. 



**When you’re faced with something free, take a moment to question your decision-making.** Ask yourself: If this _wasn’t_ free, what choice would I make? Could I justify this purchase if the “free” part was eliminated?

### Irrationality Trigger #4: Social and Market Norms

We all operate within two norms simultaneously. **The first set of norms are _social norms_ —requests are made and obliged because of the human need for connection and community**. These social transactions have three key parts: they provide pleasure to both parties; there isn’t a need for immediate “compensation”; compensation isn’t monetary—it’s a reciprocal act of connection or community, such as inviting your neighbor for dinner to thank her for mowing your lawn.

**The second set of norms are _market norms_ —requests are made and obliged because they are expected and enforced. **The key parts of market transactions are directly opposite those of social transactions: they’re not necessarily for pleasure; there’s a need for immediate compensation; compensation is monetary—non-monetary compensation is considered inappropriate.

Usually, you’ll keep these two worlds separate—you wouldn’t offer your friend payment for the dinner they cooked for you, or pay your employee with home-cooked meals instead of money. However, these two worlds occasionally mix—and the blurring of the two often creates irrational and unexpected outcomes. Sometimes, this will be to your advantage, but other times it can seriously damage pre-established relationships.

**When you introduce market norms to social relationships, social norms disappear—often harming the social relationship permanently.**

  * For example, a daycare in Israel tried enforcing a late pick-up fee to encourage parents to be timely. Instead, the parents started showing up _later_ —now that they were paying for the right to be late, they weren’t bound by the social expectations of being on time. 



**On the other hand, introducing social norms to market relationships usually has a _positive_ outcome. **

  * For example, a group of lawyers refused when asked to significantly discount their fees when working with residents of a retirement home. However, when they were asked to _volunteer_ their time and expertise to help the retirement home residents, they agreed. The social norms made them more interested in fulfilling social obligations than making money.



Furthermore, an experiment at MIT showed that people operating under unpaid social norms tend to work significantly harder than those operating under paid market norms. This suggests that the cultivation of social relationships is the best way to get people to do cheaper, more effective work for you.

  * This idea extends to your workplace. While it feels more _rational_ to have market relationships with employees, it’s more _effective_ to create social relationships.**** Doing so taps into the sense of purpose, motivation, and loyalty that employees feel toward their work. You can accomplish this by fostering excitement about the work—for example, by reporting positive customer reviews or recognizing individual employees for excellent work.



### Irrationality Trigger #5: Emotional Arousal

**We think we know ourselves well enough to accurately predict decisions that we’ll make—but we don’t take into account that there are _two selves_ driving our decisions. **

  * The first is who you are in a “cool state,” when you’re able to make decisions calmly and rationally. 
  * The second is who you are in an “aroused state.” In an emotionally aroused state—such as when you’re hungry, afraid, or sexually excited—you tend to make choices that are neither rational nor in your best interest.



Most people think that if they _know_ their aroused self will act irrationally, they can train themselves to think clearly and rationally. **However, experience with a particular aroused state doesn’t make you better at controlling how you act when you’re in that state again.** The decisions you practice when you’re in a calm state won’t hold in your aroused state.

**It might not be obvious, but procrastination stems from this discrepancy between cool state decisions and aroused state decisions.** Procrastination is simply the abandonment of rational plans in order to indulge in whatever will appease your aroused-state emotions. You set your goals with the best intentions—while in your rational cool state. When your emotions are triggered, you naturally act in ways that aren’t aligned with what you _want_ to do.

Because you can’t predict how you’ll act in an aroused state, you have to work against procrastination by creating natural guidelines toward rational decisions. There are three helpful anti-procrastination tools.

  1. **Pre-commitments** are promises or decisions your cool-state self makes that are aligned with the way you _want_ to act. These commitments are made in such a way that when it comes time to act, you’re either held accountable to another person—such as a gym buddy—or the decision is made for you—as with an automatic savings plan. 
  2. **Breaking the cycle of random rewards** is helpful if you spend too much time on things that _should_ be put off until later, like checking your phone or email. These activities randomly deliver rewards such as a text from a friend, or an important email. When rewards aren’t predictable, they take on a surprising, addictive sheen; reducing the possibility of random rewards removes this temptation. Try putting your phone on Do Not Disturb while you work, or set your emails to chime _only_ when an urgent email comes in. 
  3. **Creating positive associations** can give you a type of “reward” for doing unpleasant tasks you usually put off, such as doing laundry or studying for exams. This helps fulfill your need for immediate gratification and prevents you from seeking it elsewhere. Try watching your favorite show every time you fold laundry to create an association between the two activities. 



### Irrationality Trigger #6: Ownership Bias

Ownership is an inherent part of our lives, but unfortunately, it drives us to make poor selling and buying decisions.

#### Irrational Selling Decisions

**There are four particularities of human nature that drive poor _selling_ decisions: **

  1. You naturally start to love things as soon as you own them.
  2. You focus on potential losses more than potential gains. 
  3. You assume that the buyer shares your view of the item. 
  4. Your sense of ownership becomes stronger the more work you put into an item. 



**These particularities combine to create _the endowment effect_ —that is, when you own something, you value it much more than other people do. **This contributes to poor selling decisions in several ways.

  * First, it’s harder to part with an object when you love it or are focused on its loss—driving you to price it exorbitantly, or not sell it at all. 
  * Second, when you price items you’ve put a lot of work into, you’re pricing based on your effort—not on the _actual_ (lower) value of the item. 
  * Third, you’ll assume that your price is fair, because you know the item’s cost-worthy features. However, the buyer won’t see how the item is better than another, similar, lower-priced item. 



It’s very difficult to think objectively about your possessions, but by recognizing how ownership colors your perspective, you can be more receptive to the advice of neutral parties—such as a friend or real estate agent. Their clearer ideas of the value of your possessions can help guide your decision-making.

#### Irrational Buying Decisions

**Poor _buying_ decisions stem from the fifth particularity of our nature—you can feel ownership of an object _before_ you even own it. **This is called _virtual ownership_ , a powerful selling tool that usually comes in the form of advertisements and trial periods.

  * **Advertisements** feed you a visual story where you can imagine yourself owning a product—which causes you to naturally fall in love with it. 
  * **Trial periods** , on the other hand,**** let you _experience_ what it’s like to own a product. Because trials replicate the feeling of ownership, you’ll naturally start to feel that the product is yours and become averse to losing it.



**In both cases, your lack of real-life ownership starts to feel like a loss** —driving you to buy and therefore _actually_ own, the product.

You can avoid the trap of virtual ownership in several ways. First, when you see an advertisement, think about how the product will _really_ show up in your life. Second, avoid trial periods if you don’t need the product—once you “own” the product, it starts to _feel_ like a need.

### Irrationality Trigger #7: Options

**It’s human nature to keep as many options open as possible. However, having too many options distracts you from your goals and causes you to miss out on disappearing opportunities.** There are three ways to stop wasting time on insignificant options and commit to decisions:

**1) Narrow your options.** Recognize when options realistically have very little opportunity or potential and eliminate them from your thinking. Some of these options are insignificant and easy to dismiss—such as eliminating little-enjoyed activities from your children’s schedules. Other times, these options will be significant and difficult to choose between—such as choosing your major in college. In these cases, you’ll have to put a great deal of thought and commitment into deciding which option is the best choice for _you_.

**2) Consider your losses.** Even with only two options before you, you’ll spend time trying to decide which option is the “correct” choice. In these cases, focus on what you lose by _not_ making a choice.__ For example, not committing to a major means you miss out on interesting electives, or staying in a fizzling relationship prevents you from creating happy memories with a new partner. While keeping many options open _holds_ many opportunities, actually committing to one option is what _grants_ you opportunity.

**3) Recognize disappearing options.** Examine options in the context of the long term—you’ll discover which options have a sense of urgency, because they won’t be available forever. These opportunities demand that you invest time and energy in them _now_. These options can be incredibly significant—such as choosing to spend more time with your children than on work—and other times, important in a small way—such as choosing to quit a club in order to spend more time enjoying your garden. This exercise eliminates options that don’t serve your best interests in the long term or can be revisited at a later time.

### Irrationality Trigger #8: Expectations

**Your perception of events is heavily colored by your expectations and knowledge going into an experience.** This doesn’t just influence your _belief_ of what happened—your expectations can _physically modify_ your sensory perceptions.

  * For example, in blind tests between Pepsi and Coke, most people prefer Pepsi. However, when people are told what brands they’re drinking, they overwhelmingly prefer Coke—their ideas of the brand physically modify the taste they experience. 



Expectations—conscious and subconscious—exist in all facets of your life, and it’s important to try to keep them as unbiased as possible. While it’s difficult to “unlearn” the information that colors your experience of an event, you can find ways to make decisions and sort through problems as rationally as possible.

  * You might present a neutral account of what happened to prevent people from arguing “their” side and highlight factual discrepancies. For example, instead of arguing, “You stole money from our savings for a ridiculous purchase, and you didn’t even ask me!” you could try, “Money was taken from our joint savings account for a large purchase that wasn’t agreed upon.” 
  * You could ask a neutral third party to help with arguments—such as a couples therapist.



**The placebo effect is one well-known way that our expectations can drastically alter the outcome of an experience.** The placebo effect is more nuanced than the simple belief that you are receiving effective medicine—experiments show that when medications and products come at a higher price, the placebo effect is _stronger_ because we naturally associate quality and high prices. This means that companies and providers can not only influence how well we _think_ products, procedures, or medications are working, but how well they _actually do_ work—just by bumping up the price.

**It’s a natural, unconscious reaction to think that low price is equivalent to low quality—putting in a moment of conscious thought goes a long way toward interrupting this irrational reaction.** This moment of thought might look like reading the active ingredients in brand name and generic brand medications to objectively see that they’re the same medicine or reading user reviews when comparing two similar, but differently priced, products.

### Irrationality Trigger #9: Trickle-Down Distrust

The _rational_ way to consume resources is to commit to ensuring that resources aren’t exploited or depleted, so everyone can enjoy the benefits. However, there are often people and organizations that act in their short-term self-interest and destroy the resources for everyone in the long term. As a result, we naturally feel that we can’t trust organizations with public resources—they’ll exploit them, sooner or later. **This general distrust of organizations has far-reaching implications.**

First, we irrationally apply distrust to _everyone_ instead of just the person or organization in question. For example, people are so used to seeing organizations use the word “free” as a sly marketing half-truth that they automatically think that _any_ “free” offer must be a trick—so when a peer offers them something for free, they automatically distrust the intentions behind it.

Second, we’re more likely to _engage in untrustworthy behaviors ourselves_ when we feel that others are not trustworthy. These dishonest behaviors may be beneficial in the short term, but they’re irrational because they only serve to continue the cycle of distrust. Those who _do_ act with honesty are punished for doing so—men who don’t lie about their height are overlooked, or a candidate with an unembellished résumé doesn’t land an interview. In the future, they will also resort to untrustworthy behavior, because it’s the only way to be competitive.

**If we worked toward building trust instead of spending energy on “winning” or avoiding being swindled, we’d be able to reap more rewards from our exchanges and transactions.** The only way out of the ongoing cycle of distrust and untrustworthy behaviors is to _become more trusting_. There are two ways that you can accomplish this: consciously stop contributing to interpersonal distrust and engage with trustworthy organizations.

**1) Consciously stop contributing to interpersonal distrust.** Trust is an easily exploited resource—make sure that the way you communicate isn’t contradictory or doesn’t rely on confusing or hidden subtext. For example, make sure you _always_ say what you mean. If you tell an employee that there’s “no rush” on a project, don’t become upset when they don’t start working on it right away.

**2) Engage with trustworthy organizations.** Working on interpersonal relationships helps establish small pockets of trust, but recall that most _general_ distrust trickles down from distrust of organizations that exploit resources. To repair your general sense of distrust, engage with trustworthy companies that don’t demonstrate self-serving behaviors. Ask yourself: Does this company engage in initiatives that are in the interest of the common good, such as reducing carbon emissions? Is this company’s marketing misleading or dishonest?

### Irrationality Trigger #10: Rationalized Dishonesty

**We irrefutably think of ourselves as good and honest people, even though everyone is guilty of dishonest actions—like taking a roommate’s leftovers or swiping a few pens from work.** Usually, your decisions about whether or not to act honestly depend on your conscience, which is essentially the internalization of social values.**** However, the influence of your conscience is only so strong—at times, the financial benefit of acting dishonestly can overpower your moral compass.****

We put laws and oaths in place to prevent dishonesty, but the promise of financial benefit is _strong_. People easily find loopholes that allow dishonest dealings. For example, pharmaceutical companies can’t bribe doctors with money, but they _can_ send them on nice vacations.

**The key to being honest is recognizing the irrational mental gymnastics we go through in order to think of ourselves as honest while acting dishonestly.** The type of dishonesty perpetrated by otherwise honest people _is at least one degree separated from cash,_ because the absence of money makes it _much_ easier for you to rationalize your actions. Rationalizations leave our consciences untriggered—we can believe that we’re honest people, despite the fact that we _regularly_ engage in dishonest actions.

  * For example, if you write off lunch with a friend as a business expense, you might think, “She works in a similar field so this was a valuable networking opportunity.” 



The first step to becoming more honest is recognizing the ways you’ve rationalized dishonest behaviors. When you know your patterns of rationalization, it’s easier to spot them when they come up and consciously work against them. The second step is interrupting these thought processes by reframing your thinking—**think about the cash value of your dishonesty.** For example, if you’re about to write off that lunch as a business expense, ask yourself, “Would I take $100 directly from my company?”

### Irrationality Trigger #11: Making Choices Aloud

**When we make decisions aloud, we tend to be less satisfied with the outcome.** This is because**** we tend to make very different choices in front of others than we would privately. And, when we make decisions aloud in a group, everyone in the group makes much more varied choices than if they were choosing privately. We do this because we have a need to project a certain “individual” image of ourselves to others. On the other hand, those who make decisions privately are more often satisfied with their choices—their decisions come from their preferences, not their need to prove something.

Be aware of this inherent need to make individual choices. While it may only result in a small unsatisfying decision—like ordering a drink you didn’t really want—it has the power to drive a large, life-altering decision—such as choosing a university you don’t _love_ because a rival already chose your first pick.

It’s helpful to think ahead about your decisions, so you’re not tempted to change them in front of others.

  * First, _know what you want_. If you wait to hear the decisions of others before making a choice, you’ll be easily influenced. 
  * Second, _try to announce your decision first._ Announcing your choice first puts a “claim” on the decision, and protects your individuality, even if someone else makes the same decision as you.



### What Human Error Can Teach Us

**Many of our practices are based largely on information about how people _should_ act, but it’s clear that we should be more focused on learning how people _do_ act.** By doing so, we can find ways—irrational though they may be—to improve our communities and social relationships, make better choices for ourselves, and act with honesty.
