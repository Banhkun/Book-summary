## Chapters 10-11: Why You Usually Get What You Expect

_Rationally_ , when you and another person witness an event together, you should have roughly the same experience and account of what happened. Of course, this isn’t always the case. Imagine that you’re at the dog park and your dog and another start fighting. You’re outraged because the other dog clearly started the fight. To your surprise, the other dog’s owner is also outraged, convinced _your_ dog was the instigator.

Your knowledge that your dog is always friendly makes you _sure_ that he couldn’t have started the fight—but of course, the other owner feels the same way about her own dog. **As it turns out, your perception of events is heavily colored by your expectations and knowledge going into an experience. This doesn’t just influence your _belief_ of what happened—your expectations can _physically modify_ your sensory perceptions**.

#### Experiment: Beer and Vinegar

At MIT, students were offered a choice between two beers. _Beer A_ was regular Budweiser, and _Beer B_ was Budweiser with two drops of balsamic vinegar added to each ounce. Each student was asked to taste the two beers and then choose which they’d like a pint of.

  * Students who weren’t given any information about the beers usually _chose the vinegar-laced Beer B_ after the taste test.
  * Students who were told about the vinegar before the taste test overwhelmingly favored Beer A. 



In a second part of the experiment, students were divided into two groups: those who were informed about the vinegar in their beer _before_ they tasted it, and those who were informed _after_ they tasted the beer. The results showed that those who learned about the vinegar after they tasted the beer enjoyed it much more than those who knew about the vinegar beforehand. According to satisfaction surveys given in both parts of the experiment, those who learned about the vinegar post-tasting enjoyed the beer just as much as those in the blind taste test who didn’t know about the vinegar at all.

The students’ experience with the beer was not changed by the _information_ they had—if this was the case, both the groups who were informed about the vinegar would have given a low rating, whether they’d received the information before or after. **This experiment reveals that experiences are shaped by _expectation_ —the information we have before an experience is much more influential than the information acquired after the experience. **

### Why Awareness of Expectation Influence Matters

Expectations—conscious and subconscious—exist in all facets of your life, so it’s important to understand how your expectations are influenced and how to keep your expectations as unbiased as possible.

Sometimes, the influence of expectation shows up in fairly innocuous ways. Much of your perception of how good or bad food products are depends on their branding. For example, in blind taste tests, most people prefer the taste of Pepsi to Coke. However, when people are told ahead of time whether they will be drinking Pepsi or Coke, they tend to enjoy the taste of Coke more. This is because Coca-Cola advertisers work hard to associate their brand with pleasant images and memories so that you quite literally “taste the feeling” that their advertisements evoke.

Other times, expectations can have far-reaching and detrimental effects. _Stereotypes_ lead us to expect that certain types of people will behave a certain type of way. We then act unjustly toward them, based on what we _expect_ they’ll be like—not based on what they’re _actually_ like.

Furthermore, your expectations for yourself can be influenced by stereotypes about _yourself._ One study of Asian-American women revealed just how easily this can happen. Recall that, stereotypically, women are often considered weaker in mathematics, but Asian-Americans are considered very good at math. In the experiment, there were two groups of Asian-American women.

  * Group A answered a series of questions pertaining to their _gender_ and then took a math exam. 
  * Group B answered a series of questions pertaining to their _race_ and then took the same math exam. 



**The results showed that those women who were primed to think about their gender—and subconsciously, the attached stereotype—performed worse than those who were primed to think about their race.**

(Shortform note: Read our summary of Blink __ to learn more about how priming can shape experiences.)****

### How to Unravel Your Expectations

**It’s very difficult to “unlearn” the information that colors your experience of an event, but you can find ways to work around this information in order to make decisions and sort through problems as rationally as possible.**

Many of our irrational conflicts and arguments stem from people arguing “their” side of an experience or agreeing with whichever side they _expect_ to be better. You see this all around you—in sports, spousal arguments, and even international conflicts. There are several ways to get around this.

  * First, if possible, you can lay out the unbiased facts of what happened, not _who did what_. For example, “Money was taken from the joint account to make a large purchase. One person didn’t know about the purchase. The joint account was agreed upon as a saving-only account, not spending.” This prevents accusations and highlights factual discrepancies that might be fueling a misunderstanding. 
  * Second, you can ask a neutral third party to step in and help you hash out arguments—such as a couples therapist.



### The Placebo Effect

**The placebo effect is one well-known way that our expectations can drastically alter the outcome of an experience.** This phenomenon operates on two mechanisms:**faith** and **conditioning.**

  1. **Faith:** If you have faith in the drug or the procedure, it’s more likely to make you feel better. Additionally, if you believe that your doctor is giving you the correct amount of attention and care, it boosts your confidence in their work and you believe that their care is working. 
  2. **Conditioning:** Your body naturally releases chemicals in expectation of what’s to come. If you have confidence in a treatment or a caregiver, you’ll _expect_ to feel better—prompting your body to produce chemicals that do, in fact, make you feel better. Imagine you have a very painful injury, and you see someone approaching with morphine. Expecting relief, your body will start releasing opiates and endorphins before the needle even touches your skin. 



#### How Price Exacerbates the Placebo Effect

**The placebo effect is more nuanced than the simple belief that you are receiving medicine—as it turns out, the placebo effect can be _strengthened further_ by attaching higher prices to medications and procedures. **

##### Experiment: The Painkiller Trial

In an experiment, patients were asked to test the effectiveness of a new painkiller. The patients read a brochure about the painkiller and then rated their pain levels as they underwent a series of electric shocks. Then, they were given the “painkiller” (a vitamin C tablet) and once again asked to rate their pain levels in response to a series of electric shocks.

  * In the first session of the experiment, the painkiller was listed in the brochure at _$2.50 per dose_. Almost all the patients reported lower levels of pain once they’d taken the painkiller.
  * In a second session of the experiment with different patients, the painkiller was listed at _10 cents_ per dose—and only _half_ of the patients reported lower levels of pain in response to the shocks. 



**The higher the price of the medication, the more effective patients assumed it would be—making the placebo effect stronger.**

#### The Placebo Effect Everywhere

**This relationship between price and the strength of the placebo effect isn’t limited to experiences in healthcare** —**you can see it at work in a range of products.** Many products are marketed with the promise that they’ll enhance your athletic performance, improve your concentration, or fight fatigue. As it turns out, these products often do what they say they will, simply because clients believe they will—and the higher the price of the product, the stronger this effect becomes.

In an experiment, students were offered drinks that suggested they would be “better performing.” One group of students bought the drink at its regular price, and another group bought it at a 30% discount. After a short athletic exercise, both groups were asked if the drink helped them feel less fatigued. Those who purchased the higher-priced drink reported a lower level of fatigue than those who purchased the discounted drink. As expected, the relationship between price and placebo effect altered their subjective experience with the drink.

However, in a second part of the experiment, students were asked to perform a short anagram-unscrambling exercise after consuming the performance-enhancing drink. The results revealed that those students who bought the drink at full price scored higher on the exercise than those who bought the discounted drink.

**These results suggest that by attaching higher prices to their products, companies can not only alter how well we _think_ they’re working, but how well they _actually do_ work. **

### Questions Raised by the Placebo Effect

**The influence of expectations on outcome raises a number of important questions about honesty in healthcare and marketing.** Our practices are based largely on information about how people _should_ act, but we should be more focused on learning how people _do_ act.

#### Prescriptions

Because placebos _have_ been proven to deliver their intended result, should doctors knowingly prescribe them? This puts doctors in a difficult situation—they want to help their patients, but they can’t be expected to _lie_ to their patients. But, if they were to tell their patients the treatment is a placebo, the positive effects would diminish or disappear.

#### Healthcare Systems

Should we push the most expensive medicines and treatments, driving up healthcare costs but ensuring the most effective results? Or should we lower healthcare costs by pushing generic drugs, at the risk of treatments being less effective? It’s also important to consider that those in poorer communities must regularly resort to cheaper, and therefore less effective, medical care—how can this injustice be corrected?

#### Marketing

Should false marketing claims be acceptable? This question becomes a bit more difficult to grapple with when you ask yourself if promises made in marketing campaigns are _really_ lies if they help shape our expectations and influence our experience enough to make said promises true.

### Thinking Against the Placebo Effect

It’s been found that those who take a moment to think rationally about the relationship between quality and price are less likely to feel that a cheaper product is less effective. There are several ways you can practice rational thinking as a consumer.

  * Read the active ingredients in brand name and generic brand medications to objectively see that they’re the same medicine. 
  * Read user reviews when comparing two similar, but differently priced, products. 
  * Rationally question yourself about _why_ you believe a higher-priced product might work differently from its identical, lower-priced counterpart. 



**It’s a natural, unconscious reaction to think that low price is equivalent to low quality—putting in a moment of conscious thought goes a long way toward interrupting this irrational reaction.**
