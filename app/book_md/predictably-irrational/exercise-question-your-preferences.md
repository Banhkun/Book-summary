## Exercise: Question Your “Preferences”

One way to help ensure that you’re making rational choices is to reflect on the _reasons_ you’re making those choices.

* * *

Think of one of your purchasing habits (for example, a latté every morning, or a new iPhone every time a new model comes out). Describe the habit.

How did this habit start? Try to think back to your first decision to purchase this product.

Think about if this habit is really a _preference_ —how much pleasure or satisfaction do you get when you indulge in it?

How could you cut back on this habit, or alter it so that it costs you less money?
