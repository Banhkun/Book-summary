## Exercise: Think About How the Decoy Effect Has Influenced You

Stopping the decoy effect from influencing your decisions depends on being aware of what faulty or forced comparisons look like in your life.

* * *

Think of the last purchase you made where you had to choose from a set of options (for example, purchasing a new refrigerator or selecting from a menu at a restaurant). What decision did you make?

What factors led you to the option you ultimately decided on? (For example, the fridge model seemed to be the best value, or the lobster was a good price.)

Looking back, how do you think the decoy effect may have influenced your purchase? (For example, the fridge you chose was the mid-price model in the shop, or the lobster was the second most expensive item on the menu.)

How would you have made the decision differently, if you were conscious of how relativity was a factor?
