## Exercise: Think About How You Rationalize Dishonesty

When you consider yourself an overall honest person, it becomes easy to excuse or rationalize your instances of dishonesty. Work on recognizing how you may be falling into this trap.

Think of a recent time you acted dishonestly. Describe the situation.

How did you rationalize this dishonesty to yourself?

If you were to reframe this act of dishonesty in terms of cash, what would that look like?
