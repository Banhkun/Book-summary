## Chapters 13-14: Why Honest People Act Dishonestly

There are two types of dishonesty. The first type is starkly criminal, premeditated, and at times violent—such as a bank robbery. The second type of dishonesty is non-violent and encompasses transgressions both criminal—such as embezzlement or insurance fraud—and relatively innocuous—such as swiping your coworker’s yogurt from the communal fridge.

Everyone is guilty of this second type of dishonesty—who hasn’t refilled their soda at a fast-food restaurant, or taken pens from work? **What’s irrational is that though we recognize we’re guilty of dishonest actions, we irrefutably think of ourselves as good and honest people.** In this chapter, we’ll explore the reasoning for this discrepancy.

First, we’ll look at an experiment from MIT that aims to demonstrate how anyone—even those normally considered honest, upstanding people—can be easily tempted into dishonesty. Furthermore, this experiment explores _how far_ people will go into their dishonesty when given the chance.

#### Experiment: How Much Do Honest People Cheat?

Participants were asked to take a test consisting of 50 multiple-choice questions, writing their responses directly on the test paper. After 15 minutes, they were to transfer their responses to an answer sheet. They would receive a reward of 10 cents for each correct answer. Each group tested under slightly different conditions.

  * **Group A** was the control group. They were told to give both their answer sheet and their test sheet to the exam supervisor, who would count their correct answers and give them the appropriate reward. **On average, members of this group answered 32.6 questions correctly.**
  * **Group B** received answer sheets that were lightly pre-marked with the correct answers—giving them the opportunity to change responses when transferring their answers from the test sheet. They were told to tally their correct answers on the answer sheet and write the number at the top. They would give both sheets to the supervisor, but he would only look at the number at the top of the answer sheet. **On average, members of this group answered 36.2 questions correctly.**
  * **Group C** also received pre-marked answer sheets. Students were instructed to destroy their test sheets and only give their answer sheets to the supervisor. **On average, members of this group answered 35.9 questions correctly.**
  * **Group D** also received pre-marked answer sheets. They were instructed to destroy both the test sheet _and_ the answer sheet. Instead of letting the supervisor tally their answers and give them their reward, they were asked to simply take the correct amount of money from a jar at the front of the room. **On average, members of this group took an amount of money equivalent to 36.1 correct answers.**



The results suggest that when honest people have the opportunity to cheat, they will—but only a little. Each cheating group cheated about the same amount, regardless of risk. **It seems that people have an _inherent limit_ to acting with dishonesty. **

### Your Conscience (Usually) Sets the Limits

**Usually, your decisions about whether or not to act honestly depend on your conscience, which is essentially the internalization of social values.** When you act in line with society’s values, the reward center of your brain lights up and you don’t have the nagging voice in the back of your mind. But, when the way you act is _not_ aligned with socially acceptable behavior, the conscience starts calling for you to change your behavior.

However, it seems that the conscience doesn’t have much influence when it comes to matters of dishonesty that are so small, you barely think about them. These moments may look like borrowing your sister’s shirt without asking or grabbing someone’s soda from the communal fridge. You don’t stop to consider if these actions have any bearing on your honesty, so your conscience isn’t triggered. The conscience kicks in when you consider transgressions that are large enough to make you wonder whether the action is wrong—such as selling a bag of your sister’s shirts at a thrift shop or taking an entire _case_ of soda from the fridge.

**Unfortunately, the influence of your conscience is only so strong—at times, the financial benefit of acting dishonestly can overpower your moral compass.** This is frequently seen in fields like politics and medicine. A politician might call in some favors for a certain lobbyist, provided he’ll see a generous donation come campaign season. A doctor might prescribe medicine you don’t really need because he gets a kickback from the pharmaceutical company.

Of course, we try to put external controls in place to prevent this type of dishonesty from happening. But the promise of financial benefit is _strong_ —and people easily find loopholes that allow them to continue their dishonest dealings. For example, lobbyists are banned from treating members of Congress to sit-down dinners—so they invite them to cocktail parties with passed hors d’oeuvres instead.

### What’s to Keep Us Honest?

If we can’t rely on our conscience to hold us accountable, and external controls aren’t effective, is there _anything_ that can make people act more honestly?

#### Experiment: The Ten Commandments

Two groups of participants were tasked with solving as many problems as they could in 5 minutes on a 20-question math test. Their names were then entered into a lottery—if they won, they’d receive $10 for each of their correct answers. Before taking the exam, each group performed a different memory task:

  * **Group A** was asked to write down the titles of 10 books they remember reading in high school.
  * **Group B** was asked to write down the Ten Commandments (or at least, the Commandments they could remember).



A separate control group was _not_ asked to perform a memory task and handed their test sheet and answer sheet to the supervisor after the exam. **Group A** and **Group B** self-reported their correct responses on the answer sheet and got rid of their test sheet—giving them the opportunity to fudge the numbers in their favor.

The control group solved 3.1 problems correctly, on average. Group A—who recalled books from high school—cheated a little, on average reporting 4.1 correct answers. Group B—who recalled the Ten Commandments— _didn’t cheat_. They scored the same as the control group.

**These results suggest that reflecting on a touchstone of moral standards can encourage people to be honest.** We can already find these types of moral reminders in our lives—doctors and lawyers sign professional oaths, and students sign honor codes before taking exams. To become more honest in our everyday lives, we’d have to reflect on honesty and our values at the moment of temptation or have honor codes ready to sign at any moment.

### How We Rationalize Dishonesty

Of course, it’s not possible to constantly sign contracts, and it’s unlikely you’ll take a moment to reflect on moral benchmarks in a moment of temptation. **The key to being honest is recognizing the irrational mental gymnastics we go through in order to think of ourselves as honest while acting dishonestly.**

Reflecting on the examples of dishonesty we’ve discussed thus far, you’ll notice that the type of dishonesty perpetrated by otherwise honest people _is at least one degree separated from cash._

**Dealing with cash has a similar effect to signing an honor code** —while you’d take a few pens home from work, you wouldn’t take $3 you saw laying on the conference table. Likewise, pharmaceutical companies won’t bribe doctors in cash, but they _will_ treat them to lush vacations.

#### Experiment: Non-Monetary Tokens

To understand the correlation between honesty and cash, we’ll examine an experiment much like the one discussed earlier in this chapter. Students were asked to solve 20 math problems and were told they’d receive 50 cents for each correct answer.

  * **Group A** was the control group. They took their worksheets to the supervisor, who would count their correct answers and give them the corresponding payout.
  * **Group B** was asked to destroy their worksheets, and then tell the supervisor how many correct answers they should be paid for. 
  * **Group C** was asked to destroy their worksheets, and then tell the supervisor how many correct answers they had. The supervisor would then give them a plastic token for each correct answer, and then they would walk across the room to another supervisor and exchange their tokens for 50 cents each. 



The results showed that on average, students in Group A had 3.5 correct answers, and students in Group B claimed 6.2 correct answers. Students in Group C claimed _9.4 correct answers_. Furthermore, in the experiment described earlier in this chapter, only 4/2000 students claimed to answer every single question correctly. In this experiment, 24/450 (or, scaled up, 320/2000) students claimed to answer every single question correctly—and _all_ of them were in Group C.

**These results suggest that when dealing with non-monetary currency, people will cheat _significantly_ more than they will with money. Additionally, working with nonmonetary items seems to eliminate the inherent restraint that our conscience imposes on us. **

#### How Does Cash Keep Us Honest?

**The absence of money makes it _much_ easier for you to rationalize your actions.** If you take an extra soda refill after your meal, you might tell yourself, “They added too much ice, so the first soda was really only half full.” Or, if you write off lunch with your friend as a business expense, you might think, “She works in a similar field so this was a valuable networking opportunity.”

These rationalizations, and our untriggered consciences, are what allow us to tell ourselves—and others—that we’re honest people, despite the fact that we _regularly_ engage in dishonest actions. This is especially concerning in an increasingly cashless society—not only can we more easily rationalize our dishonesty toward others, but corporations can rationalize acting dishonestly toward _us._

The headache of attempting to use frequent flyer miles is a great example of this. When you try to redeem your saved-up miles, you’ll likely find that there are no flights available. You call a representative who confirms the dates are blacked out—but suggests that using 10,000 more miles would free those dates up. Of course, these “miles” represent several hundred dollars, but the representative isn’t asking you to fork over cash. She’s asking you to add more miles to your account. But, by making your saved miles unusable—requiring that you purchase _more_ miles to even render them usable—the airline has essentially stolen several hundred dollars from you.

#### Becoming More Honest With Thoughts of Cash

The first step to becoming more honest is the recognition of the ways you may have rationalized dishonest behaviors. Find the patterns of your rationalization—such as, “Everyone does this,” or “They won’t even notice.” When you know your patterns of rationalization, it’s easier to spot them when they come up and consciously work against them.

Then, you can interrupt these thought processes by reframing your thinking. When you are tempted to act with dishonesty, think about the cash value of your behaviors. For example, if you’re about to write off dinner with a friend as a business expense, ask yourself, “Would I take $100 directly from my company?”
