## Exercise: Set Up Decisions for Your Aroused-State Self

Building guidelines toward the decisions you want to make can help you avoid falling victim to your aroused state self’s need for instant gratification.

* * *

Describe an area where you often see a large gap between your cool-state decisions and your aroused-state decisions. (For example, you decide to be social at parties, but you clam up with anxiety when you get there. Or, you want to study for tests, but abandon the library as soon as your friends invite you elsewhere.)

What gets in the way of sticking to the decision your cool state self made? (You think people won’t want to chat with you. Socializing is objectively more fun than studying.)

What are some tools you can put in place _now_ to prevent poor decision-making in the future? (You ask your partner to actively include you in conversations at the party so you _have_ to speak up. You turn off your phone and sit in a remote part of the library to study.)
