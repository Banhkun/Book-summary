## Chapter 3: The Power of “Free”

**In this chapter, we’ll discuss the concept of “free,” how it’s used to trigger irrational choices, and its potential for driving positive social change.**

“Free” is a powerful marketing tool because we are inherently attracted to things that are free. This is because almost every transaction has an upside and a downside. The upside is that you gain something from the transaction. The downside is that you’ve spent money and it’s possible you won’t be satisfied with your purchase.

**“Free” eliminates the possibility of a downside in a transaction.** There’s no risk that your money will be spent on a dissatisfying purchase. Furthermore, because the free item is upside-only, you perceive it as much more valuable than it really is. For these reasons, you’ll naturally choose a free item above all else, even when it’s not the most rational choice. The following experiment illustrates how the possibility of getting something for free can interrupt rational thought processes.

#### Experiment: The Chocolate Sale

In this experiment, a chocolate-selling stand was set up in one of MIT’s student centers.

  * In the first part, customers had the choice between a Lindt truffle for 15 cents, or a Hershey Kiss for one cent. In this scenario, 73% of the customers chose the Lindt truffle. This was a rational choice—not only was the Lindt truffle an objectively superior product, but it was being offered at a very attractive price. 
  * In the second part, each chocolate’s price was lowered by one cent. Now, the Lindt truffle was 14 cents, and the Hershey Kiss was free. Even though the Lindt truffle was still a superior product at a great price, the label of “free” on the Kisses had more power—this time, 69% of the customers chose the Hershey Kiss. 



This behavior is especially interesting because it contradicts the standard economic model, which would predict that, because both chocolates were reduced in price by the same amount, there should be no difference in purchase rates. Customers would do the same simple cost-benefit analysis as when both chocolates came with a cost, and conclude that the Lindt truffle would be a far more pleasurable experience for a very small cost. **However, the standard economic model doesn’t take into account the power of “free.”** Instead of thinking through a cost-benefit analysis, humans quickly push rational decision-making aside in favor of a transaction with no downside.

### Even Attached to a Price, “Free” Works

It’s fairly common sense that when you’re presented with two products—one free and one at a price, no matter how small—that you’ll choose the free item. However, what’s less common sense is**** that “free” has the power to influence your choices even when you’re choosing between two products that must have a price. **Just by attaching the concept of “free” to a purchase, advertisers can trigger an irrational reaction in you that benefits them, and costs you more money.**

You’ll commonly see online retailers putting this in practice by offering free shipping for orders that exceed a certain amount. While free shipping may _feel_ like a good deal, it often costs you extra money in the end. Imagine that you’re shopping on Amazon, and your total comes to $23.75. You receive a notification that you’re just $1.25 away from qualifying for FREE shipping. You add one more book to your order and successfully snag the free shipping deal. The problem? The book you added cost you an extra $11, whereas paying for shipping would have only cost you $4.

If you’re skeptical that it’s truly the idea of “free” that triggers this reaction and not just low-cost shipping, consider what happened in France when Amazon rolled out their free shipping concept. Instead of _free_ shipping, Amazon.fr chose to offer shipping at the very, very low cost of one franc (20 cents). When the shipping was a low cost—even a negligible amount like one franc—customers acted much more rationally and made fewer impulse purchases to push their order amount to the threshold for the shipping discount.

While falling victim to the trap that “free” presents might not be a big deal on smaller purchases like books, be careful not to let it influence the way you make larger decisions, like buying a new car. Imagine you’re looking for a new car for your family—you have the choice between a sports car and a sturdy SUV. The SUV costs a bit less and rationally, is a better match for your needs. However, your salesperson mentions that the sports car comes with _free_ oil change for four years. Triggered by the idea of getting something for free—and irrationally, thinking that these oil changes will make up the difference in cost between the two cars—you spring for the sports car.

### Diminishing the Power of Free

**The first part of diminishing the power that “free” can have is recognizing the ways it might be showing up in different aspects of your life.** Keep in mind that it’s not only used to trigger irrational purchases. It can also be used to manipulate how you spend your time—you wouldn’t spend 45 minutes standing in line for ice cream unless it was Free Cone Day at Ben & Jerry’s or unless each ice cream came with a free t-shirt.

**The second part is questioning how the presence of “free” might be affecting your decision.** Take a step back and think:

  * If this _wasn’t_ free, what choice would I make? 
  * Would I be able to justify this purchase or time spent if the “free” part were eliminated?



Taking a moment to think consciously about why you might be making certain choices is a helpful step in interrupting the natural, yet irrational, reaction we have to free items—thus clearing the way for a more careful and rational analysis of what the best choice is.

### The Positive Power of Free

**It’s important to keep in mind that the power of “free” _can_ be used toward positive outcomes if harnessed correctly. **First, we’ll look at an example of how you can use it on a small scale in friendships, and then we’ll discuss how the power of free can drive social changes.

#### Dinner With Friends

Knowledge of humans’ natural positive reaction to “free” can help you strengthen the bonds of your friendship group—all you need to do is pick up the tab at your next outing.

Recall that nearly every transaction has the downside of having to spend money. If all of your friends need to chip in a bit for their portion of dinner, _everyone_ at the table experiences this downside. **However, the negative feelings associated with spending money only worsen to a certain point, and then plateau.**

Imagine that every $20 spent is one unit of discomfort, and this discomfort plateaus around $60. If you and five friends went for dinner and each owed $20 at the end of the night, your group would experience a total of 6 units of discomfort. However, if you were to pay the entire bill yourself, you would only experience 3 units of discomfort and would spare the rest of your group any discomfort at all.

Ideally, another friend would have the responsibility of picking up the check at the next outing, and another at the outing after that. This continues the cycle of diminishing the downside of the transaction and thereby increasing the perceived value of the get-together, and it triggers the positive emotions that come with getting something for free.

#### Social Change, for Free

Another positive aspect of “free” is its potential for getting people to participate in programs that benefit their communities, their health, or the environment. For example, to encourage more people to drive electric cars, you could add the influence of “free” to the purchase—such as in an offer for free emissions testing or free weekend parking in your city. Or, to encourage more people to get preventative medical exams, such as mammograms and colonoscopies, make these exams free. Reduced copays don’t spark the same amount of interest or motivation as zero-cost copays.
