## Chapter 6-7: How Emotional Arousal Derails Decision-Making

**We tend to think that we know ourselves well enough to accurately predict decisions that we’ll make—but we almost never take into account that there are _two selves_ driving our decisions. **The first self is who you are in a “cool state,” when you’re able to think through your decisions calmly and rationally. The second self is who you are in an “aroused state.” In an emotionally aroused state—such as when you’re hungry, angry, afraid, or sexually excited—you tend to make primal choices that are often neither rational nor in your best interest.

#### Experiment: Arousal’s Effect on Sex-Based Choices

Consider a 2-part experiment done at Berkeley that illustrates the discrepancy between how the cool-state mind and the aroused-state mind work. In the first part of the experiment, male students were asked several sets of questions about sex. Their responses were recorded on a scale from 0-100 (0 being definitely no, and 100 being definitely yes).

  * The first set of questions focused on activities they might take part in, such as, “Would you be able to enjoy sex with someone you hate?” or, “Would you enjoy sex with a 60-year-old woman?” 
  * The second set of questions focused on the immoral activities they might engage in for sex, such as, “Would you consider drugging a woman to increase the likelihood of having sex with her?” 
  * The third set of questions addressed the likelihood that they’d use birth control—“Would you always use a condom if you didn’t know the sexual history of your partner?” 



In the second part of the experiment, the same students were asked to masturbate—thereby getting themselves into a state of arousal—and then respond to the same questions. **_Every single_ _participant_ answered the questions differently in their aroused state than they did in their cool state.**

  * Their desire to engage in different sexual activities was 72% higher. 
  * The likelihood that they’d engage in immoral activities for sex was 136% higher. 
  * The chances that they would forego the use of birth control were 25% higher.



### Can We Recognize Our Triggers?

Though you may be aware that you have “two selves,” it turns out that people are never _fully_ aware of the influence that arousal can have. Most people think that, with the knowledge that their aroused self will act irrationally, they can easily train themselves to think clearly and rationally.

However, **having experience with a particular arousal state doesn’t make you better at understanding or controlling how you’ll act when you’re in that arousal state again.** Even if the aroused state is something you feel often, such as hunger or sexual arousal, you’ll almost always assume that the decisions you make when you’re in a calm state will hold in the aroused state—even if you’ve seen, again and again, that this isn’t so.

Imagine that you pick fights with your spouse every time you’re in the aroused state of hunger. Hunger is _not_ a new feeling, and you know you always act like this. Each time, you apologize once you’ve had something to eat, vowing to be more patient with him and more aware of your “hanger.” Your cool-state self decides that next time, you certainly won’t lash out. But of course, the next time you’re starving and he’s clicking his pen too loud or leaves his socks in the middle of the floor, you lose it.

#### How This Knowledge Should Affect Policies

This insight into the mistake of trusting our aroused-state selves to make the same decisions as our cool-state selves is particularly important to reviewing systems or processes put in place to keep us safe. **Many of these systems rely on cool-state decisions, in aroused-state situations.**

For example, abstinence-only sex education doesn’t work because teenagers agree _in a cool state_ that they won’t have sex and they’ll stop things before they go too far. Of course, it’s much harder to keep those promises in an aroused state. A better approach might be _abstinence-forward_ sex education which encourages abstinence but _also_ encourages having birth control readily available in case the aroused-state self takes over.

Another area with a significant discrepancy between cool-state and aroused-state decisions is when it comes to teenage drivers. Teenage drivers understand the rules of driving, know that it’s dangerous to speed or drive recklessly, and promise their parents that they’ll be safe. However, teenage drivers easily get caught up in the excitement of having friends in the car. This aroused state causes them to start making bad decisions, such as speeding or becoming distracted. Rather than simply trusting teenage drivers to make good choices, it might be smarter to build systems into cars that can restrict speed, or even automatically send messages to parents.

### Procrastination

**It might not be obvious, but procrastination also stems from the discrepancy between your cool-state decisions and your aroused-state decisions.** Procrastination is characterized by pushing long-term goals aside in favor of immediate gratification—that is, you abandon your rational plans in order to indulge in whatever will appease your aroused-state emotions.

You can recognize this process playing out around you every day. You’ve promised to start eating healthier but you see a delicious chocolate cake—you tell yourself, “My diet starts _tomorrow_.” Or, you’ve committed to studying in the library all night, but your friend invites you to get drinks. “I can just cram before the test tomorrow morning,” you tell yourself.

You set your goals with the best intentions—while in your rational cool state. When your emotions are triggered, you naturally act in ways that aren’t aligned with what you _want_ to do. Recall that humans aren’t able to predict how they’ll act in an aroused state—therefore, it’s not possible to _just_ commit yourself to your goals. How, then, can you consciously work against a procrastination problem? The following experiment will clarify how simply knowing that you have a procrastination problem can set you up to find ways to work against it.

#### Experiment: Essay Deadlines

Three groups of students were assigned three essays over the course of a semester. Each group received different instructions about their deadlines and possible penalizations:

**Group 1:** The professor let each student set their own deadlines, which would be set in stone at the end of the first week of class. They could space the deadlines evenly, or set all three for the last day of class. If they handed in a paper past their deadline, they’d receive a penalization of 1% off the grade each day it was late. The professor _suggested_ setting deadlines every four weeks, and most of the students chose this option.

**Group 2:** The professor set no deadlines for their papers—students simply had to hand in all three papers before the last day of class. Subsequently, there was no risk of losing points on missed deadlines throughout the semester.

**Group 3:** The professor set firm deadlines every four weeks.

At the end of the semester, the three groups had varied results.

  * Group 3, with strict deadlines, finished the semester with the best grades overall. 
  * Much of Group 2 rushed all three papers at the last minute and received the overall worst grades. 
  * Group 1, with deadlines they’d put in place themselves, finished the semester with average grades. 



##### How Does This Experiment Translate to Everyday Procrastination Issues?

We can draw several conclusions from this experiment. **First, as we know, the _worst_ way to deal with procrastination is to assume that you know what decisions you’ll make in the future.** Much of the third group may have started the semester with the best intentions, thinking they’d hand in papers every few weeks, but in the end, procrastination took over and they ended up sacrificing quality by rushing through their assignments.

**Second, the _very best_ way to deal with procrastination is to have someone impose a task on you, with the promise of a threat**—such as a lower grade on a paper, or losing your job. Of course, strict enforcement isn’t a feasible option in many personal situations of procrastination, and many of the small things we procrastinate on aren’t high-stakes enough to motivate us.

**Third, the _most practical_ way to deal with procrastination is to use available tools and opportunities in your cool state to hinder irrational decision-making in your aroused state.** We see that many students in Group 1 were aware of their procrastination problems—this is why most of them chose to follow the professor’s suggestion of regular deadlines. They knew it would be a useful tool in preventing problems down the line.

Being aware of your procrastination tendencies puts you in a great position to create guidelines that will help you act in line with what you _actually_ want, instead of getting distracted by what will give you immediate gratification.

### Setting Yourself Up Against Procrastination

Because you can’t predict how you’ll act in an aroused state, your best bet in working against procrastination is putting tools in place that will act as natural guidelines toward rational decisions—even when your line of thinking is irrational. **There are three helpful anti-procrastination tools.**

#### Tool #1: Pre-Commitments

Pre-commitments are promises or decisions your cool-state self makes that are aligned with the way you _want_ to act. These commitments are made in such a way that when it comes time to act, you’re either held accountable to another person, or the decision is made for you.

For example, you might find an exercise buddy and promise to work out together every week. Skipping the gym to binge a new show becomes much harder when you know that you’re letting someone else down. Or, if you have trouble saving money, you might sign up for your employer’s automatic savings program. You’re not tempted by the immediate gratification of spending your money, because the money surpasses you completely.

#### Tool #2: Breaking the Cycle of Random Rewards

It’s possible that your procrastination manifests in spending too much time on things that _should_ be put off until later, such as checking your phone or email. These activities are tempting because they randomly deliver rewards such as a text from a friend, or an important email. When rewards aren’t predictable, they take on a surprising and exciting sheen. This is why gambling is so addictive—you never know when you’ll win, and the next pull of the lever might be a jackpot.

**Reducing your random rewards reduces your temptation to take part in the activities that normally deliver them.** For example, if you pick up your phone every time you get a notification, switch on the Do Not Disturb feature while you’re working. If you have a habit of mindlessly scrolling social media while you should be doing homework, add an extension to your web browser that blocks select sites for a predetermined amount of time.

#### Tool #3: Creating Positive Associations

If there’s a task you find particularly unpleasant and subsequently put off, such as doing laundry or studying for exams, you can create positive associations so you get a type of “reward” for completing the unpleasant task. This helps fulfill your need for immediate gratification and prevents you from seeking it elsewhere.

For example, every time you need to fold laundry, boot up Netflix and watch an episode of your favorite show while you fold—try not to watch the show outside of laundry time, so you associate the pleasant feeling of watching the show directly with doing laundry. Or, if you have trouble sitting down in the uncomfortable library to study, find a coffee shop near campus where you can enjoy comfortable couches and indulge in a latté. Soon you’ll associate the act of studying with the cozy atmosphere of a coffee shop.

**You can’t simply vow to make better decisions. However, by putting systems and tools in place ahead of time, your cool-state self does the heavy lifting of decision-making for your aroused-state self.**
