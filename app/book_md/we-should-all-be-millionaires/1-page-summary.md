## 1-Page Summary

In _We Should All Be Millionaires_ , self-made millionaire Rachel Rodgers argues that all women, especially women of color, can and should strive to become millionaires. According to Rodgers, society and media perpetuate disempowering stereotypes about women and money that keep them from earning more. She rejects common advice to simply work harder or to live more frugally and argues that women must instead change how they think and feel about money, reclaim their time and energy, and stop underselling themselves. By following Rodgers’s advice, you’ll learn to be financially confident, grow your wealth, and live with more freedom and autonomy.

Rodgers is a business coach, intellectual property attorney, and the founder and CEO of HelloSeven, a multi-million dollar coaching company that aims to teach women and people from marginalized communities how to build wealth.

In this guide, we’ll explore Rodgers’s strategies for how to increase your wealth in three parts:

  * In Part 1, we’ll examine the obstacles women face that keep them from becoming wealthy. We’ll then discuss ways to reframe your mindset about money and gain financial confidence.
  * In Part 2, we’ll explore how you can reclaim your time and energy so you can dedicate them to building wealth. 
  * In Part 3, we’ll show how you can overcome imposter syndrome, recognize the value of your work, and start growing your wealth today.



Along the way, we’ll compare Rodgers’s advice with that of other entrepreneurs and business experts, and we’ll provide actionable suggestions on how you can apply her strategies to your life.

### Part 1: Transform Your Mindset About Money

According to Rodgers, the first step to becoming a millionaire is to **transform the beliefs you have about money that hold you back from earning more and building wealth.**

(Shortform note: In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield writes that you develop limiting beliefs about money as a result of your childhood experiences. Your parents might have told you that wealthy people exploit others, for instance, making you reluctant to become wealthy yourself.)

Rodgers writes that for most of American history, the government has prevented women from gaining economic power. In the United States, women have only been financially independent for half a century. Before the mid-1970s, women couldn’t own their own bank account, pursue higher education, start a business, or make use of other financial resources without having a man involved.

(Shortform note: Women have faced obstacles to gaining economic opportunities and financial power not only in the US but globally. Although the US and other nations have passed laws in recent decades that have granted women more power, some studies reveal that 178 countries still have legal restrictions that prevent over two billion women from having equal economic opportunities as men.)

Today, even though legal barriers are gone, society and the media continue to teach women disempowering beliefs about wealth that many women have internalized. From a young age, men are encouraged to be bold with money and to take financial risks. Women, on the other hand, are taught to be cautious about money and that building and managing wealth is difficult. Because of this conditioning, women frequently undersell themselves and doubt their financial skills.

(Shortform note: One study shows just how differently men and women view money, and these different views can be seen as reflecting the gendered conditioning around money: When asked to describe how they felt about money, women most commonly used the word “stress,” while men most commonly felt “hopeful.” The majority of women surveyed also stated that their biggest financial goal was to stop worrying about money, a goal that indicates that many women still harbor doubts about their ability to make and manage their money.)

While we can’t easily dismantle stereotypes or rewrite history, we _can_ alter our beliefs and our strategy for making money. In the following sections, we’ll cover Rodgers’s advice on how to quash the limiting beliefs many women have about money and discuss how to adopt a new, money-positive mindset.

#### Reframe Your Limiting Thoughts

Rodgers writes that your thoughts inform your actions, so **to take positive steps toward earning more, you must think more positive, empowering thoughts about money.** According to Rodgers, women's limiting beliefs are one major obstacle that keeps them financially disempowered. Many simply don’t _think_ they can make more money, and they justify this belief by convincing themselves that money isn’t important to them, that making money requires a grueling grind, or that they’re simply not skilled with money. This, in turn, prevents women from making changes or trying new strategies to increase their wealth.

> **Reframe Limiting Thoughts to Hold Onto the Money You Already Have**
> 
> In _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ , T. Harv Eker argues that your money mindset doesn’t only determine _if_ you make money—it also determines if you can _hold onto_ the money you already have. Your mindset defines your “financial setpoint,” or the maximum amount of money you subconsciously trust yourself to manage. If you earn more than that amount, you’ll start behaving in ways that deplete your wealth back down to your setpoint, since your mindset causes you to doubt your ability to handle that much money.
> 
> For example, you might start spending more freely on things you don’t need. Developing more empowering thoughts, then, may help you raise your financial setpoint, which is especially critical for women, as Rodgers argues.

Rodgers suggests you practice _thought work_ —reflecting on and transforming your negative thoughts into more helpful ones. By reframing negative thoughts, you’ll have fewer self-imposed obstacles to your financial success. Rodgers provides steps for changing your thoughts:

**Step #1:** Be more mindful of your thoughts. Notice when a new thought pops into your head so that you can reflect on it. For example, you might pay attention to what thoughts pop into your mind as you apply for a new job.

**Step #2:** Identify whether your thoughts are helpful, empowering you to believe in yourself and make positive changes to your life, or if they trigger negative emotions that leave you feeling stuck. For example, if you don’t have some skills listed in a job posting, you might think you’re not good enough to get the jobs you want. This unhelpful thought makes you feel inadequate and discouraged, which prevents you from taking positive action.

**Step #3:** Challenge your negative thoughts and replace them with more empowering ones. This way, you can focus on moving forward and taking action rather than feeling stuck and powerless. For example, you might tell yourself that skills can be built and you simply need to make time to develop them.

> **Defuse a Negative Thought**
> 
> If your thoughts leave you engulfed in negative emotions, it may be hard to take a step back and reflect on whether they’re helpful or productive, as Rodgers suggests you do. In _The Happiness Trap_ , Russ Harris provides a strategy called defusion that can help you gain distance from your negative thoughts to more easily reflect on them. Unlike the thought work Rodgers suggests, Harris’s strategy focuses not on replacing or eliminating negative thoughts, but on simply _accepting_ them. Let’s examine Harris’s defusion technique and compare it with Rodgers’s thought work practice.
> 
> **Step 1:** Rodgers suggests you first be more mindful of thoughts that pop into your head. To do this, Harris would argue that you must be connected with your “observing self.” He makes a distinction between your thinking self (which judges and interprets situations) and your observing self (which is simply _aware_ of situations). When you’re connected with your observing self, you develop a meta-awareness of the thoughts you’re having. Rather than thinking, “I’ll always be poor,” you think, “My brain is having the thought that I’ll always be poor.”
> 
> **Step 2:** Next, Rodgers recommends you identify whether a thought is helpful or not, but Harris suggests you first _defuse_ it, or gain distance from the thought. To do this, you must recognize your thoughts as simply words instead of universal truths. He provides four methods for defusing, including imagining a cartoon character saying your negative thought, which gives you a different perspective from which to look at your thoughts.
> 
> **Step 3:** Like Rodgers, Harris also suggests you ask yourself if a thought is helpful. However, he provides different suggestions on what to do with helpful and unhelpful thoughts. He argues that negative thoughts can be helpful if they encourage you to take positive action. If there’s nothing you can productively act on, Harris writes that there’s no need to replace your negative thoughts. Instead, simply let them go by redirecting your attention to more helpful thoughts.

#### Take Responsibility for Your Finances

In addition to reframing your thoughts, Rodgers writes that you must**take responsibility for properly managing your finances.** Being able to manage your own money will give you confidence in your financial knowledge and help you spend your money wisely. When you know what’s happening with your finances, you won’t live in uncertainty and doubt your spending decisions. To gain control over your money, you must record and organize your finances with accounting systems so that you can make informed decisions and meet your financial goals.

(Shortform note: You might worry that you don’t know how to manage your finances or use accounting systems. However, experts argue that to build confidence in anything, _you must act even if you don’t feel ready_. In _The Confidence Code_ , Katty Kay and Claire Shipman write that women often have an inaccurate perception of their abilities and that confidence comes as a result of action, not the other way around. When you take responsibility for your finances, you’re taking actions that require you to trust and have confidence in your ability to handle money, which will, in turn, help you become _even more_ confident about your financial affairs.)

Rodgers provides three tips on how to manage your finances:

**Tip #1:** Check your bank accounts daily. Rodgers recommends getting a bookkeeping software or hiring a bookkeeper to help you keep track of your finances. This allows you to monitor your progress toward your financial goals and detect potential challenges early on.

(Shortform note: An additional way you can monitor your bank accounts and keep track of your finances is to set up bank account alerts, which provide you with updates that allow you to act immediately and make better financial decisions. Different banks offer different alerts that you can receive through email or text that automatically inform you about any changes to your account.)

**Tip #2:** Schedule a regular time each week to review your net worth, credit score, and recent spending habits. This helps you better understand how your spending affects your wealth, enabling you to make decisions that save you money. Additionally, when you see positive changes, you’ll be more motivated to continue tracking your wealth.

(Shortform note: When reviewing your finances for the week, T. Harv Eker recommends you reflect on one thing that went well and one thing that didn’t. Reflecting on things that went well can motivate you, as Rodgers suggests. Reflecting on things that didn’t go well helps you practice taking responsibility for your financial situation and learn from your actions so you can find solutions to meet your financial goals.)

**Tip #3:** If you have debt, stop feeling ashamed about it. Rodgers argues that shame is counterproductive and makes it harder for you to confront your debt, which you must do if you want to erase it. Reframe your debt in a positive light. Doing this helps you accept your financial situation and take action to resolve your debt. For example, if you have mortgage debt, you might reframe it by recognizing that you want your family to live in a nice home and be well provided for. When you see it this way, you’ll feel empowered to work toward eliminating it.

(Shortform note: While Rodgers argues that you should reframe your current debt positively so that you can confront it, in _The Simple Path to Wealth_ , JL Collins argues that you should avoid seeing debt as good or normal. Normalizing debt makes it likely that you’ll accrue _more_ debt and thus limit your options in life, he argues. However you choose to view your debts, Collins provides a method on how to pay them off: First, rank your debts based on interest rate, from highest to lowest. Then, prioritize paying off the highest-interest debt first while paying the minimum balance for the rest of your debts. This method saves you the most money, he argues.)

#### Focus on Growing Your Wealth, Not Shrinking Your Lifestyle

Rodgers proposes another change you must make to your approach to money: **Rather than obsess over how to _save_ money, focus on how you can make _more_ money.** Rodgers argues that it’s hard to build wealth if you have a substandard lifestyle due to penny-pinching. For example, if you sleep on an old, broken mattress because you’re afraid to spend money on a new one, you can’t get the quality sleep needed to pursue a promotion at your job or study for a higher degree that will increase your income.

(Shortform note: Rodgers's suggestion to not worry about saving money runs counter to advice from other financial experts. The authors of _The Millionaire Next Door_ argue that being frugal is the foundation of wealth accumulation and that many millionaires became wealthy by budgeting their expenses and living below their means. They suggest you spend less and invest more to reduce your taxable income. So, while it likely makes sense to focus on making more money as Rodgers recommends, it may still be worthwhile to exercise some restraint in your spending, create budgets, and cut back on unnecessary expenses.)

In many cases, you must spend money to make more money. Rodgers describes steps that let you upgrade your lifestyle so you can better build the future life you want:

**Step #1:** Imagine your dream life in detail: your ideal home, the experiences you want to have, and the things you want to own. Calculate how much that lifestyle would cost you each month. This provides you with a clear goal to aim for and inspires you to pursue it.

(Shortform note: What if you don’t know what your dream life looks like? In _The Secret_ , Rhonda Byrne recommends creating a vision board that allows you to visualize your dream life by collecting images. First, get a poster board and attach pictures onto it that represent the people, things, and experiences you want to have in your life. Then, place your vision board where you can see it often to further inspire you to pursue your dream life. Once you have a vision board, you should still make the cost calculations Rodgers recommends so you have a clear number to aim for when building your wealth.)

**Step #2:** Picture the person living that dream life—your ideal self. Think of how they treat themselves and others, how they spend their time, what they eat, and how they dress. Now, think about what changes you can make right now to be more like your ideal self. For example, you might devote more time to making home-cooked meals instead of eating fast food on the drive home from work.

> **How Behaving Like Our Ideal Self Changes Our Identities**
> 
> In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear uses the concept of _identity_ to explain why behaving like the person you want to become is an effective way to bring about personal change. He notes that your actions reinforce your identity and vice-versa. So, the more you act in a certain way, the more you start to believe that’s who you are. Therefore, if you take Rodgers’s suggestion to act like your ideal self, your actions will make you naturally start _feeling_ like you’re that person, and you’ll continue behaving in that same manner.
> 
> For example, if you spend an hour every week reviewing your finances, you’ll start to feel like a person who’s financially responsible. This identity motivates you to keep tracking your finances and use your money wisely because you’re a financially responsible person and that’s what financially responsible people do.

**Step #3:** Brainstorm new ways to meet your financial goals and take your first step toward your dream life. Rodgers suggests you set a deadline for making one positive change to your life—like getting a new mattress before your birthday—and come up with ways you can make extra money. By making an upgrade to your life, you’ll improve your mood, environment, and ability to make money.

> **Why You Should Sometimes Spend More to Make More**
> 
> In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins echoes Rodgers’s suggestion, adding that enjoying the money you have helps reinforce your motivation to build wealth. If you don’t reward yourself occasionally, you’ll associate making money with pain and sacrifice rather than pleasure, which subconsciously limits your desire and ability to build wealth.
> 
> While Rodgers makes the concrete argument that upgrading your life will improve your mood, environment, and ability to make money, Jen Sincero makes a more spiritual argument for spending on yourself. In _You Are A Badass_ , she writes that spending money to make upgrades to your life lifts you to a higher frequency of living. By being at a higher frequency, you can tap into more of the universal energy source all humans are linked to, allowing more money to flow into your life.
> 
> And while Rodgers suggests you set a deadline and find ways to make money, Sincero writes that the money will come naturally: Take leaps of faith, spend the money you have, and trust that the universe will help you find ways to pay for it.

### Part 2: Maximize Your Time and Energy To Make More Money

We discussed how shifting your mindset and attitude about money can help you overcome self-imposed barriers, but Rodgers believes that’s not enough to make you a millionaire. **To build your wealth,** **you must also make decisions that free up your time and energy** , things women tend to give away too easily. In the following sections, we’ll explore Rodgers’s advice on how to reclaim your time and energy.

(Shortform note: To better make decisions that free up your time and energy, it may help to get clear about what you value. In _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , Mark Manson argues that most people feel compelled to care about too many things and that, to be happy, you must reject anything that doesn’t align with your goals or values or bring you joy. To identify your values, Manson suggests you recognize when you’re experiencing a negative emotion and ask yourself why you may be experiencing it. This can often clue you in to what matters to you.)

#### Set Healthy Boundaries

Rodgers writes that the first step to reclaiming your time and energy is to **honor your own needs by setting boundaries: Know and communicate to people what you will and will not do.** There’s a widespread belief that women should always put others, such as their children or the household, first. As a result, women usually handle the majority of domestic work and parenting on top of their jobs, leaving them with no time to advance their careers or pursue other goals.

To combat this imbalance, you must refuse to let people exploit you and use up your time, whether at home or at your workplace. When deciding on what you will and won’t do, Rodgers suggests you make decisions that add to your life rather than detract from it—decisions that make you happier, healthier, and more energized. Stop accepting demands that leave you exhausted and overextended (for instance, agreeing to look over a coworker’s project when you’re on vacation). Rodgers argues that you don’t need to feel guilty for setting boundaries and declining others’ requests. You’re simply saying “yes” to yourself after sidelining your own needs for so long.

> **Additional Suggestions on Setting Boundaries**
> 
> In _Girl, Stop Apologizing_ , Rachel Hollis agrees with Rodgers on the importance of women setting boundaries and honoring their personal needs. She explains that women are taught even as girls to put other people first and that, if they focus on themselves, they aren’t being a “good woman.” Not only can this belief hinder women’s ability to advance their careers and build wealth, but it can also lead to mental and physical illnesses. Hollis additionally notes another reason why you shouldn’t feel guilty for setting boundaries: You have only one life to live, and it would be a shame to give over any of your time to pointless feelings of guilt.
> 
> Like Rodgers, Hollis argues that women must communicate their limits to avoid overextending themselves. She provides additional suggestions on how to say “no” to other people’s demands.
> 
>   * **Decline requests that don’t fit your priorities**. Hollis recommends you make a list of what you prioritize in your life (such as your family, your creative time, or your career) to know what requests to decline. Like Rodgers, she suggests you accept requests if they bring you joy. However, she adds that you should occasionally help someone who’s struggling (as long as you don’t do it excessively).
> 
>   * **Say “no” as soon as possible.** If you wait, you’ll either cave in and comply with the demand or you’ll say no too late and put the other person in a bind.
> 
>   * **Be polite but honest.** Tell people directly that you can’t meet their request. If you make up an excuse, they will likely try to find a solution that enables you to help them.
> 
>   * **Be firm.** Avoid saying “maybe” or offering to check your schedule. Hollis writes that it’s easier for everyone if you give an honest answer.
> 
> 


#### Recruit Help and Delegate Tasks

Even after setting boundaries, you may still face many tasks that take up your time and energy. Rodgers suggests you **hire people to do household or administrative tasks that are necessary but not enjoyable.** She recommends you outsource anything that drains your energy, that you hate doing, or that you find difficult to do. For example, if you have a messy household and spend a lot of time cleaning, consider hiring a cleaning service. Rodgers advises you start by hiring a personal assistant who can handle a variety of tasks, like sorting through your emails, doing errands, and managing your schedule.

(Shortform note: In _The 4-Hour Workweek_ , Tim Ferriss agrees that you should outsource but suggests you hire a virtual assistant. Unlike a personal assistant, a virtual assistant works remotely, and you can hire them from anywhere in the world. This gives you more options and teaches you how to manage people, which is an important skill to acquire if you’re trying to build a lucrative business. Like Rodgers, Ferriss recommends you delegate tasks that you dislike, but he adds that you should also consider delegating items that have been on your to-do list the longest and tasks that interrupt you.)

You might be reluctant to spend money when you’re trying to grow your wealth, but Rodgers argues that you can build your skills and career with more focus and energy and spend more time generating income this way. Further, when you learn to delegate, you can lower your stress and free up time to do what you want, which can improve your health and happiness.

(Shortform note: An alternative to hiring people to shoulder some of your load is to simply learn to ask for help from people around you, such as your friends, family members, or partner. In _Girl, Stop Apologizing_ , Rachel Hollis argues that women often feel guilty asking for help because they’re afraid of inconveniencing others. However, Hollis states that many people are happy to help if you show appreciation and reciprocate in kind. To have more energy and time to build your wealth, consider, for instance, speaking up about your needs to your partner and asking them to take over some household duties.)

#### Build a Close Network of Successful Women

Now that you’ve cut out unreasonable demands and delegated tedious tasks, Rodgers proposes a way to use your time and energy: **Build a network of successful women who can support you and your financial goals.** A close cohort of women can provide you with gender-specific support, a sense of belonging, and more opportunities. Rodgers explains that the majority of highly-successful women have a close group of women.

> **Why Women Must Network Differently Than Men**
> 
> Research supports Rodgers’s suggestion to form a close network of women and reveals why this is: Women benefit from receiving “private” information, which includes insider tips and gender-specific recommendations—for example, how to navigate social dynamics or work in an all-male team. Men, on the other hand, only need “public information” to succeed. Public information is more surface-level and includes knowledge of new job opportunities or salaries.
> 
> Some experts argue that private information is crucial for women because they face different societal standards and obstacles than men. By forming a close network of women, you can receive and share more private information that well-connected male contacts may not have.

Rodgers offers tips on how to cultivate a small, close network of women:

**Tip #1:** Join new communities. You don’t have to limit yourself to professional groups. Rodgers recommends you simply find a community that shares your beliefs, values, and interests and focus on building sincere relationships with other women.

(Shortform note: In _Your Money or Your Life,_ Joseph R. Dominguez and Vicki Robin write that beyond providing you with support and opportunities, joining communities and forming sincere relationships also helps save you money. They write that loneliness is expensive because you have to rely on _things_ (which cost money) to fulfill your needs. On the other hand, members of communities share freely with one another, which allows you to fulfill your needs and other people’s needs without spending money.)

**Tip #2:** Reach out to friends and colleagues you’ve lost touch with. One way to reconnect is to do something for them. For example, you could reach out and tell them that you voted on their entry in a photography contest.

(Shortform note: In _Never Eat Alone_ , Keith Ferrazzi provides tips for identifying what you can do for others as a way to reconnect: Check their social media posts for clues and remind yourself of their goals. If you still can’t figure out what you can do for the other person but want to get back in touch, consider doing something to support their health, wealth, or children. Ferazzi writes that these are things that everyone consistently values.)

**Tip #3:** If you can’t find the community you’re looking for, Rodgers suggests you create your own group based on your interests.

(Shortform note: How do you go about creating your own group? Rodgers doesn't provide specific advice, but others suggest you first define the purpose of your group: Consider what long-term aspirations you have for your group and what value you'd like to provide to your members.)

### Part 3: Recognize Your Value and Increase Your Wealth

Now that you’ve learned how to adopt a better mindset about money and make time and energy to build your wealth, how can you actually _make_ more money? Rodgers writes that women often underestimate the worth of their work and do more work for less pay than men. So to become wealthier, **you must overcome imposter syndrome and start charging what you’re really worth.** In the following sections, we’ll look at Rodgers’s insights on how to do so.

> **Exploring Factors Behind the Gender Wage Gap**
> 
> Research shows that the gender wage gap has been relatively unchanged over the past 20 years—women still earn about 82% of what men earn. While Rodgers argues that women work for less pay because they tend to undervalue their work, others write that parenthood norms are behind the pay imbalance. Fathers receive a “fatherhood wage premium,” participating more in the labor force and earning higher pay than men without children.
> 
> On the other hand, women who become mothers encounter more disadvantages in the workplace and often work fewer hours. While overcoming imposter syndrome may help many women advocate for themselves, this research suggests we must also shift underlying societal norms and gender roles.

#### Overcome Imposter Syndrome

First, to be able to recognize your value, you must overcome **imposter syndrome—the tendency to doubt your skills and abilities and feel undeserving of your accomplishments.** If you have impostor syndrome, instead of owning your successes, you might credit them to luck or the efforts of others and feel afraid of being discovered as a fraud.

(Shortform note: While, like Rodgers, many experts encourage women to overcome their imposter syndrome, others argue that it’s more important to address the environments in which women work. They argue that feeling doubtful at work is normal, but workplace environments tend to perpetuate these feelings for women. They add that the label “imposter syndrome” gives the impression that it’s an issue _individuals_ bear the responsibility for solving rather than something leaders and organizations should seek to solve. Therefore, while it’s important for women to find ways to recognize their worth, the lack of support and validation for women in the typical workplace must be also addressed for more widespread and meaningful change.)

According to Rodgers, imposter syndrome is a major reason why many women aren’t as wealthy as they should be: It stops them from pursuing more wealth by making them afraid to apply for a promotion, take on tough projects, or start their own business, for instance. Imposter syndrome can also cause stress, anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, thereby negatively affecting your overall well-being.

(Shortform note: We might conceptualize imposter syndrome as _reaching your happiness threshold_. In _The Big Leap_ , psychologist Gay Hendricks writes that we all have a maximum level of success that we're comfortable with—our "happiness threshold"—which is based on the false, limiting beliefs we develop from our early life experiences. This self-imposed limit prevents us from achieving greater success and wealth: As we succeed and approach this threshold, our imposter syndrome kicks in, causing us to feel unworthy and sabotage our own success. Hendricks argues that keeping yourself from pursuing your highest potential for success and wealth can, like impostor syndrome, cause harm to your physical and mental health.)

To increase your wealth and get the pay and recognition you deserve, you must overcome imposter syndrome. Rodgers provides a few tips on how to do this:

**Tip #1:** Don’t be hard on yourself for having impostor syndrome. Many successful women have struggled with it, so you’re not alone in feeling doubtful about yourself. Acknowledge your insecurities around your worth and commit to overcoming them.

**Tip #2:** Write down your achievements, both big and small, as proof of your value. Reviewing your list of accomplishments can remind you that you’re skilled and competent when you feel doubtful.

**Tip #3:** Seek support. This can mean getting help for your imposter syndrome, like by seeing a therapist or finding a space where you can express yourself and feel understood, like a friend group.

**Tip #4:** Challenge yourself physically—run a marathon, go scuba diving, learn to ice skate. Doing physical activities that push you beyond your comfort zone can boost your confidence, which can spill over to other areas of your life, like your career.

(Shortform note: In _The Confidence Code_ , Katty Kay and Claire Shipman write that women who play team sports are more likely to graduate college, land jobs, and work in male-dominated industries than those who don’t. This is because sports familiarize them with failure and setbacks, which helps them overcome them in other areas of life.)

**Tip #5:** Reflect on your natural strengths and talents. Think about the skills that came naturally to you as a child or that contributed to your past successes. You can also consider taking a strengths test. Once you’ve identified your strengths, Rodgers suggests you commit to _one_ and focus on creating related products or services that can make you money.

(Shortform note: Others argue that you should build your entire life around your strengths so you can manage your time more productively and live a more meaningful life. In _168 Hours_ , Laura Vanderkam suggests you identify your natural strengths and schedule your time around them. Block off tasks that involve your strengths and delegate tasks you’re not good at. She also adds a layer of specificity on how to monetize your strengths: Start your own company or talk with your employer about adjusting your job duties to better align to your strengths.)

> **Rethinking Imposter Syndrome: Additional Insights and Strategies**
> 
> Overcoming your imposter syndrome can be a difficult ongoing journey. Thankfully, many psychologists have studied this phenomenon and have additional insights that can help you make the most of Rodgers’s advice:
> 
> **1\. Consider a different label.** Instead of “imposter syndrome,” some experts suggest you use the terms “imposter phenomenon” or “imposter experience” instead. Despite its name, imposter syndrome isn't a diagnosable condition, and many argue that the term is needlessly pathologizing. By opting to use an alternative label, you can help normalize imposter feelings among women and prevent them from feeling like there’s something abnormal or “wrong” with them.
> 
> **2\. Celebrate your achievements.** While Rodgers suggests you write down your achievements to remind yourself of them when you’re experiencing self-doubt, other experts advise you to practice celebrating successes when they happen. This will make it easier overall to internalize and own your successes. You can celebrate your achievements by taking time to appreciate when someone congratulates you rather than brushing it off. Additionally, collect physical reminders of your successes, like a positive client email.
> 
> **3\. Get support from outside your professional or academic group.** According to some psychologists, it may be more beneficial to seek support from family members, friends, or significant others about your imposter syndrome rather than colleagues or classmates. They argue that these individuals can be more validating because they support you unconditionally and help you view your accomplishments and values within the context of your life rather than in a professional or academic context. Conversely, seeking support from your peers may trigger comparison and worsen imposter feelings.

#### Charge What Your Work is Worth

Next, Rodgers argues that you must **raise your prices to match the _value_ you produce rather than the _hours_ you work.** So, for instance, instead of charging $1,000 because your rate is $50 per hour and you estimate that a project will take 20 hours, think about how much value you’ll bring to the final project and charge that—perhaps $5000.

If you’re an employee with a fixed salary, Rodgers suggests negotiating for a higher salary by explaining how much value you contribute to your company. Determine the value you provide by considering the _results_ of your work—the clients you acquired, the time you saved, and the money you helped your company make.

> **Learn to Promote Your Value**
> 
> While determining the value you produce is important, you must also be able to _promote_ your value to others. In _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ , T. Harv Eker writes that how well you promote yourself significantly affects how much money you can make and argues that you should educate yourself on marketing and sales techniques.
> 
> To determine the value of your work, consider rating your product or service from one to 10 according to how much value you think it offers. If it’s less than 10, Eker suggests you figure out how to improve your product to increase its value. According to Eker, this can help you promote yourself and raise your prices with integrity.

Rodgers recommends value-based charging because if you charge by the hour, you actually make _less_ money the more experienced you become at your work. This is because as you gain experience, you’ll be able to complete the work more quickly, thereby reducing your income from the project. For example, you might be a freelance artist who charges $20 an hour. As you gain experience and improve your skills, you might finish a project in 10 rather than 20 hours. Despite producing work of higher value, you’ll earn only $200 instead of $400 from the finished piece.

You might realize that your work is worth more than you’re charging for it, but how should you adjust your rates? Rodgers suggests you simply **double your price** , whether it’s your salary, hourly rate, or the price of your product. She argues that many people produce the same work you produce, but they charge much more. To increase your wealth, simply demand what you deserve and provide high-end results to match. When you increase your rate, your work becomes more valuable. As a result, you make more money and people become more eager to work with you.

> **How to Change Your Rates**
> 
> Experts provide recommendations on how to change your rates: Do it gradually. Start implementing your new pricing system with new clients and clearly communicate to your existing clients why you’re making this change and how much value you’re providing.
> 
> Rodgers suggests you double your price, but if you’re offering a service or a product you can also consider creating multiple packages, or versions of your service or product that have different features and prices. For instance, you might have a cheaper package with basic features and more expensive packages with premium features. When you create multiple packages, you’re still charging what you’re worth, but more customers will be able to work with you. As you implement new features and upgrade what you have to offer, you can then raise your prices accordingly, allowing you to make _more_ money as you gain experience rather than less.
> 
> When you increase your price according to your value, you’ll not only attract _more_ customers, but more of the right type of customers. When you charge a higher price, you draw in people who are more interested in acquiring something of high value than saving money. Such customers encourage you to make more expensive, higher-value products, thereby empowering you to charge what you’re worth.

#### Challenge Yourself to Make $10,000 in Ten Days

Now that you’ve learned to overcome imposter syndrome and charge what you’re worth, **kickstart your wealth-building journey by tackling Rodgers’s challenge to make $10,000 in ten days**. This challenge helps you prove to yourself that you’re capable of making more money than you think you can and empowers you to start increasing your wealth now.

Let’s look at Rodgers’s steps for completing the ten-day challenge:

**Step 1:** Decide how much money you want to make. While Rodgers suggests you aim for $10,000, you can choose a different target you feel comfortable with. She recommends you estimate how much money you think you can make in ten days and then add 30%.

(Shortform note: For many people, making $10,000 in a ten-day period is an intimidating goal. Some experts argue, however, that setting big goals is critical to success. In fact, in _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cardone argues that you should set your goal to be 10 times greater than average. Cardone argues that setting low goals makes you feel dissatisfied and unaccomplished when you meet them.)

**Step 2:** Decide how you’ll reward yourself for reaching your goal. This will help motivate you to go through with your challenge. For example, you might reward yourself with a dream piece of furniture or a vacation.

(Shortform note: Setting a reward for yourself not only increases your motivation, but it can also reinforce your behaviors so that you continue doing them _after_ your challenge is over. For example, if you sold handmade crafts during your challenge and rewarded yourself with a massage upon its completion, you’ll feel more motivated to continue selling your crafts and making money. This is because when you receive rewards, your brain releases a pleasurable chemical called dopamine, which motivates you to repeat the behaviors that make you feel good.)

**Step 3:** Figure out what you’ll do to make money. Rodgers recommends you choose short-term projects instead of long-term commitments—consider offering a service, selling a product, flipping old furniture, charging for your expertise and advice, or hosting a yard sale.

(Shortform note: In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield gives some suggestions on how to brainstorm ways to make money: Think about a problem you want to solve and create a product or service that can help solve it. More specifically, you might ask yourself what you or others need or want, or if there’s a good or service that could make an activity more enjoyable.)

**Step 4:** Spread the word to your friends, family, and coworkers about your challenge so that they can encourage you and support your efforts.

(Shortform note: When thinking about who to share your 10-day challenge with, consider reaching out to someone who has a higher status than you. According to some psychologists, we tend to be more motivated to achieve our goals and perform better after sharing our goals with people we look up to. This is because we value the opinions of higher-status people more and care about how they might evaluate us. With this in mind, you could perhaps prioritize sharing your $10,000 challenge with someone you admire, like a mentor or a supervisor, to boost your chances of success.)
