## Introduction

To understand why you have money problems—why you’re heavily in debt and can never seem to make ends meet or handle emergencies—look in the mirror. **Your financial situation is a result of your behavior** , according to radio talk show host and author Dave Ramsey.

In the _Total Money Makeover_ , Ramsey lays out a program for freeing yourself from debt and money worries by changing your behavior: paying with cash only, eliminating debt, saving for emergencies, and investing. The program is intended for everyone—from high earners to people thousands of dollars in debt.

Rather than offering investment advice, original insights, or the “secret” to becoming rich, Ramsey presents common-sense principles assembled in a step-by-step sequence that can change your financial situation and your life.

### The Lesson of the 2008 Recession

As a storm reveals weaknesses in the structure of a house, a personal or national economic crisis reveals the weaknesses in your financial foundations.

**The 2008 financial crisis illustrated that people and companies can be lulled into doing foolish things in good times that sink them when things go south**.

The recession was triggered by financial institutions, companies, and individuals taking on too much risk and debt for the sake of greed. This had ripple effects, destabilizing not only foolish companies, but also many businesses and people who had been relatively well off but who lacked a financial cushion.

The key lesson: **what works, or seems to work, in good times won’t enable you to survive in bad times unless it’s based on sound financial principles**.

In _How the Mighty Fall,_ Jim Collins writes that the first stage of business failure is a feeling of invincibility that leads to taking risks. For an individual, the risks could be buying on credit and not saving because you’re confident your job is secure or because others are doing it. But overspending, whether it feels “safe” or not, is still foolish. As Ramsey puts it, a turkey may fly in a tornado (people may succeed at doing foolish things in special situations), but that doesn’t mean turkeys can really fly.

**Your financial principles will determine whether you succeed in life**. If you build a house based on unsound principles, it eventually will fail. The Total Money Makeover principles are sound and, therefore, work in both good and bad times.
