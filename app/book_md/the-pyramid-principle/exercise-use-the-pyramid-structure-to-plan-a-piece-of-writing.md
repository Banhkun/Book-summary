## Exercise: Use the Pyramid Structure to Plan a Piece of Writing

In _The Pyramid Principle_ , Minto claims that strong writers brainstorm and organize their ideas into a pyramid structure _before_ they begin writing. Practice this now: Pick something to write, brainstorm your conclusions and supporting ideas, and draft your introduction.

* * *

Think about something you’ll need to write soon. It could be informative (such as a report summarizing your company’s progress), expressive (such as a thank-you letter to a friend), or persuasive (such as a message persuading your social media followers to contribute to a fundraiser). Then, describe your writing piece’s topic, question, and answer (or Peak Conclusion). (For example, your topic may be an upcoming fundraising effort for hurricane relief victims. A reader may wonder, “Why should I donate?” Your answer may be that their donation will save lives and restore victims’ hope.)

Now, use Minto’s top-down approach to generate ideas that support your Peak Conclusion. Start by imagining what question a skeptical reader would ask in response to your answer (your Peak Conclusion). Then, write your Tier 1 conclusions. (For instance, a skeptical reader may wonder, “How will my donation save lives and restore hope?” This could lead you to generate the following two conclusions: “Your donation will provide hurricane victims with emergency supplies such as medicine, food, and water” and “Your donation will provide hurricane victims with hope and reassurance that their community is here to support them.”)

Continue using this question-and-answer technique to generate your next row of supporting ideas. (For instance, a reader might wonder _how_ their donation will provide medicine, food, and water to hurricane victims. You could explain which organizations will be using their donation and what type of relief each organization will provide for families.)

Finally, in the space below, draft an introduction that includes a beginning (which establishes the “where” and “when” of your topic), a middle (which raises the question or problem), and an end (which shares your Peak Conclusion and Tier 1 conclusions). (For example: “A local charity is raising funds to support hurricane survivors. Why should _you_ donate? Because doing so will provide hope to those who’ve suffered great loss and save lives by providing food and water.”)
