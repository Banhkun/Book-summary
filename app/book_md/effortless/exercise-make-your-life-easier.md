## Exercise: Make Your Life Easier

No matter how productive or successful you are, there are always ways to make life easier for yourself. Letâ€™s examine your daily actions and habits and think about ways to take a simpler path.

* * *

Think about the challenges you faced last week at work, at school, or in your personal life. What was the most difficult challenge you had to overcome? What made that challenge difficult?

Now think about what could have made this particular challenge easier to manage before it happened. Was the situation avoidable or largely out of your control? Is there anything you could have done to better prepare yourself? If so, what?

Think about your response to the challenge. Did you feel stress, anger, or any other negative emotions? If so, what impact do you think these emotions had on your ability to overcome the situation? How might you try to mitigate these negative emotions in the future?

Are there any habits that hindered your ability to face the challenge? For example, did you have trouble getting enough rest or staying focused? Write down any bad habits that come to mind and things you can do to counteract them.
