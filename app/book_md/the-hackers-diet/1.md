## 1: How to Lose Weight

There’s a story about financial traders on Wall Street. A novice asks a guru, “How do you make money in the market?”

The guru responds, “It’s simple: buy low, sell high.”

The beginner replies, “How can I learn to do that?”

The guru responds, “Ah — that takes a lifetime.”

**Simple doesn’t mean easy.**

How do you lose weight? It’s simple. Eat fewer calories than you’re burning each day. But simple doesn’t mean easy.

What weight loss really requires is:

  * A fixation on the goal you want to achieve
  * An understanding of what’s required to achieve the goal
  * Developing a rational plan to meet your goal
  * Carrying out the plan
  * Willpower and a high tolerance for pain



This is what’s needed in any of life’s hurdles. This is precisely what losing weight achieves.

The author is John Walker, founder of software company Autodesk. He spent most of his life fat, before figuring out how the body and weight loss works. Then, in less than a year, he lost 60 pounds and kept it off forever.

This book is an engineer’s approach to weight loss, described in terms of control systems, feedback loops, measurement noise reduction, and practical problem-solving.

In the first 4 chapters, we’ll discuss the fundamentals of a successful weight loss plan. Then we’ll discuss the practicalities of starting the weight loss plan. Finally, we’ll discuss what to do when you reach your goal weight and keep it off for good.

### Motivation

If you’ve tried diet after diet and failed each time, what motivates you to try again?

This book will lay out a program that makes the steps easy, and the thought of failure hard to imagine. **It explores the principles of weight that other fad diets ignored** , which caused you to avoid addressing the root cause. After reading this, you should think, “Hey, this isn’t hard at all! I can do this!”

And the goal is worth it. Within months, people will find it hard to imagine you as overweight. You’ll be able to walk up stairs without noticing the exertion. Once you’ve experienced the joy and confidence, you’ll never consider giving it up.

Health and weight loss are rewards that no amount of money, no degree of knowledge can buy.

### Calories: It’s Simple

The human body is a simple system. Everyday, your body needs energy to function — to keep the body warm, to generate new cells, to think. Energy is usually measured in calories.

You eat food to gain energy. **Your weight change depends directly on how many calories you eat, and how many calories you burn.**

  * If you eat the exact same calories as your body needs to function, you do not gain any weight. 
  * If you eat more calories than your body needs, the excess calories are stored in fat. You cannot gain weight beyond what you eat.
  * If you eat fewer calories than your body needs, the deficit is made up by burning fat.



(Shortform note: To make sure you understand this, here’s an analogy: consider a fireplace that burns wood at a particular rate.

  * If you provide wood faster than the fireplace is burning, you get a stockpile of wood logs. This is like your body storing fat and gaining weight.
  * If you stop chopping wood, to continue feeding the fire, you’ll draw from the stockpile and the stockpile will go down. This is like your body burning fat and losing weight.)



This is the basis of **“Calories In Calories Out.”** This is an inviolable rule that applies to every living thing.

The number of calories you burn each day depends on a few factors: 1) your height and build, 2) your activity level, 3) your gender. Very generally, the average normal-weight man burns about 2000 calories a day; the average woman about 1700 calories. If you’re taller than average, have a physically demanding job, exercise a lot, or are overweight, you burn more than this. Take the opposite of all of these—if you’re shorter, sit most of the day, don’t exercise, and are underweight—and you burn less than this.

**To lose one pound of fat, you need to burn 3500 calories more than you eat.** Let’s say you burn 1800 calories a day. If you eat 500 fewer calories each day (1300 calories), you will lose one pound each week.

Likewise, to gain one pound of fat, you need to eat 3500 calories more than you burn. This is not hard to do. 2 cans of beer have 300 calories; one donut has 250 calories. If you ate one donut’s worth of calories each day above what you normally burn, you would gain 1 pound every 2 weeks. In a year, you would gain 26 pounds.

Again, weight loss is simple in principle. **To lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you burn each day.** To maintain your ideal weight, you need to eat the same number of calories as you burn each day. Anyone who practiced both regularly would be at their ideal weight for the rest of life.

### Shortform Exclusive: What Are Fad Diets Doing?

(There’s some confusion about how fad diets don’t require counting calories but still allow for weight loss.

No matter what diet you use, there is no escaping Calories In, Calories Out. To do otherwise would be to violate “conservation of energy,” one of the physical laws of the universe.

Most fad diets don’t talk about this principle because they want their diets to seem more magical than they really are. If they said, “with our diet, you’ll lose weight by reducing your daily calorie intake, which you could do by yourself and your own diet” they would sell a lot fewer subscriptions.

But fad diets do help some people lose some weight, for some period of time (many fall off the diet and regain the weight). It might have done this for you. So for some period of time, the fad diet was causing you to eat less without your having to think about it. Here are the general ways they work:

  * **Water Loss:** Crash diets that promise losing 5 pounds each week simply dehydrate you and get you to pee out water stored in your body. If you follow the diet for more than a week, you’ll find the weight loss slows to a trickle. Then if you return to a normal diet, you’ll regain the water. 
  * **Novelty:** Many fad diets get you to try something new that you haven’t done before. The novelty of new foods is itself pleasurable, which makes up temporarily for the hunger. Once you get used to the novelty, you get bored and eat more of it than you should, or go back to your normal diet.
  * **Restriction of choice:** Diversity of food is a problem for a lot of people. If you have an unlimited choice of foods, you’ll tend to overeat to try them all. Simple rules work by constraining calories in a clearcut way.
    * Intermittent fasting: Restricting eating to certain hours of the day mechanically forces you to eat less.
    * Paleo: Cutting out processed foods forces you to eat only more nutritious and filling foods.
    * Slimfast/Nutrisystem: In the extreme, you eat only the foods we give you, in the amounts we tell you to. Do not eat anything else.
    * The above systems only help you lose weight if you eat fewer calories than you burn. If you eat Paleo-only foods but engorge yourself on high-calorie nuts, you’re still going to gain weight.
  * **Satiety:** Some foods are more filling than others, for the same number of calories. Eating 200 calories of kale will fill your stomach, while eating 200 calories of Oreos will barely make a dent in hunger and make you want to eat more. If you feel more satisfied when eating certain foods, you’ll eat less other food.



This is by and large true. The major difference is that you don’t necessarily absorb all the calories that you eat. For instance, if you have issues with gut health, you’ll tend to absorb fewer calories than people with healthy guts. But for most people, Calories In, Calories Out is by and large true.)

### Does What You Eat Matter?

So far we haven’t focused on nutrition. That’s because, **for the purposes of weight loss, what you eat matters far less than the calories that you eat**. You could lose weight by eating a diet entirely of butter, as long as you’re running a calorie deficit.

Of course, if you can, it’s better to eat a more nutritious diet, balanced among the major macronutrients: carbs, proteins, and fats. It’s also better to get sufficient vitamins in your diet. If you eat a varied diet, it’s very unlikely you’ll run short of a vitamin — if you’re worried, just eat a multivitamin.

(Shortform note: This is true assuming you can methodically stay under the calorie target. But for many of us, _what_ you eat also affects _how much_ you want to eat:

  * Some foods make you feel more full for the same number of calories. Eating 200 calories of greens will fill your entire stomach; eating 200 calories of Oreos will barely make a dent. Eating the first will keep you full for longer; eating the second will make you hungry.
  * Some foods are plain addictive and it’s hard to control yourself. Foods like Doritos and Oreos give you Food Highs and it’s easy to blow past your calorie target.)



### If It’s So Simple, Why’s It So Hard?

It’s hard to lose weight today because millions of years of biological evolution are working against us.

For most of the world’s history, it was hard to get enough food to survive. Human tribes might go weeks between a big hunt. Sudden droughts might kill off plants that we ate.

So we evolved behaviors to get through periods of famine. After your tribe brings back a woolly mammoth, you eat all the calories you can to stockpile up fat to survive through harsher times. This means that whenever you see an excess of food, you tend to want to eat as much as you can.

The problem with today’s environment is that food is _always_ readily available. Unlike millions of years ago, most people will find it extremely hard to starve to death.

But **your survival signal is still pinging all the time, urging you to eat more**. Some of us have stronger such signals than others. So while your rational brain knows you should be of lean weight, your animal brain wants to stockpile all the calories it can, to last through a famine that will never come.

Unfortunately, to lose weight, you **will** need to go hungry. As we’ll discuss later, your body has a calorie setpoint that it expects; deviating under this will set off the hunger signal. Rest assured, this pain is temporary and won’t last forever — you won’t be hungry when you’re maintaining weight.

### It’s Hard to Exercise the Pounds Away

So you need to run a calorie deficit to lose weight. In the Calories In, Calories Out model, one part of the equation is how many calories you eat. Can you change how many calories you burn per day?

By far, **most of what your body is burning each day is used for daily maintenance**. It takes a lot of energy to stay warm at 98.6°F, to power your brain, and to keep your cells healthy.

It’s tempting to think about adding on exercise to burn the food away. You might know an athletic person who seems to be able to eat whatever they want and never worry about their weight. Maybe you could do that too!

But let’s examine the calories burnt. **An _hour_ of walking burns only 300 calories per hour.** Swimming, 400 calories per hour; tennis 500 calories per hour; jogging 700 calories per hour.

These numbers look pretty big, maybe enough to outweigh that extra slice of pie you want to eat. But do you remember the last time you sustained activity for a full hour without stopping? And can you really do this, _every single day of the week_ , without fail?

In contrast, compare that to calories from food: 6 Oreo cookies have 300 calories; a Snickers bar, 275 calories; medium fries at McDonald’s, 340 calories. **Is it easier to not eat a medium fries, or to jog for half an hour?** Most people would say the former.

Furthermore, many people cancel out their activity by eating more to compensate. Feel good about running a mile? Add a little more peanut butter to your sandwich.

By far, most **people who are successful at losing weight do it by controlling their eating**. In most people’s experience, it’s easier to lose 500 calories per day by eating less than to burn it through exercise.

This isn’t to say that exercise is unimportant. It’s good for your body and has benefits beyond weight loss, as we’ll discuss at the end of the book. But don’t think that exercise can do the whole job. You’ll likely end up disappointed and abandon the whole program.
