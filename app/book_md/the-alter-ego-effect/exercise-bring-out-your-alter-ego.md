## Exercise: Bring Out Your Alter Ego

Complete a truncated version of Herman’s process for choosing and bringing out your alter ego.

* * *

Think of a high-stakes moment in your life—a recurring situation in which you feel you consistently underperform. What is the “inner nemesis” that’s getting in the way of your success in these moments? (Remember, an inner nemesis is a cluster of negative thoughts and beliefs about yourself. For example, maybe you never speak up in weekly staff meetings because you believe you’re not experienced enough, or maybe you sabotage yourself on dates because you believe you’re too awkward.)

Next, jot down the traits, strengths, and skills you want to bring to bear in the high-stakes situation instead of the ones you’re currently using.

Once you’ve done this, pick an alter ego who possesses those abilities and note their name. Remember that your alter ego can be an existing figure, animal, or object, or someone or something you invented. (For instance, you might adopt the confidence and business acumen of Warren Buffett to speak up in work meetings. You might pick the alter ego of _Seinfeld’s_ Elaine Benes to be your charming, quirky self on dates.)

Finally, select and note an object and action to trigger your alter ego. Recall that the object should represent your alter ego and that the action should involve use of the object. (For instance, to activate your Warren Buffett alter ego, you might don a special pair of work shoes. To activate Elaine Benes, you might wear your hair in her iconic style.)
