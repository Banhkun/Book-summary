## Exercise: Reflect on Your Karma

Zukav says the spiritually powerful person has the following qualities:

  * Humble
  * Harmless
  * Non-competitive
  * Non-materialistic
  * Free to be themselves
  * Forgiving
  * Wise
  * Loving 



This means nurturing these qualities will spiritually empower you, and bring positive karma to your life.

* * *

Reflect on where you see these qualities, or the lack of them, in your life—in your actions, your choices, and your relationships. Where do you see the biggest lack, in yourself?

How can you make some practical changes to nurture these qualities where they’re lacking?

Following the advice above, _set intentions_ to nurture those qualities, and try a meditation practice to establish and increase them in yourself and your life. For example, if you find that you are holding grudges, meditate on the intention to cultivate forgiveness in your heart.
