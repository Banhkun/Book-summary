## Exercise: How Can You Invest in Yourself?

Warren Buffett has said that the best investment you can make is to invest in your personal development—mentally, physically, and financially. For example, Buffett recognized his awkwardness with others and studied public speaking as a way to grow out of it. Consider any areas in your life where you may have opportunities for growth.

Do you have personal interests or ambitions you’ve never followed? What avenues might be available that would let you explore them (for instance, local clubs or continuing education classes)?

Are there any common daily activities in which you still feel like a novice (for example, cooking, staying healthy, using a computer)? If so, what methods could you use to stretch yourself to improve your abilities?

In the world of investing, there’s always more to learn. What are your long-term financial goals? What do you feel you’ll need to learn to achieve them?
