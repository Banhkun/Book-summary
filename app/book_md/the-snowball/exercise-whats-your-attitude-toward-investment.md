## Exercise: What’s Your Attitude Toward Investment?

Warren Buffett has always warned against letting emotion cloud investment decisions, whether it be anxiety about a downturn in the market or unwarranted optimism in times when riches come easy. He also teaches to value money not for what it can buy in the present, but for what it might grow into in the future. Think about how these principles relate to the way you’ve thought about money in your own life.

Do you regularly put money away for the future? If you don’t, is there a way you could save even a small amount from every paycheck? If you’re already doing so, is there a way you could save more?

If you have investments, are they conservative or aggressive? Do you prefer to keep your money in retirement programs and mutual funds, or do you trade in individual stocks? If stocks, do you mainly look at a company’s recent financial performance before investing, or do you consider the values and business practices of the company itself?

Have you ever jumped on or off a financial bandwagon by investing in something because you heard it was a hot commodity or selling off an investment because its value had suddenly dropped? (Be honest.) In hindsight, what would have been the best decision? And how can you use what you’ve learned in the future?
