## Principles 6-7

**The sixth and seventh selling principles—use humor and creativity—are differentiating, that is, they set you apart from your competition**. Some people are naturally better than others at using them, but both humor and creativity are learnable, so you can use them successfully with study and practice.

### Principle #6: Humor: Make Them Smile

Making people laugh relaxes them and creates an atmosphere conducive to buying.**Laughing together is a form of agreement or approval, and agreement is a step toward selling.** Put another way, get people to laugh and you can get them to buy—all things being equal, customers will choose to buy from you over a humorless competitor. Besides helping you make the sale, humor also builds customer relationships by facilitating friendship and respect.

**To improve your humor, study humor, especially if you aren’t naturally funny.** Here are some ways to learn to be funnier:

  * Pay attention to what happens to you so you can reference funny events in jokes.
  * Visit comedy clubs or watch comedians on TV. Study delivery and audience reaction.
  * Read joke books.
  * Listen to children, who are naturally funny.
  * Practice jokes with family and friends.
  * Take an acting class.
  * Join Toastmasters, a public speaking club.
  * Practice making exaggerated faces and gestures.
  * Laugh and smile more.



Safe topics to joke about include things kids say and do, traffic, lines from television shows, and things you see. In general, pick something that’s:

  * Funny to you: Your joke will seem natural rather than forced.
  * Personal: Poke fun at a personal quality or feature, but never make fun of others.
  * Tested: Try your jokes on friends and family first to see if they work.
  * Clean: Never make crude, ethnic, or gender jokes.



In addition to jokes, tell funny stories about yourself. Stories are authentic because they’re about real experiences, in contrast to jokes that sometimes sound contrived. They’re also self-effacing, engaging, and memorable. If a story prompts your conversational partner to tell a story in return, it’s helped you build rapport. Stories incorporated into a sales presentation may also help a prospect relate to your product.

Humor should be the last element you incorporate into your selling process (the icing on the cake)—after you’ve developed sales skills, become an expert in your product, and know your customer and her business. With the other factors in place, it can seal the deal.

### Principle #7: Practice Creativity

Along with humor, **creativity will make you and your sales pitch stand out and be remembered.** Here are four ways to use it:

**1) At the start of a sales call, ask a smart, unexpected opening question** instead of blathering on about your company and product. For example, ask: “How much does a lost hour of productivity cost your company?” or “How would you know if you were overpaying for printing?”

**2) Identify every customer contact point, and change it so it’s distinctive** —including the voicemails you leave, your cover letter, your phone greeting or voicemail message, your business cards, and so on.

Fixing your voicemail message is the most important step because it can help you get new customers and act as word-of-mouth advertising (if you have a unique message, people will tell others about it). Virtually everyone’s message starts the same way, by intoning, “I’m either on the phone or away from my desk…” Some messages tell callers what day it is and what you’re doing (“I’ll be in meetings this morning…”), although the caller doesn’t care or need to know.

**If you claim to be different from your competitors, your voicemail message should reflect that.** Here are some ways to create a memorable message:

  * Make a short statement about the value of your product—for example, tell customers one way they can profit from it.
  * Use a thought-provoking quote (change it daily)
  * If you’re good at imitation, try speaking in a celebrity voice, using a familiar line.
  * Record a message from one of your kids (“Hi, I’m Josh. Dad is out earning my college tuition…”)
  * Make a joke that’s general, or one specific to your business (“Hi, I’m in my company’s genius training program at the moment…” or “You’ve reached Tom at Premier Pest Control. I want to know what’s bugging you, so leave a message...”)
  * Record a testimonial from a customer. (“I’m Dave. I’ve been pain-free for five years, thanks to Wilson Chiropractic—I hope you’ll let them help you too.”)
  * Make an off-the-wall joke: One of the author’s messages was: “Hi, this is Jeffrey. Please leave your Visa credit card number and expiration date and I’ll get back to you.” (A few people actually left credit card numbers.)



Keep your message short—35 words or less. Write it out, practice it until you can record it perfectly, then change it often (preferably weekly).

**3)** **Use creative follow-up contacts to keep in touch with a customer after a meeting** —for instance, email a weekly tip about your area of expertise, share useful information and testimonials, or send a newsletter.

**4) Respond creatively to buyer objections**. For example, when a prospect tells you she’s satisfied with her current supplier or product, you might respond: “Prospective clients often claim they’re satisfied with what they have—however, _our_ customers tell us they’re _thrilled_. Wouldn’t you rather be thrilled than just satisfied?”

### How to Cultivate Creativity

You can develop creativity by studying and practicing it. Here are some attributes and practices that facilitate creativity:

  * Maintain a positive attitude: This is important because negative thoughts and feelings block creativity. That’s why you think of the perfect response only _after_ an argument—negativity clouds your thinking.
  * Write down ideas: Creative ideas pop into your head quickly, then just as quickly vanish. So anytime you get an idea, write it down, and try to elaborate on it while it’s fresh.
  * Believe in your creative potential: Stop telling yourself you aren’t creative. You have to believe in yourself for ideas to flow, so **affirm your creativity by telling yourself you have a wealth of ideas waiting to be tapped.**
  * Create a workspace that’s conducive to creativity. For example, if you work best in stimulating surroundings, create that kind of space.
  * Find creative mentors who support and inspire your creativity.
  * Study creativity: **Read works by creative writers and books about how others have developed creativity** —for example, the Dr. Seuss books and Michael Michalko’s _Thinkertoys_ and _Cracking Creativity_. (Shortform note: For the story of how Ed Catmull fostered creativity as Pixar, read our summary of Creativity, Inc.)
  * Use creative models and tools such as SCAMPER, which walks you through a series of questions to prompt multiple perspectives on an idea or thought. (SCAMPER is an acronym for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Maximize or Minimize, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse.)
  * Be willing to risk failure: Failure is part of the creative process—it teaches you how to improve your ideas. Inventor Thomas Edison welcomed his failures as steps on the way to success.
