## Exercise: Prepare for Success, Part 2

The sixth and seventh selling principles—use humor and creativity—set you apart from your competition. Some people are funnier or more creative than others, but with study and practice you can use both successfully.

* * *

Think about a recent sales call. Did you use humor? If so, how did it affect the conversation? If not, how could you have used humor?

How could you regularly incorporate humor into your interactions? For example, what personal quality or experience could you poke fun at (for instance, missing out on the last parking space right before the big meeting)?

Write down your current voicemail message. How would you (or your callers) describe it (for example, standard, humorous, or creative)?

What’s a more memorable message you could create instead?
