## Exercise: Prepare for Success, Part 1

The fourth and fifth selling principles, branding and networking, are closely related—both involve making yourself known, which opens doors to future sales opportunities.

* * *

Branding is increasing people’s awareness of you and your strengths. How would you describe your brand? (For example, what are you an expert in?) How well-known are you?

What activities do you currently engage in to build your brand (for example, writing a blog, public speaking, or creating a distinctive business card)? What else can you do to build your brand?

Networking, which is related to branding, requires being in places where your customers and potential customers are likely to be. Describe your current networking efforts. How effective are they? (How have they benefited you?)

What are some additional ways you can meet customers and potential customers? (For instance, what three networking events can you create or attend in the next two weeks?)
