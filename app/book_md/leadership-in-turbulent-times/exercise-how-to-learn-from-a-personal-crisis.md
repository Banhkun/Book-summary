## Exercise: How to Learn From a Personal Crisis

Every president we’ve discussed in this guide went through some failure or tragedy—but responded in a way that ultimately improved his leadership. Answer the following questions to discover how you can respond to your _own_ setbacks in ways that improve your life.

* * *

Describe a recent setback you experienced (for example, losing your job).

Now, note what scares you most about this setback—in other words, what is your worst-case scenario? (For example, if you were recently fired, you might be worried that you’ll never find a job again.)

Write down three actions you could take to avoid this worst-case scenario. (For example, to avoid never having a job again, you might learn a new skill in your field.)

Pick one of the actions you listed above, and write down one step you’ll take today to implement that action. (For example, if you want to learn a particular skill, you might look for free online courses that teach that skill.)
