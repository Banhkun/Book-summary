## Exercise: Build Trust and Connect

Whitmore says you have to build trust with your coachee so they’ll engage in the coaching process, which will improve results. To do this, he suggests that you listen actively to show that you care, and be aware of your thoughts and feelings so they don’t negatively impact your work.

Whitmore recommends that to listen actively to your coachee, pay attention to their tone of voice, word choice, body language, and emotions. Think about a recent situation in which you were coaching someone or serving in a coaching-type role. Describe the listening techniques you employed and what you feel did and didn’t work.

Let’s say you’re going to meet with this coachee again. What two of Whitmore’s active listening strategies could you use to connect even more deeply?

Whitmore says it’s critical to monitor your thoughts and emotions before and during sessions so you don’t harbor judgments that can negatively impact your partnership. Reflect on a time when you judged a coachee or someone else you were talking to. What was the judgment you made of them, and how did it impact your conversation?

Now think about meeting with that same person again. What can you do to address judgmental thoughts and emotions so they don’t impact your conversation and relationship?
