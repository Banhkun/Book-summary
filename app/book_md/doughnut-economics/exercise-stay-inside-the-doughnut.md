## Exercise: Stay Inside the Doughnut

Raworth writes that the goal of economic policy should be to stay within the inner ring of the metaphorical doughnut—designing an economy that is productive enough to ensure that everyone on the planet has their basic material needs met, but that does not grow so fast as to deplete our natural resources and degrade the environment. In this exercise, explore the tradeoffs between these imperatives, and think about how we might devise the right policy mix that keeps us inside the dough of Raworth’s doughnut.

Do you think it’s possible to provide for the material needs of every human on the planet _without_ sustained economic growth, as Raworth suggests? Explain why or why not.

What might some of the consequences of Raworth’s “no-growth” economy be? Do you think the challenges of transitioning to such an economy would fall hardest on the wealthy or the poor?

Are private companies on their own capable of and willing to transition to Raworth’s “circular economy” model, or would they require state subsidies and regulations to do so? Explain your answer.

Raworth advocates the mandatory redistribution of economic resources like land and cash. Do you see any ethical concerns that this may raise? Are there any problematic historical examples of these kinds of redistribution schemes we may wish to consider before we attempt them again?
