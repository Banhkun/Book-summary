## Exercise: Reexamine Your Defining Moments

Defining moments are small, everyday events that are meaningful and memorable. Looking back at your own experiences is a good way to understand how small moments can stand out in your memory.

* * *

Think back on the past few months and pick out a small, everyday moment (like getting dinner with friends, taking a day trip with a spouse, or spending time with your kids) that was meaningful to you. Describe the event.

Now examine your answer to the above question. What were the positive peaks of the experience? How did the experience end?

How do you think the peak-end rule contributed to your overall memory of this event?
