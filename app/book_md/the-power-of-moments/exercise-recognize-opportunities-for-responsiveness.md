## Exercise: Recognize Opportunities for Responsiveness

Opportunities to deepen our relationships with others are all around us, but we often miss them. Practice recognizing these opportunities and others’ attempts to connect with you. Use the three elements of responsiveness—understanding, respect, and support—as your guide.

* * *

Think of a moment of connection that you may have missed recently: Someone offered you vulnerability, but you didn’t reciprocate responsiveness. How did you respond to them?

How could you have responded with more understanding (I see you and know what’s important to you)?

How could you have responded with respect (I respect your wants/needs)?

How could you have responded in a more supportive way (I support you and will help you get what you want/need?
