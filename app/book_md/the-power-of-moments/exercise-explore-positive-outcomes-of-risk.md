## Exercise: Explore Positive Outcomes of Risk

Exposing yourself to the risk of failure is frightening, but it’s a valuable learning opportunity.

* * *

Is there a situation you’re avoiding because of a fear of failure? Describe the situation and what you fear will happen.

Describe the self-insight—understanding of your values, motivations, and capabilities—you could gain from exposing yourself to this experience.

How would you frame this experience and its benefits if you were speaking to a mentee? Recall the four-part formula of great mentors (high expectations + assurance + direction + support).
