## Exercise: Change Up Your Script

Thinking about and understanding the scripts in your everyday life is key to breaking routine and having more meaningful experiences.

* * *

Think of a “script” you follow in your everyday life (for example, driving to work with your spouse, your morning routine with your students, or happy hour with your colleagues) that you would like to make into a more meaningful experience and opportunity for connection. Describe the script.

How can you break this routine in a meaningful way? What “strategic surprises” can you add to the script? Remember, a strategic surprise is more than just an unexpected addition. It should defy expectations of how an event will play out.
