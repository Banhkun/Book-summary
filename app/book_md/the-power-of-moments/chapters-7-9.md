## Chapters 7-9: Create Defining Moments With Pride

The third element you can use to create a defining moment is _pride_. **Moments defined by pride surface and celebrate your best self—the “you” who earns recognition for their efforts, crushes ambitious goals, and acts with courage in situations that call for it.**

The Heaths describe these moments as those that spark powerful feelings of accomplishment and motivation and serve to remind you of the value of your hard work. They caution against the misconception that hard work _itself_ creates these defining moments—rather, instances of achievement (which we’ll discuss in Strategy 1), recognition (which we’ll discuss in Strategy 2), and acting as your best self (which we’ll discuss in Strategy 3) create pride, which enhances hard work in a meaningful and memorable way.

In this chapter, we’ll explore three strategies for multiplying instances of achievement and recognition:

  1. Build small, personally motivating “wins” into the journey toward a big goal.
  2. Recognize others’ efforts and make their progress visible.
  3. Prepare yourself to act with courage when necessary. 



### Strategy 1: Create and Celebrate Small Wins

The Heaths debunk a common misconception that _everyone_ feels the same amount of pride in their work—that is, people working toward the same goal and putting in the same amount of effort to achieve it will experience the same amount of pride in their efforts. They explain that it’s not so simple, because everyone approaches goals differently: Some people might feel that accomplishing the goal is the only thing to be proud of, and others might think the journey to the goal is just as important as the goal itself. **The Heaths suggest enhancing the instances of pride you feel while working toward a goal by adding small, personally motivating wins into the journey.**

(Shortform note: Recall the fixed mindset and growth mindset discussion from Carol S. Dweck’s _Mindset_ : Those with a fixed mindset often only care about the achievement of the goal, and those with a growth mindset can more easily see the value of the journey. The Heaths’ suggested strategy of celebrating small wins is helpful because it caters to _both_ these mindsets. The frequent achievements cater to those with a fixed mindset, and the value placed on the _pursuit_ of a goal caters to those with a growth mindset.)

#### Build Small Wins Into the Path to Your Goal

Big goals often come with big flaws. First, there is usually no clear route between Here and There, making it all too easy to get lost or demotivated along the way. Second, big goals are often far too ambiguous to actually be achievable, such as, “I want to learn Spanish,” or, “I want to lose weight.”

Defeating a challenge makes for a big moment of pride and all the positive emotions that come with accomplishment.**** However, that big moment of success often never comes to pass without a plan for smaller occasions for pride that will keep you motivated. **In pursuit of a goal, you should build in small reasons to celebrate—or small wins—along the way to your destination.** Going about your goal this way serves several purposes:

  * Your goal is reframed as a tangible destination, and the small steps give you a sort of roadmap to get there. 
  * Your small wins are concrete and feel attainable—you are more likely to put in effort on an achievement that seems within reach. 
  * Each small win celebrated will provide you with a new burst of pride. In this way, you allow yourself multiple opportunities to feel good about your abilities, instead of feeling frustrated and defeated when you can’t achieve the huge leap between Here and There.



(Shortform note: Studies have also shown that continuously celebrating small achievements is a fairly easy way to boost your overall happiness—it’s much easier to continue pursuing a goal when it feels good, or even _fun_ , rather than like a chore.)

##### Example: Losing Weight With Small Wins

To learn what built-in milestones might look like for you, let’s take the “I want to lose weight” example. You can decide between two different approaches:

**Approach A**

  1. Exercise and eat healthy
  2. Exercise and eat healthy
  3. Exercise and eat healthy
  4. Buy a too-small pair of “motivation” jeans?
  5. Exercise and eat healthy



Result: Someday, maybe, you’ll lose the weight.

**Approach B**

  1. Start taking the stairs instead of the elevator 
  2. Go 30 straight days without soda (then, can you do 30 more?)
  3. Test healthy recipes, find five that even the kids will eat 
  4. Get a group at work together for a daily lunchtime walk, go out for a drink whenever you _all_ hit 10,000 steps for the day
  5. Log 50 Zumba classes



Result: You get to start wearing your favorite jeans again.

Of these two approaches, which one would be more fun? Which one gives you more occasions to celebrate? Which one gives you tangible achievements that naturally build toward your greater goal? Most importantly—which one would you be more likely to stick with?

> **How to Set Up Your Small Wins**
> 
> The Heaths stress that your small wins should be tailored to your journey and your particular motivations. There are three steps you can take to plan out a journey that makes sense to you and keeps you moving in the right direction.
> 
> **1) Think about what’s meaningful to you.** In _The Happiness Advantage_ , Shawn Achor suggests that when setting a goal, you think about incremental achievements that will consistently remind you of the meaning and importance of the journey. This will help shift your focus away from the stress of achieving planned results. A helpful question to help you come up with these achievements is, “What types of small wins will increase my confidence and knowledge?”
> 
> **2) Decide where to begin.** In their book _Switch, _the Heaths talk about the power of “shortening the distance” to your goal—in other words, you can list as one of your small wins something you’ve _already_ accomplished, so you have something to celebrate right away. The knowledge that you’ve already achieved a milestone makes the goal seem closer and more achievable.
> 
> **3) Make sure your wins are _small_. **In _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown explains that the most effective way to stay motivated on the way to a goal is to space your small wins close enough together that you feel that you are making progress nearly constantly—moving forward feels almost effortless. To design a system that feels almost effortless, make sure that each of your wins is only a _very small_ indicator of progress and investment of time above the previous small win.****

#### Create Meaningful Milestones for Your Organization

The Heaths suggest using the strategy of small wins for organizational goals as well. Often, organizations tend to get lost in their big-picture goals—achievements that matter to the organization, but perhaps not to the people who need to take the steps to make those achievements happen.

  * For instance, “Let’s increase our school’s 4th grade state test scores by 2% this year.” Or, “We want to increase revenue by $3 million this quarter.” __



While these may be worthy and important goals, they don’t really matter on a more personal level, which can easily make team members feel lost or disengaged. They’re just one person among many. What could they possibly do, personally, that would help make that goal happen?

The Heaths say that you should view a disconnect between the motivations of your team and the motivations of your organization as an opportunity to build in small wins that are motivating on your team’s level. To achieve this, you need to ask yourself three questions:

  1. **What inherently motivates my team?** In a setting with clients, this might look like: Receive a 5-star review from a satisfied customer. 
  2. **What deserves celebration and doesn’t take too long to accomplish (a few days, weeks, months)?** In an ad sales setting, you could set a goal such as: Secure one luxury goods brand and one luxury travel brand for the December issue.__
  3. **What are uncelebrated milestones we can bring attention to and celebrate?** In a customer service setting, this may look like: Go one week without any customers scoring below 5 on the satisfaction survey.



(Shortform note: Psychologists back up the power of breaking down large, ambiguous issues—studies show that reframing major social issues as a series of small, solvable problems strengthens individuals' motivations to take action. When an issue feels like an overwhelming beast, no one feels up to the task of tackling it. When it feels like a series of small puzzles, however, people feel more confident in their problem-solving abilities.)

##### Example: Making a Vague Goal Personal and Meaningful

Imagine a school presents a goal for the academic year: Increase our school’s 4th grade state test scores by 2% this year.__ Ms. Smith, a 4th grade teacher, breaks this big, ambiguous goal down into smaller goals her students can accomplish:

**Level 1:** Earn a spot in “Ms. Smith’s Homework Stars of the Week.”

**Level 2:** Read for an extra 30 minutes every night and write down two new vocabulary words each week, earn a lollipop at Friday lunch.

**Level 3:** Earn 100% on your morning multiplication drill and be the line leader for recess.

**Level 4:** Write a story using five new reading vocabulary words to earn three extra points on your next vocabulary test.

**Level 5:** Earn above 90% on two math quizzes to earn a No Homework Pass for one night.

**Destination:** Students who are working harder in math and reading, subsequently making the necessary improvements to perform well in state testing.

This approach works for her students—they can understand the smaller goals and easily achieve them with a bit of effort. Furthermore, the goals are fun enough to matter to 10-year-olds, and her students have many occasions to feel pride on their journey to math and reading improvement. In contrast, imagine how this might have played out differently if she’d simply said, “Okay, we need to improve in math and reading this year. Get to it!”

### Strategy 2: Recognize Efforts and Notice Progress

The Heaths note that there’s a common misconception that people who work hard are likely to feel proud of their work. It’s not so simple: Pride doesn’t come from hard work alone—it comes from the results of your hard work _being noticed_.

> **The Progress Principle**
> 
> Research shows that the strongest indicator of productivity is how a team member _feels_ —if she feels positively toward her organization and herself and is motivated by her work, her productive performance will naturally increase. Team leaders, therefore, should focus their efforts on their team members’ _feelings_.
> 
> **The research determined that the most effective way to lift a team member’s mood is to make sure that she has a consistent sense that she’s making progress in meaningful work—what the researchers dubbed _the progress principle._**

**The Heaths’ strategy of celebrating small wins uses the progress principle for creating _personal_ pride. For promoting _others’_ pride using the progress principle, they suggest two methods: recognizing their efforts and making their progress visible.**

#### 1) Give Frequent, Personal Recognition

Recognition is the easiest way to give others an opportunity to feel pride in their progress, and there is a huge return on a very small investment of your time and effort. **Pride that comes from recognition is _especially_ memorable—largely because it’s so rarely practiced. **Most employers report that they give out a good amount of praise to employees for their accomplishments and work...but most employees report feeling that they’re not getting nearly enough recognition.

The discrepancy is largely due to the occasions that employers use to hand out praise; usually, acknowledgment comes on the heels of a large success. These large accomplishments are hard to miss, and they are an easy target for praise. To the employers, piling on the recognition in these moments feels like enough. On the other hand, employees feel underappreciated. People thrive on _regular_ recognition of their continued efforts, not just for the big, easy-to-spot achievements.

(Shortform note: Recall the progress principle—boosted mood and productivity are seen in team members who have a _consistent_ sense of their progress. Consistent recognition meets this need as well as reminding the team member that their work has meaning.)

**Recognition is not handed out nearly as frequently as it should be.** If you are congratulated once every five years, when you do something really extraordinary, you don’t have a regular source of pride in your work.

The solution to dissatisfying, sporadic recognition is simple: Focus on the frequency of your praise, not the grandeur. Handing out regular praise and multiplying the occasions for pride is a one-way ticket to having people who take pride in their work and feel satisfied with the return on their efforts.

(Shortform note: Eliminating the discrepancy between the perceived expression of praise and the perceived reception of praise is important to ensure high team member retention. In _How Will You Measure Your Life, _Clay Christensen says employees ask themselves, “Do I have the opportunity to do meaningful work? Am I being recognized for my contributions?” Employees who say “no” to these types of questions will soon start thinking about moving on to another workplace where their boss expresses regular appreciation.)

##### What Makes Recognition Truly Memorable?

Not all frequent praise is created equal, however—a pat on the back or a congratulatory email will give the recipient a small glimmer of pride, but it will be a forgettable moment. **The Heaths explain that truly meaningful and effective recognition—the type that creates a moment defined by pride—is personal.** Personalized recognition is your opportunity to tell someone, “I see the effort you’re putting in, and more importantly, I see _you_.”

They give the example of Keith Risinger, who works in leadership development at pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. Risinger regularly hands out awards to his employees for their small victories and improvements, personalizing each award to the accomplishment. For example, for an employee who has gotten better at listening to clients’ needs, he awarded a pair of Bose headphones. For another employee who came up with a customized approach to a client’s problem, he gifted a single-serve Keurig machine. His awards are somewhat silly, but their creativity and thoughtfulness create powerful moments of pride for his employees.

(Shortform note: The Heaths attribute the memorableness of Risinger’s awards to their being personal. However, another reason these awards are so memorable and meaningful is their silliness. In many work environments, award systems lack novelty—predictable, professional “Employee of the Month'' emails easily blend into the general flatness of the workday. On the other hand, silly and unexpected awards like Risinger’s engage his employees’ brains with the appeal of variable reward and therefore stand out in their memories.)

#### 2) Make Progress Visible

The Heaths point out that progress is often incredibly difficult to measure or recall.

(Shortform note: In many work settings, employees _do_ have clear indicators of progress, such as KPIs. This section focuses on cases where there aren’t clear metrics of growth or improvement, such as learning a new skill like baking or skateboarding.)

To bring out someone’s pride in their “invisible” progress, the Heaths encourage you to dig up and recognize milestones that were achieved in the past but may not have been noticed or celebrated at the time. As you know from the section on “thinking in moments,” the celebration of largely-unseen milestones—not the big, obvious ones—is especially memorable and meaningful.****

(Shortform note: Celebrating unseen progress is especially important for those for whom “seen” progress doesn’t come easy. Studies show that schools are increasingly focusing on grades as a measure of progress, while ignoring academic progress that doesn’t visibly “move students up the ladder”—asking for help, expressing creativity, or collaborating with others, for example. As a result, students who show progress in these “invisible” areas instead of the “important” areas lose their motivation to improve. It’s important to remember that both seen and unseen progress are all part of the same path forward.)

**If you have the foresight to document progress as it happens, you can highlight the uncelebrated milestones and uncharted progress that deserves recognition, creating defining moments of pride for someone who may not realize just how far she’s come.**

##### Example: Show Progress With a “Year In Review” Video

Imagine your daughter has been practicing ballet for several years. She’s achieved evident milestones and experienced natural occasions of pride: her first recital, getting the part she wanted in her company’s production of _The Nutcracker_ , being invited to make an appearance in her company’s promo video. She knows she’s making progress, but she can’t recall specific improvements.

Each year, you give her a video that documents her practice over the course of the year, so that she’s regularly able to compare her current self side-by-side with her past self. She thinks, “At the beginning of the year, I couldn’t do pointe for more than 5 minutes without a break...now I don’t need a break at all!” __ In bringing up her past progress, you’ve given her a memorable way to recognize and feel pride in the results of her hard work.

### Strategy 3: Prepare Yourself Mentally for Courage

Lastly, the Heaths discuss the way that pride in your courageous actions can create defining moments. We feel a great deal of pride when we act with courage—when we stand up for someone else, call out injustice, or fight for something we believe in. These moments are meaningful because they show us what we’re made of.

The problem with these moments is that it’s very difficult to engineer situations that call on us to be courageous—they almost always happen spontaneously. **However, you can practice and prepare yourself mentally to act courageously when it’s necessary.**

> **What Is “Courage”?**
> 
> In _Dare to Lead, _Brené Brown—expert on shame and vulnerability—offers a four-part formula to courage:
> 
>   * Facing vulnerability: Meeting the risk of failure head-on and learning to master your response to fear or uncertainty.
> 
>   * Committing to strong values: Choose a set of values that acts as a guiding force in all aspects of your life— _especially_ when things get tough.
> 
>   * Building trust: Continuously practice small trustworthy behaviors, such as setting and respecting boundaries, taking responsibility for your actions, and relying on others.
> 
>   * Developing failure resilience: Work on your ability to overcome failure by studying your emotional response to it and consciously finding a way to work through it productively.
> 
> 

> 
> Based on these four parts, we can understand practicing courage as developing unwavering _integrity_ : A commitment to acting in alignment with what you understand, personally, to be the right thing to do—even in situations that make you feel vulnerable or exposed to the risk of failure.

#### Act Courageously With Preloaded Responses

**The Heaths note that while you might not have any control over when opportunities to act with courage appear, you do have control over how you _react_ to these opportunities. **

Usually, when you see something wrong or unjust, you don’t react right away, or at all—most people don’t naturally know how to immediately react to these situations. Without a specific planned response, we end up spending too much time deliberating what we _should_ or _could_ say or do, and miss the moment.

(Shortform note: In their book _Switch, _the Heaths put a name to this phenomenon of clamming up when faced with the task of making a choice—decision paralysis. When presented with numerous options or ambiguity, humans are predisposed to conserving their mental energy by defaulting to whatever decision feels easiest or most familiar, or not doing anything at all.)

To avoid decision paralysis, plan out exactly how you’d respond to an opportunity to act with courage—what the Heaths call “preloaded responses.” **Preloaded responses are reactions that you’ve drilled into your memory so that they’re immediately ready in a situation that calls for it.**

  * For example, “When I see Bill and his friends mocking my sister at school, I will walk over, ask them to stop, and walk her to class. ”



While thinking of your preloaded responses, it’s helpful to reframe your thoughts away from, “ _What_ is the right thing to do?” This question forces you to deliberate between all the different “right” responses you could have. Instead, ask,**“ _How_ can I get the right thing done?”** This question asserts that you _know_ what’s right and now must make it happen. It’s not a matter of what you _should****_ do, but what you _will_ do.

##### Example: Speaking Up About Inappropriate Remarks

Imagine that your colleague makes a racially insensitive remark to another colleague. Without any practice, you’d likely be so caught off-guard that you’d do nothing at all in response. However, what if you’d had a preloaded response at the ready? “I know that Mary makes insensitive jokes to her friends about Julie. That’s not right and it won’t stop unless I bring it to HR. The next time I hear her make a remark like that, I’ll say ‘Mary, that’s a really inappropriate and disrespectful thing to say, and as it goes against our company values, I’ll be reporting you to HR.’” Chances are if you’d had this preloaded response prepared, you would have been primed to speak up the first time you heard your colleague making these types of remarks.

#### Preloaded Responses for Personal Moments of Courage

Asserting that you know the right thing to do and planning out how to make it happen can apply to smaller, very personal moments of courage as well. **Doing the right thing and acting with integrity matters, even if you’re doing it just for yourself.**

Perhaps you’re trying to cut down on drinking. The journey toward sobriety is full of situations that will call on your ability to do the right thing, and you can cut out the hesitation and temptation of these situations by creating preloaded responses.

First, remember to reframe your thoughts. You already know what the right thing to do is: avoiding situations that will tempt you to drink. Then, determine _how****_ you can do that. You identify your triggering scenarios and practice your actions: “When the waiter asks me what I would like to drink, I will say seltzer.” “When I am walking home after work, I will take the long way around the block to avoid walking in front of the bar.”

In practicing these small moments of courage so that you may put them into action, you can bring out your best self and multiply your opportunities for meaningful moments of personal pride.

> **Try Creating Precommitments**
> 
> Preloaded responses are a type of _precommitment_ —a pact you make with yourself about the way you’ll act in a certain situation. At times, rehearsing your preloaded response may not be a strong enough pact to prompt you to follow through. You can try raising the stakes by putting more tangible precommitments in place.
> 
> In his book _Indistractable, _Nir Eyal outlines several ways you can use precommitments to push yourself into doing the right thing:
> 
>   * **Create social pressure:** This kind of pact, which Eyal calls an “effort pact,” is a precommitment that makes it harder to do something undesirable. One way you might use an effort pact is by making a precommitment with someone else—you’re not likely to break the precommitment because of the added pressure of being “watched” by someone else. For example, you might ask a friend to walk home from work with you every day so you don’t stop at the bar.
> 
>   * **Put your money on the line:** In this pact, you attach money to your precommitment—if you break it, you lose the money. You might attach a $100 bill to your fridge and make a pact: If you buy beer, you have to burn the money. Each time you think of buying beer, the potential loss holds you back.
> 
>   * **Identify with your future self:** Make a precommitment to the identity you _want_ to have by consciously talking about yourself as someone who has that identity. For example, instead of saying, “I’m someone who’s trying to quit drinking,” you might say, “I’m someone who _is_ quitting drinking.”
> 
> 


#### Practicing Courage Brings out the Best in Others

Why should you put in the hard work to practice courage and use it when necessary? **The Heaths say that in doing so, you just might inspire someone else to do the same.**

It’s human nature to be wary of going against the status quo; we want to blend in with what everyone else is doing, no matter if it's right or wrong. However, people are much more likely to have confidence in their own beliefs—even if they are unpopular—if they see someone else lending support to those same beliefs. Likewise, people are much more likely to do the right thing after they have observed someone else doing so; justice suddenly becomes much more important than blending in.

(Shortform note: Being able to “spread” feelings or actions in this way is a result of the _mirror neuron system_ , which directs the brain to mirror others’ actions. This system comes from early in our evolution when humans depended on being part of a group for survival. Mimicry—especially of positive, or _prosocial_ , behaviors—helped humans assimilate into groups by creating a sense of similarity and bonding. Due to your mirror neuron system, observing others’ actions prompts your brain to rehearse the action as if you were doing it yourself. In other words, by acting with courage, you subconsciously help another person to practice _their_ moment of courage.)

**Courage is contagious.** When you create a defining moment of pride for yourself with courage, you also create a defining moment for someone else who is shaped by the experience of seeing someone else stand up for what’s right and inspire them to do the same.
