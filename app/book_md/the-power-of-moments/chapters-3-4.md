## Chapters 3-4: Create Defining Moments With Elevation

Over the next four chapters, we’ll examine different ways to use the elements of elevation, insight, pride, and connection to turn everyday moments into unexpected, emotionally charged experiences that stand out against the flat background of life.

The first element we’ll discuss is _elevation_. Moments defined by elevation transcend everyday patterns and impart positive feelings like delight, motivation, and engagement.**In short, elevated moments are the positive peaks that you look back on fondly.**

(Shortform note: In his hierarchy, Maslow lists “peak experiences'' as a component of the highest need, self-actualization. Maslow described peak experiences as small, everyday events that give us a feeling of newness or delight—in other words, as with elevated moments, we transcend everyday dullness.)

Some of these positive peaks are naturally occurring in social moments like weddings and graduations, performance moments like playing in a big game or giving a talk in your field of expertise, and spontaneous moments like an unexpected upgrade on your flight. **However,_most_ experiences don’t have natural positive peaks—but you can _add_ positive peaks to them by choosing one or two moments to elevate thoughtfully. **

While elevating certain moments will take a bit of extra effort, they’re worth the trouble—their absence, an endless routine lacking “peakiness,” leads to boredom and disengagement**.**

  * Think of a dull relationship that stretches on for years. Everything’s fine, but nothing new ever happens. Eventually, you both mentally check out and decide to call it quits. Or, you spend years working in a job where every week feels exactly the same—it feels soul-sucking, and you start looking for work elsewhere. 



Using elevation to produce novel, memorable events is key to creating experiences that foster positive feelings and increase engagement. The Heaths’ identify three ways to use elevation: increase sensory pleasure, raise the stakes, and go off script with strategic surprise. Successful, memorable moments incorporate _at least_ two of these methods.

### Method 1: Increase Sensory Pleasure

The first way the Heaths suggest elevating a moment is with _increased sensory pleasure_ —that is, making a moment look, feel, taste, or sound better than what you’re used to.

  * For instance, getting dressed up to go out to a fancy restaurant looks, feels, and tastes different from eating in your sweatpants on the couch. 



**Sensory differences make memories stick**. This is because a sensory upgrade is a type of _novelty_ —it forces the brain to re-engage, process more information, and make the experience richer and more memorable.

The authors note that upping the sensory appeal of a moment doesn’t need to be expensive or extravagant—it can be as simple as a team leader conducting her employees’ year-end meetings in a park instead of in her office, or a rabbi delivering the Torah to a synagogue member’s home during the COVID-19 pandemic so that his bar mitzvah would _physically feel_ special, even if it needed to be done by video.

> **Which Senses Should You Elevate?**
> 
> The Heaths don’t discuss _which_ sensory appeals work best, but numerous studies have concluded that memory links most strongly to your sense of smell. You can use this information to engineer small, special moments in a variety of contexts. For example:
> 
>   * You wear a certain “date night” perfume or cologne to make outings with your partner feel more special—and, each time you smell it, you’ll recall memories of past outings.
> 
>   * You bake a certain type of cookie every Friday afternoon with your kids to celebrate the coming weekend. The moment stands out against the rest of the week, and your kids will recall it every time they smell that type of cookie in the future.
> 
>   * Many organizations invest a lot of money in scent branding to evoke certain emotions in their clients, make clients feel that their products are high-quality, and ensure that their clients recall their brand whenever they encounter a certain scent.
> 
> 


### Method 2: Heighten the Stakes

The second way to elevate a moment is to _raise the stakes_. The Heaths explain that adding high stakes to a situation makes an otherwise flat, unengaging experience into a standout, exciting experience—for instance when you look back at your high school career, you’ll more likely remember your debate team championship than your algebra classes.

(Shortform note: One reason that high-stakes experiences stand out in your memory may be that the prospect of a high reward forces your brain to use long-term memory to “help out” your short-term working memory. As a result, your attention is more fully focused on the event—your brain re-engages in order to process all the information you’re taking in.)

> **Raising the Stakes Effectively**
> 
> Raising the stakes can seem like the same thing as increasing _stress_ , but this line of thinking is a mistake. Stress not only has a strong negative impact on memory recall, but it’s also usually not particularly meaningful. High-stakes situations that aren’t enjoyable or rewarding in any way cause stress.
> 
>   * For example, assigning your students an oral presentation that counts for 50% of their grade raises the stakes of an assignment by adding stress. The students won’t look back on the experience as a positive one—among the other stresses of their academic careers, it likely won’t stand out at all. 
> 

> 
> **To raise the stakes effectively, focus on increasing _productive pressure_ : Pressure that’s interesting or fun in some way.__** Most experiences during students’ academic careers are focused on grades—productive pressure shifts the focus in a novel direction, toward _fun_. Rather than blending into the everyday stress of school, a fun experience stands out in students’ memories for years to come.
> 
>   * Let’s reimagine the oral presentation: You have each of your students choose a personal hero to interview. Instead of having each student give their presentation in the classroom like regular presentations, you organize a “Hero Day” in the auditorium. Each student’s interview subject is invited to come to the special event where they’ll listen to the speeches and mingle at an afterparty. Hero Day adds _productive pressure_ to the presentation—with the added pressure of having their heroes listening in on their work, the students feel excitement in putting together a presentation that best represents someone they look up to.
> 


### Method 3: Go Off Script

The last method of elevating a moment is _going off script_ , which the Heaths define as acting in a way that goes against what people expect. **Of the three methods of elevation, going off script takes the most effort but is usually the most worthwhile:** Recall our discussion of the “reminiscence bump”—the most memorable times of your life are due to going off script, encountering something unexpected and new as a result.

The idea that going off script takes extra effort may be confusing at first glance. It doesn’t seem so hard to come up with the occasional novel experience or fun surprise every now and then. The problem with this thinking is the assumption that you can meaningfully elevate an experience with cheap, easy surprises.

  * For example, you bring cupcakes to your weekly HR team meeting on improving employee experience. It’s a nice gesture, but the surprise won’t be memorable or meaningful as long as the rest of the meeting unfolds the same exact way it always does.



**Going off script in a way that’s meaningful and memorable requires _strategic surprises_.**

(Shortform note: Cheap, easy surprises are almost-predictable events—having a snack at a meeting is overall, an unremarkable event. In contrast, strategic surprises are surprises that break behavioral patterns in a way that challenges assumptions about what comes next and draws the audience in.)

#### How to Create Strategic Surprise

The Heaths say that there are two steps to creating strategic surprise:

  1. Identify scripts, or patterns, in your life, such as how your team meetings are run or how you spend time with your spouse after work. 
  2. Determine how you can go off these scripts in a meaningful way. 



For example, you examine your weekly HR meeting’s script and decide to add a _strategic_ surprise: Assigning each of your team members a “new hire” role and sending them out to interview their “new teams” with questions about advice for new team members and maintaining work/life balance. At the end of the hour, your team members meet up and discuss your new insights. By going off your regular meeting script, you’ve elevated the experience and created a defining moment for your team members.

Meaningfully going off script doesn’t mean completely upending the scripts of your life. **Remember, memorable experiences are not _wholly_ amazing—they’re largely mundane, with one or two exceptional peaks. **Your goal, then, is to deliberately punctuate overall familiar and comfortable scripts with one or two delightful surprises. There are usually two types of scripts that you’ll deal with.

##### Script 1: One-Off Experiences

The Heaths say it’s relatively easy to elevate experiences in places that people visit only occasionally—a hotel, for example.

Imagine a hotel near an airport that caters to people coming in and out of the city for meetings. It’s not very interesting: The décor is bland, there aren’t any nearby attractions, and there isn’t even a pool. However, this one hotel consistently gets rave reviews from guests, because they leverage the power of delight.

When you check in, the receptionist asks you what your favorite drink is. You go to your room and soon get a visit from a smartly-dressed staff member, there to deliver your chosen drink—on the house. On top of the charming unexpectedness of the free drink, the moment certainly appeals to the senses: The staff member’s clothing makes the moment feel a bit fancy, and nothing compares to the first sip of a cool drink after a long day of meetings. This small moment becomes the positive peak that stands out against your mundane business trip and the underwhelming hotel—the moment that you remember as you write your review and tell others about your trip.

**In one-off scripts, your goal is to go against what someone _expects_. **The hotel’s free drink delivery stands out as a defining moment because it disrupts the client’s expectation—that the hotel staff will simply check them into their room with no special treatment.

(Shortform note: You can think of the one-off script like a fun fact that you use to make a good first impression when meeting someone new. It retains its delightful quality because they don’t hear you say it every day—you only use it _once_ for the one-off experience of meeting.)

##### Script 2: Repetitive, Everyday Experiences

In contrast, creating moments of delight is a little more difficult in places that people visit regularly, like a café. **Even delightful surprises lose their charm if you experience them every day.** In cases like this, it’s critical to remember the “strategic” part of the surprise: You want to go off script, but be careful not to create a new script in the meantime.

  * For example, imagine you owned a café that started a new Free Cookie Friday—for your regular clients, this would be a fun surprise for a week or two, and then it would become just another part of their coffee break script. 



(Shortform note: In these cases, your strategy should rely on _variable reward_ : that is, rewards that happen at random times, rather than in a predictable pattern—so they always feel like a surprise. In their book _Hooked_ , Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover explain that variable, surprising rewards trigger a much stronger dopamine response in your brain than rewards that happen on a fixed schedule. This is why activities such as gambling or checking your email are so addictive—you can’t predict which pull of the lever or refresh of the inbox will reward you with a jackpot or an interesting email, so the action never loses its appeal.)

**To maintain delight and surprise in “everyday scripts,” engineer moments that _feel random_ , so they never become a flat, predictable pattern. **

  * For instance, instead of Free Cookie Friday for customers, you might tell your employees that each week, they can give away two items to customers for free. This effectively randomizes the reward of free food, so it never becomes a predictable part of your customers’ scripts and therefore doesn’t lose its delightfulness. They keep coming back because there’s a chance they’ll get free food, they just don’t know when it will happen. 



> **Retain Subscriber Loyalty With Variable Reward**
> 
> Subscription services, which are increasingly popular, can use variable rewards to differentiate themselves and retain client loyalty.
> 
> The “subscription economy” gives consumers a new type of power: Without contracts and commitments tying them down, consumers can easily take their money elsewhere if they decide they don’t like a service or aren’t getting enough value out of it. This means that subscription service providers must continuously create value and keep things interesting in order to keep their clients.
> 
>   * For example, streaming services like Hulu and Netflix retain subscribers by rapidly putting out new, exciting shows on a near-monthly basis.
> 

> 
> Tapping into the appeal of variable reward and engineering small—but memorable—positive peaks into the otherwise flat experience of a business-client relationship is a relatively simple way for a subscription service to stand out against the rest.

#### Why You Avoid Novel Experiences—And Why You Should Lean Into Them

As much as going off script can benefit you, it’s human nature to gravitate toward the comfort of familiar scripts. It’s harder to start taking the family rock climbing every Saturday than it is to sleep in and watch cartoons.

> We avoid novelty because of _the familiarity bias_ —familiar situations feel less threatening than new ones. Numerous psychologists have looked into this phenomenon:
> 
>   * In 1991, a study by Chip Heath and Amos Tversky found that when given a choice between two gambles, people are more likely to choose the one that’s more familiar to them—even if their odds of winning are lower.
> 
>   * In his book _Thinking, Fast and Slow, _psychologist Dan Kahneman discusses the _mere exposure effect_ : The more contact we have with something, the more we like it.
> 
> 

> 
> Despite our preference for familiarity, novelty is often the _better choice_ because it multiplies your memorable experiences, helps you develop new perspectives, and expands your problem-solving skills. Furthermore, it helps you learn _risk tolerance_ —which is vital to meaningful moments defined by insight, as we’ll see in the following chapter.
> 
> If you find yourself resisting novel experiences, think of it this way: Of all ways you could learn about confronting risk, moments of delight are the most enjoyable ways to do so.

#### Going Off Script Is Critical to Making Organizational Changes Stick

The small-scale benefits of going off script are evident, such as creating rich childhood memories for your kids or creating a positive experience for your clients to recall. **However, going off script can have a much further-reaching impact: It’s often a critical aspect to making transitions—such as major organizational changes—stick.**

If you are shifting your organization into a new way of doing things, going off script and building a positive peak into the transition can create a clear moment that separates the old from the new. Without this clear shift, you risk having employees stuck in a confusing mix of what they’re used to doing and what you want them to do.

For example, the book cites how VF Corporation (owner of apparel brands like JanSport, Vans, and The North Face) went off script to foster interbrand communication. Instead of a tired 100-slide PowerPoint about the value of communicating between brands, they created a highly interactive, out-of-the-box conference that mixed up different teams and sent them across LA to participate in a range of creative learning experiences such as surfing lessons and beauty science workshops. After the event, brands were more collaborative and came up with more innovative ideas together.

VF Corporation shaped this transition by going off script—simply _telling_ their employees to collaborate more would have followed (and blended into) their old script. They _demonstrated_ the shift to a new script by giving their employees a new, creative experience.

> **Logically Connect the Surprise to the Message**
> 
> In their book _Made to Stick_ , the Heaths explore how going off script and giving people unexpected experiences helps messages “stick” in people’s minds. They specify that “sticky” messages, or those that we remember and implement, rely on strategic surprise to send a message that not only _gets_ attention but also maintains it.
> 
> The key to sending a “sticky” message is ensuring that the person who receives your message can quickly make the logical connection between the surprise and the idea you’re trying to convey.
> 
> If VF Corporation had simply handed out surprise cupcakes while asking brands to collaborate more, their suggested transition would have fallen flat—there’s no logical connection between having a cupcake and changing the way you work. On the other hand, staging an event that has mixed teams go through creative experiences together logically connects to their request for team members to collaborate more.

### Why Elevation Is Especially Hard to Pull Off

The Heaths note that many people balk at the idea of creating moments defined by elevation because they require thoughtful effort—no one _wants_ to take on the extra work they require. People often talk themselves out of making the effort for two reasons:

#### 1) The Moment Isn’t Urgent

Because elevation is fun and doesn’t feel especially urgent, it’s easy to let tasks that feel more urgent or important—such as meetings or grading a pile of unmarked essays—take precedence over the work of creating a defining moment.

> In _First Things First, _author Stephen R. Covey advocates prioritizing non-urgent tasks if they’re _important_. He notes that you can categorize the things you spend time on into four quadrants:
> 
>   * Quadrant 1 is important and urgent—for example, health emergencies or work deadlines.
> 
>   * Quadrant 2 is important but not urgent—for example, relationship building and personal development.
> 
>   * Quadrant 3 is urgent but not important—such as checking your work email on the weekend or taking a friend’s phone call.
> 
>   * Quadrant 4 is not urgent and not important—such as scrolling through social media or watching television.
> 
> 

> 
> Moments of delight fall into Quadrant 2: When given the time and attention they deserve, they make up some of your most meaningful memories and re-engage you with your life. They’re important, but don’t have an overt sense of urgency to them. _Most_ of your time should be spent in Quadrant 2.
> 
> However, like most people, you may be addicted to urgency and convinced that you don’t have any time to free up for non-urgent matters. To solve this, Covey suggests an _honest_ assessment of how you spend your time: **Are you doing things that feel truly important to you? Or are you mostly reactive to situations of urgency?** Making a conscious effort to spend your time on important, non-urgent work naturally frees up the time you need for creating positive peaks in your life and the lives of others.

#### 2) The Moment Seems Too Complicated

Practicality has the power to bring a great idea’s “peak potential” down to a very unremarkable bump. Elevated moments are often more logistically complicated than business as usual, so it’s all too easy to wave them off as unreasonable and offer up an easier (but less delightful) experience in their place.

The Heaths suggest ignoring practicality in favor of putting effort into delightful ideas. **Otherwise, the experience you imagine _will_ be replaced by the least logistically complicated option. **

  * Imagine if the owner of the airport hotel decided that he didn’t want to shell out the money to surprise guests with their favorite drinks. It would have been easy to scrap that idea and simply offer free sodas in the room’s mini-fridge. As practical as the second option is, it wouldn’t have created a positive peak in guests’ minds and certainly wouldn’t prompt them to write rave reviews.



We can all think of places in our lives where we have let practicality win. You and your friend have been thinking about a road trip for ages, but it just seems like too much work. You have to plan the route, rent a car, take time off work, plan your budget...you decide it would be more practical to meet for coffee every weekend like you always do. By reaching for the least logistically complicated option, you miss out on the trip of a lifetime, rich with defining moments.

> **Cultivate an Anti-Practicality Environment**
> 
> David Schwartz, author of _The Magic of Thinking Big, _emphasizes that when you have big ideas, it’s important to surround yourself with the right kind of people. He outlines several tips for making sure your environment isn’t getting in the way of your elevation:
> 
>   * Make an effort to stay away from people who try to hold you back or continuously tell you, “It can’t be done.”
> 
>   * Stay away from gossip—it naturally shrinks your thinking and distracts you from your goal of creating defining moments.
> 
>   * Seek advice from people who understand and share your desire to create defining moments, not from those who are prepared to tell you all the ways something _won’t_ work.
> 
>   * Focus on giving _yourself_ rich experiences, such as trying a new activity over the weekend or taking your spouse out to a new restaurant—you have more power to give others elevated experiences when your cup is full.
