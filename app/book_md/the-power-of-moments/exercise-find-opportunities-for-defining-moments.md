## Exercise: Find Opportunities for Defining Moments

Practice recognizing the importance of adding shape to small transitions and celebrating unseen milestones.

* * *

Think of your organization, your career, your classroom, or your relationship. What is a transition or milestone that could be better recognized? (For example, your child reading their 25th book or your transition back to playing a sport after recovering from an injury.)

What can you do to mark the transition or celebrate the milestone? (For example, creating a dinner based on your child’s favorite book, or getting friends together for a 5k in costume to mark your first post-injury run.)

Are you encountering a negative pit—a moment of pain or anxiety—in your organization, career, classroom, or relationship? Describe the pit and how it might have been created.

What is your plan of action to turn the negative situation into a positive peak? How can you make a perceptible effort to improve the situation?
