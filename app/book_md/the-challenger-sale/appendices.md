## Appendices: Challenger Sale Bonus Materials

### Appendix A: Challenger Coaching Guide Excerpt

The following is a summary of the authors’ coaching guide for Challenger selling. The full guide is available as a free download here.

**1) Teach**

**Pre-call planning questions** : These questions focus on determining whether the rep has a viable teaching pitch and filling any gaps.

  * Examples: What customer problem are you focusing on? How do you know it’s critical to them? What’s your unique insight and why hasn’t the customer already thought of it?



**Post-call debriefing questions** : These questions focus on determining the effectiveness of the teaching pitch.

  * Examples: How interested was the client in the insight you shared? How could you tell?



**Coaching exercise** : Ask the rep to select an account and answer questions about it, such as: what are the company’s strategic objectives; where does it beat their competition and where does it lag; how does the stakeholder contribute to achieving company objectives? Work with the rep to identify opportunities to link capabilities/solutions to customer needs.

**2) Tailor**

**Pre-call planning questions** : These questions focus on ensuring the message will resonate.

  * Examples: What industry trends are affecting the customer company and how? What’s the company’s position in the marketplace? What are its strengths and weaknesses in the market?



**Post-call debriefing questions** : These questions focus on how effective the tailoring was.

  * Examples: What information or issues did the customer bring up that you hadn’t expected and how did you respond?



**3) Take Control**

**Pre-call planning questions** : These questions ensure that the rep has a clear plan for continuing to move the sales process forward.

  * Examples: What are your next steps? What's the customer’s buying process?



**Post-call debriefing questions** : These questions assess the extent to which the rep controlled the conversation.

  * Examples: How did this conversation move the sale forward? Where did tension occur and how did you react?



### Appendix B: Selling Style Self-Assessment

Questions such as the following can help you identify your selling style. Indicate how strongly you agree or disagree on a scale of 1-5 (1=strongly disagree; 5=strongly agree). The higher your total score, the closer you are to a Challenger Selling Model.

  * I often create positive, long-term relationships with customers.
  * I offer customers unique insights linked to my company’s products/services.
  * I’m an expert on the products and services I sell; my knowledge exceeds that of even the most expert purchaser.
  * I often risk disapproval to express what’s right for the customer.
  * I tailor my message based on a stakeholder’s value drivers.
  * I can identify key drivers of my customer’s business and adapt my message accordingly.
  * When a customer has a request, I fulfill it myself.
  * In a difficult conversation, I’m comfortable pushing the customer to make a decision.
  * I can discuss pricing effectively on the customer’s terms.
  * I spend more time preparing for sales calls than any of my colleagues do.



### Appendix C: Challenger Hiring Guide: Key Questions

The following are key Challenger competencies along with several examples of questions to determine how well a sales rep candidate measures up.

**Offers unique perspective**

  * Key questions: How do you typically open a sales conversation? Describe a time when you got a customer to think differently about a need or problem.



**Drives two-way communications**

  * Key questions: How do you get customers to talk about their priorities? Describe a time when you brought up an unstated customer need.



**Knows customer value drivers**

  * Key questions: What’s your process for gaining buy-in from stakeholders? How do you decide what is and isn’t important to a decision-maker?



**Can identify economic drivers**

  * Key questions: What resources do you use to learn about the customer’s business environment? Give an example of a new customer opportunity you identified.



**Comfortable discussing money**

  * Key questions: Describe a time when you successfully pushed through a price increase. How do you respond to a demand for a discount?
