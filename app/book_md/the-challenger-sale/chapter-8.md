## Chapter 8: The Manager and Challenger Sales Model

Frontline sales managers are the link between strategy and execution—they determine whether change initiatives and sales transformations succeed. But research shows that **most top company leaders lack confidence in their sales managers** and they’re uncertain of what to do about it (63% say their managers don’t have the skills and competencies they need to implement their sales models).

However, once you understand the attributes of a successful Challenger manager, you can hire or create skilled sales managers capable of executing a Challenger Selling Model. This chapter focuses on the most important sales manager skills—coaching and sales innovation—and how to develop them.

### Qualities of a Skilled Sales Manager

To determine the skills, behaviors, and attitudes that matter most for sales management excellence, researchers surveyed 65 companies and collected data from reps on 2,500 frontline sales managers.

They found that management fundamentals (reliability, integrity, and listening skills) account for only 26% of sales manager success. These fundamentals seem to be inherent rather than learned, so they should be baseline requirements for hiring or promoting someone to be a manager.

More importantly, companies should look to hire candidates who demonstrate the qualities known to drive success in sales outcomes: selling ability, coaching skills, and sales innovation. These attributes account for 73% of sales manager success.

#### 1) Selling Skills (25% of Manager Success)

For sales managers, selling skills still matter. Managers are often required to cover vacant sales territories and help close complex sales deals. More importantly, they must be able to model effective selling techniques and behaviors.

The survey found that the same skills that matter most for rep success also matter for manager success: offering customers a unique perspective, tailoring offers to customer needs and priorities, and being comfortable discussing money.

#### 2) Coaching (28% of Manager Effectiveness)

Coaching is a key aspect of manager effectiveness and a key driver of rep performance. Coaching entails working side by side with reps to share knowledge, insight, and to correct rep behaviors that get in the way of successful sales performance.

The key manager attributes for effective coaching mirrored the requirements for Challenger sales reps: guiding reps to tailor their message effectively, showing reps how and when to take control, and helping reps through complex negotiations.

#### 3) Owning (45% of Manager Effectiveness)

In addition to hands-on sales and coaching skills, manager excellence entails providing leadership, direction, guidance, and demonstrating ownership of the business (running their territory as if it were their own business).

Owning breaks down into two skill subcategories: resource allocation and sales innovation. Resource allocation is the least important part of the job (accounting for 16% of manager effectiveness). It involves such things as ensuring sales process compliance, taking corrective action, and managing resources efficiently.

**Sales innovation is the ability most important to outstanding sales manager performance** (29% of manager effectiveness). Put another way, it's the most important aspect of sales leadership. Innovation means finding new ways of solving problems standing in the way of deals and innovating new ways to position an offer. It’s about overcoming unforeseen obstacles.

Sales innovation is the key to fully realizing the potential of the Challenger Sale Model.

An innovative manager can help keep deals from getting stuck and make stuck deals happen.

**This competency is critical to selling complex solutions to increasingly reluctant customers.**

Because coaching and sales innovation are so important to sales manager success—and rep performance—they’re the focus of the rest of this chapter.

### Coaching Defined

Sales coaching is an ongoing series of interactions between a frontline sales manager and a rep, designed to diagnose, correct, and reinforce selling skills and behaviors.

**Coaching differs from training, which is for sharing knowledge. Coaching is for acting on knowledge**. Coaching is ongoing—it's not a one-time event or training series. It involves specific diagnosis and it’s customized and behavioral.

Coaching’s value lies in being tailored to the individual and applied as needed. It’s formal rather than informal, meaning it’s highly structured and regular. It also differs from managing: managers tell and do; coaches ask and guide.

### Effective Coaching Is Good Business

**Research shows that effective coaching can significantly boost the performance of average reps.**

Specific research findings include:

  * Improved coaching of weak performers results in only nominal performance improvement. If someone is a bad fit for the job, better coaching won’t fix the problem.
  * Improved coaching of star sales reps also is likely to have little performance impact. However, quality coaching improves their retention.
  * Improved coaching can **substantially boost the performance of _average_ reps**. With quality coaching, median performers could improve as much as 19%. Improving coaching effectiveness from weak to strong would result in a performance gain of 6 to 8% for core reps.



This means effective coaching has the potential to greatly improve performance in a complex sales environment. Coaching can mean the difference between hitting or missing sales goals for the majority of your reps. **The key is to focus the bulk of coaching efforts on the core performers rather than the lowest or highest performers.**

Besides boosting sales performance, coaching is a big factor in employee retention and discretionary or extra effort. **Good coaches make people want to stay; bad coaches (and bad managers) are demoralizing and drive people away**. This applies regardless of the employee’s performance level.

### Guidelines for Coaches

To coach effectively, managers need a standard to coach to.

One company created a coaching guide or cheat sheet for managers that it integrated into the sales process. It provided questions for managers/coaches to ask reps at each stage of the sales process to help them achieve the objectives of that stage.

Typically, managers focus on outcomes rather than behaviors in coaching conversations.

For instance, a manager might say to a rep, “Your conversion rate is down. What’s the problem?” This is “spreadsheet coaching”—it focuses on business outcomes, not behavior. In addition, it’s a one-size-fits-all critique.

In contrast, **good coaching focuses on behaviors (what the rep is doing), not outcomes**. For instance, in the pre-call planning stage, a coach might ask the rep: “What business problem are you planning to focus on with this customer? How new will this insight be to him? Why hasn’t he already figured it out?”

Appendix A provides an excerpt of the authors’ coaching guide for Challenger selling. The full version is available as a free download here.

#### The PAUSE Coaching Model

Here’s a model for coaching developed for CEB’s Manager Development Program. The components fit the acronym PAUSE:

**P—Prepare** for the coaching conversation: Review the customer account. Determine what stage of the sales process the rep is in and what behaviors are going to be important.

**A—Affirm** the relationship: If the rep isn't receptive to feedback, the coaching will be wasted. Separate performance management from coaching to create a safe environment for the rep to listen.

**U—Understand** what behaviors are important: Managers need to understand what they're seeing and know what behaviors to look for in observing their reps.

**S—Specify** behavior change: When you know what behaviors are needed and have an objective standard for judging them, you can provide objective feedback.

**E—Embed** new behaviors: Create an action plan for the rep to apply the feedback.

Using this framework in coaching helps keep it objective and provides continuity from one coaching conversation to the next.

### Sales Innovation

Sales innovation is the manager attribute that matters most. Here’s a look at what managers need to do in order to innovate. **There are three key sales innovation activities: investigate, create, and share**.

**1) Investigate** : Determine what’s getting in the way of advancing a sale—who’s involved, what kind of financial concerns do they have, what factors are they weighing. The manager works with the rep to understand the customer’s decision-making process and identify where a deal is bogged down and how to get it moving.

Key steps:

  * Identify obstacles that get in the way of a new sale
  * Gather feedback in terms of what’s working and what isn’t
  * Identify how to resolve customer pain



Action steps: the rep gathers information; the manager enforces

**2) Create** : Innovative managers also create solutions (innovate at the deal level)—for instance, shifting risk from the customer to supplier in exchange for a longer-term contract. Most managers just monitor reps’ progress on deals, however, innovation involves co-creation, or collaborating to find better ways to advance a deal. Managers should focus their innovation efforts on deals where the payoff is greatest.

Key steps:

  * Innovate around new ways to position the offer
  * Identify the ideal business outcome
  * Outline and explore new sales offers and solutions



Action steps: The manager develops solutions; the rep provides input

**3) Share** : Finally, innovative managers share best practices and pass on new ideas and solutions to the rest of the team.

Key steps:

  * Share tactics and best practices with the team
  * Develop and sustain cross functional relationships
  * Filter news and information downward



Action steps: The manager shares insights; the organization facilitates

### Efficiency versus Effectiveness

In the sales manager’s world, the roles of resource allocation and sales innovation can conflict.

Resource allocation is efficiently managing limited resources through better territory management, deal qualification, and sales process compliance. **While resource allocation focuses on _efficiency_ , sales innovation focuses on _effectiveness_.**

**A manager focus on effectiveness has almost twice the impact of an efficiency approach.**

Efficiency involves improving at what you’re already doing as a matter of routine. This works in an environment of traditional, straightforward product selling, where most deals are the same and customers behave predictably. Effectiveness involves innovating and collaborating to address the unexpected in a sales environment where there are many unknowns. Effectiveness takes precedence over efficiency.

However, in a recent survey of frontline managers, most managers said their current environment is dominated by an emphasis on efficient execution. Almost none agreed that “leadership empowers managers to set their own course.” But they cited empowerment or freedom to make decisions as the most important factors for them to be successful.

It takes time to change, but there are immediate things companies can do to equip sales managers to be more innovative at the deal level.

### Helping Managers Innovate

The way managers think every day is one of the biggest obstacles to innovation. They apply “narrowing thinking,” which involves looking at a complex problem, considering existing options, and producing a solution.

It works for tough, fast decisions about managing resources. But narrowing thinking restricts managers’ ability to develop creative sale solutions because it works by eliminating existing options rather than generating new ones for consideration.

The alternative is**“opening” or expansive thinking—generating and considering as many different options or alternatives as possible**.

To build innovative managers, companies need to equip them with tools and frameworks to think expansively. The first thing to do is raise their awareness of what's hindering expansive thinking. Research has identified a**number of human biases that often get in the way**. The most common are:

  * Practicality bias: the tendency to reject ideas that seem impractical
  * Confirmation bias: the tendency to ignore inexplicable customer behaviors and focus on ones they understand well
  * Exportability bias: the belief that it won’t work elsewhere because it didn’t work here
  * Legacy bias: the belief that the way we've always done it is best
  * First conclusion bias: the belief that the first explanation is the best 
  * Personal bias: the belief that if I wouldn't buy it, the customer won't either



These biases help us sort large amounts of information and make decisions quickly. However, they keep our perspective narrow. For instance, they might keep a sales manager from uncovering an innovative solution to a stuck deal because he looks at it with these biases instead of putting himself in the customer’s shoes.

To help managers overcome these biases:

  * Raise awareness of them.
  * Train managers to raise specific questions to prompt thinking from other perspectives.



### Ask Prompting Questions

“Prompting questions” force you to expand your thinking and fully explore an issue before drawing conclusions. There are three types of prompting questions:

  * **Questions that enhance understanding** : They counter the tendency to propose or discard options before you fully understand the problem. **Ask** : What’s the bigger picture that this customer situation fits into? What else must be going on? Use these questions if you tend to default to one size fits all.
  * **Questions that broaden perspective** : They counter the tendency to view challenges only from a personal or sales-focused perspective. **Ask** : If you were the customer’s CFO, what would you look for in this offering? What will the marketing director think of it? Use these questions if you tend to over-rely on personal experience.
  * **Questions that expand options** : They counter the tendency to consider only ideas that fit existing assumptions. **Ask** : What would you do differently if you had more money to pursue this customer? What would you do if you had more time? Use these questions if you tend to dismiss ideas as impractical before they're fully developed.



The SCAMMPERR framework, a prompting question tool, helps you work through ideas. The example below uses this question tool to reposition a sales offer instead of granting a discount.

**S—Substitute** : What could we do instead?

**C—Combine** : How could we combine approaches?

**A—Adapt** : What outside ideas could be adapted to this situation?

**M—Magnify** : How could we put more emphasis on value?

**M—Modify** : How can we change the offer to make it more relevant?

**P—Put to another use** : How might a different stakeholder value this?

**E—Eliminate** : What elements that the customer is unwilling to pay for can we eliminate?

**R—Rearrange** : How can we change the order of things to make them more relevant?

**R—Reverse** : What if we do the exact opposite?
