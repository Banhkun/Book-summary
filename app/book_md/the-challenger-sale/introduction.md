## Introduction

The economic crisis of 2009 wasn’t a good time to be a sales representative. Business dried up for most sales reps—cash and credit were scarce and hardly anyone was buying anything. Yet a handful of gifted sales reps succeeded in selling despite the downturn. Researchers with the business advisory firm CEB set out to learn these reps’ secrets to selling in bad times—and came away with an entirely new sales model that can be replicated and bring success to any company.

As it turned out, the reps’ success had nothing to do with the health of the economy and everything to do with responding to customers’ needs in a new way: **these reps pushed customers to think and act differently**. In _The Challenger Sale_ , authors Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson of CEB’s research arm explain this approach and why sales success today, whether in a good or bad economy, depends on it.

Dixon and Adamson reveal three key insights from a massive research study for CEB’s Sales Executive Council that have since transformed business-to-business, or B2B, sales by changing the way sales executives think about selling.

1) **There are five types of B2B sales reps** —each characterized by certain skills and behaviors that define how a rep interacts with customers. (These five profiles are described in Chapter 2.)

2) **One type of rep performs far better than the others and one lags far behind**. And sales managers traditionally have relied on the type _least_ likely to consistently deliver big results.

3)**The sales methods used by those who fit the top-performing profile enable these reps to succeed not only in a poor economy, but regardless of the economic conditions**. They succeed because they differentiate themselves from their competition by delivering value—they give the customer more than just a good price.

These reps fit the profile type referred to in the book as the “Challenger.”
