## Afterword: A Challenging Culture

Internal business customers, such as colleagues from other departments, want insight too—for instance, new ideas for saving and making money—so **the Challenger model of teaching new ways of thinking applies within and across the organization**.

For instance, researchers found that an HR recruiter’s ability to be a strategic advisor to the company accounted for 52% of effectiveness. Similarly, company leaders in other departments want IT departments to advise them on how to use technology to be more efficient or save money.

### Breaking Out of Order-Taker Mode

Like sales reps, marketing and communications professionals don’t want to be viewed as order-takers. They want to make a more valuable contribution by moving from managing the message to managing the strategy.

For instance, instead of jumping to fill a colleague’s request to issue a press release, a communications professional can help more if she knows the strategic reason for the request. It might be something like, “We want our competitors to know we've moved into this new area.” By knowing the reason behind the press release request, the communications staff can identify opportunities to deliver greater value.

One communications department used a five-step process for analyzing internal requests before acting on them. This improved its solutions and repositioned the department as a strategic partner in improving company results.

### Communicating Effectively

People with specific expertise in areas like HR or IT often have trouble communicating with colleagues in the company in language they understand.

One of the worst offenders when it comes to technical jargon is the legal department.

Attorneys are trained to write long technical briefs for judges but not to communicate effectively with business partners. Also, instead of offering options, attorneys tend to give “on the one hand/on the other hand” answers.

To build respect and credibility so that your views are taken seriously, you need to show that you understand your colleagues’ needs in the same way that reps seek to understand their customers’ businesses.

### Earning a Voice

To earn a voice in decisions, corporate staff need to deliver compelling insights. For example, to ensure they were making a valuable contribution, one marketing department came up with specific criteria for offering insight (similar to the SAFE-BOLD framework for designing a teaching pitch, described in Chapter 5):

  * The project aligns with an issue important to management
  * The department’s research is likely to uncover significant insights
  * It’s within the group’s expertise
  * There’s a high probability of resolution
  * Resource requirements are minimal



These criteria helped the marketing research staff deliver compelling insights in presentations to the management team.

While it’s difficult to predict every skill companies will need in five or ten years, it’s clear that internal customers, like outside customers, will continue to be hungry for new insight and will appreciate partners who can provide it.
