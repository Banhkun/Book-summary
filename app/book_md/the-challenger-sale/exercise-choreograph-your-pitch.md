## Exercise: Choreograph Your Pitch

In previous exercises, you've identified your company’s unique benefits and created insights to teach customers. Now you need to organize your material into a teaching pitch that follows a series of choreographed steps.

* * *

Steps 1-2: The Warm-Up—Give your assessment of an issue facing the customer and get his reaction. Offer an insight or different way of looking at the problem that will make the customer say, “Wow, I’ve never thought of that before.”

Step 3: Rational Drowning—Present the rationale for your different approach in a way that makes the customer uncomfortable (show him he's losing money or missing an opportunity).

Step 4: Emotional Impact—To help the customer emotionally with the issue, tell a story about another company that thought the same way, failed to take action, and suffered.

Step 5: A New Way—Review what the customer needs to do to solve the problem. He has to _accept_ the solution before buying _your_ solution.

Step 6: Your Solution: Explain how your company is best positioned to deliver the solution the customer has agreed to. This should connect clearly to the insight you delivered earlier.
