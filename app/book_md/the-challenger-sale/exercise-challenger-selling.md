## Exercise: Challenger Selling

The three pillars of the Challenger Selling Model are: teaching for differentiation, tailoring for resonance, and taking control of the sales conversation.

* * *

Teaching for differentiation means differentiating yourself from competitors by offering the customer a unique and valuable insight. Think of a current or prospective customer. What new insight could you offer the customer about his business? What could the customer improve about what he or she is doing? What would make them say, “Wow, I never thought of that before?”

What makes this insight unique and valuable?

How can you link the insight to your company's unique solution?
