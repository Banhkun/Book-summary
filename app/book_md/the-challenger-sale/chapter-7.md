## Chapter 7: Taking Control of the Sale

Taking control of the sale is the third pillar of the Challenger Selling Method. Challenger reps are able to take control of the sale because they’re naturally good at two things that core reps struggle with: talking about money and pushing the customer. This chapter explains how to build these skills in average reps.

**Challenger reps are comfortable discussing money because they’re confident in the value of the insight they’ve provided to the customer**. For the same reason, they don’t hesitate to push back when a customer wants a discount, looser terms, or more without a price increase.

Challengers also create momentum, keeping the conversation moving toward the next step. Their goal is to sell a deal, not have a friendly meeting. In contrast, Relationship Builders don’t push toward next steps because they don’t want to undermine the relationship. They naturally want to reduce tension, not increase it by pushing.

### Misconceptions about Taking Control

Reps may be reluctant to take control or sales managers may hesitate to push their reps to control the sales conversation due to three misconceptions:

#### Misconception 1: Taking Control Is Synonymous with Negotiation

Many sales reps and managers think they should take control only at the end of the sales conversation, at the negotiation stage. However, Challengers take control of the entire sales process from the beginning. As a result, customers see the Challenger as a confident partner as opposed to an anxious rep hoping for a deal at the end.

Challengers realize that customers may be confused about how to execute a complex purchase, so they teach the customer _how_ to buy the solution. Extrapolating from past sales, they explain the purchase process and coach the customer on who should be involved.

Challengers also take control immediately in two typical problem situations that usually stymie core reps:

  * **The foregone conclusion:** A company may assign a junior employee to meet with the rep, not to learn anything new, but to confirm a decision that’s already been made to go with another supplier. The point is just to make sure they're getting the best deal. This happens nearly 20% of the time. Challengers recognize the ploy and use it to push for access to more stakeholders or decision-makers in exchange for continued dialogue. If they don’t get it, they move on to better prospects. In contrast, average reps don’t want to walk away, so they waste time on a lost cause.
  * **Free consultation:** A customer may invite the rep in to analyze a problem and generate creative solutions— _then_ the customer searches out the cheapest supplier. Challengers either avoid this customer or they confront the customer upfront about the effort required to analyze the problem and get everyone on board; then they request assurance that the customer will invest in the supplier in return.



#### Misconception 2: Reps Should Only Take Control When the Topic Is Money

**Challengers take control not only on price, but also on ideas** —they push the customer in how they think about their business and its challenges (this is required for reframing, the essence of Commercial Teaching).

In fact, pushing on ideas is necessary because the customer often will be skeptical about a new way of thinking and will push back by demanding data or by arguing that his company is different. The Challenger rep replies that other companies have unique aspects too, but this idea has helped them.

Pushing back is critical because the insights link back to the supplier’s solutions. If the rep can’t convince the customer the problem ought to be solved, he can't sell the solution.

#### Misconception 3: Reps Will Be too Aggressive If Told to Take Control

Sales managers often fear that reps will be aggressive. But research shows that reps are more likely to go the other way toward passivity and wanting to resolve tension rather than maintain it.

**Reps are often passive because they think the customer has the most power in the sales relationship.** They give in to customer demands because they feel they have no choice. However, reps have more power than they think; many undervalue their contribution and overestimate the value of the customer’s objections. Taking control means you know the value of your expertise and company resources and you don’t give them away without a commitment from the customer to work with you.

**Sales managers often inadvertently encourage rep passivity by urging them to be customer-centric** , or to put the customer first. In response, reps tend to give discounts when they shouldn’t or become customer order-takers. Managers have to stop this if they want to build a Challenger sales force.

Challengers are assertive, not aggressive. On a rep behavior spectrum, with passive at one end and aggressive at the other, assertive falls in the middle and is characterized by:

  * Directly pursuing goals constructively
  * Defending personal boundaries
  * Using direct language



The main difference between being assertive and aggressive is posture. **Assertive reps use direct language and move the conversation forward purposefully, but they’re sensitive and responsive to the customer’s reactions**. They make their value case and stick with it, building stakeholder support. In contrast, aggressive reps attack with antagonistic language. But again, reps are far more likely to be timid than aggressive. The real question is how to make them _more_ assertive, not less assertive.

### Equipping Reps to Take Control

**To help reps become more assertive, sales managers need to address the main barrier to taking control: the desire for closure**.

Most reps are uncomfortable with loose ends and ambiguity. In contrast, Challengers welcome ambiguity, and even tension, because they realize it can be used to their advantage. They’re comfortable with silence in the sales conversation, as well as keeping points of contention open and on the table for a while.

While you can't transform people’s personalities, you can help make reps more aware of their tendencies and give them tools for making sure they don't give in when they shouldn’t during tough conversations. Chemicals company DuPont has developed some of these kinds of tools.

#### DuPont's Controlled Negotiation Process

While Challengers should take control of the entire conversation, DuPont’s template for controlling the negotiation stage is a good example of how you can help reps learn to be assertive.

The key to DuPont’s approach is **having an advance plan or strategy** that gives reps confidence to not back down in a challenging conversation. The company provides reps with a template for pre-negotiation planning. The form requires listing the supplier’s strengths and weaknesses relative to the customer. This reminds the rep of the value her company offers and the confidence to seek a fair price.

Reps also have to think in advance about the information they need to get from the customer, as well as about what information the customer will want to know. They articulate the things the supplier is looking for in the deal and things they can negotiate on. They develop hypotheses on the customer’s needs. This kind of planning equips reps to challenge and push back as well as to think several steps ahead.

##### Steps to a Successful Negotiation

Besides the background preparation, there are other steps a company can take to help reps take control of the conversation. DuPont has created a four-step framework focused on mitigating reps’ tendency to give in too soon:

**1) Defer** : When a customer demands a discount, defer the discussion by saying something like, “Before we discuss price, I’d like to make sure I fully understand your needs so we can make this deal as valuable as possible for you. Is that OK?” In this step, the rep promises to address price but gets permission to proceed. It's important to get the customer’s consent to defer or he won’t listen. The rep also has created some tension.

**2) Broaden** : Press forward to uncover the customer’s needs (DuPont provides tactics to help). The goal is to expand the customer’s view of the things that are important to him. What else besides price matters—for instance, expedited shipping?

**3) Explore** : Compare and evaluate the additional needs identified during the conversation. After broadening the list as much as possible, come back to price, starting with an open-ended question: “What are you looking to achieve with a 20% reduction?” Often the reason is something that can be addressed another way—for instance, it may be driven by the desire for a specific business outcome like production cost reductions rather than economic need.

Now you’re negotiating not just on price, but on all the ways the supplier creates value and helps the customer address challenges. You’re also positioned to offer concessions other than price.

**4) Concede** : Determine what you’re willing to concede ahead of time and follow a strategy of trading other things first before defaulting to price.

How and when you concede matters: DuPont teaches reps to avoid starting with smaller concessions and proceeding to larger ones or putting a take-it-or-leave-it offer on the table because they can leave a customer feeling cheated. Instead, concede your negotiable items in a measured way that makes the customer feel he’s winning. For instance, **start with a meaningful concession, and offer progressively smaller concessions as negotiations continue**. This manages tension constructively.

#### Caution

Remember that it's important for reps to take control throughout the sales process, not just during negotiation. It has to happen throughout the conversation or it will feel contrived or off-putting at the end.

Teaching reps the importance of clear direction over quick closure and how to create value in the sales process can help them overcome passivity and be assertive.
