## Chapter 4: Teaching—Part 1: The Importance of Insight

In typical solutions sales training, reps are taught to be investigators: to question and learn from their customers what’s most important to them so they can offer solutions. For instance, they’re taught to ask the customer, “What's keeping you up at night?”

However, as previously noted, having to answer a lot of probing questions, especially from multiple salespeople, has led to solutions fatigue. Further, customers don’t always know what they need. The Challenger approach is to teach rather than investigate. **Challengers win sales by knowing their customers’ business better than they do and teaching them something they need to know**.

Presuming to teach customers may seem arrogant at first glance, yet research shows that’s what customers want most from a supplier.

### Teaching Builds Customer Loyalty

CEB surveyed companies to learn what customers were looking for in a business-to-business (B2B) supplier. Specifically, researchers asked companies why they might choose one supplier over another, or what made them loyal to a supplier. The most important thing was the sales experience—not the product and service or price.

**It’s not _what_ you sell but _how_ you sell it that counts the most**.

The study found that only 38% of customer loyalty stems from brand and service. Typically, these factors keep a supplier in the game, but they don’t build sales or loyalty. Customers often don’t see much difference between competitors’ products, yet reps often spend time highlighting small differences.

**Price isn’t a significant factor in customer loyalty** either. Only 9% of customer loyalty is attributable to offering the best price. Discounting alone won’t get customers to buy more or continue buying from a company.

In contrast, 53% of customer loyalty is attributable to outperforming the competition in the sales experience itself. A customer’s loyalty is won during the sales call.

In surveys, customers saw huge differences between suppliers in the conversations they had with reps. They saw some reps as wasting their time by talking about small product differences; in contrast, others provided interesting, unique, and valuable information.

The next section looks deeper into the sales experience.

### The Value of Insight

In surveying customers, researchers identified seven attributes or qualities in sales reps that were most important in generating loyalty. A majority related to providing insight.

Customers were most loyal to reps that:

  * Offered useful perspectives on their market
  * Helped them explore options
  * Provided advice
  * Helped them avoid potential problems
  * Educated them on new issues and outcomes
  * Were easy to buy from
  * Had widespread support across the customer’s organization



The bottom two factors underscore that customers need consensus on purchasing and they want a smooth transaction. However, the top five attributes show that customers want to learn something more than they want to buy something. They want insight into how to cut costs, make more money, and reduce risk. Customers are saying to reps: Don't waste my time; tell me something new about my business.

However, reps must teach in a way that both changes the customer’s thinking and drives action. If the insight doesn’t lead to action, it doesn’t have any value.

### Commercial Teaching

Teaching doesn't mean free consulting. Reps must ensure their teaching leads to more business for their company, not for a competitor. To do so, they must engage in **Commercial Teaching, defined as teaching customers something new about their business that leads to business for the supplier**.

There are four Commercial Teaching requirements:

  1. Link to your company’s unique strengths.
  2. Challenge the customer’s assumptions.
  3. Prompt the customer to act.
  4. Segment customers based on needs. 



#### Rule 1: Link to Your Company’s Unique Strengths

**Commercial Teaching must connect insights to the areas in which your company outperforms the competition.**

You want the conversation to go like this: you share an important insight that requires action; the customer asks, “How can I make that happen?”; you respond, “Here’s how we can help you do that better than anyone else.” **Teach the customer not only to want help, but to want _your_ help**.

Doing this well requires two things:

1) You must actually be able to help. You’ll frustrate customers, or drive them to the competition, if you teach them about a problem without offering a solution.

2) You need to know what your company’s unique strengths are. While this sounds straightforward, many companies struggle to pinpoint what they do well, let alone what they do best.

In a recent survey of B2B customers, CEB found that only 35% could verify they were truly preferred over the competition. And of the preferred companies’ purported unique benefits, customers saw only half of them as relevant to their needs. In other words, only 14% of a company’s unique benefits were seen as such by the customer.

Agreeing on your company’s unique strengths is often the hardest part of implementing Commercial Teaching. Most companies cite being innovative, customer-focused, solutions-oriented, and so on. But those aren’t unique qualities because most companies cite them.

**If you can't connect the insights you teach to your company’s strengths, you’re providing your customers with free consulting**.

#### Rule 2: Challenge the Customer’s Assumptions

Your insights must not only connect directly to your company’s strengths, but they must also resonate with the customer by being directly relevant to his world.

To resonate, **the insight you present has to challenge the customer’s assumptions**. It must reframe how he thinks about his business, operates his business, or competes. In contrast, validating what the customer already knows doesn’t give him any value.

This may sound like a high bar. However, most suppliers really do know a customer’s business better than the customer does when it comes to the supplier’s capability or area of expertise. For instance, a company selling printers to a hospital knows more than the hospital about information management in a hospital setting (although not more about health care). A company that sells packaged foods knows more about how consumers buy groceries than most retailers know.

**If you’ve successfully reframed your customer’s thinking, the reaction will be equivalent to, “I never thought of it that way before.”** If you haven’t changed the customer’s thinking, but only validated it, the reaction will be something like, ”That’s it exactly—I totally agree.” When they get the latter response, Relationship Builders often feel good about making a connection. But agreement doesn’t win the customer’s business.

Challenger reps want the customer to stop and think about what an insight means to his business or wonder what else he’s missing. That’s the point where you’ve given the customer something of value. It's the turning point of an effective Commercial Teaching conversation.

#### Rule 3: Prompt the Customer to Act

It's not enough to change the customer’s thinking—you have to get the customer to act.

Most reps try to make the case for action by focusing on how the customer can save money with the supplier’s solution over time (the ROI). However, in Commercial Teaching, the initial focus of the conversation is on the customer’s business, not the supplier’s solution. The rep must show **why the insight shared with the customer requires action in the first place** , especially when it runs counter to conventional wisdom.

The way to use numbers to prompt action in Commercial Teaching is to help the customer **calculate the cost of failing to act on the insight you’ve taught** —either the money they’re wasting or the money or benefit they’re missing out on.

#### Rule 4: Segment Customers Based on Need

Commercial Teaching is a great business strategy, but to apply it effectively and efficiently, sales reps need expert market research and analysis from their organization. To deliver unique, relevant insights to individual customers about their business, reps need data and analysis that are widely applicable. This is where organizational support is crucial.

Marketing departments should **research customer segments and generate insights linked to solutions and applicable to specific segments**. Reps can then approach customers with a handful of scripted insights and diagnostic questions that help them present the right insight for the customer.

However, generating insights useful for Commercial Teaching requires marketing professionals to think differently about segmentation. (Shortform note: Market segmentation is dividing a target market into smaller groups of customers that share common characteristics.)

Segmenting customers by common needs is more useful than traditional segmentation by, for instance, geography or industry. Reps can apply the same insights to customers across various industries by focusing on needs they have in common, for instance, improving cash flow, reducing employee turnover, or improving workplace safety. In each case, reps can help the customer think about the need or problem differently (reframe), explain the costs of inaction, and propose action linked to the supplier’s solution.
