## Part 1 | Chapter 1: Customers Discourage Disruptive Products

Typically companies succeed by giving customers what they want—if you keep your customers happy, your profits should stay high. But, as we’ll see, disruptive innovations don’t initially appeal to a company’s current customers.

**Customers’ disinterest in disruptive technologies discourages established companies from investing in developing the disruptive products, which leads to the companies’ eventual downfalls.** Those companies that fail to adopt the disruptive technologies get the rug pulled out from under them later, when they discover that the disruptive products are taking over their market because the technologies have improved enough to satisfy their customers.

We’ll look at the effect of customers’ influence in the disk drive industry, which experienced an exceptionally rapid pace of change in technological advancements and market structure.

### Technology Mudslide Hypothesis in the Disk Drive Industry

Disk drives are responsible for reading and writing data on computers, using the binary system of 1s and 0s. IBM produced the first disk drive in the early 1950s. The drive was called RAMAC, which stood for Random Access Method for Accounting and Control.

Soon, other companies began producing disk drives. By 1976, there was about $1 billion in disk drive production.

Between 1976 and 1995, 129 startups entered the industry. During those two decades, each crop of entrant companies quickly graduated to become established firms, as new innovations disrupted the industry—and brought new generations of entrants—at an accelerated rate. Ultimately, all but 20 of the companies failed.

**Some people blamed the high rate of failure on the rapid pace of technological advancement, which far exceeded most other industries.** Based on this assumption, the author developed the technology mudslide hypothesis.

The technology mudslide hypothesis stated that keeping up with the breakneck pace of change was like working against a mudslide to climb a hill: It required every ounce of companies’ focus and effort, and pausing even for a minute would mean getting buried.

However, data ultimately debunked this theory. In reality, **neither the complexity nor the pace of technological advancement led to companies’ failures—it was the _type_ of technological change that determined companies’ fates.** Specifically, established companies failed when confronted with disruptive innovations.

### Sustaining vs. Disruptive Innovations

There are two types of technological innovations:

1) **Sustaining innovations** simply improve upon the performance of the industry’s existing products, thus catering to the established market. This represents the majority of technological advancements in any industry. Most companies that produce goods follow a fairly consistent trajectory of improving their products: They adopt technological advancements as they become available, and they release updated versions of their products with the new improvements.

Some sustaining innovations are simple changes, while others are technologically complex. Regardless, **no matter how complicated the change, established companies almost always lead their industries in producing and marketing sustaining innovations.**

2) **Disruptive innovations** disrupt the performance improvement trajectory. These technologies don’t appeal to existing customers—instead, they open up an entirely new market.

Disruptive innovations take many forms: Some are technologically advanced, while others are simple reconfigurations that offer new features. Some disruptive innovations invade markets like wildfire, while others take years or decades to take hold. **No matter what the disruptive innovation is, entrant firms—or startups—almost always become the dominant forces in producing and selling it.**

We’ll take a closer look at how these two types of changes impacted established and entrant firms in the disk drive industry. In the context of this book, established firms will refer to companies that existed before a given technological change, and entrant firms will refer to companies that started up at the same time the innovation was emerging.

### Case Study: Disruptive Innovations in the Disk Drive Industry

There were only a handful of disruptive changes in the disk drive industry, but they caused established firms to crumble. The most significant of these changes was the shrinking of disk drives.

Two of the most important characteristics of disk drives are physical size and capacity. The industry was in a constant push to fit more data capacity on smaller drives.

In the 1970s, the high-capacity 14-inch drive was standard for mainframe computers, the huge machines used by large businesses for processing data and transactions. Between 1978 and 1980, entrant firms introduced a disruptive technology: a smaller, lower-capacity 8-inch drive.

The 8-inch drive didn’t have enough capacity for mainframes, but it was perfect for the emerging market of minicomputers—mid-sized servers used for business, scientific projects, and databases—which were a step down in size and power from mainframe computers.

At first, the 8-inch drives cost more per megabyte of capacity, even though the drive’s total price was lower than the 14-inch drive. **The market tolerated the higher price-per-megabyte because it valued the drive’s smaller size.**

Over time, 8-inch drive manufacturers improved capacity and reduced costs so much that the 8-inch drives eventually had a lower cost-per-megabyte than the 14-inch drives. Additionally, **the 8-inch drives began invading the 14-inch drives’ market** : The 8-inch drives’ capacity had increased enough to suit low-end mainframe computers, eventually pushing 14-inch drives out of the low-end mainframe market.

Among 14-inch drive manufacturers, two-thirds never entered the 8-inch drive market—and those that did were two years behind the 8-inch startups. **Although the established firms that entered the 8-inch market had products that performed just as well, they couldn’t compete with the entrant firms.** Eventually, every 14-inch drive manufacturer failed.

The 14-inch drive manufacturers hesitated or failed to enter the 8-inch market because their mainframe computer customers didn’t want smaller drives. Mainframe computer makers wanted more capacity at a lower cost-per-megabyte, and 8-inch drives couldn’t offer that—at first. **Ultimately, listening to their customers led to the 14-inch firms’ demise.**

This pattern repeated multiple times in the evolution of the ever-shrinking disk drives.

#### The 5.25-Inch Drive

When the entrant Seagate Technology created the 5.25-inch drive in 1980, it had a sixth of the megabyte capacity of 8-inch drives and five times the access time (the higher the access time, the slower the computing speed).

**Minicomputer manufacturers weren’t interested in the innovation, so Seagate had to find another market.** The company turned to the emerging market of personal desktop computers, where the drive’s inferior capacity was less important than its smaller size and lower total price.

As in the transition from 14- to 8-inch drives, the established 8-inch firms that eventually produced 5.25-inch drives were about two years behind entrant firms. And half of 8-inch makers never entered the 5.25-inch market and eventually failed.

As the capacity of the drives increased, they eventually became sufficient for minicomputer and mainframe manufacturers. **Again, the disruptive innovation began in an emerging market and eventually invaded the established market.**

#### The 3.5-Inch Drive

The 3.5-inch drive was created by a company called Rodime in 1984, but the technology took off when the firm Conner Peripherals brought it to market in 1987. Similar to previous evolutions, this drive was physically smaller and offered less capacity than existing products.

Conner found a market in new portable and laptop computers, which valued the drive’s smaller size, lighter weight, and decreased power needs.

Seagate—the innovator of the 5.25-inch disk drive, and now an established firm—could have beat Conner to the market, but the company fell into the trap of listening to its customers. In 1985, Seagate’s engineers introduced a 3.5-inch drive prototype to customers, but the desktop computer makers weren’t interested. Seagate’s executives killed the 3.5-inch project because they doubted that the smaller drives would bring in enough revenue to make it worth the investment.

However, after Conner began selling 3.5-inch drives, Seagate revived the project—but instead of targeting the emerging market of laptop manufacturers, Seagate sold the smaller drives to desktop computer makers. **Although Seagate had hesitated to invest in the disruptive technology for fear of cannibalizing its existing sales, that’s exactly what happened when the company finally entered the market** because it sold the drives to its existing customers.

Seagate’s mistake is a common misstep among companies facing disruptive technologies. To avoid this, **established companies should adopt disruptive innovations soon after the technologies emerge, and the companies should target the disruptive products’ emerging markets, instead of trying to tailor them to existing markets.**

#### The 2.5-Inch Drive

In 1989, an entrant firm called Prairietek introduced a 2.5-inch drive and dominated the market. But by the end of 1990, Conner Peripherals produced its own version of the drive and took 95 percent of the market.

**In this case, the entrant Prairietek didn’t have the advantage over the established Conner Peripherals because the 2.5-inch drive was a sustaining—not a disruptive—technology.** The smaller drive appealed to the same laptop makers that used 3.5-inch drives, so the innovation merely represented a technological improvement.

Throughout the decades of improving disk technology, each round of incumbents allowed themselves to be led astray by their customers’ input. In the next chapter, we’ll talk about why.
