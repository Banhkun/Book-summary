## Chapter 6: Principle #2—Small Markets Can’t Keep Big Companies Alive

Companies typically get bigger the longer they’re in business. While growth equates to success under normal circumstances, it inhibits companies from transitioning to disruptive technologies.

As companies get larger, they need to bring in increasing profits to cover growing costs. The larger a company gets, the less it’s able to spend valuable resources on projects with low profit margins.

### Problem: Companies Are Pressured to Perpetually Grow

Most executives feel pressured to continue growing their companies for several reasons:

  1. The growth rate of a company’s earnings drives its stock prices, which makes investors happy, which puts the company in a good position to access capital. Additionally, employees who have stock options are incentivized to continue working hard when stock prices are growing. 
  2. Growth helps keep top-performing employees in the company, because it creates room for them to move up to higher positions. If the company stagnates or struggles, it risks losing its best employees to other, more successful companies. 
  3. Growing companies can justify investments in new technologies more easily than stagnated companies can. 



However, perpetual growth creates a conundrum: **The bigger a company gets, the harder it is to continue growing.**

For example, if a $40 million company aims to maintain a 20 percent annual growth rate, the goal is much easier to attain in the early years—$8 million the first year, $9.6 million the next year—but the figure quickly climbs. The $8 million growth the company needed in the first year more than doubles by the fifth year and nearly triples by the seventh year. By the time the company is worth $400 million, it needs to bring in $80 million to maintain its growth rate.

**The emerging markets for disruptive innovations are too small to support large companies’ growth needs.** But if big companies wait until the disruptive technology’s market is established enough to better satisfy their growth needs, they miss the critical window for entry.

#### Pioneers of Disruptive Innovations Have an Advantage Over Late Adopters

When an innovation emerges in an industry, a company’s decision about whether to lead or follow the trend plays a critical role in its fate.

On one hand, pioneers can reap the rewards of first-mover advantages, which allow the company to build brand recognition and customer loyalty before other firms enter the market. On the other hand, followers can avoid costly missteps by waiting to enter a market until the pioneers have encountered and resolved early issues.

Research shows that companies that pioneer _sustaining_ technology have no early learning advantage or any other substantial benefit over the companies that follow later.

However, **companies that pioneer _disruptive_ technology in emerging markets perform significantly better in the mid- to long-term than late adopters.** For example, the first disk-drive companies to adopt thin-film technology averaged $1.9 billion in revenues during an 18-year period, while the late-adopting companies averaged only $64.5 million.

Late adopters delayed in order to minimize their _market risk—_ entering an emerging market with an unproven technology—but the tradeoff was increasing their _competitive risk—_ the threat of facing fierce competition if they entered the market later.

### Solution: Create a Small, Independent Organization

When large established firms are confronted with this dilemma, they typically take one of three approaches:

  1. Try to push the emerging market to grow more quickly
  2. Wait until the market has grown 
  3. Create independent entities to develop and market the disruptive technology, and make sure the entity is small enough to match the size of the market



As we’ll see in the following case studies, the first two strategies are seldom successful. By contrast, the third strategy is the most effective way for a company to tackle a disruptive project.

We talked in the last chapter about the benefits of an established firm creating an independent organization to lead disruptive projects. When a company creates the independent entities, it’s essential that its size fits the small (albeit unknown) market it’s targeting, because:

  * **Small companies are free of large companies’ high-profit growth obligations.**
  * **Small entities can get excited about small opportunities and victories** that would be considered disappointing in the context of a big company, and that enthusiasm is critical to driving motivation to push the project’s progression.



Let’s take a look at examples of companies that have taken each of these three strategies, and the outcomes for each.

### Strategy #1: Apple Tried Pushing the PDA Market to Grow

Projects that are perceived to be successful garner more organizational and financial support, which helps them to progress to higher levels of success and profitability. By contrast, projects that are perceived as failures simply languish. **To give a disruptive project the best chance of long-term success, a company must assign it to a team and organization small enough to appreciate small victories.**

When Apple developed a disruptive personal digital assistant (PDA), instead of taking this approach and assigning the project to a _small team_ , the company tried to make the _market bigger_. By the time Apple decided to make its PDA, called the Newton, the firm was a $5 billion public company that faced pressure to continue growing. Apple was determined to make the Newton a success.

Apple’s CEO made a huge effort to promote the product and keep resources focused on its development. The company also invested heavily in market research to find out what features customers would want.

However, PDAs were a disruptive technology. Since disruptive technologies offer novel functions, their users don’t _know_ what they want or how they’ll use the products—until they start using them. **Disruptive innovations require trial and error before they appeal to a larger customer base, and that takes time.** Apple couldn’t effectively shortcut this process with market surveys.

Apple’s impatience cost the company a lot of money on multiple ineffective efforts:

  * Extensive market research to try to determine what customers wanted
  * Development of complicated technology based on the market research, not on actual usage
  * Aggressive marketing to push people to buy the product



The Newton sold 140,000 units in its first two years, which was considered a failure for such a large company. (Shortform note: The Newton had some traction in the medical field, but it lost most of the PDA market when the Palm Pilot was introduced. Steve Jobs had the Newton discontinued in 1998, five years after its release.)

However, failure and success are relative: Fifteen years earlier, Apple sold just 43,000 units of a then-disruptive technology and considered it such a big success for the fledgling company that it went public. **The perceived success and failure of the two product launches were relative to the size of the _company_ at the time, when they should’ve been viewed relative to the size of the small, emerging _markets_. **

The Newton may have reached more success if the company had been willing to go through the necessary trial-and-error process to fine-tune the product and find the right market, but leaders couldn’t get past the perception of failure. It’s extremely difficult for company leaders to view a product’s success in the context of the market instead of the context of the company—which is why**Apple should have created a smaller, independent organization to develop and launch the Newton.**

### Strategy #2: Priam Waited to Introduce 5.25-Inch Drives

Large companies that struggle to justify investing valuable resources into disruptive products because of their small markets and low profit margins are often tempted to wait to enter until the market is bigger. However, **waiting comes with a risk that the market’s leading companies could develop certain capabilities—such as knowledge or pace of production—and companies that enter later may never catch up.**

For example, the 8-inch drive maker Priam was a leader in its minicomputer market, in part because the company developed a two-year production cycle for new products, which matched minicomputer makers’ two-year production cycle. When Priam entered the disruptive 5.25-inch drive market, it maintained its two-year cycle for the new drives.

But Seagate, which entered the 5.25-inch market two years before Priam, had developed a one-year production cycle, which gave the company two advantages:

  1. Seagate’s one-year cycle matched the production cycles of its customers, desktop computer makers. 
  2. Although Seagate’s 5.25-inch drives were initially far lower quality than Priam’s 8-inch drives, Seagate quickly closed the gap by releasing new-and-improved products twice as often as Priam. 



Priam couldn’t keep up, and the company eventually shuttered.

### Strategy #3: Assign Small Organizations to Small-Market Projects

When companies assign disruptive projects to small, independent organizations, they can take two approaches:

1) **Create an entity or division within the parent company.** Control Data Corporation (CDC) took this approach when the company developed its 5.25-inch drives.

CDC’s headquarters was in Minneapolis, but it created a team in Oklahoma City to commercialize the 5.25-inch products. This small organization could get excited about the small orders that were inevitable in the early years of the emerging desktop computer market. The spin-out organization was ultimately a success.

2) **Acquire a small company.** Allen Bradley Company (AB) went this route when it began producing disruptive electronic programmable motor controllers, which were used in factories that were beginning to automate operations.

AB was an established electromechanical control maker when the disruptive electronic controllers emerged. A year after the first electronic controller hit the market, AB bought two small companies specializing in programmable controllers. Then AB combined them into one organization, which remained separate from AB’s main business. As a result, AB was the only established firm to survive the disruption.
