## Part 2 | Chapter 5: Overcoming Resource Dependence

Now that we’ve outlined the factors that cause established firms to fail when confronting disruptive innovations, we’ll talk about how managers can avoid falling into these traps.

**Established firms generally struggle to survive disruptive innovations, but if managers understand the governing principles of disruptive technologies, they can weather the storm or, at best, harness them for their success.** Companies that don’t know what they’re up against or how to navigate it will almost surely succumb to disruptive technology’s takeover.

Consider this analogy: When humans first attempted to fly, they attached wings to their arms, jumped off of tall objects, and flapped as hard as they could. They soon discovered that the methods that worked for birds didn’t work for humans. However, when they learned about the forces at work—such as gravity and the concepts of drag, lift, and resistance—they were able to harness these principles and eventually take flight.

Through the next five chapters, we’ll explore each of the five principles of disruptive technology, illustrate how they create problems for established companies, and offer solutions to navigating them. The five principles are:

  1. Customers and investors dictate a company’s resources.
  2. Small markets can’t keep big companies alive.
  3. Companies can’t rely on market research for unknown and emerging markets.
  4. A company’s capabilities in one context are its disabilities in another.
  5. Customers don’t always want the newest technological advance.



We’ll start by discussing Principle #1 and talking about a few case studies that illustrate how this principle played out in several industries.

### Principle #1: Customers and Investors Dictate a Company’s Resources

Although company leaders appear to be in control of an organization’s decisions and direction, the theory of resource dependence states that customers and investors are the primary deciders of a company’s actions. This is because **customers and investors provide the resources the company needs to stay in business, so everything the organization does essentially is in an effort to keep them happy.**

#### Problem: Resource Dependence Impedes Disruptive Innovation

Generally, the strategy of satisfying customers and investors is not only effective but also essential to a company’s survival. However, as we talked about, disruptive technologies are inherently _unappealing_ to current customers, and the low profits they offer are also unattractive to investors. Consequently, **this approach causes established firms to neglect disruptive innovations until they’ve improved enough to be attractive to current customers—and by then, it’s too late.**

The culture that grows out of resource dependence impacts everyone in the company: From the senior managers down to the most junior employees, everyone knows what kinds of work is good for the company and for their personal careers.

Even if a manager decides to take a chance and pursue a disruptive innovation, everyone working on the project needs to believe in it in order for it to be successful. **If team members don’t believe in the disruptive project, they make innumerable small day-to-day decisions** —such as prioritizing their time toward other assignments—**that’ll ultimately starve the project of the effort and attention it needs to succeed.**

#### Solution: Create an Independent Organization

Rather than trying to convince employees to back a project, company leaders can create an independent entity—preferably in a separate physical location—to lead the development and marketing of the disruptive product.

**The parent company’s culture and organization are built to succeed in its existing market, but the independent organization needs the separation to be able to develop the culture and cost structure that fit the disruptive innovation.**

### Principle #1 in the Disk Drive Industry

Let’s look at how three disk drive companies successfully handled Principle #1 when faced with disruptive innovations.

#### Quantum Corporation Financed Former Employees’ Startup

In the early 1980s, Quantum Corporation was a dominant manufacturer of 8-inch disk drives, which were used in minicomputers. When 5.25-inch drives disrupted the market, the company was nearly four years late to market its own 5.25-inch product.

When Quantum employees saw the next disruption coming, they didn’t want to be behind the curve yet again. The employees left Quantum and formed their own startup to make and sell 3.5-inch drives.

Quantum saw an opportunity: **Instead of merely letting the employees walk away, Quantum financed and held 80 percent ownership of the startup, called Plus Development Corporation.**

Besides the financial ties, Plus Development was completely independent—from its locations to its executives. The firm had a lot of success, which was a lifesaver to Quantum as the sales of its 8-inch and 5.25-inch drives dissipated over time.

After several years, Quantum bought out Plus Development and basically turned the startup into its main operation. As time went on, Quantum successfully adopted subsequent sustaining technologies and, by 1994, was the largest unit-volume disk drive manufacturer in the world.

#### Control Data Corporation Relocated Its Disruptive Product Team

Control Data Corporation (CDC) was an industry leader in 14-inch drive production for more than 15 years. When 8-inch drives entered the market, CDC was three years late in producing them—and the 8-inch drives it sold were almost entirely to existing customers.

CDC failed to capitalize on the potential of 8-inch technology and its emerging market because the project didn’t get the time and attention it needed. Instead, the marketers and engineers assigned to the project kept getting pulled away to work on new 14-inch models.

But when 5.25-inch drives arose, CDC took a different approach: **The company sent the team assigned to work on 5.25-inch products to a facility in Oklahoma City—far from the company’s primary Minneapolis location.** The physical distance allowed the team to put their entire focus on the 5.25-inch project.

CDC’s strategy worked. Although the company was two years behind the industry in introducing its 5.25-inch models, CDC held a decent market share and made a profit off the venture.

#### Micropolis’ CEO Fought to Launch the Disruptive Product Within the Company

Micropolis was a dominant 8-inch disk drive maker that managed to adopt disruptive 5.25-inch technology without creating a separate entity to lead the effort—but it wasn’t easy.

Micropolis’s CEO put his best engineers on the disruptive project and spent a year and a half fighting against the company’s organizational structure, which was designed to serve its customers in the 8-inch market. **The CEO had to put all of his time and attention on the project to ensure that resources weren’t being pulled away.**

The effort paid off, and Micropolis successfully transitioned from 8-inch to 5.25-inch drives. To do so, the company had to abandon all of its 8-inch customers—who initially had no use for the 5.25-inch models—and scramble to find 5.25-inch customers to replace the lost profits.

### Principle #1 in the Personal Computer Industry

The evolution of disruptive technologies in the computer industry runs parallel to the evolution of disk drive technology, on which computers relied. Established mainframe computer makers were disrupted by the emergence of the minicomputer, which was disrupted by the personal computer, which was disrupted by the laptop.

Two minicomputer makers—Digital Equipment (DEC) and IBM—illustrate two starkly different approaches to confronting the disruptive innovation of personal computers.

DEC marketed personal computer lines four different times between 1983 and 1995, but each time they failed. During each attempt, the company led the personal computer project within its main organization. The problem was that **DEC’s established cost structure and value network were incompatible with the value network it needed to enter to be successful in the personal computer market.**

By contrast, IBM was successful in its personal computer venture. When IBM launched its personal computer project, it created an independent entity located in Florida, while the company’s main headquarters was in New York. **The entity was empowered to take its own approach to creating a cost structure, sourcing component parts, and selling the products, independent of IBM’s main operations.**

### Principle #1 in the Discount Retail Industry

When discount retail stores began popping up in the 1950s, they caused a huge disruption for department and variety stores by selling nationally known brands at significantly lower prices.

Whereas department and variety stores sold products at about 40 percent of the wholesale price and turned over their inventory four times a year, discount retailers achieved the same profits by marking up the products only 20 percent and turning over inventory eight times a year.

Initially, discount stores sold low-end goods like hardware and small appliances to low-profit customers—namely, blue-collar wives with young kids. However, over time, the discount retailers began offering higher-end goods, such as clothes and home goods.

The two biggest variety store chains in the world—S.S. Kresge and W.F. Woolworth—took significantly different approaches to opening discount stores. **The companies’ drastically different outcomes were yet more evidence that one organization can’t sustain two cost structures and cultures.**

Kresge made a full transition from variety to discount stores. The company brought on a new CEO, hired a new management team, and steadily closed its existing stores. **Through its full commitment to the disruptive innovation, Kresge found success.** Its discount stores were called Kmart, and, 10 years after opening, Kmart’s sales were near $3.5 billion.

Woolworth tried to sustain its existing stores while also building its chain of discount stores, Woolco. The same set of managers were tasked with both projects, and the company continued opening new Woolworths at the same rate after opening Woolco as it had before. Ten years after opening, Woolco’s sales were about $0.9 billion. Another 10 years later, the last existing Woolco closed.

### Principle #1 in the Ink-Jet Printing Industry

When ink-jet printing was introduced, it disrupted the laser-jet printing market. Although the new printers had lower resolution and higher cost-per-page, they were also smaller and cheaper per unit than the larger, higher-quality laser-jets.

Hewlett-Packard created a new entity and put it in Washington state to create physical and organizational separation from its main business in Idaho. **HP executives even allowed the primary and the disruptive businesses to compete against each other in the market.** This benefitted HP in multiple ways:

  1. It continued to earn laser-jet profits while the technology was dominant in its value market.
  2. It successfully commercialized the disruptive innovation and brought in profits from its ink-jet organization.
  3. If laser-jet sales declined with improvements in ink-jet capabilities, HP’s strong presence in the ink-jet market would help the company keep its former laser-jet customers. 



Although one of HP’s businesses could end up killing the other, the company positioned itself in the best way to ride the transition from old to new technology.
