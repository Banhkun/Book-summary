## Chapter 2: Value Networks

In order to explain why dominant companies often fail in the face of technological change, most experts offer two theories:

  1. **The Organizational Structure Framework:** Companies’ organizations, managements, or cultures can’t adapt to radical innovations that require different communication patterns and workflows. 
  2. **The Capabilities Viewpoint:** Companies develop certain skills and knowledge from producing their existing products, and they stumble when a radically new technology requires a different set of skills and knowledge. 



Although these theories help explain many firms’ failures, they don’t address what happened in the disk drive industry, where established firms adopted radically new technologies for various sustaining innovations, but they failed when faced with relatively simple innovations like the 8-inch drive. As we saw in Chapter 1, a major factor determining whether a company adapted to disruptive technologies was whether its customers were interested in the new technology.

A third theory—the theory of value networks—explains how **customer input is part of a larger system that determines how companies respond to customer input, set and pursue goals, and react to industry changes, such as disruptive innovations.**

### Value Networks

Just about every product requires specific component parts—for example, a mainframe computer needs circuit boards, a central processing unit, and disk drives, among other things. Component parts, then, require their own component parts: Disk drives need disks, a motor, and a spindle. While some companies produce their own component parts, most buy them from various suppliers.

This creates a nested network of producers and markets. **Each nested network represents a unique value network, because the chain of supply and the products being manufactured determine each component’s value.**

There are two metrics that factor into a product’s value in its value network. Let’s look at them in terms of a disk drive in a network producing laptops versus a network producing mainframes:

  1. **Performance attributes** : These are the traits that customers value in a product. For laptop manufacturers, the most valued attributes for disk drives are small size, durability, and low power needs. By contrast, mainframe makers value speed, megabyte capacity, and reliability. 
  2. **Cost structure:** This is determined by a product’s overhead costs, production volume, and price point, and it dictates the gross profit margins manufacturers need to meet. Laptops entail high production volume in low-cost factory settings and distribution to retailers, thus laptop makers need only 15-20 percent gross profit margins to cover overhead. By contrast, mainframes require low-volume, custom manufacturing; direct sales, requiring a sales team; and ongoing tech support for customers, which means mainframe makers need 50-60 percent gross profit margins to cover overhead. 



**A company’s value network provides the context for the organization’s decisions and actions, including how it approaches innovations.** If an innovation affects a product’s attributes or cost in a way that is highly valued within the value network, then the company is more inclined to pursue it.

**This framework illustrates why established firms are reluctant to allocate limited resources—including time, money, and personnel—to disruptive innovations, which have low value in both metrics** :

  1. Disruptive innovations don’t have attributes that appeal to existing customers. 
  2. Disruptive innovations promise low profits because they are initially marketable only to small, emerging markets.



#### The Technology S-Curve Framework

Some businesses use the technology S-curve framework to determine when to adopt innovations—but **the S-curve framework only applies to sustaining innovations that replace products within the same value network.**

![innovators-dilemma-s-curve.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/innovators-dilemma-s-curve.png)

When a technology is first developed, progress is slow and the slope of the S-curve is gradual. Then, the slope steepens as improved understanding and engineering bring rapid progress. Finally, the slope nearly plateaus as technology has been improved and refined so much that progress slows significantly.

![innovators-dilemma-s-curve-tech.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/innovators-dilemma-s-curve-tech.png)

When a new sustaining technology emerges, the S-curves of the old and the new technologies overlap: The new technology is in the early acceleration stages while the old technology begins to plateau. **The most successful companies transition from the old to the new technology at the moment that the two curves intersect** , shown on the graph. The companies that do this best are the established firms.

![innovators-dilemma-emerging-market.png](https://media.shortform.com/images/innovators-dilemma-emerging-market.png)

However, **when a _disruptive_ technology emerges, its S-curve is on an entirely different graph because, by definition, it serves a different market and exists in a different value network.** At a certain point, once the disruptive technology’s performance has improved enough, it may invade the previously established market and replace the old technology, in which case it would look like these graphs.

### Case Study: How Value Networks Influenced Seagate

Let’s look at how the 5.25-inch drive innovator Seagate’s value network influenced the company’s decision-making as it confronted the emergence of disruptive 3.5-inch disk drives. The development and spread of the disruptive technology breaks down into six steps:

#### **Step 1: Established** F**irms** D**evelop the** T**echnology**

**Established companies often develop disruptive technologies first** —though the projects are typically initiated by engineers, not company leaders—**and entrants are simply at the forefront of bringing the technology to market.**

Example: Seagate was actually among the first firms in the industry to develop 3.5-inch drives, although it wasn’t one of the first to market the drives. Seagate’s engineers had made dozens of prototypes of the 3.5-inch drives by the time company managers finally approved the project. When they got approval, the engineers showed their prototypes to the firm’s marketing team.

#### Step 2: Firms Gauge Customer Interest

When established firms consider developing a disruptive product, they gauge the existing market’s interest in the new technology. **By definition, disruptions aren’t attractive to established customers, and the customers’ negative response typically dissuades companies from proceeding.**

In some cases, executives allow disruptive projects to continue past this stage—but a lack of conviction about the product’s potential undercuts the commitment to the project. As a result, in day-to-day situations, time and resources are diverted to other projects.

Example: Seagate’s marketers showed the drives to customers, who weren’t interested in them because the low-capacity drives didn’t meet their needs. **Based on customers’ feedback, the marketing team created dreary sales forecasts, and company leaders killed the project.**

#### Step 3: Established Firms Double-Down on Sustaining Innovations

Based on customer input, established firms’ **marketing teams not only discourage executives from pursuing disruptive technologies, but they also push for increased effort on _sustaining_ technology to improve existing products.**

Example: Seagate compared the market forecasts for 5.25-inch and 3.5-inch drives. The 5.25-inch models with 60-100 MB capacities were projected to bring in 35-40 percent gross profit margins. On the other hand, the 3.5-inch drives had an unknown profit projection—plus, the company’s existing 20 MB-capacity drives brought merely 25-30 percent gross margins. Using these comparisons, Seagate upped production of new-and-improved 5.25-inch models.

#### Step 4: Startups Form and Find Customers

After leadership at established firms turn away from disruptive projects, frustrated engineers often join entrant firms in pursuing the new technology. The startups face the same struggle as established firms in using the disruptive technology to attract customers in the existing market—but, **unlike established firms, the entrants have no other products to fall back on, so they’re forced to find a market.** Through trial and error, the startups eventually find the emerging markets for their innovations.

Example: Unhappy with managers’ strategies, employees from Seagate and Miniscribe—the two biggest 5.25-inch drive producers—left the established firms to found Conner Peripherals, which ultimately led the industry in 3.5-inch drives. Conner knew that desktop computer makers wouldn’t buy the 3.5-inch drives, so it hit upon the laptop market. The outlook for the laptop market was unclear, but the company had no choice but to try it.

#### Step 5: Disruptive Products Invade the Established Market

**The disruptive technology’s performance improvement progresses up the S-curve until it reaches a level of sophistication that appeals to the customers that previously rejected it.** In addition to dominating in the emerging market, the new technology then invades the old technology’s market.

Example: The capacity improvements for the 3.5-inch drives outpaced what the laptop market needed, and the small drive soon satisfied desktop makers’ needs. With the capacity increase, the 3.5-inch drive’s small size, lower price, and reliability made it _more_ attractive to personal computer makers than the 5.25-inch drives.

#### Step 6: Established Firms Try to Catch Up

**Once the startups begin invading the old technology’s market, established firms make an effort to defend their territory and revive the projects they’d killed** in Step 3. However, the established firms discover that the entrants have a competitive advantage.

Since the entrants developed their disruptive products in a lower value network (the emerging market), they created cost structures that made the product profitable at lower gross margins. The entrants bring their lower cost structures to the established market, which allows them to offer lower prices than the established firms, whose organizations are built around higher cost structures.

Example: When Conner Peripherals began selling its 3.5-inch drives to desktop computer makers, Seagate dusted off its 3.5-inch prototypes. Since Seagate had waited until the disruptive 3.5-inch drives invaded the desktop industry before producing its own models, the company simply sold the smaller drives to its existing customers—cannibalizing its own 5.25-inch sales. Seagate never expanded into the laptop market.

### Predicting Flash Memory’s Fate

Flash memory was developed in the 1980s and threatened to disrupt the disk drive industry. Initially, flash memory attracted customers outside the computer value network, including makers of heart monitors, cell phones, industrial robots, and modems. (Shortform note: Today, flash memory is ubiquitous and is used in solid-state hard drives, smartphones, USB flash drives, and digital cameras.)

True to any disruptive technology, flash memory had immediate advantages and disadvantages compared to disk drive technology. The advantages included:

  * Less than 5 percent of the power consumption of a disk drive with the same capacity
  * More durability in harsh conditions



The disadvantages included:

  * Significantly higher cost-per-megabyte 
  * Shorter lifespan 



The flash card market brought in $45 million in 1993 and $80 million in 1994—and that was projected to jump to $230 million by 1996.

Would flash memory invade the disk drive value network and upend established firms’ dominance? Here’s how each of the theories we discussed would guide predictions.

1) **The Organizational Structure Framework** would categorize flash memory as a radical technology. As such, established firms that were set up to facilitate a different workflow and communication structure than flash memory demanded could only develop flash memory products if they created independent entities to lead the effort.

This held true: Seagate bought a 25 percent equity in SunDisk Corporation (which was later renamed SanDisk) to design and develop the flash memory cards.

2) **The Capabilities Viewpoint** would recognize that, although flash memory used significantly different technology than disk drives, disk drive makers had all the knowledge they needed to succeed. Established firms were experienced in designing technology, buying component parts from suppliers, coordinating products’ assembly, and marketing and selling them. The companies could apply these general capabilities to producing flash memory and competing with startups.

Seagate did, in fact, use its capabilities to go into business with SunDisk, find component suppliers and a manufacturer, and then market the products itself.

3) **The Technology S-Curve Framework** would note that the rate of improvement of disk drive technology had not yet slowed to a point that the S-curve of the new technology’s progress could intersect with the old technology’s S-curve. That means that disk drives were not yet at risk of being replaced by flash memory.

4)**The Value Network Framework** would disregard established firms’ organizational structures and capabilities as reliable predictors of whether the firms would be toppled, and it would disregard the S-curve framework because that only applies to sustained technologies. Instead, the Value Network Framework would predict whether established firms would invest in their own flash memory products based on their customers’ interest.

By the mid-1990s, flash memory couldn’t offer computer makers what they needed, so Seagate pulled its few flash products from the market, though it retained its equity in SunDisk.

#### Outcome of Flash Memory Innovation

The Value Network Framework best predicted established companies’ trajectories in response to flash memory.

Disk drive makers hit a limit on how much they could lower the production cost per drive. **Since low-capacity disk drives had the same cost floor as high-capacity drives, disk drive makers focused on producing high-capacity drives**(around a gigabyte or more), which better served its customers.

This left an opening for flash memory cards to fill the void in the emerging 10-40 megabyte market. Industry experts predicted that a 40 MB flash card and 40 MB disk drive would be around the same price by the time the book was published in 1997.

(Shortform note: Flash memory eventually improved enough to invade an established market and replace hard disks in laptops. Flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) are now in top-performing laptops, including the MacBook Pro and Microsoft Surface.

Although Seagate quickly withdrew its flash products from the market, the company made a wise decision in retaining a stake in SunDisk—in fact, it’s a strategy we’ll talk more about in Part 2. SunDisk was eventually renamed SanDisk, and the company is now one of the top eight vendors in the memory card market worldwide.)
