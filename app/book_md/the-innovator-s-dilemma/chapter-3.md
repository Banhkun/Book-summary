## Chapter 3: Case Study—The Excavator Industry

To illustrate that the principles and impacts of disruptive innovations are universal, now we’ll take a look at a very different industry: excavators. **In contrast to the rapid changes that took hold in the disk drive industry, the disruptive technology we’ll be talking about** —hydraulics to replace cable-operated actions—**took 20 years to take over the excavator market.**

Here’s an overview of the innovations that impacted excavators’ evolution:

  * 1837-1920s: The steam shovel was invented. All mechanical earthmoving equipment was powered by steam.
  * Early 1920s: Gasoline replaced steam. Gasoline-powered equipment was more powerful, reliable, and affordable than almost any steam shovel, with the exception of the biggest ones. Despite the major technological shift, this was a sustaining innovation because it served the same market—just with improved performance—and 23 out of the 25 biggest steam shovel manufacturers successfully switched to gas excavator production. 
  * Late 1920s to 1940s: Several other sustaining innovations followed, including diesel power, electric motors, and a design change that gave the excavators increased reach and flexibility. 
  * 1940s to late 1960s: A disruptive technology emerged—excavators that used hydraulics instead of cables to move the arms and bucket. 



When hydraulic excavators hit the industry, they eventually wiped out nearly all the established manufacturers. In the 1950s, there were about 30 established excavator companies. **By the 1970s, only four established companies had successfully transitioned to hydraulic excavators, and the industry was led by entrant firms**(including companies that are still well-known, such as John Deere and Caterpillar).

### Finding an Emerging Market

During the reign of cable excavators, there were three markets:

  1. General excavation (digging holes for things like basements or canals)
  2. Sewer and piping (digging long trenches) 
  3. Open pit and strip mining



Each market had unique needs—for example, sewer and piping customers needed narrower buckets to dig trenches, while mining customers needed larger bucket capacity to move dirt efficiently. But overall, cable excavators’ most highly valued performance characteristics were:

  1. Reach (how far the arm and bucket could extend)
  2. Bucket capacity (cubic yards of dirt per scoop)



When hydraulic excavators were first developed, they had a fraction of the bucket capacity and reach of cable excavators—insufficient for the needs of any of the cable excavator customers. Hydraulic entrant firms had to find another market, so they adjusted the machines to be mounted on tractors, and they called them backhoes.

Backhoes became the perfect solution for smaller, residential construction jobs. Contractors on these projects previously had to hand-dig narrow ditches for sewer lines, because the job sites and project budgets were too small to bring in full-sized cable excavators. **Hydraulic excavators opened the residential construction market to using excavators for the first time, because they offered attributes that cable excavators couldn’t** , including:

  * Smaller size
  * More affordable price
  * Narrow buckets that were ideal for digging residential sewer trenches
  * Tractor mounts that made them faster and more mobile than traditional excavators on tracks



Not only had hydraulic excavator makers found their market, but they struck it while tract housing construction was booming following World War II and the Korean War.

#### An Established Firm’s Failed Attempt to Adopt Hydraulics

In 1950, a dominant cable excavator manufacturer, Bucyrus Erie, saw hydraulic excavators’ rise and bought a small hydraulic backhoe company. But **instead of entering the emerging residential construction market, Bucyrus created a hydraulic-cable hybrid to market to its existing customers.**

The machine, called the Hydrohoe, used hydraulics to guide the shovel into and through the dirt, but it used cables to lift the bucket. The cables enabled the Hydrohoe to lift bigger loads, which Bucyrus thought would make the machine robust enough for its customers. However, **the Hydrohoe still didn’t have enough capacity or reach for Bucyrus’s customers, so the product languished** on the market for 10 years and the company eventually resumed selling cable excavators.

### Hydraulic Excavators Invade the Established Market

Over time, backhoes improved and significantly increased bucket capacity—from ⅜ cubic yard in 1955 to 10 cubic yards in 1974. **With improved capacity, hydraulic backhoes ascended into the traditional cable excavator market.**

Once hydraulic excavators improved enough to satisfy cable excavators’ customers, the performance attributes that customers valued began to shift. Put another way, now that both models were good enough to get the job done, increased capacity was no longer a competitive advantage.

**With their capacity needs satisfied, customers started making buying decisions based on reliability instead of capacity.** (We’ll talk more about this concept in Chapter 9.) Hydraulic excavators didn’t carry the risk of having a cable snap while carrying a heavy load, so they began to pull ahead of cable excavators.

At this point, established firms’ businesses started to take a hit. Some firms adapted by developing hybrids like the Hydrohoe, but all of them treated hydraulic technology as a _sustaining_ innovation that could improve their products to market to their existing customers. All but four of the companies ultimately failed.

By contrast, the entrant companies had framed hydraulics as a _disruptive_ technology and targeted an emerging market. In other words, the **entrants found a market to match the technology, while the established firms tried to adapt the technology to meet their market.** Even though the disruptive technology eventually entered the traditional market, the entrants had certain advantages because they started in the emerging market and expanded upmarket.

During the two decades that the startups were serving the emerging market, the companies developed expertise in designing, improving, and selling the products. By the time they entered the traditional excavator market, that experience gave them an advantage over the established firms.

#### Excavator Companies Listened to Their Customers—And It Cost Them

Cable excavator manufacturers didn’t fail because hydraulic technology exceeded their capabilities or because they were oblivious about their customers’ needs. Rather, the companies failed because they were tuned into their customers’ needs, and hydraulic excavators didn’t make sense for their customers—and, thus, for their profits. **The established companies had to focus their resources on staying competitive in their market.**

Ironically, these decisions based on the companies’ survival cost many firms their entire businesses. In the next chapter, we’ll talk about how an organization’s past success creates barriers to adopting disruptive innovations.
