## Exercise: Practice Making a Learning-Based Strategy

Use this exercise to practice creating a learning-based strategy for launching a disruptive product.

* * *

Describe a possible disruptive product—feasible or far-fetched.

Imagine you’re creating a strategy for developing, producing, and marketing this product. What information do you currently _lack_ regarding how to execute this project?

What is the information you absolutely _need_ to know in order to execute this project?

Of that information, what do you need to know first?

How could you find that information?
