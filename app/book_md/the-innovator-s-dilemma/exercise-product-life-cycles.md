## Exercise: Product Life Cycles

Your purchasing decisions reveal where a product is in its life cycle.

* * *

What was the last big purchase you made?

What was your primary reason for choosing the product you bought over its competitors? Was it based on performance, reliability, convenience, or price?

If youâ€™ve bought a product like this in the past (for example, if this was a replacement or upgrade), on which attribute did you base that purchase?
