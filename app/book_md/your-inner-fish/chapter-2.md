## Chapter 2: Patterns in Skeletons

The next three chapters of this book show how scientists can trace bones, teeth, the DNA recipe, and the biological process for building organs from early creatures to humans. **These similarities show that the world’s diverse creatures are variations on a theme**.

The human hand first took shape in the fins of primitive fish. This chapter traces the origins of our hands, through fish fossil discoveries in the 1800s, the early 1900s and, finally, in the last several decades by Shubin and his colleagues.

A complex array of bones, muscles, tendons, nerves, and vessels in our hands enables intricate movement—for instance, 10 muscles and six bones working together enable us to twiddle our thumb and tilt our hand. But our hand does more than that—with it, we connect with others through touch and make our thoughts concrete by creating art, music, meals, architecture, and more.

Yet the human hand derives from a pattern common to vastly different animals. In the 1800s, anatomist Sir Richard Owen found that nearly all animals with limbs (wings, flippers, bones, or hands) have the same structural limb design, although the shape and size of the bones vary. In this shared skeletal structure, one bone connects with two, which attach to an array of small knucklebone-type “blobs,” which connect to digits. Owen attributed this pattern to a Creator’s design. However, Charles Darwin argued the skeletal pattern meant that animals share a common ancestor.

In fact, Owen’s one bone-two bones-blobs-digits pattern can be traced back to fish fins.

### From Fins to Limbs

At first glance, fish fins don’t have much in common with human appendages. The base of a fin has four or more bones (not one) and fins consist mostly of webbing.

However, primitive living fish—called lungfish—found in Africa and Australia in the 1800s not only had large vascular sacs (lungs), but also a single bone that connects four fin bones to the fish’s shoulder. A similar fossilized fish from the Devonian period, called _Esuthenopteron,_ had one bone connecting to two fin bones and looked like a cross between a fish and an amphibian.

Discoveries going back further led closer to the origin of fingers and toes:

  * Between 1929-34, a Swedish paleontologist found a fish fossil from the Devonian period on the east coast of Greenland. Called _Ichthyostega soderberghi_ , it had fully developed fingers and toes on its fin-limbs. 
  * Another fossil of a limbed creature, found by the same paleontologist, was a mystery until 1988, when paleontologists found additional fossils of it at the same site showing full limbs with wrists, fingers, and toes but no webbing. 



But it wasn’t until the 2004 discovery of _Tiktaalik_ —a creature with a yet more primitive form of hands, feet, wrists, and ankles—that the sequence for limb development could be put together.

### Wrist Bones in Fish

In 1995, Shubin and colleagues found a 365-million-year-old fin fossil (lacking the rest of the skeleton) in a highway construction area in Pennsylvania. The fin had webbing and scales like a fish but also the bone structure of a limb: one bone at the base, attached to two bones with eight bones extending like fingers. Without a full skeleton, however, researchers couldn’t determine whether it showed the origin of limbs.

That discovery came 10 years later as scientists picked apart rocks containing additional _Tiktaalik_ fossils brought back from the Arctic expedition a year earlier. As they gradually uncovered the fossilized skeletons, they found what looked like a wrist bone with spaces for four other bones; the rest of the appendage consisted of fin webbing containing a limb structure—it was a primitive version of a limb, confirming that _Tiktaalik_ was a transitional creature.

Further analysis of the joint structure suggested the fish was capable of doing a pushup-type of movement the way a human would, with hands flat on the ground, elbows bent, and shoulder and chest muscles moving the body up and down. Scientists concluded **its hand-like fins enabled _Tiktaalik_ to move along the bottom of streams or ponds and flop its way across mudflats**. It may have begun evolving from water to land to escape larger fish predators. _Tiktaalik_ was about four feet long whereas other fish ranged from seven to 16 feet.

### We’ve Come a Long Way

The movements humans make with their hands and wrists are far more complicated than fish pushups. But fish like _Tiktaalik_ carried the pattern or blueprint for our hands and feet, which would continue to develop and be refined over hundreds of millions of years through a progression of fish, amphibians, and reptiles. The basic skeleton emerged in the following stages:

  * The first parts of humans’ upper arm and leg existed in fish like the 380-million-year-old _Eusthenopteron_ found in Quebec, which had the one bone-two bones structure in a fin.
  * The earliest versions of the human wrist, palm, and finger region existed in _Tiktaalik._
  * The first true fingers and toes showed up in 365-million-year-old amphibians like the _Acanthostega_ (also found in Quebec)
  * Our full array of hand and wrist bones appeared in reptiles 250 million years old.



Humans’ deep origins in fish and other earlier creatures don’t detract from our uniqueness—they make our existence that much more incredible. **Our unique form developed from a common blueprint. We’re part of all life, not separate from it.**
