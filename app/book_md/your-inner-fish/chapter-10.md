## Chapter 10: Developing Hearing

The inner workings of the human ear function like a Rube Goldberg machine. However, this chapter explains that while our ears are complex, parts evolved from simpler creatures: reptiles, fish, and sharks (remember gill arches?).

The ear doesn’t look like much from the outside, but the outer appearance belies its complexity. There are three parts: the external ear, the middle ear with three ear bones, and the inner ear made up of nerves, tissue, and gel. While the external ear is a late evolutionary development (the flap is found only in mammals), the middle and inner parts have antecedents in the bone structure of sharks.

### How the Ear Works

In simple terms, the ear works like this:

  * Soundwaves are drawn into the outside cartilage flap, or external ear.
  * They travel into the middle ear and rattle the eardrum.
  * Three small bones attached to the eardrum also shake. One bone is attached to a snail-like bone with a kind of plunger.
  * The plunger goes up and down, moving around the gel in the snail-like structure.
  * The moving gel triggers nerves, which send a signal to the brain. The brain interprets it as sound.



### The Middle Ear

Our middle ear bones betray our connection with sharks and other bony fish.

Mammals have three middle ear bones, reptiles and amphibians have one, and fish don’t have any. Our three middle ear bones are the malleus, incus, and stapes, and they develop from the gill arches. The malleus and incus develop from the first arch, while the stapes develops from the second arch.

#### The Malleus and Incus

In 1827, a German anatomist studying mammal and reptile skulls discovered that two of the ear bones in mammals, the malleus and incus, looked like parts of the jaw in reptiles, indicating that the gill arch that formed part of the jaw in reptiles also formed ear bones in mammals. Thus, parts of reptiles and mammals were the same. This was pre-Darwin when they had no concept of evolution, but the implication was that mammals evolved from reptiles.

In 1913, a paleontologist connected the dots between:

  * The theory that the malleus and incus bones moved from the jaw in reptiles to the ear in mammals.
  * The discovery that dog-sized South African reptiles with mammal-like teeth also had bones at the back of the jaw resembling mammal ear bones. A series of fossils of the evolving reptile showed that these bones in the jaw got progressively smaller over time and moved toward the ear.



Indeed, the malleus and incus in mammals evolved from reptile jawbones. So mammals ended up with three middle-ear bones (remember, reptiles and other animals had only one). Having three enabled mammals to hear higher-frequency sounds. Improved hearing was developed by repurposing bones originally used by reptiles for chewing.

#### The Stapes

While two bones in our middle ear came from reptiles, the third ear bone (the stapes) came from fish.

As noted earlier, the second arch produces the stapes in mammals; the second arch also produces a large bone (hyomandibula) connecting the upper jaw to the brain area of fish and sharks. In both species, these two bones—in the mammal ear and shark jaw—are served by the same second-arch nerve, the facial nerve.

Thus, two very different bones in different animals share a common developmental origin and nerve pattern.

Tracing the hyomandibula from sharks to fish like _Tiktaalik_ to amphibians shows the bone getting progressively smaller and shifting from the upper jaw to the ear (becoming the stapes).

It evolved this way as the first creatures began to live on land and needed to pick up sound vibrations in the air as opposed to in water.

### The Inner Ear

**For the mechanisms of our inner ear, we are also indebted to sharks and fish**.

To understand the connection, it’s first necessary to understand how our hearing works. The inner ear is inside the skull (beyond the eardrum and three middle ear bones) and consists of a snail-like coil of tubes as well as gel-filled sacs. It has different parts for three functions:

  1. Hearing
  2. Balance (which way our head is tilting)
  3. Acceleration (how fast the head is accelerating or stopping)



Here’s how the inner ear works:

  * The parts of the inner ear are filled with gel that moves. 
  * Specialized nerve cells extend hair-like projections into the gel. 
  * When the gel moves, the hairs bend and send a signal to the brain that’s interpreted as sound, position, or acceleration. 



#### Position

The inner ear is somewhat like a snow globe with a flexible case that moves or flops when the snow globe is tipped, sloshing the inside gel around. When we bend our heads, like tipping the globe, the gel membrane in our inner ear flops around and moves the gel.

Registering our position involves rock-like structures on top of the gel membrane (the floppy case) that move when the head is tilted. The rocks accentuate the movement or flopping of the membrane, allowing us to sense small differences in position.

#### Acceleration

We perceive acceleration through three gel-filled tubes inside the ear that move when our body accelerates or stops, causing the nerve cell projections to bend in a simulated wave.

Our position and acceleration mechanisms are both connected to eye muscles that help keep us looking in the same direction even when our head moves. (For instance, if you look at a point on this page while moving your head back and forth, your eyes stay focused on the same point.)

When you drink too much alcohol, you throw off the inner ear balancing system, which makes you tipsy or feel like you’re moving when you aren’t. When alcohol moves from the bloodstream to our inner ear gel, it sort of floats in the gel because it’s lighter, which swishes the gel around and makes the brain think you’re moving when you aren’t. The brain passes this information to your eye muscles, making your eyes twitch (a sign police look for when pulling over suspected drink drivers).

The alcohol in the inner ear eventually dissipates by moving back into the bloodstream, which gets the gel moving again—so you continue to feel off-balance or have a hangover the next day (although your eyes twitch in the opposite direction).

#### Motion Sensing and Balance

Our ability to balance and sense motion likely traces back to fish like **trout, which have a primitive version of the human inner ear that enables them to sense the water’s current.**

Trout have lines along their bodies of small organs with sensory receptors under their skin. The receptors poke hairline projections into gel-filled sacs called neuromasts. As water moves around the fish, the gel sacs or neuromasts change shape and the hairs send a signal to the brain telling the fish how fast the water is moving. Thus, trout can hold still in fast-moving water.

The similarity between neuromasts and inner ears again shows that **organs developed for one function can be repurposed.**

Mammals expanded and evolved the inner ear to hear better than amphibians and reptiles. Also, modern fish and other vertebrates improved the sense of acceleration by developing three ear tubes compared to one in primitive fish.

While our inner ear can be traced to fish, the specialized neurons in the gel go back even further. These neurons have a long hairlike projection along with smaller ones, and they have a fixed orientation in our inner ear and a fish’s neuromasts. These neurons have been found in animals lacking sense organs and even heads, like the worm _amphioxus_ described in Chapter 5.

### Genetic Origins

Genes also reveal the ear’s long history. A gene known as _Pax 2_ directs inner ear formation in mice and humans. (Mice that have a mutated version have malformed inner ears.) It’s also active in fish neuromasts—pointing to a common gene shared by fish and humans.

#### The Origins of Eyes and Ears

Further, genetic evidence suggests our eyes and ears have a common history.

There is a link between the _Pax 2_ gene for ear formation and the _Pax 6_ gene described in Chapter 9 for eye formation. The gene that forms eyes in box jellyfish (they can have more than 20 eyes all over their body) appears to incorporate aspects of both _Pax 2_ and _Pax 6_.

Thus, the major genes dictating the formation of our eyes and ears correspond to a single gene in a primitive creature. This may help explain why many human birth defects affect both the eyes and the inner ear.
