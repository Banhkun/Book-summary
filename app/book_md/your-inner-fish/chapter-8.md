## Chapter 8: Developing a Sense of Smell

Humans, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish share the same basic system for detecting odors, which, like our other systems, has ancient origins. Drawing on both paleontology and DNA research, this chapter shows how **we can trace our sense of smell to its start in primitive fish**.

Humans can detect 5,000 to 10,000 different odors, as the brain responds to a host of molecules suspended in the air. Here’s how it works.

As we breathe, we pull odor molecules into the nose, where they’re trapped in the mucous lining in a patch of tissue with millions of nerve cells. The nerve cells bind to the air molecules and send signals to the brain, which identifies them as a smell. Each air molecule connects with a receptor in the nose that’s tuned to that type of molecule. A particular odor involves many different molecules and therefore many different receptors sending signals to the brain. An odor is like a chord made up of different notes with one combined sound. The brain reads combined receptor signals as one smell.

In humans, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, the sense of smell is handled in the skull. We all have one or more nostrils for pulling in air molecules (or water molecules, in the case of fish), and then tissues where the air connects with neurons. There’s a basic pattern in the evolution of this system (nostrils, spaces, membrane) traceable from fish to humans.

Jawless fish such as lampreys and hagfish have a nostril that draws water molecules inside to a sac in the skull where smelling takes place (they have an external and an internal nostril). Other fish have a system more like ours where water instead of air travels from a nostril to a cavity connected with the mouth.

### The Odor Genes

In addition to having nasal structures for pulling air molecules, we rely on genes to help identify odors.

In 1991, researchers identified a large family of genes that create our sense of smell. They made three assumptions, which proved to be correct: that human genes for smell resemble the odor genes in mice, that the genes are active only in the tissues associated with smell, and that a large number of genes are involved with smelling.

They determined that **3% of the human genome is involved in detecting odors** , which is a lot for one function. Each of these genes creates a receptor for an odor molecule. Other researchers found odor receptor genes in other species, which helped trace the transition in animals from sensing smell in water molecules to sensing it in air molecules.

Lampreys and hagfish have receptors that can handle both water and air molecules, indicating they emerged before the odor-detecting genes split into the two types, for water and air. These fish also have a fairly small number of odor genes.

The number of odor genes in animals increased over time (humans and mammals have over 1,000)—apparently, as animals became more complex, so did the sense of smell. The more odor genes an animal has, the greater its ability to detect different odors. Mammals (think tracking dogs) are extremely specialized smellers.

But the additional odor genes in mammals seem to be modified copies of the small number in primitive fish. This means **our odor genes are variations on a theme—arising from generations of duplication of the fish odor genes**. But despite devoting a significant proportion of our genes to smelling, 300 of our odor genes have become useless due to mutations.

### Clues from Dolphins and Primates

Dolphins and whales provide clues for why so many human odor genes don’t work. Because they’re mammals, dolphins and whales have the same large number of odor genes as do mammals that smell air molecules. But dolphins and whales don’t use their sense of smell—instead, they use their nasal passages for their breathing blowhole. None of their odor genes work.

Apparently, because dolphins and whales don’t use their sense of smell, their odor genes mutated over generations until they became useless. Nonetheless, the genes continue to be passed to the next generation, as can happen with mutations that aren’t harmful.

Humans have some nonworking odor genes because we traded smell for sight: we evolved to rely on vision more than smell for finding food and avoiding predators, so many of our olfactory genes lost their function.

Illustrating this, research shows that primates that developed color vision had large numbers of nonfunctioning smell genes.

Comparing olfactory systems shows how closely different animals are related because olfactory genes change the more they’re copied. **The more alike two species’ odor genes are, the more closely they’re related.** Our olfactory genes are most like those of primates, then mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and lastly, fish.
