## Chapter 7: The How and Why of Bodies

Cells have mechanisms for communicating, sticking together to create specific materials like bone, and trading proteins. Without these abilities, cells couldn’t build bodies. These mechanisms predated the various body plans and patterns we can trace back through DNA and fossils.

They raise key questions about bodies beyond their design:

  * **What** is a body in the first place?
  * **When** did bodies first appear?
  * **How** did they come about? 
  * **Why** did they come about?



This chapter explores these questions by tracing the development of bones, examining simple bodies such as sponges, and looking at life forms without bodies—all of which provide clues to the construction of human bodies.

### _What_ Is a Body?

Not every clump of cells or bacteria working together constitutes a body. Bodies have several defining characteristics:

  * The parts work together to create a greater whole.
  * Some parts are necessary for life—for instance, if you remove cells from vital organs, the body would die.
  * The parts (brain, heart, stomach, and so on) have different functions.
  * The division of labor extends down to the smallest components: genes, cells, and proteins.
  * Unlike the parts, the body has an identity: Skin cells are continually being replaced, but even though they change out, you’re still the same individual.
  * Also, even though some cells die and are replaced, the body maintains a balance. When the balance breaks down—when cells break the rules and keep growing, for instance—the body can become diseased or die.



But our complex bodies stretch back to a point in time where single-celled organisms became primitive bodies by developing mechanisms for cells to attach together, communicate, and make things like molecules.

### _When_ Did Bodies Appear?

Bodies with advanced features like hands and sense organs haven’t been around all that long. Life consisted of single-celled organisms for much of Earth’s 4.5-billion-year history. If that history were compressed into a calendar year, single-celled organisms (like algae and bacteria) would be the only life until June. Animals with heads would show up in October and the first human would appear on December 31.

Rocks illustrate this immense time scale: those older than 600 million years show evidence only of colonies of algae, which are far from being bodies. In the 1920s and ‘30s, paleontologists found evidence of possibly the earliest bodies but didn’t realize what they were. The impressions looked like disks and plates—they may have been primitive algae or jellyfish.

Scientists found more impressions of disks, ribbons, and fronds in Australia in 1947. But they didn’t understand until the 1960s, when the rocks were accurately dated, that the impressions were of some of the earliest bodies. Some resembled today’s simple sponges and jellyfish; others were unlike anything that existed.

So multicellular creatures lived in the seas 600 million years ago. Some bodies had symmetrical patterns or specialized structures that, for instance, gave them the ability to move. The rocks showed evidence of scrapes or paths of movement.

### _How_ Did Bodies Come About? — Part 1

To explain how bodies came about, we’ll look first at how cells combine to form tissues in the body. Part 2 looks at the first primitive bodies to form this way.

Although these early Precambrian creatures look nothing like humans, **they were made of the same type of “glue” (collagen and proteoglycan) that allows human body cells to stick together** to build materials and organs. In our bodies, this glue is a mix of molecules that differs depending on the organ it’s forming—for instance, a bone versus an eye. Without the molecule mix attaching cells to each other, bodies couldn’t be formed.

Bones are an example of how the molecular glue works. Bones, like bridges made of steel or cables, get their strength from their components, which are designed to withstand force but also be somewhat flexible. The balance of strength and flexibility, as well as proportions, of the skeleton allows the bodies of humans, frogs, rabbits, and horses to run and jump in specialized ways.

The properties and molecular structure of the materials, which hold bone tissues together, are also important.

#### Molecular Structure

Examining bones by microscope shows how they’re structured. Some cells fit closely together while others have space between them. The space between cells contains minerals such as hydroxyapatite (also in teeth), which acts like concrete—strong when compressed but less so when twisted. The space also contains collagen molecules, ropelike bundles of fibers that are strong like rope when pulled. (Collagen is our body’s most common protein.)

Another skeleton tissue, cartilage, cushions bones that move against each other. It’s a softer, more flexible material that bends under pressure but springs back into shape. Cartilage has space between its cells, which are filled by collagen and a molecule called a proteoglycan complex that absorbs water to help cartilage pad joints.

The amounts of the different materials make bones, cartilage, and teeth different.

  * Teeth are hard because they have more hydroxyapatite and less collagen between cells
  * Bone has more collagen and less hydroxyapatite
  * Cartilage has a lot of collagen, as well as proteoglycans, but no hydroxyapatite



Skeletons, whether in humans or animals, function as designed when these molecules are distributed in the proper proportions.

Like humans and animals, the earliest creatures with bodies—even those that lacked skeletons or were only clumps of cells—had molecules or collagen and proteoglycans between cells. This means primitive creatures had to find ways to: make these materials, further glue cells together, and enable cells to communicate.

#### How Cells Stick Together

Bodies use different methods of connecting cells. Bone cells stick together by using various types of molecular rivets. Some work like contact cement, gluing the outsides of two cells together. Other rivets connect only to cells with the same kind of rivet, a mechanism that enables cells to organize and ensures that bone cells stick to bone cells, skin cells stick to skin cells, and so on.

In the lab, cells put in a dish will sort and organize themselves according to the numbers and types of rivets they have.

#### How Cells Communicate

To make the pattern of our skeleton and the rest of the body, cells must communicate so they know when to divide, make molecules, and die. If they acted randomly—for instance, making the wrong amounts or type of bone or skin, we would die.

**Cells communicate by sending out molecules with messages.** A cell sends a signal or molecule, which attaches to the outside of a receiving cell. This sets off a chain reaction of molecules within the cell moving the message from the outer membrane to the nucleus. As a result, the cell receiving the information changes its behavior: it divides, makes new molecules, or dies.

In summary, all animals with bodies have molecules like collagen and proteoglycans between cells; the molecules have rivets so they can stick together and their cells communicate by sending molecules back and forth. This is how cells create body structures like the skeleton.

### _How_ Did Bodies Come About? — Part 2

Now that we know the materials and mechanisms that make bodies possible, the next challenge is identifying the first bodies to employ the mechanisms of cell attachment and communication. It turns out **you can find connecting molecules in the most primitive bodies and even in life forms lacking bodies: microbes.**

#### Placozoans

In the 1880s, employees at an aquarium found a live blob, now known as a _placozoan_ , on the glass of a fish tank. It’s a creature even simpler than some of the fossil impressions of disks and plates found in Australia in the 1940s.

A _placozoan_ has a plate-shaped body with only four types of cells. Though simple, it has features of a body: division of labor among cells (movement, digestion), rivet connections, and communication ability.

#### Sponges

An even more primitive example of an early body is a sponge, which has cells that communicate and function as a whole, division of labor, and also collagen with molecular rivets.

The body of a sponge is actually a non-living structure of silica or calcium carbonate with collagen interspersed. Sponges have two kinds of collagens, compared to 21 in humans.

A sponge’s cells are clues to the origin of bodies. The inside of a sponge is a space divided into compartments. Cells shaped like goblets direct water through the sponge, using flagellum that they wave in tandem. Goblets also use tiny arms to catch food in the water, which other cells process. Other cells can contract and change the sponge’s shape in response to changing water currents.

The way a sponge functions, with different cells having different tasks, is a primitive version of the way cells divide labor in the human body.

#### Microbes

_Placozoans_ and sponges have an even more primitive relative, a single-celled microbe called a _choanoflagellate_ that has features connecting it to creatures with bodies and ultimately to humans.

_Choanoflagellates_ look similar to the goblet cells in sponges—but while they look somewhat like primitive sponges, their DNA is actually more similar to microbes, making them a link between single-celled microbes and organisms with bodies like sponges.

Further, they have molecules that could be used for cell adhesion or communication. Microbes that specialize in invading other cells also have primitive versions of collagen and proteoglycan.

### _Why_ Did Bodies Come About?

As microbes were the only life forms in the first 3.5 billion years of Earth’s history, the potential to build bodies was there long before bodies actually appeared. **There are several theories for _why_ bodies appeared in the first place**.

One theory is that microbes learned to band together to avoid being eaten by bigger microbes. Perhaps they transformed the molecules they used to catch and hold onto prey into molecules that make cells stick together.

Researchers did an experiment to test this predator explanation for body formation. They grew a batch of single-celled algae, then introduced a predator that ate single-celled microbes. The algae clumped together, eventually settling into eight-cell groups, large enough to avoid capture, but small enough that each cell could absorb enough light to survive. A simple multicellular organism thus formed from a single-celled organism lacking a body.

If predators explain why bodies appeared, it also raises the question of what took them so long to develop. The answer may be that it couldn't happen until the environment provided the amount of oxygen the microbes needed to produce collagen molecules. There was a spike in oxygen levels about a billion years ago that may have been the trigger for microbes to begin forming bodies.

In summary, the answers to the key questions of how bodies developed are:

  * **When** : 600 million years ago.
  * **How** : Cells stuck together through molecular rivets and communicated by sending molecular messengers.
  * **Why** : Bodies allowed microbes to enlarge themselves to avoid predators.
