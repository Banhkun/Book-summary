## Introduction

Many people dream of quitting a job or boss they dislike and becoming their own boss by starting a business. Each year, a million new businesses are started. However, 40 percent fail within the first year and 80 percent fail within five years. Of those that last five years, more than 80 percent fail in the next five.

Underlying the failure rate are persistent romantic notions about how businesses are born and what it takes to succeed. In _The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don’t Work and What to Do About it_ , Michael E. Gerber explains how wrong beliefs and assumptions undermine new businesses and how to overcome them and succeed.

Succeeding in a new business starts with understanding these driving forces:

  * **The Entrepreneurial Myth** : The myth is that most businesses are started by entrepreneurs with business knowledge, who come up with an innovative idea and take the risk of investing in it in hopes of making a profit. In fact, entrepreneurship isn’t the reason most businesses are started. They’re started because people who are good at something believe their technical skills are a ticket to success and they start a business on those skills alone. Acquiring business knowledge gets left out of the equation.
  * **The Growth of Franchises** : Since the launch of McDonald’s in the sixties, corporations selling “turn-key” franchises along with training to would-be small business owners has become a highly successful alternative to taking the risks of starting a business from scratch. 
  * **The Business Development Process** : The business development process at the center of the franchise movement serves as a useful model for the development of an independent business or transformation of an existing business. Any small business owner can apply it in a step-by-step, predictable way to achieve results.



The typical small business owner — a technician — works too hard, too long for the return she’s getting. She’s overworked and exhausted because she’s focused on the wrong work — technical work. As a result, the business that started as a dream becomes overwhelming and the work a grind.

This book is about starting a successful business or turning your business around if you’re struggling. The process starts with changing yourself. For your business to change, you must change first because your business is a reflection of who you are, including your limitations.

The first thing to change is your understanding of what a business is and what makes a business work.
