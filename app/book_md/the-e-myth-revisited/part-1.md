## Part I: The Small Business Trajectory

### Chapter 1: The Myth of the Entrepreneur

Most people believe the Myth of the Entrepreneur, which is that new businesses are started by entrepreneurs who spot opportunities for making a profit and risk capital for an ultimate payoff.

**However, most small businesses aren’t started by sharp-eyed entrepreneurs. They’re started by people like you, struck by the idea of becoming your own boss**. Usually, you’re doing technical work and something triggers the thought of going it alone and doing the same work for yourself rather than for someone else. For instance, you might suddenly get fed up with the demands or feel your talents and efforts are unappreciated. So whether you’re a hairstylist, pet groomer, plumber, or technical writer, you start your own business.

**You erroneously assume that your ability to make something or do something well will translate into business success** — that what a business does and how it works are the same thing. But technical knowledge isn’t enough. It can even be a liability if you think you already know everything you need to know. Running a business requires a different mindset from that of a technician and a broader set of skills.

As a technically oriented small business owner, you jump in with both feet, enthusiastically working around the clock, but eventually, your labor of love becomes drudgery, a lot like the drudgery of the job you left. The small business that you thought would liberate you has become a job — one that’s taken over your life — and you end up tired and disillusioned.

### Chapter 2: A Small Business Owner’s Three Roles

The problem is that you’ve focused too narrowly on one role. A small business owner needs to cultivate and balance three roles or mindsets, all of which are necessary for running a business. The first is the technician mindset, which, as noted, often prompts you to start a business but by itself is insufficient to maintain a business. The other roles are those of the entrepreneur and the manager.

Two of them — technician and manager — may be delegated as the business grows, but in the beginning, the owner must apply and balance all three. The three roles or mindsets may compete to dominate the business owner’s actions, the way your desire to indulge in eating a favorite snack may compete with your desire to stay trim and fit.

Here are the key characteristics of each role. They can be both strengths and, if taken too far, drawbacks.

#### Entrepreneur

**The entrepreneur role provides the vision, creativity, and energy that drive the business.** The entrepreneur is always thinking of the future. He likes to consider what-if scenarios, envisioning strategies, new ways of doing things, and ways to create or reach new markets. The entrepreneur’s desire for change can frustrate those wanting stability or a consistent direction. He may come to view such people as obstacles who need to be pushed or pulled along. The entrepreneur also has a strong need for control.

#### Manager

**The manager is a pragmatist who uses planning and systems to create order and predictability**. She strives to maintain the status quo. Her mindset conflicts with the entrepreneur’s in that she sees problems rather than opportunities and her pragmatism counters the entrepreneur’s desire for innovation.

#### Technician

**The technician is an individualist and a doer.** He prefers to do things himself to ensure that they’re done right. With his focus on getting things done, he lives in the present. He likes to be in control of his workflow and to work on one thing at a time. He distrusts managers because they push for more than is reasonable (more than can be done right) and they get in the way. This mindset conflicts with that of the entrepreneur, who keeps interrupting with changes, and with the mindset of the manager, who tries to impose a system.

A small business needs all three mindsets working in harmony, and an owner possesses all three to varying degrees. Typically, however, a small business owner is 70 percent technician, 20 percent manager, and 10 percent entrepreneur. Running a business with mostly a technician mindset is a mistake for reasons that are explained in the next chapter.

**Be aware of which mindset dominates your thinking and which hat you spend most of your time wearing.** Your business mirrors your strongest tendency. But to succeed, you need to master all three.

In addition to understanding the three roles of a business owner, it’s important to understand where your business is in the typical life cycle of a small business. There are three phases: infancy, adolescence, and maturity. Each has various characteristics and risks.

### Chapter 3: The Infancy Phase

**In the infancy phase, the owner wears the technician hat**. The business is driven not by what it needs, but by what the owner wants. In the infancy phase, you (the owner/technician) want a place to work as you see fit, free of constraints.

For a while, you’re happy functioning on your own. You don’t mind working fourteen hours a day, every day, because you’re used to “paying your dues,” and besides, this work is for your own business. You’re willing to do whatever it takes to keep the business afloat — doing the technical work plus buying, selling, shipping, ordering, and keeping the books. **At this stage, you _are_ the business. **Your name may even be part of your business’s name (for example, Joe’s Place).

Customers appreciate your work and keep patronizing the business. But the volume of work soon exceeds your capacity to get it all done. You work harder but start having problems keeping up. Your business has taken over your life; it’s become your boss — a boss who can’t be satisfied. You have a job that’s even worse than the one you left. You may begin feeling hopeless and disillusioned. **At this point, many businesses fail — the exhausted owner/technician gives up.**

The problem is that you’ve neglected your roles as entrepreneur and manager. You’ve been taking solely a tactical approach focused on the work that needs to be done, rather than also taking a strategic view that would move the business forward. Part of a business owner’s role — the entrepreneurial part — is to grow the business. That role is often absent during a business’s infancy stage, as is the manager role responsible for ensuring things run smoothly.

One reason you focus on your role as technician, at the expense of your other roles, is that you enjoy doing the technical work more than entrepreneurial or management work. But a more subtle reason is that you may be unable, at this stage, to separate yourself from your business. It’s your name on the sign outside. You take pride in your work and like that customers depend on you personally to deliver your product. Further, you can’t imagine what your business would look like if you _weren’t_ the one doing the work. But when you are your business and your business is you, you can’t get sick or take a vacation, and your business can’t grow.

Your business won’t succeed if you play or fulfill just one role because it’s the one you’re most comfortable with. You need to learn all three: creating a vision (entrepreneur), translating your vision into action through systems and processes (manager), and getting the work done (technician). **When you balance all three, the business becomes energizing and rewarding rather than draining**.

### Chapter 4: The Adolescent Phase

If you don’t give up in the infancy stage due to overwork, you move into the adolescent phase with the idea of hiring some help. You typically look for another technician, preferably with experience in the same field.

Also, you might look for someone with experience doing the things you don’t like doing — for instance, bookkeeping, ordering supplies, or maintaining a schedule. In fact, if you’re like most overworked owners, if you can find an experienced person, you’re happy to give up responsibility for those areas, in effect abdicating rather than delegating. You start enjoying shorter hours and less grunt work without giving much thought to what your employee is doing as long as things seem to go smoothly.

However, without your oversight, problems start to develop and mistakes are made — for instance, you don’t have supplies when you need them or the quality of your product slips and customers get upset. **So you jump back in again (into your comfort zone) and start doing things yourself so they’re done right, instead of developing the managerial and entrepreneurial skills that would advance your business.**

### Chapter 5: Crisis Point

In the adolescent phase, your business always reaches a point beyond your comfort zone, at which you begin to feel you’re losing control. Business owners typically go one of three directions at this point: they shrink the business in size (return to the infancy stage), keep growing willy-nilly (go all out), or go into survival mode.

#### Back to Square One

When you have a technician mindset and hit the crisis point, you’ll be inclined to try to go back to the way things used to be, when having fewer customers, fewer bills, and fewer employees meant things were less complicated. You can get rid of some of the problems of growth this way, but when you go back to doing everything yourself, you’ll soon be overloaded again. Things will deteriorate and, like 400,000 small business owners in the U.S. each year, you’ll throw in the towel.

#### Growing Willy-Nilly

An alternative to shrinking is to go all out as fast and as far as you can. This is a common approach in the technology sector. Tech companies started by technician/owners who have a good idea tend to stay focused on what they’re producing, rather than on running a business. This looks deceptively promising — they usually build momentum, until they crash due to a weak underlying business foundation.

If you go all out, your problems will be magnified by the pace of growth — demand ultimately will exceed your production capacity — and your business will collapse. A brilliant idea and rapid growth by themselves can’t sustain a business, although you may be able to walk away with some cash.

#### Survival Mode

The third possibility, also unpalatable, is that you soldier on and survive for a time by pushing yourself and your employees to the extreme. But when you become consumed by your business, you’ll inevitably reach a personal breaking point.

Business owners have a better alternative to shrinking, growing uncontrollably, or entering survival mode: productive change.

#### Productive Change: Learning New Skills

Productive change requires leaving your comfort zone and developing new identities (manager and entrepreneur) by learning new skills.

Businesses are destined to grow — what usually holds them back are the owner’s limitations in skill, knowledge, and, most importantly, passion for learning and for the business. As your business grows, you need to grow personally.

When you decide to shrink or go back to square one, you’re reacting to changes you could have anticipated and planned for, had you learned business skills to accompany your technical skills. For instance, you could have predicted that customers would like your product and, therefore, that your business would grow. You could have predicted the result of failing to be involved in the work of your employees. You could have predicted that a growing business would require learning new skills. Your job is larger than that of a technician — it’s to prepare yourself to grow your business.

You do this by understanding business processes, having clear objectives for yourself and your business, and developing a plan for getting there. This includes deciding at the outset how you want your business to grow by answering questions like:

  * “What are my goals, and how quickly do I plan to reach them?”
  * “How much capital will I need to reach my goals?”
  * “How many people do I need to hire, and what work will they do?”
  * “How much space will I need in 6 months? In 2 years? In 10 years?”



By following the right process, you can build a business that works because of the way you designed it, not because of what you do each day to keep it going. In other words, you can build a business that works without you rather than one that enslaves you.

### Chapter 6: The Mature Phase

Businesses can grow from infancy and adolescence to maturity, in which they have a clear sense of purpose and direction. But the most successful companies start out differently, already knowing where they’re going and how. Maturity isn’t a phase for these companies — they’re mature from the outset.

The entrepreneurs who started companies like McDonald’s and Federal Express had an entrepreneur’s mindset. They understood what businesses are and how they work. In addition to business knowledge, they had clear objectives and a plan.

For example, when Tom Watson founded IBM, he knew several things: He had a clear vision of what the company would look and act like, and he knew that to become a great company IBM would have to act like one from the start. He created a template for a great company and worked daily to match the company to the model. He focused on developing the business rather than “doing business.”

#### The Entrepreneurial Mindset

When you build a business from an entrepreneur’s perspective, you focus on the business and how it works as opposed to what it does. However, most people start businesses from a technician’s perspective, focused on the work rather than on the business.

Other differences between the two perspectives are:

  * The entrepreneur begins with a vision of the future, then works to align the present with that vision. The technician focuses on the present and hopes the future will be much the same.
  * The entrepreneur is outwardly focused on meeting customer needs and making a profit. The technician is inwardly focused on the business as a place to work and earn an income.
  * The entrepreneur sees the business as a whole, while the technician sees separate parts.
  * The entrepreneur asks how the business should work, while the technician wants to know what needs to be done.



#### The Entrepreneurial Business Model

The entrepreneur uses a business development model with measurable steps. The business itself has a guiding vision and a defined structure and it functions by principles and rules. The business is an aggregation of parts that work together systematically to produce the intended result.

The business model of a technician-run business is created day by day. The vision is narrow, focusing on the work and the present, with no sense of where the business is headed.

The two models begin at different points. The entrepreneur starts with a particular customer in mind rather than with an idea for a business. She looks for an opportunity to provide something a specific customer wants and that no one else offers, in a unique way. **The result is a business designed based on the customer’s needs.** The entrepreneur understands that the customer’s needs will continue to change, which provides the business with ongoing opportunities to fulfill needs.

By contrast, the technician’s starting point is to satisfy herself by doing what she wants to do. She views the customer as a problem because he’s never satisfied.

A small business owner needs to break away from her technical side and employ her entrepreneurial instincts to create and activate an entrepreneurial model for a business that works effectively. The franchise movement provides that business model.
