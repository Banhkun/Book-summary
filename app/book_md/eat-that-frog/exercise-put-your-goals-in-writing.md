## Exercise: Put Your Goals in Writing

Before you can identify your most important task and jump into it, you need to know your goals and what actions will contribute the most to reaching them.

* * *

List five things you want to accomplish. To make them more real, write them in the present tense as though youâ€™ve already achieved them (example: I weigh xxx pounds by this date).

From your list of five goals, pick the one whose achievement would make the biggest difference in your life. Set a deadline for achieving it.

Make a list of what you would have to do to achieve the goal. Prioritize and organize the list into a plan.

What step or action can you take each day this week to move toward this goal?
