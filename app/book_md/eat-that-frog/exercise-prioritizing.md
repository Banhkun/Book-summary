## Exercise: Prioritizing

According to the 80/20 rule, 20% of your effort produces 80% of your results. Focusing on the few most important things will have the greatest impact, yet most people focus on the “trivial many” (the 80%).

* * *

Take a look at your tasks and activities for today or tomorrow. Which tasks are you most inclined to do first and why?

What are the likely results of these tasks?

Which few tasks, if you focused on them, could bring the most (80% of) results? How would you feel at the end of the day if you got those things done?

How would focusing on those few things first change your day?
