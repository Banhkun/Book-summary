## Chapter 11: Build Your Skills

**Continually upgrading your skills is one of the most important ways to increase your productivity and advance your career**. Determine what you need to learn in order to do your job better and then learn it.

Developing your skills has multiple benefits:

  * It gives you confidence and motivation to plunge into challenging tasks without hesitation and get them done.
  * It enables you to avoid procrastination. A major reason for procrastinating is feeling inadequate in a key area. Weakness in one area can be enough to keep you from starting a task.
  * **Upgrading your skills is a time saver. The better you are at something, the faster you are at getting it done**. One additional skill or piece of information can make a big difference in how well you can do something
  * It will advance your career. To keep your job and to advance, you need to continually upgrade your skills in your key result areas. You can always expand your knowledge, and no matter how much you know today, your skills and knowledge are in the process of becoming obsolete.



Identify your most important tasks and capabilities, then draw up a plan to continually upgrade your skills in these areas. You can learn anything—from typing and computer proficiency to specialized knowledge in your field. Learning should be a priority. Basketball coach Pat Riley said, “Anytime you stop striving to get better, you’re bound to get worse.”

You can take courses and workshops, or earn certifications and advanced degrees in your field. But there are also several ways to make learning part of your routine:

1) **Read about your field or industry daily**. Also, read books and articles about personal development and productivity.

2) **Take courses and seminars** addressing skills you need. Attend conferences and business meetings of your profession or occupation.

3) **Listen to audio programs in your car**. The average driver spends 500 to 1,000 hours a year on the road. Use this time to learn.

You build mental muscle or brain power by using your brain—so the more you learn, the more you expand your capacity to learn. The only limits to how far you can go are the limits of your imagination.
