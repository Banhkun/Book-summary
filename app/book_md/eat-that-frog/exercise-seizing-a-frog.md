## Exercise: Seizing a Frog

Author Brian Tracy argues that the key to success is developing the habit of getting your most important task done first. It’s like eating a live frog—if you do it right away, everything after that is easy by comparison.

Think of a big, important task you have been procrastinating on doing. What is it? What effect has your procrastination had?

How can you apply the three steps—decide, discipline yourself, and practice—to get it done tomorrow?
