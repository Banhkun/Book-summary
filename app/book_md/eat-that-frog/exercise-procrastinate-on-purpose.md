## Exercise: Procrastinate on Purpose

Most people procrastinate unconsciously and end up putting off the most important things. Instead, you should intentionally procrastinate on things of little importance so you can get the big things done.

* * *

Think about your tasks and responsibilities for today or this week. What small tasks can you put off doing now? Which ones can you eliminate entirely or delegate?

How did these low-value activities get onto your agenda in the first place? How can you keep tasks like this off your list in the future?

By abandoning these tasks, what task with significant long-term consequences can you complete today/this week instead?
