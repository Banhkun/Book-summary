## Chapter 12: Identify Your Biggest Limitation

**In every effort, there’s always a major constraint or limitation that hinders your progress on completing your task or achieving your goal**.

It can be internal or external. It can even be personal—everyone has limiting factors.

There are always multiple factors creating friction, but one is greater than the others.

**It’s critical to identify the constraint that’s holding you, your project, or the company back.** Removing it will make a bigger difference in how quickly you achieve your goal than almost anything else you do.

Potential bottlenecks can be:

**1)** **External** : Outside factors affecting your ability to accomplish your goal include competitors, the market, customers, and the government. For instance, customers may have a false perception of your product that's hindering sales. An external factor will turn out to be your biggest constraint only about 20% of the time.

**2) Internal** : 80% of the time, your biggest constraint will be internal. It may be a person whose help you need or who has to sign off on an aspect of the process. It could be a key resource that’s lacking or an organizational weakness, such as an inadequate marketing or sales effort. Other potential internal limitations are cash flow and operational problems.

**3) Personal** : Everyone has limitations affecting the pursuit of their tasks and goals, but one factor will predominate. To succeed, you need to **honestly examine yourself by asking what personal quality or knowledge or performance gap is holding you back** ; what keeps you from accomplishing important tasks?

Your primary constraint may not be obvious at first glance. Make a list of every step in the process and every activity, then analyze them to determine what’s holding you back.

It’s important to accurately identify the major issue, so that you choose the right strategy to eliminate it and restore progress toward your goal. Focusing on a lesser factor instead of the one that’s hindering you the most will be a waste of time and a diversion.

For instance, one company attributed lagging sales to its sales staff and management, and the company restructured the whole department in response. But this tactic failed to improve sales because the major constraint holding back sales was incorrect pricing, not the sales staff. Once they focused on the right thing, sales took off again.

Once you fix the biggest constraint, you may find another that’s now the biggest. Identify and remove each as you find it. Removing the most consequential bottlenecks will motivate and energize you to push your task to completion.

Removing a limiting factor may be your most important task—or frog to eat—at the moment.
