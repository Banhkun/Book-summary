## Exercise: Be an Optimist

What you tell yourself about setbacks determines whether they motivate or discourage you. Choose to be an optimist. Respond positively to whatever happens. Optimists are more successful in most areas of life.

What was the worst or most frustrating thing that happened at work this week? How did it turn out?

How did you react to it? What did you tell yourself about the situation, and how did this make you feel about it?

Whatâ€™s a different message or attitude you could have chosen instead? What lesson can you derive from the situation?
