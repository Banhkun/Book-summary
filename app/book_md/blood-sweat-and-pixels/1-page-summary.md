## 1-Page Summary

Video games are meant to be fun, but _making_ video games can be anything but. In _Blood, Sweat, and Pixels_ , video game journalist Jason Schreier gives a rare look into the inner workings of the video game industry and the harsh reality of being a game developer: long hours, enormous pressure to meet deadlines, and an unpredictable, constantly changing work environment.

Schreier discusses the development cycles of 10 games, ranging from indie darlings to AAA flops, as told by developers whom Schreier interviewed. He also emphasizes that, **while these stories seem extreme and unusual, they really aren’t;** similar things happen in the video game industry every day.

Among gamers, Jason Schreier is a popular and credible games journalist, whose reputation is driven in part by _Blood, Sweat, and Pixels_ itself. Schreier worked as a freelance journalist until 2011 when the gaming website Kotaku offered him a full-time job as a news reporter. He held that position for nine years before resigning—shortly thereafter, he accepted a position with Bloomberg News.

This guide organizes the themes and key ideas from the case studies in _Blood, Sweat, and Pixels_ into four challenges that video game developers face:

  * Accounting for games’ interactivity
  * Constantly evolving technology
  * The impossibility of making and adhering to a schedule during development
  * Interference from people outside of the development studio 



Our commentary adds background information for readers less familiar with the gaming industry and further explores the human impact of industry practices.

### Challenge 1: Interactivity Creates Unique Challenges

Schreier explains that video game development is a hugely challenging career for numerous reasons. Game development demands creativity, flexibility, and a near-fanatical devotion to your work to overcome the unique challenges of the video game industry.

(Shortform note: Video gaming has grown into an enormously popular pastime—it’s a $100 billion industry in the United States alone, and there are an estimated 3 billion gamers in the world today. There’s enormous market pressure for game studios to churn out new, high-quality video games, which helps to explain the lengths that developers go to while creating those games.)

The first major challenge that game developers face comes from the very nature of video games: They’re interactive. Because games are meant to be played, instead of just watched or listened to, **there are a myriad of extra factors that developers have to consider while creating them.**

First, Schreier explains, video gaming is a unique medium because it has to respond to player choices. Instead of telling a single, linear story like a book or a movie, developers have to create a world that constantly moves and changes based on what the player does. That means there are nearly unlimited possibilities that developers have to account for.

For example, say the player tries to talk to an in-game character. For starters, can they even interact with that character? If so, what does the character say? Can the player choose a response? What happens based on that response? This single interaction, which might represent just a few seconds of gameplay, creates numerous possible outcomes that developers have to program into the game.

(Shortform note: To give you an idea of just how much writing can go into a game to account for numerous possible outcomes, Todd Howard, director of game publisher Bethesda, has said that _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim has around 60,000 lines of dialogue_. That’s just the words themselves, never mind the programming required to create those characters and make them speak. Furthermore, that’s not even Bethesda’s biggest game. _Fallout 4_ boasts nearly double that amount of dialogue with 110,000 lines, while their upcoming game _Starfield_ reportedly has over 250,000 lines of dialogue.)

#### You Can’t Know if a Game Is Good Until You Play It

Schreier adds that, because video games are interactive, there are additional challenges in determining whether a game is “good”—challenges that, for example, authors and movie directors don’t face. **Each of those challenges represents a large number of extra hurdles** **that developers have to overcome** to make sure people enjoy playing their games.

First, since a player will control the game, developers have to make sure it’s user-friendly, which can be difficult to predict. For instance, the controls should be intuitive, or at least easy to learn. Anything the player needs to know at a glance, like their character’s health, must be on screen without cluttering the field of vision.

(Shortform note: The most common way to address this issue is with a heads-up display (HUD), which puts information the player needs around the edges of the screen. Ideally, the HUD will also add to the player’s immersion—for example, in the _Halo_ series, the HUD is designed to look like the inside of the character’s helmet, with the information displayed on the visor.)

Second, Schreier explains that a good game needs to _feel_ good: **The game must respond to player input in satisfying ways.** For example, there shouldn’t be a noticeable delay between entering a command and seeing the result onscreen; otherwise, the game will feel sluggish, like a car with poor handling. If there needs to be a delay, as is the case with attacks in fighting games that take time to power up and activate, that delay should be short and consistent. If a game features combat, attacks need to feel impactful—giving the sense that you’ve actually hit your opponent—which is usually accomplished through a combination of visual cues and sound effects.

(Shortform note: A game’s “feel” may be so hard to design and predict because determining it is mostly a subconscious process. Game feel is simply the way your brain reacts—often subconsciously—to the visual and aural feedback you get as you play. As a result, there’s no reliable way to evoke the game feel you want; as Schreier says, there’s no way of knowing what it’ll be until you actually play the game.)

**Finally, a game generally needs to be challenging enough that it’s satisfying to beat, but not _so_ challenging that it becomes frustrating.** Finding the right balance is often difficult, especially for developers who know their game inside and out. These developers likely know gameplay tricks and strategies that the average player won’t, so they struggle to correctly predict how challenging the general public will find the game.

> **How Challenging Should a Game Be?**
> 
> It’s well known that a good challenge—one that’s satisfying but not frustrating—helps you stay engaged with a task. In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear says that the ideal challenge is one where you succeed about half of the time; if it’s much easier than that, you’ll get bored, and if it’s much harder, you’ll get frustrated.
> 
> Schreier discusses the struggle developers face to accurately predict whether or not their game will be too challenging (and thus too frustrating) for the general public. For some gamers, though, challenging games may not be a problem. In games like Dark Souls _,_ the punishing difficulty is actually a selling point; they’re targeted at people who want an intense challenge. That said, some gamers may not want “cozy” games like _Animal Crossing_ —games designed to be relaxing and pleasant—to be challenging at all.

##### Case Study: Diablo 3

One game that Schreier discusses in detail is _Diablo 3_ , from Blizzard Entertainment. _Diablo_ is a series in which players explore dungeons and fight endless swarms of demons on their quest to defeat the forces of Hell and save the world.

_Diablo 3_ was in development from 2001 to 2012, an extremely long time even by video game standards, yet Schreier says it was still a disaster at launch. From constantly-crashing servers to a game difficulty that increased far too quickly, there were numerous ways in which **the developers had failed to predict and prepare for the difficulties of their game going public.**

(Shortform note: Reportedly, _Diablo 3_ ’s “development hell”—slang for an unusually long development cycle—was due in large part to the lack of a unified vision among senior development staff. Developers found themselves working on several different versions of the same game, resulting in a lot of wasted time and effort. They even poked fun at the game’s long development period by including a hidden area called Development Hell.)

The first interactivity challenge came from people simply trying to log in. _Diablo 3_ could only be played online, but it outsold Blizzard’s wildest expectations, and the game’s servers couldn’t handle all the traffic. This meant that many would-be players couldn’t play the game at all. It took several days for Blizzard to strengthen their servers enough to resolve this issue.

(Shortform note: Some games, like _Diablo 3_ , require players to be online, even if they’re playing in a single-player mode. This is called always-on DRM (Digital Rights Management), and it’s meant to prevent game piracy by constantly checking the game’s license—a unique code confirming that you purchased the game legally—while you play. However, always-on DRM creates numerous problems. People without fast, reliable internet connections aren’t able to play these games, and if the servers for a game get shut down, it can no longer be played at all.)

However, even once people were able to play _Diablo 3_ , they encountered numerous frustrating problems because**the game was unbalanced.** Enemies became too strong too quickly, and becoming powerful enough to defeat those enemies was time-consuming and tedious. Schreier explains that a major part of the _Diablo_ franchise is finding magical weapons and armor to power up your character, but in _Diablo 3_ , such items appeared extremely infrequently.

The balance was so bad that players learned it was more efficient to look for rare items in breakable pots and treasure chests than to hunt down strong monsters (the game’s intended method for finding powerful gear). Although the monsters were slightly more likely to drop magical items, the difference wasn’t enough to make up for the time spent finding and fighting them.

(Shortform note: Testing and refining a game’s balance is normally a crucial part of development, and it’s unclear why Blizzard struggled with this with _Diablo 3_. Studios usually uncover the issues Schreier describes here through beta testing: allowing people to play a game before its official release to troubleshoot it. _Diablo 3_did have a beta testing period, but somehow it didn’t highlight these major problems, which left Blizzard scrambling to fix the game after release.)

Developers also didn’t anticipate the outrage that another feature, the Auction House, would cause among players. It was another option for getting powerful equipment, as it allowed players to spend real money to buy in-game items. Schreier says this feature was unpopular because it turned the game into a “pay-to-win”—players who spent money would have decisive advantages over those who didn’t.

(Shortform note: _Diablo Immortal_ , the next game in the series, is a mobile game that heavily relies on pay-to-win mechanics, and it received a similar backlash to Diablo 3. Despite this, _Diablo Immortal_ was a financial success. It came out in June 2022; by November, it had reportedly made over $300 million, making it a huge financial success for Blizzard Entertainment.)

### Challenge 2: Hardware and Software Change Constantly

The second major challenge that video game developers have to tackle is ever-evolving technology. As Schreier says, computers get more powerful every year, allowing for bigger games with better graphics. Consumers expect their games to keep up with that constantly changing technology.

(Shortform note: To provide some context for just how much technology has progressed, the original _Super Mario Bros._ game (released in 1985) had a total file size of 40 KB. In contrast, _Super Mario Odyssey_(released in 2017) had a file size of around 5.6 GB, which is 140,000 times as large. Even that’s small by modern standards—many modern games take up well over 100 GB. The fact that modern gaming systems are able to store and process all that data speaks to the technological advancements of the last 40 years.)

**Also, game developers must constantly learn how to use new tools and find new ways to adapt existing technology.** Remember that games generally take years to create, meaning the hardware and software developers use at the start of the development cycle may not be what they’re using at the end of that cycle.

> **Why Are Modern Games So Glitchy?**
> 
> As games become more complex, this experimental, improvisational approach to game development creates more and more bugs in the code. Finding and fixing them all is impossible, especially as hardware and software continue to improve, so developers tend to only fix the ones most likely to cause serious problems.
> 
> For example, _Super Mario 64_ was one of the first games for the Nintendo 64 and—despite being widely hailed as one of the best games ever made—it contains a high number of bugs and glitches. These range from minor graphical problems that weren’t worth fixing to game-breaking glitches that, because they were rare and hard to trigger, went unnoticed until many years later.

#### Case Study: Dragon Age: Inquisition

To illustrate the challenges that come from changing technology, Schreier discusses the software difficulties that developers at BioWare faced while creating _Dragon Age: Inquisition_. This is a fantasy game in which the player controls a party of four characters on a quest to seal a mysterious portal that’s allowing monsters into the world. _Inquisition_ is the third title in the _Dragon Age_ series, following _Dragon Age: Origins_ and _Dragon Age 2_.

To understand the challenges _Dragon Age’s_ developers faced, it’s helpful to first understand what a “game engine” is. In this context, an engine is like a skeleton for the game—**it includes basic features such as physics, graphical rendering, and the save and load functions.** Game engines save a lot of time by allowing developers to build off of that preexisting design instead of creating each new game from scratch.

The game engines used for previous _Dragon Age_ games had become outdated, and they couldn’t render the kind of graphical effects the developers wanted. Therefore, BioWare decided to create _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ using the then-top-of-the-line Frostbite game engine.

However, Frostbite was originally designed for first-person shooters; a completely different genre of game. As a result, **developers had to program custom tools to enable even basic functions** in _Dragon Age_ , like swinging a sword instead of shooting a gun.

(Shortform note: The problems with Frostbite didn’t end with _Dragon Age: Inquisition._ Several other BioWare titles made around the same time also used Frostbite and experienced similar difficulties. Many gamers blamed Frostbite for the bugs and other problems those games tended to have upon release. Some also tried to put the blame on BioWare’s parent company, Electronic Arts, for forcing their game studios to use the Frostbite engine—although project managers have since come forward to say that isn’t true and using Frostbite was their own decision.)

Even after all of that extra work, the engine was unreliable, glitchy, and prone to crashing, costing developers even more time and labor. To make matters worse, the Frostbite engine got frequent updates, and each update required the _Dragon Age_ team to manually move all of their code from the old version to the new one.

(Shortform note: This example of _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ illustrates the importance of having not just a powerful game engine but also the _right_ game engine for what you’re trying to make. While engines like Frostbite are designed for specific types of games, others—for instance, Unreal Engine—are much more flexible, according to some experts. In fact, many games from major studios across a variety of genres were made using Unreal Engine 4. Unfortunately for the _Dragon Age_ team, they worked on this game before Unreal Engine 4 existed, and the previous version was outdated.)

Due to these issues, _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ was delayed by over a year. Even so, **developers were still adding and testing basic features just months before its November 2014 release.** This strained development cycle resulted in months of mandatory overtime for developers to get the game ready in time. (We’ll further discuss the problem of mandatory overtime later.)

(Shortform note: According to BioWare’s former executive producer, the studio knew there would be a significant delay to _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ because of the challenges of working with the Frostbite engine, but they agreed to the timetable set by Electronic Arts anyway. The reasoning behind that decision is unclear. Another problem the studio faced was the ambitious scope of the in-game world; even with a year’s delay and developers working around the clock, _Inquisition_ simply didn’t have enough content to fill it, which led to a world that some describe as empty and dull.)

Schreier adds that this story, at least, has a happy ending. Despite the numerous challenges during development, _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ was a hit—it blew away the sales numbers from the previous two games, and it received excellent reviews from game critics.

(Shortform note: _Dragon Age: Inquisition_ was so popular that it became prominent in Google searches featuring the word “inquisition.” As a result, the Russell Crowe movie _The Pope’s Exorcist_ accidentally used the symbol of Dragon Age’s Inquisition in place of the symbol of the real-world Spanish Inquisition.)

### Challenge 3: Scheduling Is Difficult

The third major challenge that game developers face is**knowing exactly how long it’ll take to finish making a game.** Schreier notes a few reasons for this.

First, delays and setbacks are almost inevitable during game production, due in large part to the development challenges discussed in _Blood, Sweat, and Pixels._ Second, developers might underestimate how long certain tasks will take.

(Shortform note: As risk analyst Nassim Nicholas Taleb notes in _Antifragile_ , predicting the future—such as how long a game will take to develop—is practically impossible. Furthermore, predictions become less accurate the farther into the future they go; for example, weather forecasts are only accurate for a few days, after which they become infamously untrustworthy. So, for video games with development cycles lasting years, _any_ kind of predicted timeline is likely to end up being inaccurate.)

Schreier adds that another common reason for delays is that **games are art, and it’s hard to know when a work of art is finished.** Even if a game is fully functional, it’s hard to say that it’s “done.” For example, perhaps the graphics could be improved or a new feature added to make the game even better.

> **Are Video Games Art?**
> 
> Schreier’s statement that video games are an art form is arguably controversial. Many people, such as famous film critic Roger Ebert, argue that video games are simply games, and they can’t be called art any more than baseball or poker can be called art.
> 
> However, some fans of video games point out that they have images, music, and stories, all of which had to be created by artists of some kind. Others point out that games can evoke emotions as effectively as any other art form, lending further credence to the game-as-artform argument.
> 
> Still others, including some video game developers, say the question is irrelevant. Whether video games are formally recognized as an art form has no bearing on the work and passion that go into creating them, nor on how much people enjoy them.

#### The Controversial Solution: Mandatory Overtime

Schreier explains that because development cycles often take much longer than expected, “crunch”—meaning enormous amounts of mandatory overtime—is a common practice in video game development.

Game studios frequently resort to mandatory overtime to meet important deadlines, such as having demos ready for major conventions. In some cases, developers have been known to work for**as much as 14 hours a day, with no days off, in the weeks leading up to a major deadline.**

Such grueling schedules take a heavy toll on developers’ personal lives and mental health. Keeping up with the work requires a fervent passion for gaming and a workaholic mindset; even then, exhaustion and burnout are common problems in the video game industry.

> **Does Mandatory Overtime Work?**
> 
> A large and growing body of research indicates that mandatory overtime isn’t just bad for employees—it’s also bad for the company involved. First, it’s simply not effective: People become fatigued and reach a point where more hours worked don’t translate to more tasks getting done. Furthermore, exhaustion and overwork result in employees missing work, getting sick, and quitting their jobs, all of which hurts the company’s bottom line.
> 
> So what’s the ideal number of hours to work in a week? There’s no simple answer, but research has provided a couple of benchmarks: Working more than 45 hours per week is harmful to physical and mental health in numerous ways, and the maximum productive hours for the average employee is around 55 per week. Any time worked beyond that 55-hour benchmark doesn’t result in increased productivity. This suggests that it’s neither healthy nor productive for a developer to work 14-hour days, as that would amount to 70-hour weeks.

##### Case Study #1: Uncharted 4

Schreier says that almost every video game company resorts to mandatory overtime sometimes, but Naughty Dog is infamous for it. The company is known for creating games with gorgeous graphics. Everything from wrinkles in the main character’s clothes to leaves on trees is **rendered with loving—some would say obsessive—attention to detail.**

(Shortform note: Recently, Naughty Dog’s reputation has taken a bit of a hit thanks to leaks of their upcoming remake of The Last of Us _._ Some critics report that the remake is nothing but an almost-unnoticeable graphical update being sold as an entirely new game. As a result, these leaks have some gamers accusing the company of making a cheap cash grab using one of their most popular games.)

However, that level of perfectionism takes a lot of time to achieve, which is why Naughty Dog is also known for exploiting mandatory overtime. In the case of the studio’s hit action-adventure game _Uncharted 4, _Schreier says that employees often had to work past midnight for days on end to hit deadlines, including on weekends. While it’s common for other studios to have their employees on such a schedule for a few weeks, Naughty Dog’s developers worked those hours for months.

_Uncharted 4_ sold 2.7 million copies in its first week and got excellent reviews, with particular praise for its graphics. However, after its release, **numerous developers quit their jobs at Naughty Dog, citing burnout as their reason for leaving.**

> **The Impact of Crunch Culture**
> 
> Schreier may be understating the impacts of Naughty Dog’s mandatory overtime: A former employee said that at least one developer ended up in the hospital from overwork, and around 70% of the studio’s game designers quit after _Uncharted 4_ ’s release. In addition, Naughty Dog’s high turnover rate and reputation for requiring long hours have caused problems for the studio in recent years—experienced developers aren’t willing to work there, so the studio has had to resort to hiring industry newcomers, resulting in significant production delays.
> 
> _Blood, Sweat, and Pixels_ was published in 2017; in 2022, Schreier stated in an article for _Bloomberg_ that the video game industry is growing less tolerant of “crunch culture.” However, in the same article, he notes that crunch is still deeply ingrained in the industry. He says that’s unlikely to change until studio executives stop glorifying overtime and start valuing their employees’ work-life balance instead.

##### Case Study #2: Stardew Valley

Mandatory overtime doesn’t just hit large studios like Naughty Dog. It can be even worse for small studios and independent developers who don’t have as many employees to share the workload.

Schreier spoke to Eric Barone, the one-man team behind the beloved farming simulator _Stardew Valley_. **Barone spent over four years working on the game, during which he says he put in anywhere from eight to 15 hours a day.** He consistently told friends and family that it would be done in another month or two, but that timeline kept stretching since he had no supervisors pushing him to finalize and release the game.

(Shortform note: Creating your own game like Barone did is more doable than ever thanks to the accessibility of programming software and how powerful personal computers have become. However, there are downsides to independent game development: Making a game by yourself is a hugely time-consuming endeavor (as Barone discovered) and one that you won’t get paid for unless your game does well.)

Eventually, Barone struck a deal with a small publisher called Chucklefish Games, and _Stardew Valley_ finally came out in February 2016. The game was an unexpected hit; it sold over a million copies in two months and made Barone a millionaire practically overnight.

(Shortform note: Barone publicly distanced himself from Chucklefish Games in 2019 when the studio was accused of exploiting developers and relying on unpaid labor. He emphasized that he was the only developer who worked on _Stardew Valley_ —implying that he wasn’t benefitting from unfair labor practices—and said Chucklefish was only responsible for publishing the game and implementing the multiplayer feature. Chucklefish released a statement in 2022 that didn’t directly attack Barone’s post but made a point of listing the numerous features and re-releases the studio handled as _Stardew Valley_ ’s popularity continued to grow beyond what they or Barone had ever imagined.)

Schreier notes that Barone’s work situation didn’t improve after _Stardew Valley_ came out; a few months later, **Barone worked himself into burnout and couldn't bring himself to work at all.** Having so many players meant that Barone was suddenly under enormous pressure to fix bugs and release new features. He frequently pulled all-nighters to develop and release patches—small updates designed to fix problems in the game—but those patches often created as many issues as they solved.

(Shortform note: Even in 2023, seven years after the game’s release, Barone was still developing patches for Stardew Valley, albeit at a much slower pace. In a Tweet from April 2023, Barone said that he was currently working on yet another update for the game that would add new content, including some much-requested new dialogue for its characters.)

Barone took the summer off to rest before entering a cycle of intense work and equally intense burnout. He’d push himself for weeks to crank out new patches—then, he’d have to take weeks off to recover.

(Shortform note: Burnout is more than simple fatigue; it’s a serious condition with symptoms including anxiety, insomnia, heart palpitations, and the inability to make even simple decisions. Furthermore, recovering from burnout often takes longer than just a few weeks or months—severe cases can require up to a year of rest. Forcing yourself to work before you’re recovered can trap you in a cycle of burnout like the one Barone found himself in. Trying to push yourself through a period of burnout can cause further mental, emotional, and even physical harm, up to and including death.)

Schreier says that he got in touch with Barone in December 2016 to see how he was doing. Barone replied that he was exhausted, sick of _Stardew Valley_ , and thinking about starting a new game with a more realistic timetable.

(Shortform note: Barone, also known by his gaming alias ConcernedApe, announced that he’d begun work on a new game called _Haunted Chocolatier_ in late 2020—although, as noted above, he continued developing patches for _Stardew Valley_ even after beginning this new project.)

### Challenge 4: Outside Forces Interfere With Development

The final challenge we’ll discuss doesn’t relate to game development itself. Instead, it’s a product of collaboration with investors, publishers, and other people outside of the game studio whose interests in selling the product might conflict with the developers’ interests in creating it.

#### Games Often Require Collaboration

Schreier points out that there’s more to making a video game than writing endless lines of code. Developers also have commercial and legal matters to tackle before releasing a game, which usually means getting other people involved in the development process.

First, studios need to pay their developers and cover overhead costs. Unless a company is large enough to cover all of its costs, that means striking funding deals with people outside of the studio.

However, when investors are funding a game, **they have a say in the development process.** For example, they might push for a game to be released before developers think it’s ready so they can start seeing returns on their investments. They can also pull their financial support if they’re unhappy.

(Shortform note: Problems like these often come from a lack of a shared vision—developers and investors have different ideas about how their game should be made, so they end up unintentionally working against each other. The solution to this problem is communication and collaboration: Developers should work together with investors to establish reasonable goals and milestones and keep them apprised of their progress.)

Second, developers often have business executives weighing in on their work, and possibly even copyright holders (if a game is based on an existing intellectual property). This can be especially frustrating because developers could find themselves taking orders from people who aren’t experienced in video game development. **But without those people’s support, the game can’t get made at all.**

(Shortform note: As a counterpoint to Schreier, there are times when outside perspectives and ideas can be beneficial. Someone with no background in game development might come up with a unique idea that people steeped in game development culture and practices would never think of. For example, an executive might provide some insight about how a character in a leadership role should behave, while a copyright holder likely knows key details about the setting that others have overlooked or forgotten. However, as with the “shared vision” principle above, communication and collaboration are key—it shouldn’t just be an outsider overriding developers’ decisions.)

##### Case Study: Star Wars 1313

Schreier ends this book with the story of the unreleased _Star Wars 1313_ , a game in which players would have controlled a bounty hunter as he tried to make a living in the slums of the planet Coruscant. The developers, working for the company LucasArts, overcame numerous developmental and creative challenges only to see their studio bought out and shut down by Disney.

The first major hurdle that LucasArts’s developers faced was from outside the game studio. _Star Wars_ creator George Lucas (who is, by his own admission, not a gamer) kept demanding creative changes. He thought those changes would be relatively minor, but in reality, they required the development team to redo weeks or months of work.

For example, Schreier says that with development already well underway, Lucas wanted the game’s main character to be Boba Fett—a popular character from the _Star Wars_ movies—instead of the original character the design team had created. Lucas thought this would be a simple matter of changing the character’s appearance, but **the developers had to completely rework the game’s controls and redesign the in-game architecture** to account for the new movement options provided by Fett’s signature jetpack.

(Shortform note: George Lucas’s approach to _Star Wars 1313_ may have frustrated developers due to the extensive work his requests resulted in, but it isn’t unusual behavior for him. As Bob Iger explains in _The Ride of a Lifetime_ , Lucas is notably possessive of Star Wars, and he sought to inject his own ideas into _Star Wars_ products even after selling the rights to the franchise. For instance, Lucas was reportedly disappointed that filmmakers didn’t use his ideas in _The Force Awakens_ , a _Star Wars_ movie that he wasn’t supposed to contribute to.)

Despite these creative difficulties, a _Star Wars 1313_ demo was one of the biggest hits at a major gaming convention. **Gamers and reviewers alike praised the demo and said they were excited for the full release.**

However, Schreier reports that before the game was finished, Disney bought out LucasArts and shut down the company. Years of work on _Star Wars 1313_ had to be thrown away, while developers and fans alike realized that this promising game would never see the light of day.

> **The Legacy of _Star Wars 1313_ and LucasArts**
> 
> Although _Star Wars 1313_ was eventually canceled, its popularity arguably lives on: Some of its ideas and designs seem to have been repurposed for television. For example, Grant Parker (one of the developers working on _1313_) said that he spotted some of the set pieces he’d designed for the game in _The Mandalorian_ and _The Book of Boba Fett._
> 
> It’s also not entirely accurate to say that Disney shut down LucasArts. Rather, Disney shut down the _production_ aspects of LucasArts and shifted the company’s focus to licensing. In other words, rather than making _Star Wars_ games in-house, LucasArts would now sell the rights to make those games to other studios.
