## 1-Page Summary

Read the full summary for the full timelines of each company. Here we’ll discuss the high-level commonalities between both companies.

#### Both started as side projects, looking for the next big idea.

At Uber, Camp and Kalanick had both recently had their companies acquired. Camp was still busy at StumbleUpon, while Kalanick was enjoying his time away. From incorporation, over a year passed before they hired a CEO and invested real time.

At Airbnb, Chesky and Gebbia started it as a way to pay rent. It’s months before they really pick it as their main idea.

#### Both were rejected early on with a failure of imagination.

Uber’s potential investors often questioned the size of the black car market, not predicting how it could actually grow to the taxi market and even bigger. Others knew Uber was going to run into hostile local transportation laws. Others were worried about how uninvolved the founders were.

Airbnb investors were concerned about the size of the market, designer founders who didn’t fit the Silicon Valley engineer-founder mold, the legal liability of injured guests or destroyed homes, and concerns about whether anyone really wanted to sleep in strangers’ homes.

  * Instead, with a more ambitious imagination, Airbnb can be defined as the larger “eBay, but for spaces,” or “the largest hotel chain in the world, without actually owning inventory” or “transforming a massive illiquid asset - space - into a peer-to-peer marketplace.”



#### Both grew virally, exhibited network effects, and kicked off powerful flywheels.

Uber had natural local virality - back then if you stepped out of a black car in front of your friends, they’d wonder what you were doing.

  * More drivers caused less wait time and cheaper fares, which caused more riders to join and more rides to be taken, which stimulated more drivers.



Airbnb had natural international virality built in. Travelers who used the service would consider listing their own places.

  * More users encouraged more inventory which encouraged lower prices which attracted more users.



#### Both circumvented local laws.

Uber

  * Most cities regulate cabs and restrict the number of cab medallions available. By law only taxis can pick up people who hail on streets. Uber bypassed this regulation, allowing pickups by electronic hails, and using the phone as a fare meter. 
  * California wanted Uber to register as a limo company, but Uber argued it was not a fleet operator but rather an intermediary, much like Expedia wasn’t an airline.
  * New York City required drivers of town cars to be affiliated with a base, like a professional fleet. Initially refusing to register Uber as a base, Kalanick eventually acquiesced.



Airbnb

  * Large-scale property owners circumvented hotel laws requiring registration and taxes if they didn’t live in the unit being rented out for most of the year.



#### Both used popular consumer support to fight regulation.

Uber

  * They fought local legislators by mobilizing users. Uber published phone numbers, email addresses, and Twitter handles of politicians and asked users to make their voices heard.



Airbnb

  * Created a group called Peers to hold meetups among hosts to influence lawmakers. 
  * Generally, Airbnb didn’t have the same firepower Uber did. Hosts only rent out apartments a few times a year, unlike Uber drivers whose full time job could be to drive. And travelers by nature travel _outside_ the city they live in, thus local regulation doesn’t affect their well being like Uber regulation would.



#### Both seeded the market with hacky growth tactics.

Both companies leaned on aggressive marketing tactics to gain market share and deal with competitors.

Uber called competitor cars en masse, sent them invitations to join Uber, then canceled rides.

In 2009, Airbnb used Craigslist, one of its main implicit rivals: 1) email anyone who posts a rental property on Craigslist asking them to join Airbnb; 2) in the reverse, allow Airbnb users to cross-post their listing to Craigslist frictionlessly. Craigslist eventually sent a cease-and-desist in 2012.
