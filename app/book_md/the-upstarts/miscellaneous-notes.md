## Miscellaneous Notes

### Travis Kalanick’s History

  * In high school, Kalanick sold Cutco knives and started an SAT training company after graduation. 
  * In 1998 he dropped out of UCLA senior year to join classmates building Scour.net, a search engine for media files on local networks. 
    * In 1999 Scour was getting 1.5 million views a day and 900k visitors in two months. 
    * A few “nonlucky” events happened: Michael Ovitz dragged out an investment offer, sued them, and acquired 51% of the company; in 2000, Scour was sued for $250 billion and declared bankruptcy fall of 2000.
  * In 2001, Kalanick started Red Swoosh, a company offering to save bandwidth costs for media companies by P2P distribution. 
    * Within a year his co-founder left, poached the engineers, and Travis was alone watching deals fall through. 
    * In 2005, Mark Cuban invested $1MM, and Travis moved to the Valley.
    * In 2007, he sold the company to Akamai for $18.7MM, netting him several million after years of labor.
  * Kalanick wasn’t sure about joining Uber for over a year. He was contemplating joining Formspring, a Q&A site he’d invested in, as COO.



### Facing Fire from Earlier Advocates

Airbnb

  * Some Airbnb hosts were upset by the lack of disclosure around local regulation and that their hosting might be illegal. Nigel Warren was fined for $40,000 and, receiving little help from HQ, got exposure through the New York Times. Eventually, with some legal assistance from Airbnb, Warren was excused of charges.
  * Guests reported racial discrimination.



Uber

  * Drivers continuously combated over 1099-contractor status, and over reduction in fees designed to stimulate demand and fight Lyft.



### Reacting to Crises

  * Defense and blaming the user will only stoke the fire. 
    * Paul Graham: “Fall on your sword, accept responsibility, and people will move on.”
    * Chris Sacca: “You can’t say out loud, ‘Fucking get over it,’ you have to be like, ‘We are working on it, good feedback, we’ll improve the app.’” 
  * In response to the EJ incident, Chesky writes “we have really screwed things up” and appended his personal email to the letter. Read the original letter.
  * In response to 7x surge pricing, Kalanick tweets defensively, arguing the price is always visible. 



### Miscellaneous Notes

  * Negative churn
    * Uber saw that users who joined were more likely to stay with it and increase their usage over time.
  * Forcing good host behavior
    * A challenge was getting hosts to reply to guests’ messages. The solution was to make the host’s response rate publicly visible (eg “this host responds to 50% of messages”), thus affecting their chance of being approached. 
  * Arguments and analogies
    * “Ridesharing will cause terrible accidents to uninsured drivers.” “That’s like restricting wireless phone service because people are afraid they’ll be cut off from 911 if their cell phone batteries die.”
  * Both took advantage of macro economic trends.
    * During the 2008 recession, an open inventory of rental properties allowed managers like Toshi Chan to snap up cheap apartments and re-list them nightly.
    * Uber benefits from shaky employment.
