## Exercise: Think Like a Data Scientist

Stephens-Davidowitz says that good data studies are intuitive—they answer relevant and interesting questions by making the kinds of connections we make all the time. Let’s see how intuitive this kind of work is by thinking through a problem the way a data scientist might.

* * *

What is a question you’d like answered or a problem you’d like to solve that big data could help with?

Which of Stephens-Davidowitz’s four benefits would be most relevant to your question or problem? (For example, how would you use new information, honest information, zooming in, and/or causal experiments to answer your questions?)

Which pitfalls would you need to watch out for and why? (How might the data offer false insights or present ethical concerns?)

Which traditional methods (surveys, interviews, experiments, etc.) might make a useful complement to your big data study and why?
