## Exercise: Identify Media Bias

Owens argues that a critical tool of the Democratic agenda is mainstream media. Consider the media that you consume and see if you can identify any hidden manipulations.

* * *

In a typical day, how much news do you consume? How and where do you consume it? (For example, social media, TV, newspaper, word of mouth?)

Reflecting on your previous few days, was there any news that upset you? If yes, what was it and how did it make you feel? (For example, did you feel worried, angry, or depressed?)

Upon reflection of the broadcast, do you remember if any political issues were raised during the broadcast? For example, if you saw a story about a bad car crash, were your Mayorâ€™s policies or political affiliation brought up as part of the story?

Take a few minutes to research the news source that you are referencing. Is it left- or right-leaning? Does knowing this information affect how you now perceive the news story, and if so, how?

Finally, think of one way that you can adjust your current news sources to reflect a more balanced perspective. What is it? For example, could you replace a biased source with a more neutral one? Or could you add another source from a different perspective to hear both sides of the issues?
