## Part 1: The Problem | Introduction and Chapter 1: We Worship at the Altar of “Me”

_New York Times_ columnist David Brooks believes that modern society has lost its moral compass, and our lives will feel empty until we find it again. In _The Road to Character,_ he asserts that in the last 70 years—beginning soon after World War II’s end—our culture has undergone a huge moral shift toward narcissism.

Today we’re obsessed with personal success and individual achievements. We believe that the length of our resumés is the ultimate measure of our worth. We think that a successful career, fame, and a fat bank account equal a fulfilling life. We broadcast our tiniest personal victories on Facebook and Instagram while we cover up, ignore, or even lie about our character flaws. We’re so busy achieving—and telling our friends what we’ve achieved—that we don’t waste a single moment wondering if there’s any higher purpose for our lives.

### The Problems With a “Me-Focused” Life

Ironically, in our conquest for external success, we've made ourselves unhappy. As we center our lives around “living the good life”—striving for fabulous careers, sprawling mansions, and glamorous vacations—we've lost our connection to the moral values that bring deep, lasting joy. Happiness can’t be found in achievements; it lies in the battle for higher moral character. Our life’s most meaningful work is to become better human beings—individuals who are humble, virtuous, loving, and more interested in service to others than to the self.

### Resumé Virtues Versus Eulogy Virtues

There’s a big difference between "resumé virtues" (job-related skills and successes) and "eulogy virtues" (the personality traits that people talk about at your funeral). Most of us would say that eulogy virtues are more important than resumé virtues, but **we give lip service to eulogy virtues while we spend the bulk of our time building resumé virtues.**

Truthfully, what matters to you more—being famous or being a great friend? Would you rather be remembered as a top salesperson or a devoted parent? These are hard questions because our culture rewards us for external achievements, not for cultivating our virtue, building our character, and being the best human beings we can be. “Eulogy virtues” are only lauded after we’re dead.

### Defining Humans’ True Nature

Philosophers have long studied human nature, considering the ways in which we are governed by competing influences: good versus evil, generosity versus selfishness, and so on. For much of western civilization, the prevailing school of thought has been that humans have a natural tendency for selfishness and narcissistic self-love. **But we also have free will, and we can choose not to be enslaved by our selfish desires.**

Brooks references the writings of rabbi and scholar Joseph Soloveitchik, who believed that the Book of Genesis contains two accounts of creation that represent the opposing sides of human nature. **"Adam 1" is our ambitious, career-oriented self and "Adam 2" is our moral, internal self who aims for greater good, regardless of personal ambitions.**

#### Meet an Adam 1

Adam 1 is very busy. She’s buying a big suburban house and winning accolades at work. She is constantly proving to the world that she is at the top of her game. In doling out her time and energy, she always puts herself, her career, and her finances first. She prioritizes time over people—after all, it takes a lot of hours and energy to continually improve her skills, knowledge, and abilities, and she knows she’ll get rewarded. She manages her life like a well-thought-out business plan.

##### How to Cultivate Our Adam 1 Nature

In order to develop our Adam 1 natures, we must spend time nurturing our strengths—our talents, intelligence, and professional skills. To do this, we have to develop an achievement-oriented mindset, and we have to put ourselves first. We study hard to get into the best colleges, we work long hours to win big promotions at work, we make friends with people who can help us get ahead, and we marry into the “right” families. We even make sure we have a big social media presence—tons of Facebook friends—so that everybody can keep track of our upwardly-mobile progress.

##### How Adam 1s See Themselves

People with a well-developed Adam 1 side don’t spend time worrying about their inner lives or moral compass. Since they are rewarded by society for their many achievements, they never even consider the question of whether or not they are virtuous enough. They slip into "moral mediocrity," assuming that if they're popular and well-liked, they must be good enough.

#### Meet an Adam 2

Adam 2 may or may not have achieved worldly success, but she is deeply concerned about the health and welfare of her family, friends, co-workers, and neighbors. She works hard all day at her job, volunteers at the soup kitchen in the evenings, and helps out her elderly parents on the weekends. The neighborhood kids always seem to gather at her house, where she makes time to listen to their problems and cheer them on. Nonetheless, she is humble about her life. She doesn’t talk much about herself or her activities because in her mind, it’s not remarkable. She’s just doing what needs to be done.

##### How to Cultivate Our Adam 2 Nature

In order to develop our Adam 2 natures—which is essentially our moral core or character—we must confront and analyze our weaknesses (which might be selfishness, egotism, alcoholism, sex or love addiction, laziness, lack of empathy, a need for attention, or any number of other vices). **We need to face up to the fact that we are far from perfect.** Once we identify our faults, we can work on self-improvement. We can make it our daily work to build stronger character and become better human beings.

##### How Adam 2s See Themselves

People who have a well-developed Adam 2 side are reserved, self-effacing, humble, dignified, respectful, and restrained. They are well aware of their flaws, so they don’t go around telling or showing the world how great they are. Instead, they make everyone around them feel good because they are not focused on themselves.**And they always look around to see where their service is needed.** Like Adam 1s, Adam 2s are doers, but they’re not usually doing for themselves. They perform “other-oriented” acts of service without expecting praise or gratitude. They ask themselves, who needs assistance? What needs to be done? What gifts do I have to offer that will make this world a better place?

#### Real-Life Example: Adam 1 and Adam 2

Football quarterbacks Joe Namath and John Unitas were both amazing sports heroes. Both were raised in Pennsylvania steel towns, but they were brought up differently (and a decade apart). As adults, they subscribed to vastly different moral codes. Namath was a flamboyant showman and a shameless self-promoter. He often talked about how handsome he was and how the ladies adored him. He was a superstar who defined himself by “personal branding” before that term even existed. Namath was a classic Adam 1.

John Unitas was an equally outstanding quarterback, but he was understated, self-effacing, almost shy. He treated his record-breaking football career like it was a routine job, no different than being a plumber or a salesman. He was hounded by the press, but he dreaded talking to them. Unitas was a true team player who never hogged the limelight—in fact, he preferred to see his teammates shine. He was a classic Adam 2.

#### Let Adam 1 Make Friends With Adam 2

As discussed, our culture rewards us for cultivating our Adam 1 sides—not Adam 2—which makes it more difficult to choose a righteous moral path. Spending time and effort to get into Princeton or rise to the top seat of a corporation are actions that are praised by our society. Spending time and effort to confront and overcome our weaknesses in order to build character and become a better human being is “invisible” inner work, and doesn’t wind up on our resumés. But we should be cultivating both sides of our nature, whether those actions are rewarded or not.

The good news is that the Adam 1 versus Adam 2 conflict doesn’t require a binary solution. We don’t have to quit our jobs and become monks to live better, more virtuous lives. If everyone did that, our entire economy would collapse. For the sake of our nation’s well-being, we must be productive workers and consumers, we must work hard at school and careers, we must make money and support ourselves. There has to be a functioning Adam 1 inside all of us. **The key is not to develop our Adam 1 self at the expense of Adam 2. The two Adams must learn to live side-by-side.**

We’ve let Adam 1 grow so large that we have forgotten the wisdom of Adam 2, and we’ve lost the deep, abiding joy of living an Adam 2 life. **We need to re-balance the two worldviews.**

### Embrace the Old-Fashioned Concept of Sin

This “hey, look how great I am” emphasis wasn't always the norm. Our culture used to place a high price tag on humility, self-restraint, and self-discipline. Not only that, but we used to value service to others _higher_ than service to ourselves.

Western thinking once subscribed to the idea of original sin, or what philosopher Immanuel Kant described as **"crooked timber" morality**. It’s the belief that humans are fundamentally broken, but that our life’s purpose is to confront our brokenness and build a better, stronger character.

Kant’s famous line “out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made” is roughly equivalent to the Christian concept of “original sin.” **We are born imperfect, but there are great benefits in struggling to overcome our imperfections.** It’s a difficult battle, but it builds character, adds meaning and purpose to our lives, and ultimately makes us happier and more fulfilled.

(Shortform note: Although Kant coined the phase “crooked timber,” it was popularized by historian Isaiah Berlin in his 1959 book _The Crooked Timber of Humanity,_ which discussed the perils of democratic government. The central idea was that since humans are innately flawed, they can’t possibly govern themselves well.)

However, the “crooked timber” school of thought has fallen out of fashion. Today we associate the word “sin” with an old-fashioned Victorian morality that is painfully out of style. In fact, the word “sin” has nearly disappeared from our vocabulary except when we apply it to rich desserts, which are “sinfully” decadent.

We need to start with a language revolution—make the word “sin” common again, using it as it was originally intended—in reference to human nature. **The idea that we’re sinners is not a popular notion, but we should revisit it.**

Most people under the age of 60 will find this a hard sell. Anyone born after 1965 or thereabouts has grown up with a vastly different mindset. Instead of being taught “I’m inherently flawed and I must work to overcome my flaws,” we were taught "I'm perfect just the way I am." Society has reinforced this message—take a look at most college graduation speeches or popular self-help books. **We’re repeatedly told “we’re wonderful just the way we are,” and all we need to do is be true to ourselves.** And since we’re all taught to think we’re perfectly fine, **it doesn’t occur to us to look deeply and critically at our moral compasses.** Self-reflection is viewed as a waste of time. Instead, we tell ourselves to look outward, to show the world just how great we are.

We even instill the “me-focus” in our children, believing it will help them develop strong self-esteem. We teach our children that they are wonderful at the core. Disney cartoons and other children’s media underscore that lesson. Kids’ movies don’t relay the message “I was born a sinner and I must work hard to fix myself,” they say, “You’re perfect—just trust yourself and you can do anything.”

### A Philosophical Shift: Moral Realism to Moral Romanticism

If you’re not comfortable with the word “sin,” there are other labels to describe the moral shift that Americans have experienced in the last century. **Moral realism** is equivalent to the “crooked timber” or “original sin” school of thought, an idea that dates back to Biblical times. Moral realism, a concept that was widely accepted for centuries, stresses that humans are limited by our inherent weaknesses, so we should not trust our own judgment about ourselves. Virtue is made, not born.

But in the 18th century, **moral realism was challenged by moral romanticism.** Thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau espoused humanity’s inner goodness, stating that at our core, we were pure. Romanticists trusted in anything that was made by Nature, including humans. We can trust our reasoning and self-direction because we have a “golden cure” that is innately good. As such, humans should listen to their inner voices, which will always point them in the right moral direction.

**Both worldviews existed side-by-side for many years,** with realism more popular among the working class and romanticism embraced by artists and free-thinkers. But by the late 1940s, moral realism fell by the wayside. After being deprived for nearly 20 years—due to the challenges of the Great Depression and World War II—people were ready to indulge in a more positive worldview. There was a pent-up demand for relaxation and enjoyment. Advertising and consumerism started to frame a new way of living (and thinking). Products were being sold (dishwashers, for example) that made life easier, even more frivolous (televisions, for example). The 1952 self-help book _The Power of Positive Thinking_ had a huge impact on how people envisioned their futures. The zeitgeist became, “Go get what you want out of life—you deserve it.” (Shortform note: To learn more about the ideas that caused this shift, read our summary of The Power of Positive Thinking.)

#### Moral Romanticism Has Some Advantages

**Initially this new emphasis on self-empowerment and self-esteem had positive effects.**

Many people’s lives were improved by the empowerment movement. The new emphasis on self-actualization had huge implications for improving social injustice, especially for women and minorities. In the 1950s and 1960s, marginalized people chose to stand up for their rights and demand better treatment. Women gained greater personal freedoms and more clout in the workplace. Blacks and other minorities demanded and received more equal rights and opportunities. The federal government was forced to create more inclusive laws and institutions.

(Shortform note: As protests across America have shown, there’s still much work to do to eliminate the oppression of Black people, women, and other minority groups.)

**But gradually, Americans’ thinking became solely “me-focused.”** The downside of believing so firmly in ourselves was that it led to narcissism. Before long the pendulum had swung from a midpoint balance of moral realism and moral romanticism to a nearly complete shift to the latter. Brooks gives a few examples of this cultural shift:

  1. As recently as the 1970s, most politicians didn't publish memoirs. In fact, memoir as a literary genre has only recently gained popularity. Now even low-level politicians publish memoirs soon after leaving office. 
  2. President George Bush Sr. used to cross out the word "I" from his speeches. He didn’t think it was dignified for a U.S. president to speak as an individual. His job was to be the voice of the people, not the voice of himself. But Presidents in more recent history are enamored with the word “I.” 
  3. The first Girl Scout handbooks, published in 1912, emphasized modesty and self-effacement. The 1980 version of the handbook encouraged Girl Scouts to put themselves “at center stage” and pay attention to their feelings. 
  4. In a 1976 survey of people's life goals, achieving fame was ranked at the bottom (number 15 out of 16 choices). But by 2007, more than half of young people said that being famous was one of their top goals. 



#### The Forgotten Trait: Humility

Moral romanticism’s “me-focus” manifests itself in a loss of humility, a key trait for character-building. As recently as the 1940s, Americans admired humility and looked down on narcissism and self-promotion. For example, when World War II ended, Americans were jubilant but also humble. We handled our success in the war with appropriate gravitas—we had just participated in a horrible period of history marked by death and destruction, so it didn't seem right to blow our horns in celebration even though we were “victorious.” In contrast, in today’s world, every time a football player scores a touchdown, he dances a victory jig in the end zone (to the great delight of TV cameras and fans).

### What’s Lost in Choosing “Me” Over “We”

In addition to making us unhappy, our “me-focused” thinking and achievement-oriented mindset has created a huge societal loss—we no longer focus our energies on helping out our communities, aiding those less fortunate than us, or working in public service. Today we prioritize actions that serve our own good over the greater good. We think in terms of “how can I live my life to get exactly what I want?” But that’s a very different question than asking ourselves,**“What does the world need that I can offer?” or “What does life want from me?”**

(Shortform note: This idea echoes John F. Kennedy’s famous line from his inaugural address: “Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.” He was challenging every American to contribute in some way to the public good. And long before JFK, Thomas Jefferson said “there is a debt of service from every man to his country.”)
