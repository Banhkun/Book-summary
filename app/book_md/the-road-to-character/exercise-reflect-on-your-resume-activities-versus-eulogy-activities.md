## Exercise: Reflect on Your Resumé Activities Versus Eulogy Activities

Brooks writes that most of us believe “eulogy virtues” are more important than “resumé virtues, and yet most of us spend more time on the latter.

* * *

Consider an average day or week in your life and list the main activities that consume your time. Label each activity with either “R” (for an activity that cultivates a “resumé virtue,” a job-related skill or success) or “E” (for an activity that cultivates a "eulogy virtue," a personality trait that people might talk about at your funeral).

Roughly how many hours do you devote to each category during the average day or week?

What percentage of time do you spend with activities that build up your resumé versus activities that create memories and stories for your eulogy? Are you comfortable with that percentage?
