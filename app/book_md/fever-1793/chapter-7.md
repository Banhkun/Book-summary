## Chapter 7: October 14-23, 1793

Matilda woke up in the garden. She was slow to sit up and open her eyes, but once she did, she couldn’t believe what she saw. **A layer of crystals covered the ground and plants. The first frost had finally come. The fever was over.**

Matilda called to Eliza, and the two hugged and danced. They’d made it through alive. They brought a mattress outside and laid the children on top to help them cool down. The hot stench of death was gone, replaced by cool, crisp, and clean air.

A few days later, a messenger came with a basket of food from Joseph. The farmers were back in the city selling at the market again. Food never tasted so good to Matilda. By now, **the children’s fevers had broken, and they were recovering well**. When Joseph finally came to visit, he was overwhelmed with gratitude. Joseph hugged all three children and thanked the women for keeping them alive.

Joseph asked if Matilda had any news about her mother, but she hadn’t heard a word. He assured her that word would come soon and suggested she go to the market to find out the latest news. Matilda asked Eliza if she could go, but they both realized the days where Matilda needed permission were over. **She had grown during the crisis and could make her own choices now.**

### A World Awakens

The market was teeming with people. The air was thick with laughter and merriment, and gossip and news fell from everyone’s mouths. Most talked about those who’d died and those still unknown. It would be weeks before reports of the people who’d fled returned.

The German chicken farmer almost fell over when she saw Matilda. She was so happy to see Matilda alive and so shocked at how thin she was, she gave her two hens and eggs for free. Matilda told her about Grandpa and Lucille and asked that she spread the word that Lucille was missing. The farmer was a notorious gossip. Matilda knew word would spread quickly.

Matilda finished her shopping quickly, but she couldn’t bring herself to leave the market. She honestly didn’t know what to do. Maybe she should go to the farm to find her mother? Maybe she should wait a few more days? And what if her worst fear came true? She’d have to sell the coffeehouse and move to the orphanage. She’d have to work as a servant for the rest of her life.

Just then, Matilda caught sight of her reflection in a window. With her face so thin and pale, she resembled her mother more than ever before. She realized she didn’t have to do what anyone told her. She was from a line of resourceful and strong people. **She would make it on her own if she had to.**

Matilda was about to leave when a hand landed on her arm. She turned to find Nathaniel Benson smiling ear to ear. Just like before, her stomach flipped. But as the two walked back to the coffeehouse together, she realized she wasn’t that silly girl anymore and relaxed. They discussed war stories and how strange it was for life to simply pick back up.

As they rounded the corner to her home, Matilda saw her neighbor pop out of a carriage like she’d just returned from a holiday. Nathaniel saw her face drop and assured her Lucille would be home soon. Matilda wanted to believe him, but doubt haunted her.

### Giving Thanks

The city seemed to be thriving even more than before the fever. Every day brought hundreds more back from the country. They were all fat and happy, and they were eager to carouse like nothing had happened. **Matilda resented their lack of awareness of the hardships and death the people who’d stayed had endured.** The ones left behind were still thin and ghostly, forever changed by the epidemic.

There was still no news from Lucille, but Matilda continued to hang on to hope. Nathaniel was there to help her. After that first day back at the market, Nathaniel came by the coffeehouse daily. He stopped by around sundown, just when Matilda was finishing cleaning up for the day and putting the children to bed. At first, their walks were short ones around the block. Then, they started to venture farther out, often ending up at the square where Grandpa was buried. The mounds were now flat, and grass had sprouted through the dirt. Matilda thought Grandpa would be happy to be somewhere crowded.

To celebrate their health and survival, Eliza suggested a thanksgiving feast. Mother Smith, Joseph, and Nathaniel joined Eliza, Matilda, and children at the coffeehouse. Before they ate, Mother Smith blessed the food. She thanked God for their good fortune and asked that he watch over those he took. Joseph said a special prayer for his wife. The fever was gone, but his grief was far from over.

During the meal, Joseph asked about Lucille, and Eliza gave him a stern look. **Mother Smith said she could feel it in her bones that Lucille was still alive, and her bones were always right.** The subject was dropped until dessert, when Joseph asked how much Matilda was going to ask for the coffeehouse. He said it was good property, and she’d get a large amount to be used as her dowry.

Everyone at the table started to quibble about what Matilda should do. She felt like she was a child again, listening to Grandpa and Lucille discuss her future in front of her. Those days were over for Matilda. She’d decided what she would do that day in the market, and no one would stop her.

When she announced that she was reopening the coffeehouse the next morning, the arguments started again. There was no way she could run the place on her own. That’s when **Matilda asked Eliza to become her partner. She said Eliza and the boys could live there with her and Nell.** She expected Eliza to jump with joy, but Eliza refused. She couldn’t buy in, and it wasn’t proper to take the offer as a gift.

Mother Smith stepped in and said Eliza would take it. It was a good opportunity, and she could pay what she owed out of her earnings. After that, Eliza had no choice but to accept. A messenger came to the door just then to deliver a bag of coffee beans. His employer would be at full stock again soon and wanted to confirm the Cook’s business. Matilda surprised everyone, even herself, with her grace and professionalism. **She was ready to take over the family business.**

### November 10, 1793

Three days after opening the coffeehouse, the place was packed. Familiar sounds and aromas filled the air. Matilda had taken to handing out free samples. She learned that people could never have just one bite of something. They inevitably ordered more to eat, and **they were selling food almost faster than Eliza could make it**.

Nathaniel was a regular fixture at the coffeehouse. He helped run errands, and he’d hung some of his paintings on the walls to brighten the place. He’d sold two already.

Matilda had more big plans for the shop. When they could afford it, she would buy the lot next door and expand. She also wanted to send sample cakes to the state house to generate high-profile business. Everything was going great. The coffeehouse was thriving. Her relationship with Nathaniel grew stronger each day. And she had Eliza and the children. **But she was empty inside. The fever had stained her life.** Grandpa and her mother were gone, and the ghosts of the fever days gripped her heart. Still, she was alive.

Suddenly, Nathaniel rushed into the coffeehouse from outside. President Washington was back from Virginia and riding through town on the way to the capital. The patrons ran to the street and vied for a spot to watch the procession. Washington rode a white horse and waved to the onlookers. Matilda watched, thinking about how happy Grandpa would have been.

Once the president’s procession was gone, a caravan of carriages and wagons moved down the road. They were filled with people finally returning now that the president had returned. If Washington was back, the fever was really over. One carriage stopped in front of the coffeehouse. A frail old woman stepped out supported by another woman. **When the old woman raised her head, Matilda saw the face of her mother.**

### Homecoming

Matilda ran to Lucille and enveloped her in a long embrace. Lucille was light as a feather. She introduced Mrs. Ludington to Matilda and seemed to struggle to get the words out. Nathaniel stepped forward and greeted Lucille with respect. He suggested they get her inside, where she could sit and rest. Lucille agreed. Matilda waited for her mother’s disapproval of Nathaniel, but it never came.

When they entered the coffeehouse, the room fell silent. Then, **one by one, each man stood to honor Lucille’s return**. Matilda and Mrs. Ludington half-walked, half-carried Lucille into the kitchen. Eliza burst into tears when she saw Lucille and quickly helped her get settled in a chair with a cup of coffee.

Matilda was filled with questions. She couldn’t believe Lucille was at the Ludingtons’ farm the whole time. Mrs. Ludington took the liberty of filling her in on her mother’s journey.

Lucille had traveled to the farm three days after Matilda and Grandpa left. But when she arrived and discovered they never showed, she became frantic with worry. They reached out to various towns along the path from Philadelphia, but no one had seen the girl and her grandfather. One night, Lucille took one of the farm horses and searched the countryside alone. She was still recovering from the fever, and she was close to death on the side of the road when they found her two days later. **It took Lucille weeks to recover, but her heart was damaged.** They didn’t feel it was safe to come back until President Washington returned.

After Mrs. Ludington left, Lucille looked around at the new coffeehouse and asked who was responsible for it. Matilda proudly said she’d decided to open the shop despite advice to sell. Matilda then launched into her own saga, starting with the moment Lucille was dumped on the sidewalk the day she fell ill. She told her mother about Grandpa’s death, but she left out the part about the intruders and how he’d died.

Lucille cried for her daughter’s struggles, and Matilda held her until there were no more tears to shed. **She noticed how still her mother’s once busy hands now were.** A feeling of sorrow passed through her. She feared what this meant about Lucille’s future. Matilda fought back tears and helped her mother upstairs.

### Epilogue: December 11, 1793

Matilda awoke in her dark room. Nell slept beside her, and Lucille snored peacefully in the next bed. The mornings had become increasingly cold, and Matilda didn’t want to leave her cozy blanket. But no one else was going to get the house in order for the day. She climbed out and dressed, then tiptoed down the stairs. In the room across the hall, Eliza and the twins were still dreaming.

In the kitchen, Matilda stoked the fire and set water to boil. She made coffee for herself and the others, adding a hunk of sugar to her cup—one of the perks of being the first one awake. As she set the table for breakfast, she thought about how the morning would go. Eliza would wake up and send the boys to fetch the newspaper. Lucille would complain that the twins were too young to run errands. And Nell would stick to Matilda’s hip all day, but Matilda didn’t mind. And once they could afford a cart and pony, her mother could venture out with the boys, leaving her and Eliza a few moments of peace to work.

Matilda took her coffee to the front step. She’d grown accustomed to watching the stars get erased by the first light. She enjoyed these few moments when the world was hers alone. It was peaceful in the city at that hour. **The calm made the calamity of the fever seem far away. The city had reclaimed its vibrance and moved on from the fever, but Matilda would not forget.**

In those silent morning moments, she could almost hear Polly laughing or Grandpa calling her name. She felt close to them, but the moments only lasted an instant. The sun always rose in the sky, as it was starting to do that morning. A new day filled with new hopes was starting. It was time to get to work.
