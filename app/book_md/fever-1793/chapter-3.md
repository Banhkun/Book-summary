## Chapter 3: A Family in Jeopardy—Sep 2-9, 1793

**Matilda’s life was about to change in ways she never could have imagined.** Grandpa checked Lucille’s pulse. She was alive but unconscious. He and Matilda carried her inside and up to the bedroom. Eliza screamed at the sight of Mrs. Cook unwell.

Grandpa assured the ladies that Lucille had merely passed out from the heat and exhaustion. A good rest should do the trick, but Matilda wasn’t so sure. Lucille opened her eyes briefly. Matilda waited for her to jump up and start ordering everyone around, but she didn’t. Instead, she told Matilda to take care of things downstairs while she rested. Her body shook with chills.

The day was a disaster. Matilda spilled coffee and tea everywhere, Eliza lost focus and burned food, and the patrons were tense and rowdy. When the day was finally over, only Grandpa and another man remained. His name was Mr. Rowley, and Grandpa told him about Lucille’s condition. Although he wasn’t a real doctor, Mr. Rowley did have some medical knowledge and offered to help. The real doctors were all down at the waterfront, where Eliza heard bodies were piling up like wood.

Matilda didn’t like Mr. Rowley. His hands and face were grimy, and he smelled like booze. **Rowley examined Lucille and said it wasn’t yellow fever, just a normal autumnal fever. There was nothing to worry about.** Eliza protested. The great Dr. Rush said that yellow fever was spreading through the city, she told him. But Rowley cautioned against such claims. He said one family had thrown the elderly matriarch out on the street when another doctor diagnosed her with yellow fever. She died, and it turned out to be a false diagnosis. Rowley collected his fee and was on his way. Grandpa William was triumphant at the news. He knew he’d been right about the misguided hysteria all along.

### The Fever Takes Hold

**Despite Rowley’s claims, Lucille was very ill. She needed round the clock care to get better.** Eliza and Matilda bathed her every four hours and changed the bedding each time. Matilda was mortified at having to bathe her mother, but Eliza couldn’t do it alone. They also gave her different teas that Rowley had prescribed, but nothing seemed to work.

Lucille deteriorated quickly. The fever grew and warped her mind, causing her to weep and call out for her husband. The chills were so bad, her teeth chattered. Her blue eyes showed streaks of red and yellow. Grandpa stayed with Mr. Carris to avoid catching something, and Eliza had to tend to her brother’s family in the evening. Matilda was on her own.

At night, Matilda sat vigil by her mother’s side. She looked into Lucille’s contorted face and wondered if her mother had ever been happy. Maybe death was a way she could be released from all the struggles she’d faced. Matilda grew emotional thinking of all the things her mother had tried to teach her that she always ignored. She prayed, read Psalms, and drifted to sleep.

Matilda woke suddenly to the sound of her mother getting sick. Lucille was vomiting blood, and her eyes rolled back in their sockets. Matilda screamed for help, then remembered she was alone. Lucille opened her eyes and looked at her daughter. She could barely form the words to tell Matilda to leave the room. A pungent black substance spewed from her mouth. Matilda tried to clean the mess. **She wanted to be there for her mother, but Lucille screamed for her to leave. She didn’t want her daughter infected with whatever was trying to kill her.**

### Into the Unknown

Four days later, the Cooks received an unpleasant surprise that would force them apart. Lucille was alive but pallid and weak. Eliza and Grandpa had tracked down a real doctor, Dr. Kerr, to examine Lucille. He was a small Scottish man who carried a little black medical bag. While he examined Lucille, he asked about her condition during the night. Matilda rushed to explain that she’d continued to bathe her every four hours and give her the teas from Rowley. She thought a simple case of autumnal fever would have cleared up by now.

**When Dr. Kerr learned about Rowley’s diagnosis, he called him a charlatan and said there was no question in his mind that Lucille had yellow fever.** Matilda couldn’t breathe. How could her mother be dying of a stupid fever? Her mother had cooked a feast for the whole family hours after giving birth and fended off British soldiers while her husband was fighting in the war. This woman couldn’t die so easily. She wouldn’t.

Dr. Kerr cut a vein on Lucille’s arm and collected the blood in a basin. When it was full, he filled up a second one. He took 10 ounces that day and would be back to take 10 more tomorrow. He prescribed medications to evacuate her stomach and bowels. He said Lucille was strong and could make it through with proper care.

After the bloodletting, Lucille roused and ordered Matilda out. Dr. Kerr escorted Matilda downstairs and gave Grandpa and Eliza the unhappy news that she should be sent to the country. **People were panicking, he said. It wasn’t safe for a young girl to be in the city right now.** Matilda threw a fit and refused to leave, but everyone thought it was best. A plan was made, and Grandpa left to secure a carriage for the journey.

After things settled down, Eliza remembered a package that had come for Matilda. It was a painting of flowers in a vase on a wooden board. The card attached was from Nathaniel Benson. He was locked in the Peale’s house with the family for protection. He wished Matilda safety and good health and promised they’d reunite when the plague was over.

The next morning, Grandpa packed their trunks and food pantry into a carriage belonging to a local farmer. He would accompany her on her journey to the country. When it was time to leave, he put on his regiment uniform and saluted Matilda. He clicked his heels together to bring some levity to the situation. Eliza and Matilda said an emotional goodbye, promising to see each other soon. Matilda climbed into the carriage next to her grandfather. **The carriage pulled away. Her journey into an unknown future began.**

### A Tragic Turn of Events

Matilda and Grandpa’s journey would end before it could begin after an encounter on the road. The farmer who owned the carriage sat up front with his wife and baby. Only one horse pulled the cart. The horse was so slow and starved, it took an hour just to get out of the city. The road was grooved from the mass exodus of carriages before them, and the carriage bounced around. The heat and insects were intense.

Matilda joked that the baby’s messed diaper was attracting the insects, which made Grandpa laugh. But**his laughter turned into a coughing fit, raising alarm for Matilda and the farmer**. Grandpa settled back and said they should enjoy the ride. He told Matilda it was time for her soldiering training.

Since she was little, Grandpa had trained her in the military tactics of both the American and British armies. Today, he quizzed her about the three most important things a soldier needed. She responded with good boots, a full stomach, and plenty of sleep. Grandpa clomped his boots and patted his belly. He had the first two. Now it was time for the third. He leaned back and drifted to sleep, and Matilda leaned against him to do the same.

Matilda jerked awake when the carriage came to a stop. Up ahead, four men with guns on horses blocked the road. Everyone assumed they were robbers, and the farmer reached for his knife. Matilda tried to rouse Grandpa, but he didn’t budge.

One of the men rode over and said they were checking all carriages passing through their town for the fever. They had a doctor who would examine everyone. The farmer and his family jumped down and passed the test. But **Matilda couldn’t wake Grandpa up. She shook him hard, but he still didn’t move**. The doctor forced his eyes open, which finally brought Grandpa back. When he woke up, he was confused and started coughing immediately.

The doctor covered his mouth and declared Grandpa too sick to pass through town. They’d have to go back. Grandpa said it was just summer grippe, but they didn’t listen. The farmer asked why his family should be held up when he’d only picked these two up off the side of the road a few minutes before? Matilda called him a liar, but it did no good. **The farmer was allowed to ride away, taking the Cooks’ supplies and luggage with him.** The men on the horses left, and Matilda and Grandpa were left to walk home.

### Lost and Alone

All of Matilda’s soldiering training was about to come in handy as she and Grandpa made their way down the road. **They hadn’t walked far before Grandpa was taken by the chills.** They found a chestnut tree and sat beneath it. Grandpa was out as soon as he hit the ground.

Matilda was scared, but she tried to keep her head. She told herself it was just summer grippe. It had to be. She couldn’t take care of Grandpa if it was something worse. They needed food and water, so she grabbed his canteen and kissed him goodbye on his hot and clammy forehead.

At the top of the hill, she spotted a line of willow trees. Her training told her that willow trees meant a nearby water source. She ran toward them and found a stream. She also found a raspberry bush, which she knew meant rabbits were in the area. It was much cooler by the water than where she’d left Grandpa, so she made a plan. She and Grandpa would walk to the stream and stay as long as they needed to for him to get better. They’d snare rabbits and cook them over a fire. With fresh water and food, he would get enough strength to make the 10-mile journey back to the city.

When she returned to the chestnut tree, she woke up Grandpa and gave him the water. She checked his eyes—red but no yellow. A good sign. While he ate raspberries, she told him about her plan. She said they’d get him home to his own bed soon.

Grandpa asked her to come closer so he could see her face. He said he’d been a fool for not listening to Lucille’s fears and warnings. The sun set, and the stars came out. **Grandpa told Matilda he was concerned for her future. They needed a strategy now and for the rest of the war.** She waited for his orders, but he didn’t give any. Fear took her when she realized he was waiting for hers. She decided they’d move camp in the morning.
