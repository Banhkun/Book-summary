## Exercise: Decide Your Next Move

Getting through your tasks boils down to determining the next actions for each item on your to-do list.

* * *

What is a task or project—big or small—that you’ve been putting off?

If you have a list or organizer where you keep things like this, have you listed this item as a project or as the next action?

If your entry doesn’t reflect an actual physical action, take a moment to clarify what the next action is. What is it?

When can you commit to completing this action?
