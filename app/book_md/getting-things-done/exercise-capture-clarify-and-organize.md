## Exercise: Capture, Clarify, and Organize

Open loops can be mentally draining before you’ve even made any progress on completing the task. Apply this exercise to your open loops to help clear your mind and get things done.

* * *

Name a project or task that’s been weighing on your mind, anything from a project at work to planning your next vacation.

In one sentence, what is a successful outcome that would make you consider this project done?

What’s the immediate next physical action you need to do in order to move things forward on this?

How do you feel now toward the situation compared to how you felt at the beginning of this exercise?
