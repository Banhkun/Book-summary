## Part 2 | Chapter 4: Set Yourself Up for GTD Success

Now that you’ve learned the models and the methods, it’s time to start applying the Getting Things Done program to your life.

It’s one thing to _know_ what you should do, and quite another to actually _do_ it, so Part 2 provides some coaching and practical tools for implementing the GTD system. You can implement the full-scale system, or adopt a few aspects and implement more over time.

### Dedicate Time

Your biggest time investment will be in getting the GTD system up and running. It takes most people two days back-to-back to fully get things started—about a day to capture and another day to clarify and determine next actions.

**The initial process takes a lot of mental energy, so aim to dedicate a day or two to it with no distractions.** If you work on this after you get home from work at the end of the day, your energy will probably be too tapped to effectively capture and clarify everything without falling down rabbit holes.

Once you have the system set up and in place, you’ll be able to maintain it during much shorter windows of free time in your days.

### Dedicate Space

Designate a physical location in your home where you can manage your workflow and keep your in-trays and files. Even if your system is mostly digital, it’s almost inevitable that you’ll have some papers to deal with, so you need a place to store and process them.

Your workspace should have:

  * A writing surface
  * An in-tray
  * Space for a computer or other necessary digital devices



You may also want:

  * A printer
  * File drawers
  * Stacking trays
  * Reference shelves
  * A whiteboard



**If you work at an office, create an almost identical setup at work so that you can manage your system wherever you are when things come up.** If you share a workspace at home or at work, carve out your own space in order to keep your system organized and effective.

If you travel a lot or work remotely, you may also want a portable office with a briefcase, satchel, or backpack as well as necessary folders and workstation supplies (we’ll get into those in the next section); don’t lose valuable opportunities to be productive when you’re in transit and unprepared.

### Get The Right Tools

You need a handful of supplies in your workspace to make this system go.

In addition to whatever you choose to use for capturing, organizing, and maintaining your lists (such as planners, notebooks, a computer, tablet, and/or phone), you’ll need:

  * Calendar for tracking date-specific actions and reminders (you can keep using whatever calendar you currently use; once you start using the GTD system you’ll get a better sense of whether you need a different type of calendar)
  * File folders for organizing projects and general reference materials 
  * Automatic labeler for file folders 
  * Paper-holding trays for your in-tray, out-tray, work-in-progress tray, and/or read-and-review tray
  * Pen or pencil 
  * For organizing and filing papers:
    * Paper clips
    * Rubber bands
    * Scotch tape
    * Stapler
    * Sticky notes
  * Plain paper or notepad for capturing and making lists
  * Trash or recycling bin to keep your space (and mind) clear of unnecessary items 



You may or may not also want to use some kind of organizer, whether it’s a planner, notebook, phone app, or some combination. If you’re already using something and it’s working for you, incorporate it into this system.

**The GTD program isn’t rigid; tailor it in a way that will get you to use the system.**

#### Your Filing System Is Vital For Success

A well-organized, easy-to-navigate filing system is essential.

**Create a filing system that’s quick and easy to use to make it as easy as possible for you to clear your in-tray and keep your whole organization system running smoothly.** If it’s clunky and unappealing, you’re likely to put it off and end up with papers stacked in the wrong places, clogging up your workflow.

Keep a functional general-reference file, which can hold instruction manuals, brochures, articles, membership cards, flash drives, even foreign currency you want to keep for your next trip. If you don’t have a place for documents that aren’t actionable but that contain information you might need later, they’ll clutter up your workspace and your mind, making it hard to keep up with the system.

If you prefer, you can also digitize just about everything in your files (except the currency) to make it accessible from anywhere. But allow some time to figure out the scanning, organizing, and digital storage workflow that works best for you.

Here are some tips to make your filing system a success:

  * **Keep your general-reference files within arm’s reach.** An easy and accessible system encourages you to keep up with it and file documents away before they pile up in your in-tray. 
  * **Keep extra file folders on hand.** Eliminate any roadblocks to filing, so if you have something that doesn’t fit in an existing file, make a file on the spot and keep things moving. 
  * **Use your labeler to label files.** The uniformity is aesthetically pleasing and makes the filing system easier to use. 
  * **Alphabetize your files.** Instead of organizing files by subject or project, keep them in alphabetical order for simplicity and to minimize the chance that you won’t remember where something is when you’re looking for it. 
  * **Don’t overstuff your filing cabinet.** Try to keep your file drawer from getting more than three-quarters full. You’ll be less inclined to file if it’s overflowing. If you have to buy another filing cabinet, first see if you have any files you can purge and then accept that if things are worth keeping, they’re worth keeping organized. 
  * **Comb through files and purge once a year.** Regularly purging your files has two benefits: First, it keeps things clean, current, and organized. Second, you can feel comfortable keeping and filing documents that you’re not sure you’ll need, because you’ll have the chance to reassess during your annual purge. (It may be helpful to put a reminder for your yearly purge day on your calendar or in your tickler file.)
