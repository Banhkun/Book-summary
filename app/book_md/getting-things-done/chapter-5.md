## Chapter 5: Step 1—Capture Everything

Now that you have your workspace set up and the time set aside, dive in with the first step: capturing.

There are a few benefits to getting everything in one place in front of you before you begin the next step, clarifying:

  1. You know how much stuff you have to go through. 
  2. You have a definitive endpoint (at least for now, until life gives you more to capture). 
  3. You can focus on clarifying and organizing when you get to those steps, without feeling like there’s still more stuff out there. 



### Part 1: Capture Physical Items

Capturing is more all-encompassing than simply jotting down a list off the top of your head. For your initial capturing, go through physical holders of notes and reminders, including:

  * Bulletin boards 
  * Cabinets 
  * Countertops 
  * Desktop
  * Desk drawers
  * Floors 
  * Office (or second office space)
  * Shelves



If you can’t get to every spot right now, make a placeholder note (e.g. “Clean out hall closet”) and put it in your in-tray to remind you to do it later.

Gather anything that doesn’t belong where it is the way it is, and put it all into your in-tray. This includes:

  * Binders 
  * Business cards
  * Catalogs 
  * Mail
  * Manuals
  * Notes
  * Reading material 
  * Receipts 
  * Reference materials 
  * Reports



By the nature of this process, **you’ll end up with a lot of things that aren’t that important** —that’s why you probably put them off in the first place. **But you need to capture them nonetheless** so that you have no open loops.

Follow these guidelines for capturing:

  * Scan your entire physical surroundings for anything that is incomplete (for example, gadgets that need to be repaired and furniture you’ve been meaning to move). 
  * Generally, you can leave supplies (such as stationery, batteries, and paper clips), reference material (such as software manuals and contact lists), decorations (such as photos and artwork), and equipment (such as a computer and printer) where they are _unless_ there’s something about them you need to move, fix, update, or otherwise alter. 
  * **This isn’t about throwing everything away. This system is designed to allow you to keep everything you want to keep** , as long as it’s either the way you want and in the place you want it or it has been captured.



#### Beware of Capturing Pitfalls

Capturing is a big job, and it’s easy to get tripped up along the way. There are several common capturing issues that you can avoid.

First, if an item is too big to physically fit in your in-tray, simply write a note on a piece of paper to represent it (it’s good practice to date it, too) and put that in your in-tray. If your pile of papers is too big to fit in your in-tray, make stacks around the in-tray and just be careful that it’s clear that they’re “in” and they don’t get mixed up with other documents.

Second, when you come across things that you immediately know you won’t need, trash it on the spot. However, if you have any doubt, just put it in your in-tray and rest assured that you’ll have time to assess it during the clarifying stage; clarifying requires a different mindset, and you don’t want to let yourself get caught up in that right now. For now, just **focus on capturing everything as quickly as possible.**

Similarly, don’t fall into a rabbit hole of purging and organizing as you go through your house, office, and other physical spaces. If you have the time to do it, then go for it, but capturing is your priority. To keep things moving, add papers to your in-tray that remind you to “purge kitchen cabinet” or “organize desk” later.

Third, if you already have certain items on lists or in organizers, simply treat them as items to be processed. You want everything in a single, uniform system, so unless your current organization fits the GTD model, you need to reorganize it.

Fourth, if you come across something that you forgot about but is fairly urgent, you can:

  1. Do it now. It’s best to avoid interrupting the capturing process, but if it’s absolutely urgent, you’re better off getting it done and off your mind. 
  2. Put it in the in-tray. Don’t worry about losing it in the ever-growing stack in your in-tray because you’ll be sorting through that pile next so you’ll come across this reminder within the next couple of hours or days. 
  3. Put it in an emergency stack. Ideally, you want everything in a single in-tray pile, but if this solution puts your mind at ease you’ll be better able to finish capturing. 



### Part 2: Capture Mental Items

After sweeping through your office, home, and anywhere else you’ve stored tasks and reminders, wrack your brain for anything else that’s still pulling at your attention. Just like with the physical capturing process, **capture everything—big and small, urgent and aspirational—that’s taking up any space in your brain.**

Write each thought, idea, project, and reminder on a separate sheet of paper. This might seem inefficient, and you’ll probably end up with a lot of papers, but this makes the clarifying stage much easier.

Random thoughts may remind you of certain tasks, so review these lists of “Incompletion Triggers” to see if it reminds you of something you need to capture. (Shortform note: The book includes more exhaustive lists. We encourage reading the original book for a complete guide to setting up your GTD system.)

**Professional Incompletion Triggers**

  * Projects to be researched, started, or completed
  * Phone calls, voicemails, and emails 
  * Reports and evaluations
  * Meetings to be scheduled
  * Marketing plans
  * Upcoming events
  * Presentations
  * Professional development
  * Skills to learn or practice
  * Staffing
  * Sales and customer service



**Personal Incompletion Triggers**

  * Family commitments and communications
  * Friend commitments and communications 
  * Community commitments
  * Spiritual organization 
  * Birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, weddings, and other events 
  * Travel 
  * Financial (e.g. bills, debts, investments, loans, and taxes)
  * Repairs
  * Home/household maintenance and tasks
  * Shopping and errands



Most digital items should be converted to some kind of paper version and added to the in-tray: **Jot down voicemails on a piece of paper and print out digital to-do lists.** The exception is emails, which should stay where they are because there are probably many and you can organize them within your email server.
