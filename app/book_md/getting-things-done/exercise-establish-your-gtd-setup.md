## Exercise: Establish Your GTD Setup

Implementing the GTD system requires some time, space, and the right tools.

* * *

Looking at your schedule, when can you dedicate a day or two to setting up your GTD system, ideally without any distractions?

Where in your home can you dedicate a workspace (that you donâ€™t have to share) to keep your in-trays, files, and tools?

Which tools do you need to buy to set up your workspace?

If you plan to use digital storage, what system or software do you plan to use?
