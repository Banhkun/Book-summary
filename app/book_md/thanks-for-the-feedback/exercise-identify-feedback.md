## Exercise: Identify Feedback

There are three kinds of feedback: evaluation (“Here’s where you stand”), coaching (“Here’s what you should do”), and appreciation (“Great job!”). These three types of feedback are best approached separately but are often not. Practice being aware of each and separating them yourself so you can better manage the conversation.

* * *

Think back to your last conflict with a friend, loved one, or colleague. What pieces of his or her feedback were evaluation?

What pieces of that conversation were coaching?

Did you have trouble distinguishing between the two? Did one drown out the other?

How could the threads of that conversation have been more effectively presented? (For example, would it have helped if the evaluation elements came before the coaching elements? Would it have been better if the feedback-giver gave only one type of feedback?)

How might your reactions and consequent behaviors be different in response to this more effective feedback?
