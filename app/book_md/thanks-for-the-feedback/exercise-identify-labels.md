## Exercise: Identify Labels

Labels are shorthand for feedback. They are usually pithy phrases that sum up a person’s thoughts but are vague and open to interpretation (and misinterpretation): “Be a team player”; “Act your age”; “You’re not his mother.”

* * *

Think back to your last performance evaluation or feedback conversation. What labels were used to convey that feedback?

When you heard that label, you made an assumption about what it meant. How did you interpret it?

What are some other meanings it could have had?
