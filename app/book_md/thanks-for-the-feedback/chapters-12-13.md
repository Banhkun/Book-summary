## Chapters 12-13: Incorporating Feedback

At this point, you’ve gotten a handle on how to understand feedback, respond to it, and have a feedback conversation. We’ll now look at the next steps: what you do with that feedback and how you can incorporate it into your life individually and your organization.

### Incorporating Feedback at an Individual Level

There are five techniques that can help you incorporate feedback into your life:

  1. Focus on one thing.
  2. Look for appropriate options.
  3. Test with small experiments.
  4. Get properly motivated.
  5. Make the other person feel included.



#### 1\. Focus on One Thing

Sometimes feedback has several strands and encompasses a wide area. Often it is vague. Get a handle on it by approaching just one specific aspect of it first.

  * **Take it step-by-step:** Instead of asking, “Can I get some feedback?” ask, “What’s **one thing** you see me doing that I can improve?” or “What am I _not_ doing that I should be?” 
  * **Look for themes:** Ask several people the “one thing” question to get a fuller picture. Then look for themes and commonalities among that feedback you receive. If your feedback is, for example, related to a performance review, seek out two or three colleagues as well as your manager and maybe someone from a different department, and ask them one thing they see you doing that you could improve.
  * **Focus on impact:** Ask the feedback-giver for one thing you could do that would make a difference to _her specifically_. Framing the question in this way can reveal issues at the core of your intersection with her. When a mother asks her kids what’s one thing she could do that would help them out, one of them might reply, “We never go on hikes as a family anymore.” His feedback might reveal a lack of connection that she had overlooked in the busyness of daily life.



#### 2\. Look for Options

Once you’ve successfully understood the feedback you’re presented with and you’ve decided to incorporate it into your life, you must figure out exactly how to do that. Make sure you understand the giver’s true interests, then look for options that address them.

Positions are what people say they want; interests are what they actually want. A person might say “I want you to be on time,” but what they really mean is “I want you to care.” Look for options that address their underlying concern. If a doctor is getting complaints that she’s regularly late for appointments, hanging a sign in the waiting room explaining that patients are never rushed through appointments and therefore appointments can sometimes run late lets her patients know that the issue is not that she doesn't care about them, but that she cares a lot.

#### 3\. Test With Small Experiments

At times, even when you know you need to change, it can be hard to let go of habits that are comfortable and predictable. At other times, you’re not sure if changing _is_ the right way to go. And sometimes, you’re not sure if you want to bother changing, even if you know the feedback you’ve received is spot-on. This is especially true if the problem hasn’t impacted your life in a huge way—yet. Maybe you know you are always late to things, but in general, other than missing a few opening acts and having to apologize to friends left waiting, it hasn’t resulted in any huge problems.

Whether you’re not sure how to get started, not sure if you should, or not sure whether to bother, running small experiments is a great way to put that metaphorical toe in the water. Testing out advice on a small level lowers the stakes and the potential costs of committing to a big change. It also shows the other person that you are taking their insights seriously, which can have relationship advantages that reach beyond this specific issue.

  * **Run thought experiments:** Sometimes simply running through the experiment in your head is enough to reveal some insight. Sit with the possibility that the feedback is true for a few days. Take some time to think about it, allowing your emotions to cool and your triggers to fade. This will enable you to see what might be right even if you don’t agree with the overall assessment.
  * **Run real-world experiments:** Think about a small, introductory way that you can try out the advice you’ve received. Been told to exercise more but joining a gym is a big budgetary commitment? Instead, commit to going for a jog once a week, or doing ten push-ups every morning. Low-cost experiments can show you how changes are more approachable than you might have expected.



#### 4\. Get Properly Motivated

You can increase the likelihood that you’ll stick with a new behavioral regime by **increasing the immediate, tangible benefits of change.**

  * **Make it social:** Partnering with another person incorporates an element of fun to something that might not otherwise be and helps us stick with changes. It reframes your struggle as “our struggle.” It makes you accountable to someone else. 
  * **Keep score:** Find ways to measure your progress on your journey of change and then compete against them, trying to best yourself. Games appeal to our instincts for fun and for mastering problems, and they provide opportunities for dopamine hits that increase the pleasure you get out of an activity. So-called “gamification” is now used in all sorts of pursuits to encourage people to do things, like science courses that use competition to hook their students on finding knowledge. 
  * **Increasing the stakes:** Invent a consequence that will inspire you to stay the course. You might want to enlist a friend to help you with this, as you’re likely to end up not following through on any consequences you’ve set for yourself. For example, a doctor who helped other doctors break their drug habits did so in part by having each of them write a letter to the medical board confessing their addiction. They then gave that letter, signed, addressed, and stamped, to a friend, with instructions to mail it if they lapsed. In this way, they made their commitment not just about their own addiction, but about their career, too. 



**Be aware that things often get harder before they get easier when you start on a new program of change.** We are often less efficient, comfortable, or happy when we begin to work on new skills. This is typically the point at which most people abandon the program. To prevent this, commit to pursuing your new course of action for a specifically designated period of time so your program has the time it needs to start working. This might be three days, two weeks, or a year, depending on the specifics of your project.

#### 5\. Make the Other Person Feel Included

Allowing the feedback-giver to help you can transform your relationship. The fact that you are trusting of her and confident enough to ask for her help makes her feel appreciated and respected. Being open to her advice also allows her to feel open to your advice later. If there’s something you want to talk to another person about, but she seems resistant, try opening yourself up to advice from her first on something else. It may spark the connection she needed to allow her to listen to your feedback.

In the end, feedback isn’t just about the quality of the advice—it’s about the quality of the relationship between you.

### Incorporating Feedback at an Organizational Level

There’s no such thing as a perfect feedback system for any given organization. Every system will have tradeoffs. It will work well for some, be adequate for others, and be poorly suited to still others. There are some things you can do, though, to give your chosen system the best shot at success. We’ll examine these techniques through three perspectives: senior leadership and HR; team leaders and coaches; and receivers.

#### Senior Leadership and HR

As the most visible players, a company’s leadership and HR are expected to spearhead performance management systems. Promoting a culture of learning can lay the groundwork and being honest about a system’s benefits and tradeoffs can help smooth a rollout.

##### Promote a Culture of Learning

As discussed earlier, people who view feedback as an opportunity to learn respond to it better and improve themselves from it more. There are specific things you can do to encourage a culture of learning:

  * **Highlight journeys of learning:** When someone is successful and moves up the ranks, talk about her learning skills—curiosity and openness to feedback, for example—rather than her innate skills like likeability, gregariousness, and intelligence.
  * **Encourage growth identities:** Teach your employees about the differences between growth and fixed identities. Draw the connection between a growth identity and better performance. 
  * **Discuss feedback-receiving methods and “second scores”:** Talk about blind spots, triggers, and common misinterpretations. Introduce the concept of grading yourself on how you take feedback.
  * **Create multiple feedback tracks:** Create an official feedback track and a more unofficial one. Track 1 includes performance evaluation systems, mentoring and training programs, and the like. Track 2 encompasses things like informal coaching among friends and colleagues, company stories about success or failure, or an exchange of helpful books.
  * **Emphasize positive social norms:** Highlighting the good things people are doing improves behavior more than highlighting the bad things people do, because the behavior you highlight will be seen as the “norm.” Instead of pointing out that 40 percent of employees still haven’t turned in their self-evaluations, note that 60 percent have, and thank them for doing so. Those who have will feel appreciated, and those who haven’t will feel out of step with their peers. 
  * **Cultivate a culture of shared learning:** Promote the idea that “we are all in this together,” and that a well-functioning feedback system benefits everyone, not just the people at the top who are usually the ones giving feedback. Emphasize the learning component of feedback over the evaluation or consequence aspect.



##### Explain Tradeoffs as Well as Benefits

Often when rolling out a new performance evaluation system, senior leadership and HR extol its benefits in an effort to get the rest of the company behind it. This is an understandable impulse but can have unintended consequences. Employees are quick to pick up on something that sounds too good to be true. If lower-level employees sense their seniors are trying to manipulate their reactions through unrealistic optimism, they’ll react by balancing it with extra skepticism. The company becomes divided into cheerleaders (leadership and HR) and “sneerleaders” (everyone else).

A better approach is one that feels more honest. Promote benefits but also address shortcomings. This will allow employees to be better prepared for how to manage the program and what to expect from it. In particular, address:

  * The goals of the system
  * The reason this system was chosen over others
  * The potential costs as well as benefits
  * The consequences of half-hearted participation
  * An invitation for further discussion and feedback



##### Model Receiving Feedback as the Boss

If senior leadership models the feedback-receiving experience, the system will be much more readily accepted across all levels of the organization. It can also be an illuminating exercise for that leadership.

Typically when we ask for feedback, we seek people who are somewhat at the same level of expertise and experience as we are, or ideally, who are ahead of us. Sometimes, though, it’s useful to seek the opinions of those behind us in experience or expertise. Some of the best forms of coaching can actually come from your subordinates, who can see your blind spots and how they affect people at all levels around you. They are hyper-aware of any inconsistencies in your messaging and anything that creates extra work for them.

Actively seek out input from those below you. Establish concrete ways in which people can approach you with insight. Consider establishing “reverse mentorships” with one or more people in several levels of the organization, who you trust to alert you to concerns from different departments or offices of the company. Your goal when seeking feedback as the boss is to discover how your priorities are and aren’t affecting all parts of the organization, and to look out for unintended effects of initiatives.

#### Team Leaders and Coaches

A company is a collection of subcultures. Team leaders can have a significant impact on the productivity and satisfaction of their particular corner of the organization. Establish healthy feedback systems on your team by modeling your own system, knowing the difference between short-term pain and long-term gain, and being aware of individual differences among your teammates.

  * **Model learning and request coaching:** Just as we discussed for senior leadership, it’s crucial for team leaders to show that they, too, are open to learning, not just from those above them but also from peers and subordinates. Make your efforts explicit: encourage your employees to raise issues with you and follow up on their concerns with full discussions using the techniques discussed in this book. 
  * **Distinguish between short- and long-term pain:** No one likes to deliver hard news, but sparing someone the unpleasantness of hearing difficult feedback backfires if it causes them to miss out on future opportunities like promotions. Have empathy, but also be clear and honest.
  * **Be aware of individual differences:** Recognize that people have different sensitivities to feedback which can be reflected not only in how they receive feedback but also in how they give it. If you are not very sensitive, you might assume others are equally resilient, but your frank advice might not be taken so well by a more sensitive person. Keep this in mind and encourage those you are coaching to coach your coaching so that you all stay on the same page. 



#### Receivers

The most important thing to remember is that as a receiver of feedback, you drive the process and control your own learning. Be proactive—seek out advice from those who can help you. Observe successful people and try to figure out what they’re doing differently. Be open, try out advice, and communicate clearly.

**In the end, although learning is a shared experience, your own individual progress is up to you.**
