## Exercise: Examine Your Temperament

Your temperament is a combination of your baseline emotional state, your typical emotional swing in response to events, and the speed of your return to your baseline.

* * *

Examine your own baseline. Are you generally upbeat or anxious? Is your mood overall positive or apprehensive?

Think back to the last time a stranger gave you a negative evaluation. This could be a driver who honked at you, a customer who complained about your service, or a person who passed you irritatedly on the sidewalk (perhaps even muttering something unmentionable under her breath). Examine your emotional response. How strongly did you swing off your baseline?

How was your recovery from that incident? Did you bounce back quickly or did the feeling stick with you? Did you brush it off or continue to think about it hours later?
