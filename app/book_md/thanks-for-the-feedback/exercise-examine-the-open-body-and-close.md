## Exercise: Examine the Open, Body, and Close

The opening of the conversation is where you’ll get aligned with the other person on the purpose and tone of the conversation. The body is where you’ll discuss the content of the feedback. The closing is where you’ll clarify next steps and expectations.

* * *

Think of the last time you were approached with feedback by someone in either your professional or personal life. Come up with two or three questions that you could have asked yourself or the other person that would have helped you both align your expectations for the discussion.

In the body of that conversation, did you hit all of the steps to thoroughly discuss feedback? (Did you listen in a focused way and ask emotion-free questions? Did you ask for clarification on anything vague? Did you offer your own interpretations and let her know your reasoning behind your choices?) Which steps could have been better implemented, and how?

Did you leave the conversation with a clear understanding of what she expected next from you? Did she leave with a clear understanding of your takeaways?

What can you do differently next time you speak with this person about this or another issue?
