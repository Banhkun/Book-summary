## Exercise: Examine Emotional Reactions Thoughtfully

When we are in a negative frame of mind, we can lose perspective and imagine the worst of every piece of feedback we receive, linking it to every similar incident from the past and exaggerating and distorting any possible consequences.

* * *

What’s a negative piece of feedback that you’ve received—maybe an employee evaluation or an overheard comment from a friend—that made you exaggerate the enormity of the situation? Did it make you remember every similar incident from the past? Did it make you think everyone felt this way about you?

How did you recover from that emotional setback? Did the passage of time put it into perspective? Or were you able to talk yourself off the proverbial ledge and realize that your exaggeration was misplaced?

Think of a time you imagined horrible consequences but later laughed at the incident. What triggered you to initially respond with such strong emotion? How could you have found the humor in the situation earlier?
