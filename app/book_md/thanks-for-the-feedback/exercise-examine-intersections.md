## Exercise: Examine Intersections

Intersections are where differences in opinions, values, and habits clash, when they were not a problem on their own. Roles can create adversity between two people who otherwise would not conflict, simply because of the responsibilities that come along with that role. Examine both intersections and roles to see the bigger picture of a conflict.

* * *

Think of a time when your habits, opinions, or values suddenly became a problem when you started interacting with someone new, when none of those things had been problems on their own. What differences caused these conflicts?

Were you able to find common ground with the other person despite these differences? How?

Think back to a recent conflict that resulted in an exchange of feedback. Was this person from another department? Was she a family member? How did the different roles you each played affect how you reacted to each other?
