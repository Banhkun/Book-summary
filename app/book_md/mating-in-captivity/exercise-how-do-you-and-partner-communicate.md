## Exercise: How Do You and Partner Communicate?

There are two ways to communicate, verbally and physically.

* * *

Do you prefer to communicate verbally or physically? How do you know?

Does your partner communicate verbally or physically? How do you know?

If you and your partner don’t communicate the same way, how might you start learning to speak their language? (For example, if they’re a physical communicator, you might try to communicate physically by playing a game. If they’re a verbal communicator, you might try expressing a feeling using words.)
