## Exercise: How Do You Balance Dependence and Independence?

We learn about dependence and independence during our childhood, and we carry what weâ€™ve learned into our adult relationships.

* * *

As a child, in what areas did you depend on your parents?

In what areas did you want to be independent?

Are these the same areas you depend on/are independent from your partner?

What did you learn about your gender and sexuality from observing your parents?
