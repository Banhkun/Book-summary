## Exercise: Unlimit Yourself

According to Kwik, becoming limitless starts with your mindframe—you have to overcome your self-limiting beliefs.

* * *

What’s one self-limiting belief that you have? For example, if you think that you’re not good at math, or art, or that you’re socially awkward, those are all self-limiting beliefs.

What’s the _truth_ about that belief? For instance, are you really “bad at math,” or did it just not interest you enough to practice it? Are you actually bad in social situations, or do you come out of your shell when you’re around people you’re comfortable with?

Now that you’ve identified your self-limiting belief, what new belief can you replace it with?
