## Exercise: Assess Conspiracy Theories

Cooper makes a wide variety of claims in _Behold a Pale Horse_ , but the ones that have had the most lasting impact are his descriptions of psyops, or deliberate attempts by the Illuminati and the American government to manipulate people’s behavior through propaganda, staged violence, and economic shocks.

* * *

Which of Cooper’s theories or sub-claims—about the Illuminati, the American government, or the presence of aliens on Earth—do you find most convincing? Why?

Have you encountered theories similar to Cooper’s before? If so, describe one. (For example, theories about pandemics, terrorist attacks, elections, and recessions.)

Did you find this theory believable? Why or why not?
