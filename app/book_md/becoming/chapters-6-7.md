## Chapters 6-7: Princeton Years (1981-1985)

These chapters focus on Michelle's undergraduate years at Princeton University, her experience as a Black woman in classrooms full of white men, and her first job working with children. These years are critical to Michelle’s “becoming”: As her skills and capabilities develop, she learns to believe in herself. She sees that even in the most daunting situations in college or in her work-study job, she can rise to meet the challenge.

### A New Start at Princeton

In 1981, 17-year-old Michelle went off to Princeton, leaving behind everything she loved in Chicago, including her boyfriend of the last year. Although she knew he was a great guy and she loved him, she also knew he didn't fit into her new life.

#### Being in the Minority

**At Princeton, Michelle experienced being in the minority for the first time.** Her**** first few weeks at Princeton were an orientation period just for minority students, so she didn't immediately notice much disparity between herself and her peers.**** Princeton admitted some of the students to fill affirmative action quotas; others were student-athletes in the top tier of their sports. Some incoming freshmen were much like her—exceptional achievers whose parents had scrimped and saved to send them to an Ivy League school.

But as soon as the entire student body showed up for the semester’s official start, she saw the majority were white men. **Men outnumbered women two to one. Black students made up less than 9% of Michelle's class.** Many students came from privileged or wealthy backgrounds—some even arrived on campus in their parents' limousines.

Michelle had never been part of a mostly white community, and she felt that her skin color made her stand out. **It required extra effort to act comfortable and confident when she was the only nonwhite person sitting in a classroom, joining an intramural team, or trying out for a part in a play.**

She saw some students of color experience more blatant discrimination. In one instance, a Black female student was called to the dean's office because her white roommate had complained that she had “big Black guys” in their room to celebrate her birthday.

**Other instances of discrimination were invisible to Michelle.** Midway through her freshman year, Michelle's white roommate moved out of their room, but Michelle never found out why until 25 years later. As Michelle and Barack rose to political prominence, the roommate was featured on the news. She told this account of what happened: Her white mother had been horrified to learn that one of her daughter's roommates (Michelle) was Black, and she demanded that the college separate them. Princeton moved the white girl into another room, but kept the entire incident under wraps.

#### Thriving at Princeton

**Given the white-male-dominated milieu at Princeton, Michelle felt compelled to work even harder to overcome racial stereotypes.** She quickly learned not to feel intimidated by the white males who spoke up most often in class. She realized they weren't smarter than she was; they were just more confident.

She focused all her efforts on excelling in her classes, following a strict, unrelenting study schedule every day. While majoring in sociology and African-American studies, she gained a reputation as the kind of high-achiever who spent evenings in the library color-coding her extremely organized class notes. She constantly reviewed her progress, counted her victories, and reassessed her goals. **She never wavered from her goals of scoring higher and achieving more.**

Meanwhile, Michelle also came to appreciate the luxuries that Princeton afforded—vast libraries, beautiful buildings, meticulously maintained grounds, a wealth of delicious food in the dining halls, and the chance to play sports like squash and lacrosse that were unheard of at Michelle's inner-city high school.

Michelle also enjoyed the advantages of being Craig’s little sister. Craig had established himself on campus by playing on Princeton's varsity basketball team, and he was able to introduce her to his broad array of friends.

One of Craig’s friends was Kevin, a Princeton football player who became Michelle’s boyfriend. She loved being with Kevin because he was lighthearted, fun, and much less achievement-oriented than she was. He planned to attend medical school, but in his senior year, he made a surprising switch: **He decided to audition for the job of the Cleveland Browns’ mascot—a guy dressed up in an animal costume.**

Michelle judged Kevin harshly for this. She couldn’t understand why Kevin wasn’t as driven as she was.

#### Befriending Suzanne

**Craig also introduced Michelle to Suzanne Alele, a premed student who quickly became one of Michelle's best friends despite their polar-opposite personalities.** While Michelle was organized and meticulous, Suzanne was messy and carefree. Michelle was a planner, and Suzanne made decisions on the spur of the moment. Still, the two became inseparable and eventually shared an apartment together.

Michelle reflects that later in life when she lived with Barack—a man who never folded his clothes and left piles of belongings in every room—she was able to coexist peacefully with him because of her experiences living with Suzanne.

### Michelle's First Job

As part of her financial aid package at Princeton, Michelle needed a work-study job. She worked as an assistant to Czerny Brasuell, the director of the Third World Center, a Princeton institution dedicated to supporting students of color. The center offered tutoring services and hosted parties and shared meals, and **Czerny became one of Michelle's early and most important mentors.**

Michelle quickly learned to be prepared for any assignment—typing up memos, babysitting Czerny’s son, answering questions from students, even driving around New York City while Czerny ran errands. The job's many demands and Czerny's mentorship helped Michelle overcome her inhibitions. Through her work, she came to realize she was a capable, responsible adult who could handle whatever came her way.

### Working With Children

Czerny suggested that Michelle open up a day care center at Princeton because many Princeton professors needed childcare for their kids. Michelle enjoyed watching over Czerny's child, so she agreed to expand her services. She quickly found that working with children was exhausting but immensely satisfying. She loved to play with the professors' kids and help them with their elementary school homework.

### Fraser's Health Declines

Michelle called home from school every week to tell her parents all about her life at Princeton and to learn what was new in her extended family and her South Side neighborhood. On every call, her father Fraser always spoke as if everything was fine. He never mentioned that his condition was worsening. **When asked about his health, he changed the subject or refused to talk about it.**

One day when her parents drove all day from Chicago to Princeton to see Craig play in a basketball game, Michelle was shocked to see**her father was now using a wheelchair.** Marian had to push him into the gym to watch Craig play. Michelle begged Fraser to see a specialist or go to physical therapy, but her father refused, preferring to cope with his condition himself.

### Elder Relatives Die

Shortly before her junior year, Michelle experienced the death of two close relatives. Both her great-aunt Robbie, the piano teacher, and her jazz-loving grandfather died that summer. The combination of their passing and the nostalgia she felt as her family came together after the funerals felt like a shock compared to her quiet, controlled college life. **She realized that while she was focused on her small, selfish world of academic achievement, members of her family were aging and dying.** But she didn't know how to reconcile this dissonance, or what she could do about it, so she headed back to Princeton to study even harder.

### Applying to Law School

Still hyper-focused on success, Michelle started to burn out from the endless pressure of achievement. Even though she needed a mental break, she kept climbing the academic ladder and basking in others’ approval.

When it came time for her to make plans for life after Princeton, **she took the Law School Admission Test and got into Harvard Law School. As expected, everyone praised her.**

#### Reflection

Looking back, Michelle realizes she didn't choose law school out of logic or passion for the law. She did it for the same reason that her six-year-old self told adults that she wanted to grow up to be a pediatrician:**Telling her friends and classmates that she would attend Harvard Law School made people admire her, which made her feel worthy**.

In hindsight, Michelle understands that caring too much about what other people think can lead you in the wrong direction. When you're overly concerned about how your life looks to others, you may keep striving and achieving**until you're so far along the wrong path that it's nearly impossible to turn around.** Without realizing it, you handcuff yourself to the wrong future.
