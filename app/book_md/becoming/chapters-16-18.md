## Chapters 16-18: Campaign for the Presidency (2007-2008)

These chapters focus on Barack's successful run for U.S. President, Michelle's role in campaigning, and the challenges of living in the media spotlight. Michelle must confront her aversion to public life and distaste for politics and find a way to support her partner without losing her own precious sense of self.

### Barack Announces His Candidacy

Michelle truly believed Barack had the intelligence, temperament, discipline, and empathy to be a great president. She believed in his ideals and his ability to bring them to life. **But she also knew enough about America to think the country might not yet be ready for a Black president.** She had an unshakeable feeling that no matter how hard he campaigned, he wasn't going to win.

On February 10, 2007, Barack prepared to stand at an outdoor podium in a freezing Illinois storm to announce his candidacy. Michelle worried that the awful weather would mean a small crowd, and Barack’s kickoff event might be a dismal failure. She worried that her daughters would trip over their feet or look bored on stage. She worried whether she or they were dressed properly. She was painfully aware of the image she was supposed to project: **"I knew the stereotype I was meant to inhabit, the immaculately groomed doll-wife with the painted-on smile, gazing bright-eyed at her husband."**

But as soon as she saw the crowd that had gathered, her worries subsided. Thousands of people roared with enthusiasm, cheering on the entire Obama family. Michelle was moved by this incredible display of loyalty. She started to believe that the next 20 months of campaigning might actually be worth it: Barack did have a chance at the presidency. **She suddenly saw each audience member as the Obamas’ responsibility. Each person had come out to support the Obamas, and the Obamas would not fail them.**

#### Michelle Joins the Campaign Fray

Michelle was now fully committed to Barack's bid for President, and as she had predicted, her family's life changed quickly and radically. Michelle remembers Barack as being constantly in motion, responding to the nonstop actions and reactions of the campaign. He was competing against Hillary Clinton, who was much better known than Obama, and eight other Democrats.

**As most presidential candidates' spouses do, Michelle ran her own campaign to get Barack elected.** She hired Melissa Winter as her campaign manager (who later became Michelle’s chief of staff), and Katie McCormick Lelyveld as her communications director. Michelle's only stipulation was that there would be no overnight travel—she wanted to be home every night for the girls.

Michelle scaled back her work at the hospital to part time and traveled a few days a week to Iowa, a priority state for any candidate hoping to win the Democratic nomination. **The state was 90 percent white and mostly rural, so it seemed like a tough challenge for a Black candidate from Chicago.**

Barack rarely campaigned alongside her because he had other places he needed to be, so Michelle had to come up with her own messages and strategies. Without fully understanding exactly what she was supposed to do or say, Michelle spoke to community groups and volunteers all over the state. **She told her personal stories—about her family life, how she met Barack, what her schooling was like, and why she wasn't a big fan of politics.**

The people who listened to her, she says, were a lot like her family, only white. They were civic-minded blue-collar workers, college students, retirees, and stay-at-home mothers. When these people hugged her, she hugged them right back.

##### Reflection

The most uncomfortable part of the Iowa campaign was when journalists would ask Michelle what it was like for an Ivy League-educated Black woman to speak to a room full of white, middle-class Iowans. **She bristled at the question because it emphasized differences instead of similarities.** She saw how these people were the same as she was: Some wanted to talk to her because they, too, had a family member with multiple sclerosis, or they, too, struggled to believe they were “good enough” to attend a great college or raise children while managing a career.

### A Catalyst for Michelle's Future Nutrition Campaign

In the midst of campaigning for Barack, a doctor informed Michelle that Malia’s body mass index was too high. This might put her in danger of obesity, high blood pressure, or other serious health issues later on in her life.

Michelle was shocked. She’d thought she had done everything right to care for her daughters, but she hadn’t realized they’d fallen into bad habits like eating fast food or getting too many takeout dinners. With Barack’s presidential campaign in full swing, Michelle had no time to prepare healthy meals, so she hired a professional chef, Sam Kass, who not only cooked for the girls, but also taught them about healthy eating and the perils of the food industry's marketing campaigns. **Michelle promised Kass that if Barack got elected, she would use her role as first lady to address the public health consequences of unhealthy eating.**

#### Harsh Media Criticism

A few months later, Michelle took a leave of absence from her job because the campaign—and caring for her children in the midst of it—demanded all her time. She was getting a ton of media exposure, and although much of it was positive, some was discriminatory and hateful. **The media often portrayed Michelle as an "angry Black woman," a stereotype that she calls a "signal not to listen to what we've got to say."**

One _New York Times_ columnist called her a “princess of South Chicago.” Another media personality called her “Obama’s Baby Mama.” Journalists rarely asked about her work or qualifications, but some news stories insinuated that her promotions at the hospital were due to Barack’s popularity.

Michelle struggled with her new role as a media celebrity and tried to not take the criticism personally, but combatting the mean-spirited comments was draining. **She questioned whether her presence on the campaign trail was helping or hurting Barack.** He insisted she was a great asset but said he understood her frustration—if she wanted to stop campaigning, she could.

Michelle decided to work with Barack's communications staff to fine-tune her public demeanor and speech delivery. **She came to understand that politics is as much performance art as anything else,** and she needed to learn how to perfect her act. Barack’s staff taught her to smile more and show more of her softer, maternal side because that’s what America wanted to see.

### Threats Against Barack

Meanwhile, Barack was the subject of many unfounded rumors. Lies, suspicions, and theories circulated in the media, on the Internet, and in anonymous email chains. Some stories said he refused to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, or that he had a close friend who was a domestic terrorist, or that he had been sworn into the Senate on a Koran instead of a Bible. **Many Americans couldn't even pronounce Barack's name—and didn't try to learn.**

Michelle didn't feel unsafe, but she was concerned about threats against Barack. She took comfort in the fact that Secret Service agents trailed her husband, and an agent was assigned to the Obama home. **Never before in history had a presidential candidate been given Secret Service protection so early in his campaign** , but Barack’s heritage made him a particularly controversial candidate.

#### Reflection

As Michelle is subjected to harsh criticism, she recalls her mother's lesson about not letting a bully's insults or aggression get to you—**it’s only when you take a bully's comments personally that you really get hurt.** She remembers when she was in first grade, and a boy punched her in the face for no reason. Stunned, hurt, and confused, Michelle ran home to her mother, and her mother went to her school to sort things out. The boy was punished and forced to apologize to Michelle. Michelle's mother explained the boy's meanness this way: "That boy was just scared and angry about things that have nothing to do with you."

### Iowa's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner

After a year of campaigning, Barack trailed in the polls behind Hillary Clinton and John Edwards. But Michelle wasn't convinced the polls were correct. She knew that Barack was running a massive grassroots campaign staffed mostly by young 20-somethings. They were invisible to the pollsters, but these young people had power, skills, and energy, and they were staffing 37 offices for the Obama campaign.

**A key moment came at the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, an annual Democratic event in Des Moines** that's essentially a huge pep rally held a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses. More than 3,000 of Barack's young staffers attended the event. All the Democratic candidates made a speech, and most used their time to criticize their opponents, but **Barack, who spoke last, spoke against the dangers of polarization. He didn't want voters to take sides; he wanted Democrats to change America.** His speech was met with thunderous applause, and Barack went on to win the Iowa caucuses.

### Barack's Campaign Gains Strength

**Barack became the Democratic nominee for President and chose Joe Biden—at that time a Senator from Delaware—to be his running mate.** Although they were rivals for the Democratic nomination, they quickly became friends afterward. They were running against the Republican ticket of John McCain and Sarah Palin.

The media frenzy around the Obamas intensified. Journalists follow Barack’s every move, scrutinizing every word, action, and gesture. In the summer of 2008, just a few months before the November election, **Michelle felt like the Obamas’ life was entirely scripted, with every moment planned by other people.** Being surrounded by huge audiences, bright lights, and newspaper photographers had become the norm. Carefully regulating every word spoken in public was also the norm.

### Butte's Fourth of July

**Michelle learned to cherish the precious unrehearsed moments she was occasionally granted.** She got one of those rare moments on the Fourth of July, when the Obamas and their Secret Service attaché flew to Butte, Montana. The citizens of Butte knew that it was Malia’s 10th birthday, and they held up signs congratulating her. Huge crowds came out for a Fourth of July picnic, and everyone sang “Happy Birthday” to Malia.

Michelle spent much of the day feeling guilty and inadequate as a parent because her family life had become so public. Because of their campaign responsibilities, she thought she had failed to give Malia a normal birthday at home with a party, friends, relatives, and presents. **But at the end of the day, Malia surprised her by insisting this was "the best birthday ever."** In her 10-year-old mind, strangers helped her to celebrate her day, she'd spent the day outside at a picnic, and she ate birthday cake—and life couldn't get any better.

### 2008 Presidential Election

On November 4, Michelle and Barack cast their votes in Chicago and begin an excruciating, all-day wait to hear the election results. Friends and family visited their home to help pass the time. Craig and Barack played basketball to relieve the stress. Michelle continued to ask herself the question she'd been asking all along: **Was America really ready to elect a Black president?**

That evening, Michelle and Barack went to a hotel suite that the campaign had rented for them. With a small group of family and friends, they watched the election results on television. Joe and Jill Biden watched the results from their own suite across the hall.

**At 10 p.m., Barack was declared the 44th President of the United States** , and everyone in the hotel started screaming and hugging. Michelle recalls the rest of the night as a surreal blur. Secret Service agents escorted the Obamas in a motorcade to Grant Park, where Barack made his acceptance speech to an audience of more than 200,000 people. Michelle, Malia, and Sasha stood on stage with Barack, listening to the cheers of a jubilant crowd.
