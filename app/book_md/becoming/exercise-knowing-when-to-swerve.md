## Exercise: Knowing When to Swerve

Michelle Obama writes about being a “box checker” as a child, someone who strives for perfect attendance and straight A’s. She followed a straight-line path to success, checking off one box after another until she reached her academic and career goals. But later in life, she learned she had to “swerve” to adjust to life’s circumstances. (For example, she veered away from corporate law to a more meaningful but lesser paying job.)

* * *

In general, do you see yourself as someone who checks boxes or someone who swerves? (To think of it another way: Do you see yourself as a meticulous planner or as someone who is more spontaneous in your decision-making?) What makes you say this?

Give an example of a time that your approach—either box-checking or swerving—worked well for you.

Have you ever blindly worked so hard toward achieving something that you didn't realize you were on the wrong path? How did you realize it and what did you do then?

Have you ever veered off your predetermined life plan when you've wanted or needed to? If so, describe your swerve and its outcome—whether or not it worked out well.
