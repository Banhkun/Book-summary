## Exercise: The Importance of Mentors

Michelle described a number of women who served as mentors for her at different times in her life—from her boss at her work-study job at Princeton to her colleagues at Chicago City Hall to past first ladies in the White House. Each mentor helped her to see what kind of person she could become.

* * *

Name three of the most important mentors in your life. Next to each name, write what they've helped you to achieve.

Think of an important goal in your life. Name that goal, and then name a few people who might be able to serve as mentors to help you achieve it. (If you don’t know of anyone, consider places where you might look for a mentor.)

Think of someone that you could mentor right now—someone who is trying to learn something you already know, or enter an industry or community that you’re already familiar with. Name that person and what you might be able to offer him or her.
