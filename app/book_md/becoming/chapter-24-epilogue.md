## Chapter 24 & Epilogue: The Obama Era Ends (2017)

The final pages focus on Sasha and Malia's life in the White House, the last year of the Obama administration, Hillary Clinton's and Donald Trump's campaigns for the presidency, and the 2017 inauguration of Donald Trump. After the inauguration, Michelle and her family depart the White House, and her next stage of “becoming” begins. After eight years of an extremely unusual life, she must now adjust to the world beyond the White House and the new reality that her daughters are nearly grown.

### Sasha and Malia Grow Up

In the Obamas’ eighth year at the White House, Malia graduated from high school and traveled to Europe. At Malia's graduation ceremony, Michelle looked over at Barack, who had tears in his eyes as Malia walked across the stage, and felt sorry for him. Since Barack was ending his second term as President, he was nearly finished with his service to the country and would soon have more time to spend with his daughters. But now Malia was an independent young woman who was ready to leave the nest. **Both parents felt sad that their oldest was preparing to leave home.**

#### Teenagers in the Spotlight

Michelle feels proud of Sasha and Malia for how well they thrived while living in the shadow of the presidency. **The lack of privacy was hard on the entire family, but excruciating for two teenagers who were constantly followed by a security team.** (When Malia wanted to go to the prom, the Secret Service made the huge concession of letting her ride in a car her date was driving, but they followed right behind them in another car.)

The Secret Service agents assigned to the girls made it a point to dress down so they wouldn't stand out so much. They would wear board shorts and T-shirts instead of black suits to make them look less conspicuous. One agent who accompanied Sasha to elementary school became a favorite among her classmates; they would all beg him to push them while they'd swing on the swing set.

The girls understood that their father’s position placed on their shoulders a great deal of pressure and responsibility—if they made a mistake in public, it could be broadcast to the entire world. **Michelle and Barack realized this was unfair** —they had both engaged in typical teenage shenanigans like experimenting with cigarettes and alcohol, but **they didn't have the whole world watching them.**

Perhaps more invasive than all the public and media scrutiny were the people who would try to take photos of the girls when they were out in public. Even worse, people would sometimes ask—or demand—to take a selfie with one of the girls. Malia learned to respond by saying, "You do know I'm a child, right?"

**Barack and Michelle declined all media requests for interviews with the girls. I** n 2008, they had allowed the girls to be interviewed for the TV show _Access Hollywood_ when Barack was campaigning for President. Even though the show was harmless and the girls were utterly charming, Michelle always regretted putting their children on public display.

By the time the girls were teenagers, they were allowed to decide whether they wanted to attend White House events, including the President's annual Turkey Pardon, which the girls thought was downright silly.

#### First Family Privileges

Of course, Malia and Sasha enjoyed incredible privileges because of their father's job, too. They lived in one of the country's most opulent buildings; they met famous musicians, actors, and other celebrities at White House events. They traveled with their parents to countries around the world.

**Even though their White House years were far from normal teenage life, the girls handled their positions with grace and dignity.** And they had both grown into intelligent, kind, thoughtful young adults.

### Michelle Takes Stock of Barack's Presidency

Michelle reflects that being first lady was the "greatest honor of her life." **She felt extremely privileged to have served the country that she loved.**

* * *

As Barack’s presidency neared its end, Michelle looked back at his years in office and evaluated what progress the country had made: She saw fewer wounded soldiers during her visits to military hospitals. The Centers for Disease Control reported improved statistics on childhood obesity. The country had seen five years of job growth. Twenty million Americans had health insurance who didn't before. More than 1.5 million military families had received help in finding jobs.

Another major change came from a separate branch of government: **The Supreme Court affirmed that same-sex couples were allowed to marry in all 50 states** —a landmark decision that met with cheers from many parts of the country. The White House staff lit up the building with rainbow-colored lights to represent the gay pride flag.

Michelle was so excited about the court decisions that she and Malia evaded Secret Service agents and snuck out of the White House to see the light show and the happy crowd that had gathered.

### Michelle's Garden Thrives

Michelle's vegetable garden, her pet project from her first year as first lady, was still going strong after more than seven years. It produced about 2,000 pounds of vegetables every year.

Before leaving the White House, **Michelle doubled the size of the garden** as a way of making it even more permanent. She added pathways, benches, and an arbor, then held a dedication ceremony. Her current and former staff and many supporters attended, as well as two of the fifth graders who had helped to plant the garden—who were now seniors in high school.

### Racial Violence and Terrorist Threats

Michelle saw that America still had much to accomplish: Congress had voted down all gun control bills. Osama bin Laden had been killed, but now ISIS was a growing threat. Chicago's homicide rate was increasing.

**And racial violence everywhere appeared to be on the upswing:** A black teenager named Michael Brown had been shot by a cop in Ferguson, Missouri. A black boy named Tamir Rice was shot dead by Cleveland police while playing with a toy gun. In June 2015, nine black people were killed at a Methodist church in Charleston, South Carolina, after inviting a 21-year-old white man into their Bible study group. The man waited until they bowed their heads in prayer, then shot them.

**Those who had proclaimed that Obama’s election to the presidency signaled an end to racism in America were clearly wrong.** In fact, Barack and Michelle were aware that their time in the White House may have indirectly contributed to some of the violence.**** America still had citizens who were uncomfortable having Black people in high positions. "The hatred was as old and deep and dangerous as ever," Michelle writes.

### Michelle's Final Initiative: Let Girls Learn

At the White House, Michelle, Barack, and Malia met with**Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani teenager who had been shot by the Taliban because she advocated for girls to go to school.** Six months after Malala’s visit, an extremist group kidnapped 276 Nigerian schoolgirls, again sending the message that girls should not be allowed access to education.

In response, Michelle launched a government-wide initiative to help young girls around the globe have better access to education. Michelle felt a personal investment in making sure girls could go to school: **Education was her ticket to a better life, and she knew it would be true for others as well.**

Barack assisted in securing funding for Michelle’s initiative, called **Let Girls Learn.** Michelle called on celebrity friends, including Stephen Colbert and Kelly Clarkson, to add some star power to her campaign. She enlisted Diane Warren to write the pop song "This is For My Girls." Profits from the song helped to fund girls' education around the world. Michelle even guest-starred on James Corden's YouTube show _Carpool Karaoke_ to help raise awareness.

### A Last Visit With the Queen

In April 2016, Michelle and Barack made one last trip to England to visit with Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip. The Queen's staff informed them that Prince Philip wanted to drive the couple to Windsor Castle in his Range Rover. They also informed them of strict protocol—**Barack was instructed to sit in the backseat with the Queen; Michelle was to sit in the front with Prince Phillip.**

Michelle and Barack had not been in a car driven by anyone except Secret Service agents for the last eight years, and **now their driver would be a 94-year-old man.** When the Obamas landed in a helicopter alongside the Range Rover, the Queen surprised everyone by inviting Michelle to get in the back seat with her. Michelle was taken aback—she didn't want to get caught in another international faux pas like seven years ago when she touched the Queen.

The Queen saw Michelle’s hesitation and said, "Did they give you some rule about this? That's rubbish. Sit wherever you want."

### 2016 Presidential Election

Michelle spoke at the 2016 Democratic convention. It was her third time speaking at the convention, but the first two times she was supporting her husband's candidacy. **Now she was supporting Hillary Clinton,** who had been Barack's opponent in 2008 but was now his Secretary of State.

To an even greater degree, her speech made a case against Donald Trump, the Republican candidate. For the past year, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had been locked in a fierce competition for the presidency. Michelle saw Trump as a bully who demeaned women and minorities, and she believed firmly that he would be a terrible President. **In her convention speech, she spoke the now-famous phrase, "When they go low, we go high,"** referring to the Trump campaign's attempts to slander Hillary's reputation.

As both campaigns moved ahead, a secret recording of Donald Trump speaking in 2005 was leaked to the media. He was talking privately to television host Billy Bush, using vulgar words to describe women and bragging about what he could and would do to them.

Like many women, Michelle was horrified—and yet she also found his words to have a shockingly familiar ring. "Every woman I know recognized it," she writes. **"Dominance, even the threat of it, is a form of dehumanization."**

Michelle funneled her fury into writing a speech to combat Trump's misogyny. She delivered it in Manchester, New Hampshire, a few weeks before the election.

Polls showed that Hillary was ahead with a comfortable lead. The day before Election Day, the Obamas joined the Clintons at a final rally in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania was a key state to win, but the crowd that showed up for Hillary Clinton was huge and jubilant. **To Michelle and Barack, it seemed certain that she would win.**

#### Trump Becomes the Next President

But the next evening as the votes were being tallied, Barack seemed worried. The numbers weren't adding up the way experts had predicted—Hillary was falling behind. Michelle didn't like the way things were going and couldn't stand the pressure of waiting for the final results, so she went to bed. She wanted to block it out of her mind until the morning. **Ultimately, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote, and Trump was elected President.**

Barack, concerned about backlash and division in the country, asked Americans to respect the institutions of democracy, their new President, and each other. **Michelle knew that it was the current President's job to help people accept the election's outcome.**

Still, Michelle was bereft, and many of her staff members, who were mostly women and minorities, were in tears. She tried to comfort them by telling them that one election did not erase all the work that they had done in the last eight years.

### The Obamas Leave the White House

Moving out of the White House was highly emotional for the Obamas. Michelle felt grateful to the many staff members who were like family to her. **Saying goodbye was especially hard for Malia and Sasha, who had grown up with these people around them.** The permanent White House staff—butlers, ushers, florists, chefs, housekeepers—would now go on to serve the next President, while the people who came in with the Obamas would move on to new jobs elsewhere.

At a goodbye ceremony before the Inauguration, the staff presented the family with two flags: one from Barack’s first day and one from his last day as President of the United States.

#### Trump's Inauguration

It was difficult for Michelle to suppress her unhappiness as she watched Donald Trump's inauguration. **From her seat on the stage in front of the U.S. Capitol, Michelle looked around at the sea of white male faces in the incoming administration.** She worried that much of the progress they had made toward more diversity in the White House would now fade away.

#### Michelle's New Life Beyond the White House

At the book's conclusion, Michelle has entered a new chapter of her life. She’s ready to find a new identity now that she has much less responsibility and more time to reflect. As she ponders who she is now and what her next steps will be, **she realizes that she is still "becoming," that there is no end point to evolving as a human being.**

People often ask Michelle about running for office, but she has no political aspirations. She was never a fan of politics, and after living through Barack's two years as U.S. Senator and eight years as President, she is even less of a fan. She is unhappy with Donald Trump's actions in his first year as President—she gets angry watching the news and she sometimes loses sleep over current events­—but **she holds fast to hope for the future of America.**

### Becoming Means Evolving

Michelle writes that “becoming” requires patience and belief in the future. It requires understanding that there is always more work to be done. And most of all, **it requires optimism—"a form of faith, an antidote to fear," she writes.**

Although America is far from perfect, she loves her country for all the optimism it offers. Her time in the White House let her look deeply at American’s contradictions and injustices, but it also made her privy to its idealism and resilience.
