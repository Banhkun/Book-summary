## Chapters 19-20: Inauguration and First Year in the White House

These chapters focus on Michelle's role as first lady, her family's adjustment to life in the White House, her plan to plant a White House garden, and her first visit with Queen Elizabeth. Michelle initially feels daunted by the intensely public role she plays in American life, but she soon adapts to her new reality and manages to put her own unique spin on being first lady.

### Preparing to Be the First Black First Lady

In the 76 days between the election and the inauguration, Michelle started to plan what she would do as first lady. After the hard knocks Michelle had to withstand during Barack's presidential campaign, she had a fair idea of the scrutiny that awaited. **As the first Black woman in American history to serve as first lady, she would be "measured by a different yardstick."**

The job of a first lady does not come with a job description or even with official responsibilities. And yet, the position wields tremendous power, and Michelle wanted to use that power to achieve positive changes. Since she was free to select her own agenda, **she planned to oversee several initiatives that would offer better support for military families and teach America's kids about food and nutrition.**

A few weeks before the inauguration, President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush invited Michelle and Barack to the White House. **Bush, who had served as President for eight years, had pledged to ensure the smoothest Presidential transition in history.** Laura gave Michelle a tour and offered encouraging words about the new life the Obamas were about to face.

**Michelle also had a chance to talk with past first ladies.** Hillary Clinton, who had been Barack's political rival for so long, gave Michelle advice on selecting schools for her girls based on the Clinton family's experience raising Chelsea in the White House. Both Rosalynn Carter and Nancy Reagan offered moral support.

#### Reflection

Michelle recalls thinking about the time she was headed to her new, high-achieving high school, and how she was gripped with doubt over whether she was good enough to compete with the other students. She applied the lesson she learned then—that **confidence is an inner state of mind, one we sometimes have to conjure up**. Was she "good enough" to be first lady? Yes, she was, she told herself.

### New Chapters for Malia, Sasha, and Marian

Michelle found a new school in Washington, D.C. for Malia and Sasha to attend. It was the same Quaker school that Chelsea Clinton had attended when her father was President. The girls were driven to school in a motorcade accompanied by armed Secret Service agents, which made Michelle feel terrible—**now that their dad was President, her girls couldn’t have a normal childhood.**

Michelle worried about the girls nonstop on their first day of school, but they came home happy and looking forward to their new lives. Like typical kids, they seemed to take everything in stride.

Michelle's mother Marian, now 71 years old, moved to the White House with the Obamas. She didn't want to leave Chicago, but after pressure from Michelle and her brother Craig, she agreed for the sake of her granddaughters.

**Still, Marian continued to live by her own rules and maintained her independence from White House life:** She declined Secret Service protection, stayed away from journalists, did her own laundry, and left the grounds whenever she wanted to. If someone recognized her and asked if she was Michelle Obama’s mother, she wouldn't admit to it.

#### Michelle's Friendship with Jill Biden

In the last few months of campaigning, Michelle and Jill Biden had become close friends. Jill, who was a community college English professor, **shared Michelle's interest in helping military families.** The five Biden grandkids were always happy to play with the Obama girls.

### Inauguration Day

In January 2009, Barack was sworn in as U.S. President. **Nearly two million people crammed into the National Mall and the surrounding parade route to take part in the festivities.** Before the ceremony, Michelle stood with Barack while he practiced placing his hand on Abraham Lincoln’s red Bible—a key part of the ritual in which he would vow to protect the Constitution.

After the swearing-in ceremony, the Obamas got into the presidential limousine to lead the parade to the White House. **A long day of speeches and celebrations culminated in the couple attending 10 different inaugural balls that night,** each one with the same format: Barack was introduced to the attendees as the song “Hail to the Chief” played. He spoke briefly, and then he and Michelle danced on stage to the Etta James' song "At Last," which the Obamas had chosen for their first dance. (Beyoncé famously performed it at the first of the balls.) **As she danced with Barack, Michelle felt comfort in knowing they were still the same couple they always had been through 20 years of marriage.**

The final party was a private affair for friends and family, but Michelle was too exhausted from the epic day to enjoy it. It was 2 a.m. by the time they arrived, and the day had been nothing short of a whirlwind. Barack assured her that she didn’t have to attend, and she promptly went to bed.

### Life and Work in the White House

Barack had to get to work immediately after the inauguration. America's 2008 financial meltdown had occurred a few months before he took office, and the economy was in free fall. Nearly 750,000 jobs were lost in January 2009 alone. **The economic crisis was a top priority, but there was also ongoing fear about possible terrorist attacks.**

Despite Barack's heavy responsibilities, the family had more time together than they'd had in years. Having the family living quarters upstairs from the Oval Office gave the Obamas a chance to eat dinner together almost every night. Barack wasn't commuting to another city every week any more. Their life was, in some ways, more "normal."

#### The Family's New Home

Of course, in other ways the family’s life was far from normal. Their new home, for example, had **132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 28 fireplaces spread out over six floors. It also had a movie theater, gym, florist shop, and bowling alley.** The master suite that Michelle and Barack slept in was larger than the entire apartment her family shared when she was growing up. The building was staffed by an immense crew of housekeepers, painters, electricians, plumbers, florists, chefs, laundry workers, and ushers who worked to keep the place in perfect condition. **Barack had three military valets whose sole job was to make sure his wardrobe was always cleaned, pressed, folded, and shined.**

Michelle learned quickly that although the presidential family lives rent-free in the White House, they still have a lot they have to pay for. Every month they received an itemized bill for groceries, toilet paper, and other supplies. They had to pay for guests who dined with them or stayed overnight in one of the White House rooms. Michelle learned to supervise the chefs to keep the food costs reasonable. If they were granted free rein to prepare whatever they wanted, they would fly in delicacies from across the globe.

The White House staff was always warm and welcoming to the Obamas, and the family enjoyed interacting with the various staff members. Barack would watch basketball games and talk sports with the butlers. Malia and Sasha would make smoothies and popcorn in the kitchen after school.

#### Tight Security All the Time

**Everything in the White House is designed to keep the President safe.** The windows are fitted with bomb-resistant glass and kept securely closed at all times. Opening one for a breath of fresh air is not an option. A crew of shoppers picks up groceries and supplies anonymously at various stores throughout the Washington, D.C. area to make sure no one sabotages the President's stomach.

**Michelle wanted to loosen the formality of the White House in part to make things more "normal" for her daughters.** She told the staff the girls had to make their own beds in the morning. She also started to arrange playdates so the girls' friends could come to the White House. The Secret Service required the friends' parents to supply their Social Security numbers before bringing their children over to play, which created some awkward moments. But the children didn't care; they just wanted to play.

It was important to Michelle that the other parents saw her as Malia and Sasha’s mom, not as the first lady. Michelle made it a priority to invite her daughters’ new friends’ parents for lunch or community events.

#### Michelle Manages White House Events

Michelle coordinated with the permanent White House staff in planning traditional social events, such as the black-tie Governor’s Ball and the Easter Egg Roll, a family event that had been taking place since 1878. In the Obamas' attempt to make the White House more open and comfortable for everyone, they added more tickets to the Easter Egg Roll for military families and city schoolchildren.

#### Michelle Plants a Garden

Michelle knew the first lady had to participate in White House social events, but **she was determined to be more than a gracious hostess, a "well-dressed ornament who showed up at parties and ribbon cuttings."** She wanted to see what the first lady could accomplish for the American people, and **first on her list was food and nutrition.**

Michelle knew that most of what Americans understood about food came from advertising. Busy parents had been indoctrinated to believe that convenience food—boxed, frozen, and processed—was good to eat. At the time, few people were singing the praises of fresh carrots and just-picked tomatoes. Michelle hoped to start a conversation about healthy eating and challenge the powerful food and beverage industry to be more honest about what they were producing and selling.

Even though she knew nothing about gardening, Michelle worked with a group of elementary school kids to plant a garden on the South Lawn. Growing vegetables at the White House was a good way to shed light on the fact that nearly a third of American children were overweight or obese. Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure were common among young people.

### The Obamas Visit the Queen

Two months after moving to the White House, Barack and Michelle flew to London so Barack could attend the London G20 Summit (G20 was short for Group of 20, which were leaders from the world's 20 largest economies). America's financial crisis was causing economic disasters all over the world, and leaders were getting together to express their concerns and make a plan to move forward.

**On the same trip, the Obamas visited Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace.** Michelle thought the White House was opulent, but she realized it was a mere dollhouse compared to this 775-room palace that was 15 times its size.

The Queen held a reception for the Obamas and the other G20 leaders and spouses. In one moment, Michelle found herself standing alone with the 82-year-old Queen, who commented, "You're so tall." Michelle, who is 5 feet 11 inches, made a small joke about her high heels, and the two women laughed about how uncomfortable their shoes were.

As the pair laughed, Michelle placed her arm around Queen Elizabeth’s shoulder and the Queen placed her hand on Michelle’s back. **Michelle had no idea she was breaking British protocol, but no one was ever supposed to touch the Queen.** The Queen didn't seem to mind—the Obamas were invited back to visit her many times afterward—but of course, the media captured the moment and **criticized Michelle for her glaring lack of grace and manners.** Michelle saw that she was facing at least four years of trying to do everything perfectly so the media couldn't find fault with her—an impossible task.

The next day, Michelle visited the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School, a London girls’ academy known for its outstanding achievers. **More than 90 percent of the students were minorities—many were immigrants or Black—and Michelle knew that even with their high intelligence, they would struggle to be seen and heard.** She talked to the girls about her own upbringing and education—how she was raised in a working-class neighborhood and her salvation was school and pursuing the chance to get admitted to the best colleges. Before she left, she hugged as many of the girls as she could.

#### Reflection

In her new role as first lady, Michelle had many moments when she felt unworthy and incapable of the job, and the media underscored that belief. Often she felt like her personal identity had been wiped out in her quest to "act the part" of the President's wife. But when she visited this London school filled with smart, eager girls who were much like she was as an adolescent, she found her identity again.

**She realized who she was and who she could be as first lady aligned perfectly.** This time when she asked herself the question that haunted her throughout her life—am I good enough?—she finally knew she was.
