## Exercise: The Importance of Friendship

When Michelle moved to Washington, D.C., she had to work harder to maintain her relationships with her Chicago girlfriends. But because these friends had always been her "circle of strength," she made an extra effort to keep them close (for example, planning getaways at Camp David with them).

* * *

List three people who are part of your circle of strength. Next to each name, write how that person supports you.

How often do you communicate or spend face-to-face time with these three people? Name three ways you could increase that time.
