## 1-Page Summary

From the time she was a small child, Michelle Obama's parents taught her the importance of speaking up and telling her own story in her authentic voice—reconciling her past, present, and future and feeling proud of it all. As first lady of the United States, Michelle passed on this advice to thousands of young people, and **she hopes that by sharing her own life’s narrative, she can inspire others.**

As her memoir begins, Michelle has recently left the White House after eight years as first lady from January 2009 to January 2017. Along with her husband, former President Barack Obama, and their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, she has moved into a suburban home not far from the White House. **For the first time in many years, Michelle finds herself alone with her thoughts in a quiet house.**

Each member of the Obama family is transitioning into new chapters of their lives. Barack is exploring career opportunities for his post-Presidential years. The Obama children are entering adulthood—Malia, the older daughter, is taking a gap year before starting college at Harvard University, and Sasha will finish high school in another two years. **Michelle is free from the constraints of her highly public life as first lady. Simultaneously, her duties and responsibilities as a mother have diminished.**

Michelle describes the simple pleasures she can now enjoy, which she didn't have while living in the White House: She can go outside and play in the yard with her dogs without the Secret Service asking where she is going. She can open her bedroom windows and let in fresh air whenever she pleases. She can make her own cheese toast without the kitchen staff rushing in to help.

Even though a cadre of Secret Service agents is holed up in the Obamas' garage command post—and agents will accompany the family for the rest of their lives—Michelle cherishes her newfound freedom and quiet time. This is her opportunity to reflect and write her life story.****

**Eight themes weave through Michelle’s memoir:**

### 1\. Becoming Is an Ongoing Challenge

Michelle is a woman who is perpetually striving to become a better version of herself. Through the process of “becoming,” she learns to adapt to her changing circumstances and not get stuck holding fast to the same identity or set of beliefs. She learns to grow and change in pursuit of the person she’d like to become.

Michelle discovers that **personal growth has no finish line; there’s no moment in time when she’s done evolving. “Becoming” is an ongoing process of self-creation. It requires understanding there’s always more work to be done.**

Michelle’s early years didn’t allow for this kind of flexibility. As a child, she focused on doing the “right” thing to please her teachers and family. She wanted only to make a good impression and earn others’ praise and admiration: She strived for straight A’s and perfect attendance in school. She told adults she wanted to be a pediatrician when she grew up because they seemed pleased by that answer. She didn’t think about what her passions were or what she wanted from her life.

Michelle followed a precise and predetermined path of **“checking off boxes”** —earning top honors in elementary and high school, getting admitted to top-notch universities, climbing the corporate ladder at a high-profile law firm. She never stopped to consider whether any of it made her happy. When her free-spirited college friend died from cancer at age 26, Michelle had a wake-up call. She realized she didn’t want the life she had worked so hard to achieve. **She had to muster the courage to veer off the path she'd followed for years and find her path into a more meaningful future.**

Despite her mother’s objections, Michelle quit her job and took a much lower paying position in the Chicago mayor’s office. She calls this **“finding the courage to swerve.”** She was moving closer to living her own true story, not simply living up to others’ expectations.

Michelle learned to swerve again after Barack became an important figure in her life. His passion for working to build a better world encouraged her to seek out more fulfilling work in the nonprofit sector.**** She wound up holding a series of civic-minded positions that were far more enriching than her law career.

But what she loved most about Barack—his idealism and desire to help people and change the world—also challenged her vision of how her life should be. Michelle**** wanted a private family life like the one she grew up in—days filled with simple routines and the whole family sitting down to the dinner table every night. She knew that **life with Barack meant a life in the political arena, which meant chaotic schedules, the glare of the media spotlight, and never-ending public scrutiny.**

Despite Michelle’s misgivings about political life, she loved Barack, so she gave up her predetermined ideas about what her life should look like. She evolved as a partner to Barack and as a person—she campaigned for him when he ran for Senate and for two terms as President. Ultimately she became one of the most popular first ladies in American history.

Once her time in the White House ended, Michelle had to begin the process of “becoming” all over again. Leaving behind her role in politics and with two daughters nearing adulthood, it was up to Michelle to recreate herself and adapt to her new reality.

### 2\. Striving, Hard Work, and Self-Determination

**Through her parents' encouragement and her own hard work, Michelle rose above her circumstances**. She grew up in South Shore, a working-class Chicago neighborhood. She, her brother, and parents shared a one-bedroom apartment that the family rented from her mother’s aunt. Her father worked for the city water department and suffered from multiple sclerosis.

Michelle studied diligently in public school and later graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School. She held high-powered jobs as a corporate lawyer, city manager, nonprofit director, and hospital vice president. While striving to give her best effort to each position, she helped her husband Barack campaign to become a U.S. Senator and later, U.S. President, and she raised two young daughters.

**As first lady, Michelle lived a life of opulence beyond her wildest childhood dreams.** She and her family lived in the 132-room White House with world-class chefs cooking their meals and staff members attending to their every need, including an in-house florist who noted what flowers they liked or didn’t like.

But Michelle never forgot her humble beginnings. She did not permit herself or her daughters to be spoiled by their privilege. **She demanded even more of herself as first lady, pushing through four major initiatives during her time in the White House.**

### 3\. Living With Racial Discrimination

**Michelle began learning about racial discrimination early in life.** She grew up in a racially mixed neighborhood where children played together regardless of skin color. But she soon encountered racial discrimination when a police officer stopped her brother Craig while he was out riding his new bike. The officer assumed that since this young Black boy’s bike was shiny and new, he must have stolen it.

Michelle also learned about racial discrimination from the elders in her family. Her grandfather, like many of the men of his generation, couldn't get a union card because he was Black, so he had to take a non-union job as a postal worker. He felt bitter about never having the career opportunities he hoped he would have.

**At 10 years old, Michelle learned that discrimination can be a two-sided coin.** Michelle's parents had always insisted that she and her brother speak formal English without any slang words. One day, one of her cousins asked her why she talked “like a white girl." The cousin believed that Michelle was denying her Black culture by speaking with proper diction.

A few years later, her family visited some Black friends who had moved to a white community in the suburbs. While they were there, someone vandalized Michelle’s father's treasured Buick Electra, which was parked on the street. Her family never knew who did it, but her mother assumed the neighbors wanted to discourage more Black people from moving in.

**When Michelle turned 17 and headed off to Princeton, for the first time in her life she found herself to be the only black woman in the classroom.** She had to muster the courage to speak up in class despite the difference in her skin color and gender.

### 4\. Persisting in the Face of Adversity

**Michelle's experiences taught her to remain optimistic and not let setbacks steer her off course.** Her father served as a role model, never complaining about his disability caused by multiple sclerosis. He simply accepted his condition and did his best to ignore it.

Her parents modeled optimism in the way they believed education could bring their children a better life. And when Michelle's high school guidance counselor told her that she wasn’t "Princeton material," Michelle ignored her, applied to the college, and got accepted.

In her eight years as first lady, Michelle met hundreds of highly accomplished people, many of whom told a story similar to hers: Someone in their young years doubted their ability to succeed at their goals. **The naysayers, critics, and doubters are always standing at the door, but the most successful people learn to push right past them.**

The people whom Michelle admires most remain optimistic in the face of great struggles. First, there’s Barack, who firmly believes that **people can work toward creating a better society.** But she names many other models of hope and inspiration, including Nelson Mandela, whom she met on a trip to South Africa, and the wounded warriors at Walter Reed Hospital, who inspired her with their resiliency.

Michelle notes that even her own story can be told in both pessimistic and optimistic ways: In one story, she grew up in a too-small house with not much money in a neighborhood that had begun to decay. In another version, she grew up in a music-filled house with a close-knit, loving family who believed in the importance of higher education.**In the former story, she is disadvantaged. In the latter, she has every chance at success.**

### 5\. Learning to Believe in Yourself

Michelle’s major concerns during the first 50 years or her life could be filed under one overarching question: **Am I good enough?** The questions and doubts began after middle school, when she got accepted to a high-achieving high school. She felt insecure about her intelligence—would she be able to measure up against the other students, many of whom come from privileged backgrounds? But she soon learned that if she studied hard enough, she could easily keep up with them.

Later, in her first year at Princeton, she again felt insecure about her background, her education, and her abilities. Would she be able to make her mark in classrooms full of white men? **She quickly learned they weren’t smarter than she was; they were just more self-confident.**

Many years later, when she campaigned for Barack, the media vilified her. She questioned whether she was helping or hurting her husband's career. But she worked hard at improving her public speaking skills and her media persona, and she played a major role in Barack’s win.

When she became first lady, she knew that the world was scrutinizing her because she was the first Black woman to hold this position. **The question "am I good enough?" continued to haunt her.** But as she made major strides in advancing her political initiatives, she realized that the answer was a resounding “yes.”

### 6\. Being Proud of Your Unique Story

During the campaign for Presidency, Michelle struggled to find the right words to frame the many twists, turns, and contradictions of her life story. Ultimately, she followed her mother's advice—**to tell her story truthfully and authentically.**

Michelle believes that too many people, especially women and minorities, go through their lives feeling ashamed of where they've come from or what their backgrounds are. They think that their truth doesn't live up to the established ideal, so they keep it hidden. But finding your own voice and telling your own truth is critical to the process of self-creation. **You can’t be fully yourself until you embrace every part of your story—past, present, and future.**

### 7\. Living Under the Weight of Privilege

Even before becoming first lady, Michelle was acutely aware of her privilege, which could take a variety of forms. She understood there’s inherent privilege in what class or race you're born into, but there's also privilege in being a mother who can choose how much to work—full- or part-time—or whether to work at all. There's even privilege in being able to have children, whether through in vitro fertilization or otherwise. **Sometimes privilege is based on the sheer luck of evading life's catastrophes: layoffs, mass shootings, domestic violence, lack of health care, poverty, prison, and so on.**

As Michelle’s daughters grew up in the White House, Michelle saw how many advantages they enjoyed compared to millions of girls all over the world who didn’t even have access to education. **Michelle believes the only answer to living under the weight of privilege is to find a way to serve others—to do what you can to create more advantages for everyone.**

### 8\. Living Under the Spotlight’s Glare

While the role of first lady was an extremely high privilege, it came with a difficult downside: **The media and public officials constantly scrutinized and criticized Michelle**(one U.S. Congressman even made jokes about her hips).

Michelle yearned for privacy for herself and her children. She craved simple, private-citizen freedoms, like going shopping by herself or taking her kids on field trips without causing a scene everywhere she went. She wanted to be free of the constant presence of cameras and cell phones, to not always be concerned about what clothes she wore or how her hair looked. Most important, she wanted the media and the public to leave her daughters alone so they could live their childhood and teenage years as normally as possible.

But this, she knew, was impossible. Presidential life did not afford the luxury of privacy, and **each member of the Obama family would need to find ways to live with that.**

### As First Lady, Michelle Worked for Positive Change

The role of a first lady doesn’t come with a job description or even with official responsibilities. And yet, the position wields tremendous power, and Michelle wanted to use her power to bring positive change. During her eight years in the White House, while raising her two daughters, **she pushed through four major initiatives**. They were:

#### Let's Move: Initiative for Children's Health

Concerned about the childhood obesity epidemic, Michelle established a public health initiative that addressed **family nutrition and exercise.** At the time, nearly a third of American children were overweight or obese, and Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure were common.

With the help of a group of fifth graders, Michelle **planted a vegetable garden on the South Lawn of the White House,** and she used it to draw attention to several messages:

  * Families needed to learn how to feed their children healthier foods. 
  * Grocery stores needed greater access to fresh produce, and it had to be priced so that poor families could afford it. 
  * The food and beverage industry had to stop "supersizing" everything. 
  * Ad agencies had to stop targeting children with commercials for sugary cereals and processed foods. 



**Michelle and her staff also developed the Let’s Move! campaign to get kids exercising.** Michelle hula-hooped on the South Lawn and guest-starred on “Sesame Street” to discuss vegetables with Big Bird. When reporters from health magazines interviewed her, she explained that**rising obesity levels meant rising health care costs and that many poor Americans didn't have access to fresh, affordable produce.**

Michelle's campaign for family health resulted in several victories, including better labeling for sodas and other beverages, a commitment by the suppliers of school lunches to cut fat, sugar, and salt in their meals, and the establishment of a federal task force on childhood obesity.****

#### Joining Forces: Initiative for Military Families

Michelle’s visits to military hospitals and talks with hundreds of wounded soldiers and their families inspired her to start an initiative called **Joining Forces.** Its goal was to establish concrete ways for Americans to rally around military service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment.

Joining Forces worked in tandem with the public and private sector to find jobs for veterans and help them get access to higher education. It also created media campaigns to fight the stigma behind PTSD, or post-traumatic stress disorder.

#### Reach Higher: Initiative for Higher Education

Concerned about the number of school-age children being killed by gun violence, Michelle launched an education initiative called **Reach Higher.** The goal was to get more kids interested in continuing their education beyond high school—whether through a professional training program, community college, or four-year college or university—by making them aware of the ways they could get there.

Michelle knew that many school-age kids, especially in urban areas, did not have mentors or role models to make them aware of what they could achieve. These kids needed to learn what their career and college opportunities were and how they could access them. Reach Higher provided financial assistance to high school guidance counselors to help students get into college, set up programs for summer internships and learning opportunities, and made it easier for students to obtain federal financial aid.****

#### Let Girls Learn: Initiative for Global Girls’ Education

In her final year as first lady, Michelle launched her fourth initiative, **Let Girls Learn.** Inspired by**Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani teenager who had been shot by the Taliban because she advocated for girls to go to school** , Michelle started a government-wide initiative to give girls around the globe better access to education.

Michelle felt a personal connection to the importance of schooling: **Education was her ticket to a better life, and she knew it would be true for others.** She enlisted celebrity friends, including Stephen Colbert and Kelly Clarkson, to add some star power to her campaign. She got Diane Warren to write the pop song "This is For My Girls." Profits from the song helped to fund girls' education around the world. Michelle even guest-starred on James Corden's YouTube show _Carpool Karaoke_ to help raise awareness.
