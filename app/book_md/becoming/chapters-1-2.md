## Chapters 1-2: Childhood and Family Life (1964-1976)

These chapters focus on Michelle's youth in urban Chicago, the people who made up her loving, close-knit family, and her introduction to her own natural ambition. This is young Michelle’s first stage of “becoming,” in which she learns that she can dictate much about her own future through hard work and striving.

### Early Years

Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born in January 1964. She grew up in Chicago in one of the poorer blocks of a racially mixed, working-class neighborhood called South Shore. Michelle's parents rented a small apartment on the second floor of a house owned by Michelle's great-aunt Robbie. Her parents slept in the single bedroom; Michelle and her older brother Craig shared the living room.

**Michelle and Craig were surrounded by extended family members throughout their early years.** Great-aunt Robbie and her husband lived on the first floor, and Michelle's grandparents and cousins lived only a few blocks away.

### Michelle's Childhood Dreams

Young Michelle's aspirations were uncomplicated. She wanted a dog. She wanted her family to live in a house with two floors—upstairs and downstairs—and have a four-door station wagon parked in the driveway. In elementary school, she was naturally ambitious and worked hard to earn straight A’s. When adults asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she said "pediatrician" because she liked the idea of working with children. **She quickly learned that adults were pleased by that answer, so she stuck with it.**

### Family

#### Michelle's Father

**Michelle credits her father, Fraser, for teaching her to work hard and keep her promises.** Fraser worked for the city as a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department. He put on a uniform every day and showed up for work despite having multiple sclerosis (MS) since his 30s. Initially, the disease caused him to walk with a limp, but during Michelle's childhood, the MS progressed. By the time Michelle finished elementary school, Fraser could only walk by using crutches; later, he used a wheelchair.

**But Fraser never complained about his disability; he simply accepted it and did his best to ignore it. As Michelle writes, her family had a "long-standing habit of blocking out bad news."**

Fraser's Buick Electra was his pride and joy; he loved to take the family for Sunday drives. (Michelle reflects that it would be many years before she understood her father’s attachment to that car: When he was driving, he was free from his disability.)

Fraser's passions were jazz and art. As a young man, he had briefly attended art school before he ran out of money and joined the Army. For much of Michelle's childhood, Fraser volunteered as a precinct captain for the city's Democratic Party. He spent Saturdays visiting his constituents to hear their complaints about garbage pickup or street potholes.

#### Michelle's Mother

**Michelle credits her mother, Marian, for teaching her to value education.** Marian taught Michelle how to read before she attended kindergarten and often took her to visit the public library. Up until Michelle entered high school, Marian did not have a job, so she was always at home and actively involved in Michelle's life and schooling. She kept to a strict budget while always taking care of her family’s needs. She cooked healthy meals, sewed some of Michelle's clothes, chaperoned school field trips, and served in the parent-teacher association. Michelle and her friends liked to run home to Michelle's house at lunchtime to hang out with Marian.

**Michelle also credits Marian for teaching her the value of speaking up with her own powerful voice.** In the Robinson family, dinner discussions were always lively. No topics were off-limits, and the children were taught to think and speak like adults and clearly articulate their thoughts and opinions.

As a young child, Michelle discovered the power of rhetoric when her mother tried to make her eat eggs for breakfast, which Michelle disliked. Michelle argued that peanut butter was equivalent to eggs as a source of protein for breakfast—and she never ate eggs again.

#### Michelle's Brother

Michelle's brother Craig, two years older, was her best friend. The siblings enjoyed playing board games, boxing, listening to music, and talking about everything. As young children, they shared a bedroom. As they got older, Michelle’s grandfather built a partition so Michelle and Craig each had their own tiny rooms. Even so, they slept only a few feet from each other and would often talk through the partition late into the night.

#### Music and Other Family Pleasures

The Robinson family didn't have money for luxuries, but they enjoyed the simple joys of shared activities. They savored small pleasures like ordering pizza for birthday celebrations, sharing pints of ice cream on hot summer days, going for picnics by Lake Michigan, and attending drive-in movies.

The entire family shared an interest in music. Great-aunt Robbie was a piano teacher who taught lessons in the house they lived in. Michelle started taking lessons from her when she was four. Robbie was a prim and strict teacher, and Michelle was a rather impatient student who often skipped ahead in the lesson book. Her ambition didn't match up with her skill. To Robbie’s chagrin, Michelle wanted to play more advanced songs rather than practicing the basics.

Michelle and Robbie argued often, and in little Michelle's mind, Robbie was the enemy. At Michelle's first piano recital, Michelle came on stage and froze with fear at the hall filled with people and the fancy baby grand piano in front of her, which was so different from the aging upright piano she practiced on. **Robbie saw Michelle's fear and joined her on the stage, showing her the first note and giving her the courage to play her song.** Michelle finally saw that Robbie was looking out for her.

Michelle's maternal grandfather was also a huge music fan and introduced Michelle and her brother to Ella Fitzgerald, John Coltrane, Stevie Wonder, and Aretha Franklin. **To this day, music is one of Michelle's greatest joys.**

### Kindergarten: Introduction to Ambition

**Michelle met her own competitive streak in kindergarten in 1969.** When the teacher quizzed the students on reading the names of colors—red, blue, yellow, black, and so on—Michelle was stumped by the word “white.” Two of her classmates could read all the words, and the teacher awarded them gold-foil star stickers. Mortified that she didn't get a star, Michelle’s natural ambition kicked in.

That evening, she practiced reading her list of color words until she knew them all by heart, and the next day at school, she asked her teacher for a second chance. At first, her teacher said no—the class had other things to do—but Michelle persisted. This time she earned her gold star.

### Second Grade: Michelle's Mother Advocates for Her Schooling

In the second grade, Michelle ran into a problem at school. Her teacher couldn't manage her classroom, taught the students little or nothing, and just didn't seem to care—and Michelle took note of it all. She complained about the teacher to her mother, who finally went to the school and petitioned to remove Michelle from the class. The principal placed Michelle and several other high-achieving students in a third-grade class while the rest of her classmates were left to languish with the bad teacher.

#### Reflection

At the time, Michelle was just happy to be moved to the third grade. But looking back, she considers her mother's advocacy a life-changing event. If she had stayed in that poor learning environment in second grade, her education might have been stunted. **Michelle reflects that kids can see when they're being devalued.** They know when adults are giving their best to them and when they're not. Unfortunately, many kids don't have a mother like Michelle did—someone they can talk to and who can advocate for them. Instead, they respond by acting out. But it's not their fault; it's the fault of the adults who aren't giving them 100 percent.

### Fifth Grade: Introduction to Toughness

**Michelle often chose to play alone at home** with her Barbie dolls and alphabet blocks. She was a naturally fastidious kid; she noticed the way other children mistreated their toys, and she played alone to keep hers in pristine condition..

But Michelle’s preference for solitude concerned her mother, who wanted Michelle to play with other children, too. Marian hoped that Michelle would become as extroverted as her brother, a skilled basketball player whom everybody liked.

Encouraged by her mother and hoping to emulate her popular brother, Michelle decided she'd try to join a clique of neighborhood kids who played together outside. But the ring leader, a bully named DeeDee, made cruel remarks about Michelle and kept her out of the group.

Michelle determined that she had to earn DeeDee’s respect. She tried reasoning with her, but it had no effect. One day, Michelle got into a fistfight with DeeDee. Having had some experience boxing with her brother, Michelle threw a few good punches and won. With her victory, Michelle earned DeeDee's respect and became a part of the group.

### Racial Discrimination in the City

**For the first few years of her life, Michelle didn't know that skin color sent a message to some people.** In Michelle's racially mixed neighborhood, children played together without regard to color. But she soon learned her first lesson in discrimination. When Craig was a young boy, he received a new bike as a present. As he rode his bike near Lake Michigan, a police officer stopped him, assuming that this young Black boy must have stolen the shiny, new bike. Craig insisted that the bike was his, and the officer called his mother.

Of course, Craig and Michelle's mother was furious at the officer, who happened to be a Black man. She made him apologize to Craig. **She then explained to both Craig and Michelle that the color of their skin would sometimes create problems for them, and it was something they would have to learn to deal with.**

### Racial Discrimination in the Suburbs

Michelle also encountered racial discrimination when visiting friends in the suburbs. **White families and some of the more well-off Black families were moving out of the aging South Shore neighborhood to newly constructed communities.**

When the Robinsons' close family friends, who were very light-skinned Blacks, moved to the suburbs of Park Forest—a mostly white community—they invited the Robinsons to come see their new home. The Robinsons spent an enjoyable day visiting with their old friends. At day's end, they walked out to the street where their Buick was parked and found a deep scratch running from the driver’s door all the way to the back bumper. The scratch looked like it had been made by someone with a key or a rock—someone who wanted to deliver an unfriendly message to a Black family in a mostly white neighborhood.

The Robinsons were shocked and hurt, but they didn't respond with drama. Instead, they drove home quietly. Michelle's dad, who never complained or made a big deal about anything, simply drove his Buick to the auto body shop to have the scratch removed.

**Michelle's mother later wondered whether the Robinsons visit had "outed" their light-skinned Black friends.** Perhaps their visit caused the neighbors to suddenly notice the family's Black skin. Or perhaps the neighbors thought having one Black family in the neighborhood was okay, but they didn't want more Black people to move in.
