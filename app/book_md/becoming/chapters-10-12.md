## Chapters 10-12: Fraser’s Death and the Obamas’ Marriage (1990-1993)

These chapters focus on the death of Michelle's father, Michelle and Barack's engagement and marriage, and Michelle’s decision to leave her law career to work at Chicago City Hall. Although her career transition posed a challenge, Michelle is transforming into someone who makes choices for herself instead of trying to impress or please other people.

### Rethinking Her Future

In the summer of 1990, Barack returned to Chicago as a summer associate at a different law firm and moved into Michelle's apartment in her parents' house. This gave Marian, Fraser, and Barack a chance to get to know each other. But he soon returned to Cambridge to attend to his duties as president of the _Harvard Law Review._ Barack was the first African-American to hold this position.

**Michelle realized that Barack's future looked bright and bold while hers seemed lackluster.** She felt serious doubts about her choice of career. Practicing corporate law held little meaning for her. She didn’t know what she wanted to do with her life, and she felt somewhat intimidated by Barack's confidence that he was ready to make a difference in the world. She started writing in a journal to sort through her confusion.

Michelle considered her options: She thought perhaps she might like teaching, working for a nonprofit, or helping kids. She wondered if she could pay her bills if she abandoned her high-paying job. When she discussed her dilemma with her mother, Marian told her to focus on making money while she was young and worry about being happy later. Michelle wasn’t surprised by her advice: The Robinson family had always emphasized practicality.

### Barack and Michelle Disagree Over Marriage

**Michelle always dreamed of falling in love and marrying. But Barack, while not directly opposed to marriage, felt more ambivalent about it.** Barack's mother had married twice and divorced twice, so Barack didn't see marriage as particularly beneficial. In contrast, Michelle's parents had been together for their entire adult lives. In 30 years, they had rarely spent even one night apart.

Also, Barack had his hands full: He was about to graduate from Harvard, take the Illinois bar exam, and interview for jobs.

Michelle felt concerned that Barack didn't share her eagerness to wed, but **she hoped that when he returned to Chicago after graduation, they would live together permanently and he would decide to marry her.**

### Fraser Dies

Michelle's father's health deteriorated as his multiple sclerosis worsened, but as always, he wouldn't admit to it. His standard response to health questions was "I'm fine." He refused to go to the doctor, and he continued to go to work every day. He used a motorized scooter to get around at his job.

Eventually Fraser's legs and feet swelled so badly that he couldn't walk at all. Marian called an ambulance to take him to the hospital. The doctors informed him that he had Cushing’s Syndrome, which may or may not have been related to his multiple sclerosis. **The disease was so far advanced that Fraser never left the hospital.**

In March 1991, Michelle visited Fraser and found him so swollen that he was unable to breathe comfortably or speak. She cried, and he took her hand and kissed it. She knew he was saying goodbye, telling her to be strong, and asking forgiveness for not listening to her and calling the doctor sooner. **That night, he had a heart attack and passed away.**

Wracked by grief, Michelle and Craig spent the next day engaged in an absurd argument about what kind of casket to buy their father. Michelle wanted the fanciest casket the family could afford. Craig wanted a simple box, arguing that it’s what their father would want. Later that day, the siblings were able to find the humor in the situation, **knowing that Fraser would have laughed at them, too.**

#### Reflection

**Looking back on her father’s death and its impact on her family, Michelle reflects on the nature of grief—the way it defies logic and normality.** She writes that after a loved one dies, everything hurts. Even joyful things like sunsets or laughing children, which would normally seem beautiful, deepen the sense of loneliness and loss.

### Swerving Off the Law Career Track

Losing her best friend and her 55-year-old father served as a wake-up call for Michelle, reminding her that life was precariously short. It was time to make what she calls "the first real swerve of my life." **At 26 years old, she no longer wanted to follow her lifelong path of high-profile achievement.**

Michelle sought advice from anyone who might know what job would suit a lawyer who didn't want to practice law. She thought she might want to work in public service, so she began sending resumes to nonprofits, foundations, and universities all over Chicago.

An acquaintance introduced her to Valerie Jarrett, the deputy chief of staff for the Chicago mayor's office. **Like Michelle, Valerie had worked at an elite law firm but quickly realized the legal profession wasn't her calling.** Valerie offered Michelle a job as an assistant to Mayor Richard M. Daley.

Michelle believed that Valerie would be an excellent mentor. But she was also skeptical about working in politics, especially at Chicago's City Hall. And she was worried about taking a huge pay cut—the new job would pay only half of her current salary.

Before she could accept the job, she wanted Barack to meet Valerie. Michelle and Barack had recently become engaged, and she didn't feel comfortable making a decision of this magnitude without his input.

### The Engagement

**In a flashback, Michelle relates how Barack proposed to her:** On July 31, 1991, the couple went out for a celebration dinner after Barack took the state bar exam. Michelle knew exactly how hard the exam was—she took it twice because she failed the first time—and she worried that Barack had not studied hard enough for it. But he was as relaxed and confident as always.

During dinner, Barack broached the subject of marriage. He told her he didn't see the point of getting married since they already knew they loved each other. Michelle got angry. She couldn't believe he was bringing up this uncomfortable subject on a happy evening at one of their favorite restaurants.

While the couple debated the merits of marriage, a waiter delivered a dessert plate and placed it in front of Michelle. On it lay a small velvet box holding an engagement ring. **Michelle was suitably surprised—and she knew that Barack had tricked her so she wouldn’t suspect this moment was coming.**

Barack dropped to one knee and asked her to honor him by marrying him. She said yes, and the entire restaurant erupted with applause.

### New Job and Life Partner

Barack met Valerie and encouraged Michelle to accept the job at City Hall. Although everyone in her family thought she was crazy to give up her high-paying law job, **Barack insisted that if she followed her heart and her principles, everything would work out.** Meanwhile, Barack had accepted a position in a Chicago public interest law firm. He also had a contract and a large advance from a New York book publisher who wanted him to write a book about race and identity.

**To celebrate their engagement, the couple journeyed to Nairobi and visited Barack’s relatives.** Michelle was amazed by her first trip to Africa, a land completely different from anything she'd known. Barack’s grandmother Sarah welcomed them to the family's ancestral home, and neighbors and friends came by to meet Barack’s bride-to-be.

#### The Wedding

In October 1992, **Michelle and Barack got married** at Trinity Church in Chicago in front of 300 friends and family members. Their wedding song was Stevie Wonder's "You and I."

**After a honeymoon in Northern California, Michelle and Barack were faced with good news and bad news.** The good news: Their favored candidate Bill Clinton won the 1992 Presidential election, defeating the incumbent George H. W. Bush after an unprecedented turnout.

For Barack, it was an encouraging sign of progress: **Clinton's win demonstrated to politicians that African-American votes mattered.** Right up until the honeymoon, he had been working for a nonpartisan organization called Project VOTE! that helped to register 110,000 new voters. In Chicago alone, more than half a million Black voters had gone to the polls.

### A Missed Deadline

The bad news came from Barack's publishing agent. Because Barack had failed to meet his writing deadline, the publisher canceled his book, and Barack had to repay a $40,000 advance. Michelle wasn't terribly surprised, knowing that **Barack always committed to more projects than he could possibly accomplish.**

Barack was confident that another publisher would buy his book, so he proposed to Michelle that he go into isolation to finish the manuscript. Michelle wasn't happy that just six weeks after their wedding, Barack would take extended time away from her. She found herself thinking it was unfair that he was going on his own solo "honeymoon."

She finally agreed, realizing this might be the only way he would get the book done. Barack retreated to a rented cabin in Bali and returned home five weeks later with a finished manuscript. In a few months, his agent sold it to another publisher. _Dreams from My Father_ was published a few years later.

#### Reflection

Being gregarious and family-oriented, **Michelle found Barack's need for solitude hard to accept. She had to remind herself that she had married an unusual man, an "outside-the-box thinker."** Even though the couple had been together many years, now that they were married, they had new identities to negotiate.

**Looking back at her newlywed self, Michelle realizes she had to learn to adapt to the needs of her partner as well as her own needs.** Michelle had to constantly remind herself that she came from a family whose parents lived like the families depicted on 1960s and 1970s television: Dad worked while Mom stayed home and cared for the kids. (Barack would sometimes kid Michelle that her family was like the Black version of _Leave It to Beaver,_ except poorer.) Barack's childhood and family were vastly different, so of course there would be clashes.

### Career at Chicago City Hall and Newlywed Bliss

Michelle's work at City Hall was completely different from that of being a corporate lawyer. She enjoyed public service, she liked learning about Chicago's inner workings, and she had the benefit of **two female mentors who were both working mothers.** They**** wielded their power skillfully at work but dropped everything if their children needed them. **Michelle realized this was the kind of mother she wanted to be.**

After Barack returned from Bali, the newlyweds settled comfortably into married life. They purchased and moved into a Hyde Park condo, and their days were relatively happy and uneventful. After two years at City Hall, Michelle was offered a leadership role at a nonprofit, and she made another career leap.
