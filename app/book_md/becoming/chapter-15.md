## Chapter 15: Michelle's Early Forties (2004-2006)

This chapter focuses on Michelle's dual roles as career woman and mother, Barack's tenure as a U.S. Senator, and how Hurricane Katrina affects his decision to run for U.S. President. At this stage in Michelle’s “becoming,” she feels satisfied with her career choice and overjoyed to be a wife and mother. But she’s about to face new challenges as Barack moves deeper into the political arena.

At 40 years old, Michelle's life settled into a fairly happy routine. She was careful not to allow her job at the hospital to overtake her family life. She felt like she was "pulling it off"— balancing a challenging and satisfying job with the joys of motherhood. Unlike in her younger years, she no longer threw herself completely into her work. She was protective of her time to make sure she provided a stable life for her girls. **She discovered that living this way made her happy.**

### Barack Runs for Senate

Believing that he could make big changes in Washington, D.C., Barack**toyed with the idea of running for U.S. Senate. Michelle tried to discourage him.**

If Barack ran, his campaign would be especially difficult because he was only an Illinois state legislator. He was unknown on the national political scene. Michelle didn’t think he had much chance at winning—which would mean putting up with all the campaign hoopla for nothing.

But Barack was intent on taking this leap of faith, so Michelle agreed to support him. They struck a deal for the sake of their family: **She made him promise that if he lost the race, he would leave politics altogether.**

Many of the couple's friends agreed to help with Barack’s Senate campaign, including Michelle's former boss at City Hall, Valerie Jarrett. Valerie became his campaign finance chair. ****

### 2004 Democratic National Convention Speech

Massachusetts Senator John Kerry, who was running for U.S. President against George W. Bush, invited Barack to deliver the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. It was an incredible opportunity: As a mere state legislator, Barack had never had this big a chance to get his message across. **He gave a 17-minute speech before a crowd of 15,000 conventioneers, and the applause seemed to go on forever.**

Michelle, who watched from backstage, felt a huge surge of pride. She saw that Barack was exactly where he should be, doing what he should be doing.

#### Reflection

As Michelle looks back on this night in 2004, she realizes that this is the moment when **she finally gives up on the idea that they will ever have a "normal" family life, one that isn't in the political spotlight.** She finally accepts that Barack is destined for political life, and it’s her job to support him in that important calling.

### Barack Becomes a U.S. Senator

The response to Barack's convention speech was overwhelmingly positive. **Journalists started making a leap of faith, calling him "the guy who will be the first Black president.”** People asked for his autograph. His book _Dreams from My Father_ made _The New York Times_ bestseller list. Oprah Winfrey interviewed Michelle and Barack.

The couple found their sudden fame jarring, but they had to adapt. **In November, Barack won his Senate race by 70% of the vote, the largest landslide in that year’s congressional races.**

In January 2005, Barack started commuting back and forth from Chicago to his Senate office in Washington, D.C., so he was gone much of the time. But Michelle's routine was much the same as ever—she kept working at the hospital and the girls went to school and to swimming and ballet lessons.

When another U.S. Senator’s wife called Michelle and invited her to join a private club of Washington wives, she politely declined, explaining that her family was not moving to D.C. The woman gently told her that Senate families could fall apart when they didn't move to the capital. Michelle found this disconcerting, but she insisted that she and Barack wanted to keep the children in their schools and that she was not going to quit her job.

#### Reflection

After that phone call, Michelle thought about how she had been married to Barack for 12 years, but **now for the first time people saw her as "Mrs. Obama," not as an independent career woman whose accomplishments were completely separate from her husband's.** Although she loved Barack, she wasn't willing to drop everything to move to Washington, D.C. to be with him. Life as a Senator's wife wasn’t her choice, and federal politics seemed like a vortex she didn't want to get sucked into. Yet by virtue of her marriage, she felt sucked in.

#### Rumors of a Presidential Bid

Barack had only been a Senator for a short time, but **already the media was conjecturing about whether or not he would run for President in 2008.** Even Michelle's colleagues at the hospital asked her about whether he would run. Barack insisted he was happy working as a new and low-ranking member of the Senate; he just wanted to do his best at that job.

### Hurricane Katrina Hits

Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005, flooding the levees in New Orleans and leaving a wake of devastation. Poor black families were especially hard hit. **Nearly 1,900 people died, and more than half a million people lost their homes.** The federal government's response was pathetically slow and inept.

Michelle and Barack were horrified by what had happened. They knew that if a similar natural disaster occurred in their home town of Chicago, many of their family members and friends—the people Michelle grew up with—would suffer the same fate as the displaced families who were now sleeping on cots in the New Orleans Superdome.

Barack joined the Clinton and Bush families in the Gulf Coast, trying to provide assistance and comfort to people who lost their homes, livelihoods, and family members.

### Barack's Momentum Surges

**Hurricane Katrina was the turning point for Barack, whose entire philosophy was rooted in helping those less fortunate.** It seemed everyone wanted him to run for President. His cell phone never stopped ringing. _Time_ magazine ran a cover story with the headline "Why Barack Obama Could Be the Next President." Even the conservative _New York Times_ columnist David Brooks encouraged Barack to run in a column titled "Run, Barack, Run."

Michelle, who had recently been promoted to vice president at the University of Chicago Medical Center and was content with her career and home life, feared Barack's next step. **She and Barack had already lived through five election campaigns in 11 years, and each one exacted a toll on their personal life.**

For a presidential campaign, every member of the Obama family—even the two girls, who were now five and eight—would be in the spotlight. She couldn't help worrying about how campaign politics and publicity would affect her daughters and her marriage. But Michelle's brother Craig reminded her that if Barack had any shot at winning, he needed to try.

**Michelle knew she could not put her needs, or even their family's needs, ahead of millions of people who desperately needed a voice in government.** She knew that she and Barack enjoyed lives of great privilege while many other people couldn't get access to basic necessities like housing and health care. And she knew Barack might be able to help them.
