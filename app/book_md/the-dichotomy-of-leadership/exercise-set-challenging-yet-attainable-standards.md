## Exercise: Set Challenging Yet Attainable Standards

Willink and Babin assert that it’s up to you to push your team to do their best work, but warn that pushing too hard will hinder their performance. Assess the standards you set for your team: Make sure you’re not overwhelming them with unnecessary rules and are assigning them tasks just difficult enough to help them grow.

* * *

List some of the rules and requirements you obligate your team to follow. Which of these rules contribute the most to your mission’s success, and why?

Which rules and requirements are unnecessary and should be removed? (Remember: Every additional requirement makes your team less likely to care about the important ones.)

Which of your team members do you think are the most bored by their current duties, and what gives you that impression? What challenges could you offer each one to keep them engaged and improve their skills? (For example, if your personal assistant is bored by scheduling your appointments, task them with networking and setting up meetings with potential business contacts.)

Which of your team members do you think are struggling the most to fulfill their current duties, and what gives you that impression? How could you temporarily ease their challenges and keep them from feeling overwhelmed? (For example, if your company’s new salesperson is struggling to meet quotas, assign a veteran employee to coach them for a couple of weeks.)
