## Exercise: Are You Micromanaging or Not Doing Enough?

In the moment, it’s often difficult to notice when you’re leaning too far toward one side of a dichotomy. Take a step back and question whether you’re too involved in your team’s responsibilities—or not involved enough.

* * *

Reflect on your managerial style—do you think you’re more likely to fail by managing too much or not enough, and why? What experiences from your life led you to this conclusion?

If you’re more of a micromanager: List some of the tasks you personally worked on in the past few workdays. Which tasks could you have delegated to other members of your team? What big-picture tasks could you have been doing instead? (For example, if you spent two hours clearing out your email inbox, perhaps you could have assigned this task to an intern or assistant and brainstormed new project ideas instead.)

If you’re more in danger of being too hands-off: Think back to a time when a team member of yours failed you. What could you have done to prevent this failure from happening? (For example, if a designer on your team missed an important deadline, you could have required every designer to send you a progress report a week before the deadline.)
