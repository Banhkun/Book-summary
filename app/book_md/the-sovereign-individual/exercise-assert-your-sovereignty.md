## Exercise: Assert Your Sovereignty

As we’ve discussed, the authors make a number of predictions about technological developments and resulting social changes that they expected to take place in the first part of the 21st century. Most of their predictions have not been fully realized yet, but this exercise will give you a chance to think about how you could take advantage of them when and if they do come about.

Imagine that for a trivial fee, you can hire an AI virtual assistant that is capable of performing any task that a teleworking human with advanced degrees in language, law, graphic arts, and every field of science and engineering could perform. Would you hire one? If so, what is the first task or responsibility that you would assign to it? If you wouldn’t hire one, why not?

Imagine that for a flat annual fee equivalent to about 10% of your current annual income, the government would lease you sovereign control of your current residence. As a sovereign individual, at home you wouldn’t have to have to pay taxes or abide by laws unless you impose them on yourself. And you can impose whatever laws you like on others who come to your home, but it’s up to you to enforce them. Would you lease sovereignty from the government? Why or why not?

Now imagine that most nations have fragmented into many micro-sovereignties, which are competing to attract (or keep) profitable businesses and productive individuals. The city in which you live has just been granted sovereignty and has called for public input on its policies going forward. What one thing (law, program, problem, and so on) would you recommend that they make their top priority to change, implement, or improve?
