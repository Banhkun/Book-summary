## Exercise: Practice Self-Awareness

According to Schwartz, practicing greater self-awareness is one of the first steps in becoming more Self-led. The following exercise will give you the opportunity to reflect on your emotional response to a current personal conflict.

* * *

Think of a conflict in your life. This might be an interpersonal conflict or an internal one. Describe the conflict briefly.

As you thought or wrote about this conflict, what emotion(s) did you feel? Where did these emotions show up in your body?

Choose one of the emotions that came up. Write down three questions you could ask yourself about that emotional response (for example, you might ask what the emotion was trying to tell you). Then answer the questions you wrote down.
