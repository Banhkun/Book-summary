## Exercise: Change Your Environment to Combat Interference

According to Gazzaley and Rosen, reducing accessibility to technology and combating technology-induced anxiety and boredom are key to minimizing interference. In this exercise, reflect on these approaches and consider actions you can take to embrace them.

* * *

On a typical day, how much access do you have to your phone? What actions could you take to limit this access?

How often do you feel bored, either at work or at home? In these moments, do you find yourself drawn to your phone? Why or why not?

Of the strategies discussed above (listening to music, changing your environment, setting daily goals), which sound like promising approaches to alleviate boredom? Why?

Describe how you’ve felt in situations when you’ve been disconnected from your phone. To what extent did you experience anxiety about being unavailable?

If you chose to set clear boundaries with friends and coworkers about when you aren’t available, how do you think they would react? Would you ever consider setting those boundaries? Why or why not?
