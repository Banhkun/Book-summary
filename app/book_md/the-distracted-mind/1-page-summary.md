## 1-Page Summary

With a vast ensemble of screens, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets, always at our fingertips, technology has infiltrated every aspect of our lives. And although this technological boom has delivered exponentially greater access to information, this access ultimately harms our productivity and ability to fulfill our goals, according to neuroscientist Adam Gazzaley and psychologist Larry D. Rosen. In their 2017 book _The Distracted Mind_ , Gazzaley and Rosen argue that **technology has made us significantly more prone to distractions and interruptions** , hampering our higher-level cognitive goals and exacerbating what they call “the distracted mind.”

Gazzaley and Rosen’s backgrounds shape different aspects of _The Distracted Mind_. On one hand, Gazzaley’s experience as the founder of Neuroscape—a neuroscience center exploring the relationship between our brains and technology—informs his discussion of the neural mechanisms underlying the distracted mind. On the other, Rosen’s experience as the author of _iDisorder_ , a best seller distilling years of research on the psychology of technology, proves invaluable in discussing the psychological aspect of technology usage. Additionally, both Gazzaley and Rosen are distinguished academics and have condensed years of their academic work into _The Distracted Mind_.

In this guide, we’ll begin by examining the distracted mind itself, including Gazzaley and Rosen’s definition of what it is and their theory of how it came about. Next, we’ll discuss their argument that technology increases our susceptibility to distractions and interruptions, and we’ll outline the harms of this increased susceptibility. To conclude, we’ll analyze their recommendations for alleviating this condition, including what we can do to improve our cognitive control and modify our environment. Throughout this guide, we’ll also take a deeper dive into the neuroscience that underlies Gazzaley and Rosen’s arguments and consider actionable ways to implement their advice.

### The Basics of the Distracted Mind

To begin, we’ll discuss the distracted mind itself to understand Gazzaley and Rosen’s later arguments about technology’s impact on it. In particular, we’ll start by analyzing Gazzaley and Rosen’s definition of the distracted mind as an ingrained vulnerability to _distractions_ and _interruptions_. Afterward, we’ll discuss their thesis about the origin of this vulnerability—namely, that it arose because our higher-level goals __ outstripped our _cognitive control_ , the faculties that we use to fulfill these goals.

#### Defining the Distracted Mind

To understand Gazzaley and Rosen’s later arguments about the distracted mind, it’ll help to understand what the distracted mind is to begin with. Put simply, they define the distracted mind as **our susceptibility to _interference_ that hinders our ability to achieve our goals**.

At a broad level, Gazzaley and Rosen consider interference to be anything that disrupts your attempt to fulfill a specific goal. For example, imagine that you want to make your morning coffee, so you decide to grind some coffee beans. If, during this process, you receive an email notification that you stop to read, that would be a form of interference.

(Shortform note: Gazzaley and Rosen use “goal” in a broad sense; they aren’t just concerned with specific ambitions, like becoming a doctor or finishing a marathon, but rather with _any_ task that we set out to accomplish, no matter how mundane. Thus, interference can be a problem in all areas of life, from simple tasks like brushing your teeth and making breakfast to complicated tasks like graduating from college.)

More narrowly, they assert that interference can come in the form of _distractions_ or _interruptions_. On the one hand, **_distractions_ refer to irrelevant stimuli or information that catch our attention unintentionally**. For instance, if you’re driving to work in the morning but have your attention temporarily diverted by a flashy car and miss your exit, that constitutes a distraction. (Shortform note: Though distractions afflict everyone to an extent, those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are especially susceptible to distractions. Indeed, those with _inattentive ADHD_ —a subclass of ADHD—struggle to sustain focus, making distractions far more difficult to resist.)

On the other hand, **_interruptions_ are intentional decisions to pursue a secondary goal that detracts from your primary goal. **Returning to the previous example, if you consciously decided to stop and grab donuts on your way to work, that would count as an interruption rather than a distraction. (Shortform note: Procrastination is one common form of interruption, in which you deliberately seek out distractions to avoid working on required tasks. According to experts, this particular mode of interruption often stems from perfectionism since perfectionists worry that they won’t meet their high internal standards, leading them to put off work as long as possible.)

#### How Cognitive Control Limitations Make Us Susceptible to Interference

Having seen what it means to be vulnerable to interference, we can now discuss the origins of this weakness. Gazzaley and Rosen argue that we’re susceptible to interference because **our _cognitive control_ —the group of faculties that allow us to fulfill our goals—has limitations that make us susceptible to interference. **To show as much, they examine these three faculties (attention, working memory, and goal management) to highlight their shortcomings.

##### Faculty #1: Attention

According to Gazzaley and Rosen, the first component of cognitive control is _attention_. They write that **attention is similar to a spotlight** since it allows us to attend to particular stimuli in our environment. For example, attention can allow us to focus on the car in front of us in a traffic jam, the scent of pretzels in a mall, or the crying baby in a movie theater.

When it comes to meeting our goals, Gazzaley and Rosen argue that the ability to focus on particular stimuli increases our brain’s efficiency by filtering out irrelevant information. For instance, imagine that you’re a concert pianist performing a concerto. Instead of fixing your attention on all the other stimuli present, such as the whispers of the crowd or the lighting on stage, you selectively focus on the piano in front of you to maximize your performance.

(Shortform note: Although scientists regularly liken attention to a spotlight, other experts suggest this comparison is mistaken. Indeed, while the spotlight comparison is meant to highlight our ability to attend to one single stimulus, some experts argue that we can simultaneously attend to two different visual stimuli. Consequently, they suggest that the spotlight comparison isn’t perfectly apt since we can “split the spotlight.”)

However, our capacity for selective attention has limits. In particular, Gazzaley and Rosen note that **our attention can be derailed by environmental stimuli that catch our attention,** such as sudden movements or loud noises. If, for instance, you’re conversing with a friend in a coffee shop, your attention might falter if your favorite song comes on the radio. Although this responsiveness to environmental stimuli originally provided survival benefits, such as alerting us to nearby predators, it now detracts from our goals by providing us with frequent interference.

(Shortform note: Although all environmental stimuli have the potential to disrupt our attention, certain stimuli prove more disruptive than others. Neuroscientists agree that _emotionally significant stimuli_ —for instance, angry scowls and crying toddlers—are more likely to catch our attention. Though the reasons behind this are unclear, the experts speculate that the human brain is hardwired to perceive stimuli of personal and social import, which are inevitably tied to emotions.)

##### Faculty #2: Working Memory

Next, Gazzaley and Rosen discuss _working memory_ , the faculty that allows us to retain key pieces of information in our mind over short time spans. They argue that **working memory is crucial in executing higher-level goals** because it allows us to decide how to act on the basis of past perceptions. For example, imagine that you’re driving to a new location after checking the directions at home; your working memory enables you to recall those directions and thus correctly decide which turns to make.

(Shortform note: In addition to working memory, our capacity for long-term memory, which allows us to store information for indefinite periods of time, aids us in accomplishing longer-term goals. For example, if you’re a law student with the goal of passing the bar, your long-term memory will prove crucial in helping you remember information from your first year of law school.)

But, just like attention, our working memory is saddled with limitations that make us vulnerable to interference. Specifically, Gazzaley and Rosen cite experiments showing that working memory is **limited in its accuracy (especially as time goes on) and its storage capacity—and interference can exacerbate these weaknesses.** For example, when distractions and interruptions arise, they claim, we all find it much more difficult to remember what was on our mind; if you’re trying to remember someone’s phone number and get distracted by, say, a baby crying nearby, you’ll find that the number has vanished from your working memory.

(Shortform note: In a separate article, Gazzaley and other neuroscientists performed a study showing that, although all forms of interference harm working memory, interruptions are considerably more harmful than distractions. They attributed this disparity to the fact that unlike distractions, interruptions require us to redirect our mental resources away from our original goal and toward a new one.)

##### Faculty #3: Goal Management

Finally, Gazzaley and Rosen turn to _goal management_ , our capacity for dividing up tasks to accomplish multiple goals within a fixed timeframe. They write that, because humans evolved to juggle multiple goals concurrently, **goal management is essential** **for deciding which tasks to prioritize**.

(Shortform note: “Goal management” is different from “task prioritization,” which refers to the process of arranging tasks in order of importance to help divvy up resources. Whereas task prioritization typically focuses on the individual tasks required to reach _one_ goal, goal management is a broader process that involves organizing multiple goals at once and balancing the tasks needed to pursue these goals simultaneously rather than one at a time (as in task prioritization).)

Goal management, they note, is a combination of two abilities: multitasking and task-switching. Multitasking refers to an attempt to perform multiple tasks simultaneously; for example, you might speak to someone on the phone while driving your car. Task-switching, by contrast, refers to performing different tasks in quick succession, like switching back and forth between your Spanish homework and your math homework. Both of these abilities represent ways to juggle competing goals that you might have.

However, our capacity for goal management also has shortcomings. With respect to multitasking, Gazzaley and Rosen note that our brain can’t process two streams of information at once, meaning we _can’t_ actually multitask—our attempts to do so are actually just a form of rapid task-switching. With respect to task-switching, the authors point out that experiments have shown we suffer performance decreases when we switch between two tasks, as we become less efficient performing the second task. For these reasons, our secondary goals can become a form of interference that harms our ability to fulfill our primary goals.

(Shortform note: Gazzaley and Rosen’s claims about multitasking are in line with the scientific consensus—in the overwhelming majority of cases, what we call “multitasking” is actually quick task-switching. In light of this consensus, experts offer several pieces of advice for efficiently working without attempting to multitask. For example, try to focus on one task at a time until your attention span wanes—usually at about 20 minutes. Moreover, don’t be afraid to work in isolation to prevent other tasks from capturing your attention.)

### Technology’s Impact on Interference

Now that we’ve covered what interference is and why we’re so vulnerable to it, we can discuss the ways that technology has exacerbated this vulnerability. More precisely, we’ll examine Gazzaley and Rosen’s argument that the Information Age increased our susceptibility to interference, their explanation for this increase, and finally, their warnings about the harmful effects of this uptick in interference.

#### Interference in the Information Age

Although Gazzaley and Rosen contend that our vulnerability to interference is a longstanding feature of human nature, they argue that it’s been exacerbated by modern technology. In particular, they argue that **the Information Age made us more vulnerable to interference** by creating information outlets that constantly vie for our attention. To show as much, they first outline how the Information Age increased potential sources of interference and then argue that this new interference has infiltrated our schools and workplaces.

The Information Age, Gazzaley and Rosen argue, began with the onset of the internet around 1990, as information previously only available via encyclopedias became much more accessible. Moreover, the authors point out that the internet led directly to email, which allowed us to communicate instantly with any other internet user.

(Shortform note: Although the internet only began gaining steam in the 1990s, its roots began decades earlier. In 1962 J.C.R. Licklider first articulated his vision of an interconnected network of computers that could communicate with one another, and the US Department of Defense developed the first prototype of the internet in 1969.)

Additionally, the authors argue that two further developments defined the Information Age—social media and the smartphone. First, social media enhanced email’s capacity for communication; whereas before, we could communicate with one person instantly, social media allowed us to communicate with millions of people instantly. Then, with the development of smartphones, we gained access to information from the internet and social media regardless of our location.

The upshot is that **interference became exponentially more common** as new sources of information—such as email alerts, text messages, and Twitter notifications—began to vie for our attention. Whether in the form of distractions, like the sudden “ding” of a text message, or interruptions, like actively choosing to check social media while at work, we became exposed to interference at every corner.

(Shortform note: This increased interference from the Information Age may vary by country. Although social media and smartphones are generally common in countries with developing economies, certain countries see markedly lower social media and smartphone usage. For instance, while above 80% of US adults use a smartphone, only about 30% of adults in countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan own smartphones.)

#### Why Does Technology Make Interference More Common?

Having discussed how technology increases interference, we’ll now examine Gazzaley and Rosen’s explanation for this phenomenon. Broadly speaking, they argue that **technology leads to widespread interference because we’re evolutionarily wired to consume information,** and technology provides easy access to such information.

(Shortform note: Gazzaley and Rosen don’t explicitly explain why __ we’re wired to consume information, though they cite an article with a potential explanation. The article’s author argues that information is predictive of resources that are crucial to survival—like food, water, and shelter. For example, sensory information about high humidity in the air might be suggestive of crops nearby. So, because the evolutionary process selects for traits that help us survive and reproduce, it encourages us to consume information that makes it easier to do so.)

To explain why our drive for information makes us more susceptible to interference, the authors first discuss the _marginal value theorem_ (MVT)—a theory that predicts when animals will shift from one food patch to another to maximize food consumption—and then suggest that its insights can be applied to our information consumption.

##### The Marginal Value Theorem Applied to Food Foraging

Roughly put, the MVT states that three factors determine when an animal will leave its current food patch and forage elsewhere: the amount of food in its current patch, the ease of access to nearby patches, and the amount of food in those nearby patches. In other words, animals are likely to stay in patches rich with food—especially if nearby patches _aren’t_ easily accessible—but will be quick to leave patches with fewer resources—especially when nearby patches _are_ accessible.

To see how the MVT functions in practice, imagine that you go apple-picking and find a tree full of apples that’s surrounded by barren trees. In this case, you likely won’t leave the tree full of apples until you’ve picked all the apples—the prospects of foraging elsewhere aren’t good enough to justify leaving. On the other hand, imagine that you start picking apples from a rich apple tree in a forest full of similarly rich trees. In this case, you’ll be more likely to quickly leave your current tree once you’ve picked its low-hanging apples because you can easily access more plentiful trees once you’ve picked the accessible apples from your current tree.

> **A Deeper Dive Into the Marginal Value Theorem**
> 
> Multiple experimental studies have demonstrated that certain animals’ foraging behaviors conform to the MVT. For instance, one study found that, in a laboratory setting, the foraging behavior of guinea pigs and screaming hairy armadillos matches the predictions made by the MVT. Similarly, a field of study of great and blue tits—two species of birds—found that the birds’ foraging behaviors in their natural environment were roughly in line with the MVT.
> 
> Nonetheless, other experts have pointed out that the MVT has several shortcomings. For example, ecologist Peter Nonacs has argued that the MVT is too simplistic in its exclusive focus on foraging because it fails to consider other activities that animals engage in concurrently—such as seeking mates and avoiding predators. In turn, he contends that many animals’ behavior does not square well with the MVT, since these other considerations influence their foraging behavior.

##### The Marginal Value Theorem Applied to Technological Interference

Crucially, Gazzaley and Rosen argue that the **MVT can be adapted to explain our vulnerability to technology-induced interference**. Treating different information sources—such as social media, emails, and text messages—as “information patches,” they contend that technology has made us more vulnerable to interference for two reasons:

1) Per the MVT, animals more quickly move to another patch of food when that patch is easily accessible. As we’ve discussed, smartphones, social media, streaming platforms, and work group chats have made new patches more accessible than ever. (Shortform note: Though information is becoming more accessible, another factor complicates the situation—information is also becoming lower quality. For example, experts note that the deluge of information on social media often creates widespread “fake news” because it’s more difficult to verify information when we’re exposed to so much of it.)

2) Per the MVT, animals more quickly move to another patch of food when it becomes too costly to stay in their current patch. In our case, technology has increased the costs of focusing on one source of information by inducing anxiety and boredom when we do.

Regarding the second point, Gazzaley and Rosen point to studies showing that, when students concentrate on work-related screens, their cognitive engagement quickly decreases; by contrast, cognitive engagement spikes when they switch to entertainment-related screens. For example, students writing an essay might quickly become disengaged, causing them to switch to Twitter, where their brains are more stimulated. As Gazzaley and Rosen hypothesize, this **quick onset of boredom is likely due to the faster reward cycles associated with media multitasking** —for instance, teenagers are rewarded with new information whenever they switch social media apps, which can create boredom when remaining on one app.

(Shortform note: Some experts contend that the concept of boredom is a recent phenomenon. In _Boredom_ , literary scholar Patricia Meyer Spacks argues that the concept of boredom arose in the 18th century as leisure time became more common; she observes that, at the time, boredom was even considered sinful because it allegedly indicated a lack of faith in God. Moreover, she argues that the emphasis on personal experience that accompanies individualism made boredom all the more salient. So, it stands to reason that although technology may have _exacerbated_ boredom, there are multiple causes at work.)

Finally, to illustrate the **increased anxiety caused by technology** , the authors cite their study of individuals born in the 1990s. They note that of these individuals, approximately half report feeling anxious if they can’t check their text messages every 15 minutes, with similar numbers for other forms of technology, such as social media and email. Moreover, they note that other studies have shown similar results, confirming a link between increased smartphone usage and increased anxiety. In turn, humans are more likely to frequently check their phones—often interrupting other tasks—to mitigate this anxiety.

(Shortform note: Smartphones aren’t the only anxiety-inducing form of technology: Researchers have also found a strong correlation between social media usage and increased anxiety among adolescents. However, the causes behind social media-induced anxiety might differ from those behind smartphone-induced anxiety. Indeed, some experts hypothesize that social media fuels social anxiety in particular because it causes fear of being judged and makes us more self-conscious.)

#### The Harmful Effects of Increased Technological Interference

Now that we’ve seen _how_ and _why_ technology aggravates our distracted minds, it’s time to discuss the impact of this increased technological interference. According to Gazzaley and Rosen, **technological interference does widespread harm in various domains of life** , including school, the workplace, and our relationships.

##### Impact #1: Interference in Education

First, Gazzaley and Rosen write that **technology has led to widespread interference both in and out of the classroom.** According to studies cited by Gazzaley and Rosen, about 90% of college students report using their phones to text while in class—a clear case of interruption (intentional decisions to pursue secondary goals). Moreover, the authors point out that the results are similar outside the classroom: In one study, researchers examined students’ behavior during three-hour study sessions, finding that students checked their phones an average of nine times during these sessions, spending about 30 minutes off task.

(Shortform note: For further context, it bears mentioning that this widespread smartphone use is occurring even though in-class cellphone use is widely banned—the National Center for Education Statistics reports that, in 2020, 77% of public schools had banned nonacademic cellphone use in the classroom. In college classrooms, the picture is further complicated by the fact that many students use their laptops in class, even though researchers have found that increased in-class laptop use is predictive of poorer academic performance.)

According to Gazzaley and Rosen, this technological interference**** decreases students’ productivity and efficiency. They point out that researchers have found that nearly all forms of in-class technology usage are predictive of poorer classroom performance. Moreover, the authors note that researchers have made similar findings for out-of-class technology usage; for instance, one study found that students who paused to send instant messages while completing an assignment took consistently more time than peers who didn’t (even when accounting for the extra time spent messaging).

(Shortform note: Technology-induced interference also became more common in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which compelled students across the country to learn remotely via computers. One study found that students in remote classes demonstrated more frequent mind-wandering (shifting their attention from their primary task to unrelated internal thoughts)—a clear form of internal interference.)

##### Impact #2: Interference in the Workplace

In a similar vein, Gazzaley and Rosen argue that **technological interference has also infiltrated the workplace**. They cite a study wherein researchers observed office workers for two weeks and found that these workers were interrupted over four times per hour by email and three times per hour by instant messaging. Crucially, 40% of these workers immediately dropped their tasks to respond to emails, while 70% did so to reply to instant messages.

(Shortform note: Though technology is ubiquitous in the modern workplace, some experts note that certain forms of technology benefit workers. For example, they point out that noise-canceling headphones actually _decrease_ external distractions, leading to improved worker concentration and performance. Additionally, video conferencing technology enables face-to-face communication with workers from around the world, which can foster a sense of connection in an increasingly remote workplace.)

Gazzaley and Rosen argue that workplace interference**** increases workers’ stress and decreases their efficiency**.** To show as much, they cite a study of over 200 employees that measured the most significant predictors of employees’ stress levels—behind workload, external interruptions were the greatest predictor of stress levels. Further, as for worker efficiency, Gazzaley and Rosen point to studies showing that workers often take around a half-hour to reorient themselves to their initial task following an interruption or distraction.

(Shortform note: Not only does workplace interference increase workers’ stress, but in high-stakes work environments, it can also be deadly. One study found that almost half of all aviation accidents occur because of external interruptions that distract pilots. Similarly, researchers have found that emergency room doctors are regularly subject to external interruptions, which can compromise the quality of patient care.)

##### Impact #3: Interference in Relationships

Finally, Gazzaley and Rosen write that **technological interference has a corrosive effect on human relationships** because it inhibits connection. For instance, it’s common to complain that friends are on their phones at dinner rather than conversing with each other. Moreover, the authors note that empirical studies have verified the adverse effects that technology has on relationships. One study found that when two strangers conversed for the first time, they reported feeling significantly less empathy and connection toward each other when a smartphone was lying on a table nearby; this has been referred to as “the iPhone Effect.”

> **Smartphone Use in Romantic Relationships: Effects and Remedies**
> 
> In a similar vein, research has confirmed that smartphone use often has a detrimental impact on romantic relationships in particular. One study of 145 married adults found that “phubbing”—using your phone as a means of ignoring your partner—was predictive of decreased marital satisfaction, even though it occurs in around 70% of romantic relationships.
> 
> Nonetheless, other experts contend that we can take steps to mitigate the harmful effects of smartphones in our romantic relationships. For example, they recommend setting aside “device-free” time with one another, in which you both turn off your devices to focus entirely on each other. Moreover, they recommend embracing the advice laid out by John Gottman and Nan Silver in _The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work_ —namely, responding positively to your partner’s bids for connection, rather than using your phone to retreat from the conversation.

### How to Become More Resistant to Interference

Having shown the detrimental effects of interference, Gazzaley and Rosen next turn to potential remedies. Although there are no foolproof cures, Gazzaley and Rosen contend that **we can minimize our susceptibility to interference by taking steps to improve our cognitive control and minimize potential sources of interference.**

#### Strategy #1: Improve the Brain’s Cognitive Control

In light of their earlier claim that we’re susceptible to interference because of cognitive control limitations, Gazzaley and Rosen reason that one way to improve this condition is to improve our cognitive control. Although they consider various activities to strengthen our cognitive control, we’ll focus on the four that they contend have the strongest empirical support: **physical exercise, meditation, cognitive exercise, and certain video games.** Of these four, they note that only physical exercise rises to the level of a prescriptive recommendation, while the other three have comparatively less empirical support.

##### Activity #1: Physical Exercise

To begin, Gazzaley and Rosen argue that **a wide body of research clearly supports the beneficial impact of physical exercise on cognitive control.** For instance, one study found that, after consistently undergoing aerobic exercise, children experienced significant boosts in cognitive control. But these results aren’t just limited to children; Gazzaley and Rosen observe that, according to multiple meta-analyses of published studies, physical exercise is predictive of increased cognitive control in adult populations as well.

(Shortform note: Some experts point out that beyond increasing cognitive control, exercise can improve your mental health in other key areas. For example, regular physical exercise has been causally linked to decreased anxiety and depression; although the details are unclear, experts hypothesize that the endorphins released by physical activity play a key role in combating both depression and anxiety.)

##### Activity #2: Meditation

Although exercise has the best-established benefits for cognitive control, Gazzaley and Rosen contend that **consistent meditation might also be beneficial, especially for our selective attention.** In support of their claim, Gazzaley and Rosen cite a seminal study that examined young adults with no previous experience meditating as they went through a five-week long meditation course. This study found that, compared to a control group, participants in the meditation course performed significantly better at tests measuring their selective attention.

(Shortform note: One particularly common form of meditation is _mindfulness_ , which specifically targets attention skills by asking practitioners to shift their attention exclusively to the present moment. Though research into the efficacy of mindfulness is ongoing, one review of mindfulness studies noted a link between mindfulness and increased self-reported well-being.)

##### Activity #3: Cognitive Exercise

In addition to meditation, Gazzaley and Rosen suggest that **cognitive exercise can improve our cognitive control.** Cognitive exercise refers to adaptive “brain games” that become more difficult over time to match players’ skill levels. For example, in Gazzaley’s laboratory, participants took part in a game called _Beepseeker_ —they heard three tones and had to determine whether a target tone was present among the tones, thus testing their ability to filter out extraneous information. Gazzaley and Rosen observed that, over time, older adults who participated in _Beepseeker_ became less vulnerable to distractions in the game, demonstrating improved cognitive control.

(Shortform note: Adaptive brain games like _Beepseeker_ work because they use a practice similar to _progressive overload_ —a physical exercise technique that involves steadily ramping up the difficulty of workouts over time. Just as progressive overload ensures that you’re consistently challenged to yield results, so too do adaptive brain games ensure that your brain is consistently at its threshold to maximize results.)

##### Activity #4: Video Games

In a similar vein, Gazzaley and Rosen argue that **playing certain video games can also lead to improved cognitive control.** Specifically, they cite a study showing that video game players showed superior capacity for attention, both in terms of how fast they processed information and how much information they could attend to simultaneously. This finding was strongest among those who play action games because those games require juggling more tasks simultaneously than non-action games. Moreover, the authors point out that after this initial study, other studies have shown a link between playing video games and increased aspects of cognitive control, such as better working memory and goal management.

(Shortform note: In addition to improved attention, working memory, and goal management, another influential review of studies concludes that video games also noticeably improve our _visuospatial cognition_ —that is, our ability to perceive and imagine objects’ spatial relations with one another. Moreover, because spatial cognition skills strongly predict which students will enter STEM fields, it stands to reason that improving these skills could tangibly impact students’ later career paths.)

#### Strategy #2: Change Your Environment

Although Gazzaley and Rosen are optimistic that we can become more resistant to interference

by improving our cognitive control, they argue that we can also combat interference by **addressing the root causes according to the MVT—increased accessibility of information as well as increased anxiety and boredom** when focusing on one information source.

##### Change #1: Take Steps to Reduce Accessibility

First, Gazzaley and Rosen argue that **we should take concrete steps to reduce our access to external sources of information—especially our smartphones.** Of course, they point out that limiting accessibility will look different depending on the task at hand; when driving a car, for example, you can simply put your phone in the backseat, but this isn’t an option when you’re at work.

Nonetheless, they point out that limiting access is possible in most circumstances. For instance, they recommend closing unnecessary tabs when working on your laptop and creating “tech-free” zones when socializing with friends or family. In doing so, you can artificially restrict access to information that leads to increased interference.

(Shortform note: In a separate discussion of _The Distracted Mind_ , Rosen offers another simple but effective tip for reducing our smartphone usage: Turn off your push notifications if at all possible. Although, strictly speaking, this strategy doesn’t reduce your _access_ to your phone, it does reduce the number of external interruptions that you’re subjected to each day.)

##### Change #2: Take Steps to Reduce Boredom

Next, Gazzaley and Rosen contend that **taking active steps to reduce boredom in situations prone to interference can help us minimize interruptions and distractions.** Once again, they point out that the exact process of reducing boredom will look different depending on the task at hand. However, one frequent activity that they endorse to reduce boredom is simply listening to music—whether while working or studying. In both cases, studies have shown that listening to music can increase cognitive performance without being especially distracting.

(Shortform note: Boredom is especially endemic within the workplace, with one survey of 382 US office workers reporting being bored for above 10 hours per week. To that end, experts recommend a variety of additional steps specifically geared toward combating workplace boredom. For example, you can try altering your workplace environment so that it feels stimulating rather than dull. Alternatively, set daily goals that you can work toward to improve your motivation. And if you do try listening to music, experts recommend instrumental music when you need to focus and music with lyrics when you’re tackling more mindless tasks.)

##### Change #3: Take Steps to Reduce Anxiety

Finally, Gazzaley and Rosen argue that **finding ways to decrease the anxiety we feel when apart from technology helps us combat interference.** In particular, they have one clear recommendation for alleviating technology-induced anxiety in all domains: Set boundaries with your contacts about when you will and won’t be available.

In defense of this approach, they argue that the root cause of most anxiety that we feel when apart from our devices is our concern about missing a text, an email, or an instant message. After all, technology has led us to expect 24/7 availability and instant responses, leading to anxiety when we _aren’t_ available 24/7 and responding instantly. So, by setting boundaries and letting contacts know that we won’t be available during—say—work, school, or mealtimes, we won’t worry about not meeting others’ expectations, making us less anxious.

(Shortform note: Though setting boundaries can be effective in reducing the pressure to be constantly available, some countries’ legislatures have decided this burden shouldn’t fall on workers alone. Countries like Belgium and Portugal have introduced laws prohibiting work-related emails, phone calls, or texts after work hours, recognizing the stress and strain that workers are under when they can’t disconnect. So, institutional changes might also play a role in changing the societal expectations to be always available.)
