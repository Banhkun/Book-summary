## Exercise: Find and Build the Relationship You Want

Now that you’ve learned how to find and keep love in your life, apply Ury’s advice so that you can find and build your ideal relationship.

* * *

Based on your dating history, what is your dating tendency and how has it affected your search for a relationship? (Remember that the three dating tendencies are optimizers, fairytale chasers, and delayers.)

Taking Ury’s tips into account, what’s one thing you can do to improve your odds of meeting a good partner? For example, you might revise your online profile so that it provides specific details or start looking for events you can attend alone.

When you find a good partner, which advice will you implement to maximize your chances of happiness? For example, Ury suggests that you write a relationship agreement and regularly update it.
