## Chapter 2: Welcome to Danbury

Piper self-surrendered in February 2004, reporting to Danbury with Larry. They sat in the waiting room of the correctional facility for hours as they waited for her paperwork to be processed—an early introduction to the red tape and bureaucratic inefficiency that would define so much of her prison experience.

**While waiting, Piper munched on a _foie gras_ sandwich that Larry had packed her the night before, a glaring symbol of her wealth and privilege**. In a prison whose inmate population was disproportionately poor women of color, eating a gourmet sandwich made of fattened duck liver reminded Piper of just how different she was from these other inmates who were about to become her neighbors and daily companions. She mused to herself that this had to have been the only time in the history of the American penal system that someone was eating _foie gras_ in the waiting room.

### Intake

At last, Piper was asked to leave the waiting room and enter the prison to begin the intake process. Larry was not allowed to accompany her beyond this point. Piper said her tearful, painful goodbye to her fiancé, during which Larry told Piper that he would call her and come back to visit her as soon as he possibly could. She watched as he left the waiting room and looked out the window as he crossed the parking lot, got into his car, and drove off out of her sight. She was now truly alone.

After Larry was gone, Piper was brusquely told by the female guard performing her intake that she might not have the opportunity to see Larry for weeks. It would take time for her paperwork to be processed—until it was, her friends and family were not cleared to visit her. Every inmate had an approved and vetted visitor list; if a visitor _wasn’t_ on the list or a correctional officer failed to complete the paperwork to _get_ a visitor on the list (which, Piper learned, was an all-too-common occurrence), the visit would not be approved. This was devastating news for Piper, who desperately needed to see Larry immediately and couldn’t bear the notion of an indefinite separation.

Worse still, they told her that the money in her commissary account (the prison commissary was where inmates could purchase various food, clothing, and personal hygiene items that were not issued by the prison) would have to go through a circuitous process before it was processed and available for use. This, too, she was told, might not be done for weeks.

As she went through the various security checks and moved further and further into the bowels of the prison (and further away from her former life), she was intimidated by the harshness and severity of the prison’s maze of concrete walls, as well as the coarseness of the guards. **All throughout the dehumanizing intake process, her jailors barked orders at her and treated her with minimal human dignity and respect**. Even worse was the strip search. In an effort to find potential contraband or drugs smuggled into the prison, Piper was forced to strip, bend over, squat, and cough, while the correctional officer (CO) performed a cavity search.

The female CO grilled Piper when she saw that she had some photos of friends and family. The CO demanded to know if Piper was smuggling in nude pictures (or “Nudie Judies” as she called them), which was strictly against prison rules. Piper said she was not, and was allowed to take the photos in. Capping off the bewildering process, Piper was finally issued her prisoner number. **She was no longer Piper Kerman; she was now federal inmate #11187-424. It was a new identity for a new life.**

### Coming to Camp

After making it through the initial intake process, Piper was issued her prison uniform. It was standard-issue khaki prison garb, coarse and uncomfortable. Moreover, it was only her temporary uniform. Permanent uniforms wouldn’t be issued for a few days, so her clothes were different from what most of the other inmates were wearing—as if she didn’t already feel alone and isolated from everything she had ever known, now her clothes distinctly marked her out as a newcomer.

Next, she met her counselor, an older male prison official named Butorsky. He had a softer tone toward her than did the COs who handled her intake, and Piper could tell that he was a man of some intelligence. He treated her with relative kindness, remarking upon how unusual it was for someone of her background and upbringing to have received a prison sentence at all. Much to Piper’s relief, Butorsky told her that what she had heard from the COs was not true—all the names on her visitor list were already cleared and Larry would be able to visit her that very weekend! Piper was grateful when Butorsky told her that he would help make sure all the paperwork was clear for Larry to come.

**But there was, Piper quickly learned, a darker and more menacing side to Butorsky**. He warned Piper to stay out of trouble and went on to express his disdain for the homosexual activity that took place inside the walls of the prison. He described himself as an old-fashioned traditionalist who had little patience or tolerance for lesbian relationships. Piper recognized his homophobia and had no idea if Butorsky knew about her bisexual history. She was unsure whether to take Butorsky’s anti-LGBT speech as a general warning he would have issued to anyone, or as a more pointed threat directed at her.

### Rules and Regulations

After her meeting with Butorsky, Piper went in a van to the camp where the minimum security facility was located. To her surprise, the driver of the van was an inmate named Minetta. Piper hadn’t thought that inmates would be allowed to operate vehicles on the premises. After arriving at camp, Piper was assigned to her bunk area and introduced to her bunkmates. The layout of the minimum security camp was not cell blocks with rows and rows of cages, as Piper had pictured. Instead, it was a series of open-concept bunks and common areas, somewhat more akin to a college dormitory.

**Minetta showed Piper around and introduced her to the basic rhythms of prison life that all inmates were required to follow.** These included daily inmate counts, which occurred at regular times throughout the day, during which prisoners were required to report to their assigned bunk and stand at attention so the COs could make sure that no one was missing.

Minetta also told Piper about the assigned meal times, which were staggered for different sections of the prison—Piper would eat dinner at 4:30 (ridiculously early for a hip New Yorker like Piper). Bizarrely, Piper also learned that in order to pass Butorsky’s rigid inspections, she would not be allowed to actually sleep _in_ her bed under the bedding. She would need to make the bed and then sleep on top of it without getting under the covers. **All in all, it was a barrage of unfamiliar (and seemingly arbitrary) rules and regulations.**

Later, Piper met Rosemarie, an Italian-American woman from Massachusetts. As a fellow Bay Stater with a comforting demeanor, Rosemarie provided a feeling of familiarity for Piper in this strange and bewildering place. After meeting Minetta and Rosemarie, she used the office phone of another prison counselor, Mr. Toricella, to call Larry. Piper was delighted to hear his voice and to hear him tell her that he loved her—it was a connection to her old life, which already seemed so distant.

### Learning the Ropes

The next day, Piper received her permanent, official uniform. But she was still not fully integrated into the Danbury ecosystem. As a new arrival, Piper was classified as “A&O” (admission and orientation). This meant that she was not yet eligible to be assigned to a permanent job, for which she could be paid (albeit at $0.14 per hour), until she was cleared to have one. **This was yet another example of the maddeningly slow and inefficient bureaucracy, which seemed to be an inescapable feature of prison life.** The slow-moving pace of events was called “prison time” by the inmates.

**Piper headed to the orientation session with her fellow new inmates.** These women were a mix of those who, like Piper, were experiencing the penal system for the first time, as well as recidivists who had been in and out of prison before. At orientation, they listened to a series of lectures from various prison officials, the goal of which was to familiarize the new arrivals with the rules and culture at Danbury. The on-staff psychiatrist was blunt in admitting to the women that he had no resources to provide comprehensive mental health services—all he could do was issue antipsychotic and antidepressant medications.

The final presenter was the female warden, Ms. Deboo, an attractive, put-together, and thoroughly professional woman. She used her speaking time to warn the new arrivals about sexual contact in prison and reminded the women that non-consensual sex was strictly prohibited. As she spoke, Piper realized she wasn’t talking about sexual contact between inmates; she was talking about unwanted advances from the guards. Clearly, the fact that Warden Deboo felt the need to give such a warning spoke to the abuses that were possible in an environment with such a **stark power disparity between male guards and female inmates.**

Piper was impressed by Warden Deboo, but other inmates saw through her polished presentation. They said that the warden was disingenuous, driven by ambition, and concerned primarily with appearances, assuring Piper that she rarely ventured into the prison to interact with inmates and staff.

### Making Friends

**One of the things that first struck Piper was how much race determined and defined the culture at Danbury**. Segregation was the unwritten rule behind bars—although there were some exceptions, most people hung out in racially homogenous groups, with little intermingling across racial lines. In these early days of her prison sentence, most of Piper’s friends were white, predominantly Italian-American. The prison officials reinforced this by lumping racial groups together into the same cell blocks, which, characteristically, bore stereotyped names (“Spanish Harlem” for the Latina inmates, “The Ghetto” for the African-American inmates).

She saw the racial solidarity during her first days at camp, when a series of white inmates gifted Piper various provisions from the commissary, because they knew that she didn’t yet have the money to purchase anything. This, Piper learned, was a ritual performed by all the racial groups at Danbury with new arrivals.

In conversations with other women, Piper saw that they freely discussed one another’s lengths of imprisonment. She was baffled by the seeming randomness of different inmate sentences, as women convicted of similar offenses often received wildly divergent punishments. It was also clear that there was racial bias built into the criminal justice system, as **women of color tended to have disproportionately harsher sentences than white inmates who’d committed similar offenses.**

She befriended a group of women, including Nina, Rosemarie, Annette, and Yoga Janet, an older hippie who organized yoga classes in the recreation room at the prison. **This clique of women kept an eye out for Piper, easing her transition to prison life and coaching her through the dizzying rules and regulations** —both official and unofficial. The consequences of violating this code could vary from being mocked to having one’s visiting privileges revoked to even being sent to solitary confinement in the segregated housing unit (SHU) for an indeterminate period of time.

Piper saw that prison life really was a series of “chickenshit rules enforced by chickenshit people.” Much of the day-to-day experience consisted of standing in line, whether it was to eat, receive mail, shower (in maggot-infested stalls with notoriously unreliable hot water), or be counted by the COs. Many of the women who came from less-privileged backgrounds than Piper knew this dehumanizing experience all too well, having dealt with the welfare, public housing, drug treatment, and juvenile criminal justice bureaucracies all their lives.

**Piper found herself clinging to daily rituals and routines in an effort to regain some agency and mastery over her life** —giving herself some power and control in a situation where she otherwise had none. So she would make her coffee the same way every morning; sit in the yard at her usual spot; and talk with Nina. She internalized the old prison mantra: do your time, don’t let your time do you.

Piper was relieved and grateful to have a community that took an interest in her well-being and helped soften the blow of prison. Even small acts of kindness, such as when Nina made Piper a root beer float (made by pouring cans of root beer into a coffee cup and dumping scoops of generic commissary ice cream into it), went a long way toward easing her crushing homesickness.

### Receiving Emotional Support

For the first few days at Danbury, Piper lived in “the Rooms.” These were dormitories where new inmates lived until they could be assigned permanent housing. Also in the Rooms were inmates who were pregnant, chronically ill, or otherwise unable to live in the general population.

Each day, Piper learned something new and strange about prison—and about the women with whom she was serving time. One inmate, she learned, was a nun. This woman had been locked up for organizing anti-war protests at Department of Defense facilities. Piper’s clique of predominantly Italian-American, Catholic inmates were outraged that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) would actually incarcerate a member of the clergy.

Despite making friends, **Piper was still new to prison life, blinded by her privilege, and capable of putting her foot in her mouth**. One day at mealtime during her first week at Danbury, Piper made a wisecrack about how the inmates should organize a hunger strike to protest the bad food. Pop, a Russian-American inmate who sat high atop the prison social pyramid (and who also ran the kitchen whose food Piper was insulting), dressed Piper down. Pop told Piper _never_ to make jokes about that, because another inmate might tell a CO that she was trying to incite a riot, which could land Piper in the SHU. It was a lesson to Piper—watch what you say, and watch who you’re talking to.

But there was something to look forward to—Larry’s visit that weekend. Piper could hardly contain her emotion upon seeing him in the visiting room, though the physical contact she could have with him was severely limited by BOP rules. Although it had only been a few days, it already felt like a lifetime since she’d seen him. Piper also noticed children in the visiting area, coming to see their incarcerated mothers. It was a humbling reminder that she was not the only one whose family had been impacted by prison.

It was not just Larry who was offering Piper emotional support from the outside. She was struck by the outpouring of sympathy and love from friends and family who sent her books and letters on a near-constant basis. The books did somewhat single her out as a privileged intellectual and outsider among the other inmates, not to mention the fact that many of her fellow prisoners simply lacked the kind of outside social and emotional support systems that Piper had.

**Piper needed to overcome some of her own subconscious prejudices.** One day, a black inmate named Rochelle asked Piper if she could borrow one of her books. Piper was ashamed to discover that she harbored racialized fears that Rochelle would steal her book (Piper also felt racist for having instinctively given Rochelle a book by black author Zora Neale Hurston, as if that was the only kind of literature she could possibly enjoy). When Rochelle returned it a week later, Piper mentally chided herself for assuming the worst about Rochelle. She saw that she had much to learn about humility—after all, how was she any different than these other women?

Still, Piper was immensely grateful to have so many people who cared about her. She even received materials from friends of friends, people she’d never met, who wanted to correspond with her and show their solidarity.
