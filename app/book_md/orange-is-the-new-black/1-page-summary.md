## 1-Page Summary

_Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women’s Prison_ is a memoir by Piper Kerman, detailing her experiences as an inmate at a federal women’s prison, where she served for just over a year. **Piper was a privileged, well-educated white woman** **from an upper-middle-class family.** Shortly after graduating college in the early 1990s, Piper became involved with her girlfriend Nora Jansen’s international drug smuggling operation. Despite the glamour of her jet-setting lifestyle, however, Piper had growing apprehensions about what she was doing. She knew that Nora was untrustworthy, dangerous, and fully willing to exploit her for her own advantage. Nora thought little of putting Piper at great legal and physical risk if it meant more profit for the drug smuggling operation. Ultimately, Piper ended her relationship with Nora and cut off all ties with her.

### Indictment and Plea

Piper began a more conventional, risk-free life, glad to have put her criminal past behind her. She landed a job as a television producer and editor, working primarily on infomercials and met and fell in love with a man named Larry. He was not the risk-seeking, hip, bohemian type she had traditionally been attracted to, but he was good-hearted, kind, and loved her intensely—and Piper found, this was all she ever wanted.

The happy couple moved to New York City for work in 1998. That May, US customs officials appeared at their home to tell Piper that she was indicted on conspiracy charges related to her old drug smuggling activities. Nora had given Piper’s name to the authorities, which had resulted in her being charged as a co-conspirator. Terrified of a potentially long sentence if she risked trial, Piper accepted a plea deal and awaited her fate. After Piper pleaded guilty, Larry proposed to her. She knew that together, they would be able to overcome whatever the future had in store for them.

Piper was, at last, sentenced on December 8, 2003 to 15 months in prison at the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, a minimum-security women’s prison. The unknown date which Piper had dreaded for five years was at hand.

### Self-Surrender

Piper self-surrendered in February 2004, a decade after committing the offense for which she was convicted. As a glaring symbol of her privilege, Piper ate a _foie gras_ sandwich while she waited to be processed. All throughout the dehumanizing intake process, the guards barked orders at her and treated her with minimal human dignity and respect. Piper underwent a humiliating strip search, during which she was forced to strip, bend over, squat, and cough, while the correctional officer (CO) performed a cavity search. At last, she was issued her prisoner number. **She was no longer Piper Kerman; she was now federal inmate #11187-424, a new identity for a new life.**

Once she arrived at the minimum security camp, the inmates showed Piper around and introduced her to the basic rhythms of prison life that all inmates were required to follow. These included daily prisoner counts, assigned meal times, and bed inspections. All in all, it was a barrage of unfamiliar (and seemingly arbitrary) rules and regulations. **Piper learned that everything in prison was governed by a maddeningly slow and inefficient bureaucracy**.

At prison orientation a few days later, the female warden warned the new arrivals about sexual contact in prison and reminded the women that non-consensual sex was strictly prohibited. As she spoke, Piper realized she wasn’t talking about sexual contact between inmates—she was talking about unwanted advances from the _guards_.

### Adjusting to Prison Life

Race determined and defined the culture at Danbury. Segregation was the unwritten rule behind bars. Most of Piper’s friends were white, predominantly Italian-American. The prison officials reinforced this dynamic by lumping racial groups together into the same cell blocks, which, characteristically, bore stereotyped names (“Spanish Harlem” for the Latina inmates, “The Ghetto” for the African-American inmates).

**Piper clung to daily rituals and routines in an effort to give some order to her day and provide herself with some agency and mastery over her life** —giving herself some power and control in a situation where she otherwise had none. So she would make her coffee the same way every morning; sit in the yard at her usual spot; and internalize the old prison mantra of doing your time, not letting your time do you.

**Piper had to overcome some of her own subconscious prejudices about the kinds of people she now found herself living with**. One day, a black inmate named Rochelle asked Piper if she could borrow one of her books. Piper was ashamed to discover that she harbored racialized fears that Rochelle would steal her book. When Rochelle returned it a week later, Piper mentally chided herself for assuming the worst about Rochelle. She saw that she had much to learn about humility—how was she any different than these other women?

### Finding Community

**Inmates managed to hold on to their culture and dignity, even inside prison**. The West Indian women and “Spanish mamis” managed to make genuinely delicious Latin and Caribbean dishes, using nothing more than junk food from the commissary as ingredients. The human spirit and passion for creativity could not be extinguished, even at Danbury.

Piper tried hard not to advertise her privilege and unique status as an upper-middle-class white woman in a prison disproportionately populated by underprivileged people of color. She turned down an opportunity to become the prison van driver (a coveted high-status position) and declined an offer from Pop, a powerful and influential leader among the white prisoners, to become her bunkmate, lest she be perceived as racist if she chose to leave her black bunkmate, Natalie.

Although Piper had chosen not to bunk with her, Pop became like a mother to Piper, guiding her through the trials and tribulations of prison with a unique mixture of compassion and tough love**.** She was exactly the kind of guardian figure someone like Piper needed in Danbury. She had a genuine warmth and compassion and made it her business to look out for the “girls” in her crew. And that now very much included Piper.

**The women of Danbury did everything they could to hold onto some sliver of their humanity and their individuality**. This included setting up a makeshift beauty salon on campus and sewing alterations into their uniforms (strictly prohibited by the regulations) to better match their personal style. Piper also found strength in her community _outside_ prison—from her parents, Larry, and friends, who came from all over the country, dropping other commitments to visit her.

That spring, a new inmate came to the minimum security camp as a reward for her good behavior at the neighboring maximum security facility. This woman, “Crazy Eyes” Morena, attempted to seduce Piper. Piper knew that **many women engaged in brief, experimental same-sex relationships during the period of their incarceration** —going “gay for the stay” as it was called—but she was determined to remain faithful to Larry. Eventually, Piper politely but firmly rebuffed Crazy Eyes’s advances.

**The key to survival and sanity was to avoid getting sucked into the petty drama and upheaval of prison life**. So many women, Piper saw, became institutionalized and unable to function outside of prison—for them, _prison_ had become their entire world. She witnessed many inmates returning to Danbury after being released, even requesting to be reassigned to their old cell blocks and bunks.

### Hitting a Stride

After months of being told it was unavailable, Piper was finally able to acquire a portable radio from the commissary. The radio became her constant companion on her daily runs through the yard, the music connecting her back to the days of her youth, when she was carefree, foolish, and filled with limitless possibilities. Like so much else, it was a precious connection to her life in the world outside. On May 17, Piper celebrated her eighth anniversary with Larry and yearned for the day when she would be free again.

That spring, Piper helped two inmates earn their GEDs—her bunkmate Natalie and a longtime inmate named Mrs. Jones. This was important, because, **without a high-school education, many inmates lacked the credentials to get decent jobs, often landing them right back in prison.** Although Piper did a lot of the actual coursework (especially for the barely literate Mrs. Jones), she knew she was doing the right thing. When they graduated, Piper was overcome with emotion, openly weeping at seeing how these women had overcome such enormous obstacles to regain some power and agency over their lives.

One summer day, Piper enjoyed an unexpected trip to a picnic area by a lake, where the prisoners were laughing and enjoying the rare opportunity for outdoor recreation. Piper plunged her hands into the lake, feeling the cool water rush over her. Her work situation also improved that summer. After being humiliatingly sexually harassed by DeSimon, her odious boss in the electrical shop, Piper requested and received a work transfer away from him.

### Systemic Failures

**Piper saw how the American criminal justice system was very good at locking up addicts, but spectacularly bad at treating their addiction**. The ideology driving the prison system was entirely retributive—there was almost no focus on restoration or rehabilitation, on making sure that people who were released from prison didn’t come back. The consequences of this failing system were everywhere—broken families, squandered opportunities, and ruined lives.

That fall, the annual job fair came to Danbury. This event was yet another reminder of how inadequately the prison was preparing its inmates to functionally reintegrate into mainstream society. When inmates had questions about job training, or what employers might be open to hiring women with a record, the prison’s job fair organizers simply had no answers. **Pre-release programs, meanwhile, offered no information about how to access health and reproductive care services** (obviously a priority for destitute women), find a job, secure housing, get drug treatment, and regain custody of their children.

Poor administration created unsafe conditions in the prison and exposed prisoners to the most sadistic and abusive impulses of individual COs who were eager to exploit the massive power disparity. One woman even got sent to solitary confinement after carrying on a (possibly non-consensual) sexual relationship with a male CO and getting sucked into a power struggle between the CO and a top administrator at the prison.

**Prisoners had no recourse against abuse at the hands of the guards—such was the nature of the drastic power imbalance between male guards and female prisoners**. These men fed off the power they wielded over powerless inmates, relishing their authority and capacity to inflict harm on those who couldn’t fight back.

### Out of Danbury

In the second week of December, Piper’s lawyer contacted her to tell her that her time in Danbury would be coming to an end even sooner than she thought, but _not_ because she was getting early release—she would soon be transported to Chicago to testify against an old drug ring associate. Piper would not be returned to Danbury before her ultimate release to say a final goodbye to her prison friends and family.

On January 3, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) put Piper on a plane. As she was leaving, the other women gave Piper advice for surviving the ordeal of the prison flight, with one prisoner urging her to smile at the guards escorting her onto the plane, so they wouldn’t cuff her too tight and kill her circulation.

Piper’s first destination wasn’t Chicago—it was the Oklahoma City Federal Transfer Center, a temporary holding facility that held prisoners either awaiting trial or waiting to testify in someone else’s trial. It would be Piper’s home until her time came to testify.

### Seeing Nora

Life in Oklahoma City was dull and monotonous—the lack of windows made it difficult to even tell the passage of time. One day, Piper saw a familiar figure emerge from a cell and take her place on the breakfast line—Nora Jansen, the woman who’d sent her to prison and totally derailed her life. Piper fantasized about taking violent revenge, but, thankfully, was talked out of doing anything rash by one of her friends from Danbury who had also made the journey west with her.

In mid-January, Piper was told once more to pack out and board a plane to Chicago. But, this time, she was joined on the flight by Nora and her sister, Hester. The marshals even made Piper sit next to Nora on the long flight. After arriving in Chicago, Piper began to experience a thaw in her attitude toward her former girlfriend. They were no longer enemies with a tumultuous history. Now, they were fellow travelers on this bizarre journey together.

**In this environment, Nora and her sister were the only people with whom she was capable of forming some sort of friendship**. They formed a trio in Chicago, hanging out together, cooking meals with one another (the sisters were accomplished prison chefs), and generally lamenting the sloppy and unprofessional conditions at the Chicago correctional center.

Nora insisted to Piper that she had _not_ given her name to the feds. Piper knew Nora to be a cunning and manipulative liar, but she decided to accept that she would never know the truth and let go of it. After nearly a decade of all-consuming hate toward Nora, it was time to make peace and move on.

### The End

After the largely pointless and perfunctory trial, Piper focused on her impending March 4 release. Piper took the time to reflect and take stock of her experience and the wild journey she’d been on. She’d found a community of women in prison that had saved her and made her feel less alone in the world. **Their struggle and success in preserving their humanity in the face of a system that sought to crush it was nothing short of heroic**. They taught her compassion she never thought herself capable of and revealed strengths she never knew she had.

On March 4, Piper received her final call to “pack out.” (She was released two months early for good behavior.) The COs took her down the service elevator of the federal prison in Chicago. And just like that, she was on the streets again in broad daylight, a free woman once more. Larry was waiting outside to meet her. She sprinted over to him as fast as she could. Her long ordeal was over at last—but she would be forever shaped by her experience and the incredible women with whom she’d shared it.
