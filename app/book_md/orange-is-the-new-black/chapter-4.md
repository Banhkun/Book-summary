## Chapter 4: Prison Family

At the end of May, it was Mother’s Day. This was an especially difficult day for many of the incarcerated mothers at Danbury, as it reminded them of their forced separation from their children—indeed, 80 percent of the American female prison population are mothers. Piper saw that **families missed whole chapters of each other’s lives because of prison—births, deaths, weddings, graduations, and other major milestones**. Many women at Danbury experienced a loved one passing away on the outside without ever having the opportunity to say goodbye.

Deprived of the company of their real families, prisoners formed their own adopted families. These usually featured an older woman functioning as a “mom” to a group of younger “daughters.” Pop served as Piper’s “mom,” while two inmates named Toni and Rosemarie were her “sisters.”

One pregnant inmate, a woman named Doris, went into labor at Danbury and gave birth to her son after she was transported to a local hospital. Piper learned that in some prisons in the US, pregnant inmates were forced to give birth while shackled—a barbaric practice that, thankfully, Doris was not forced to endure. Nevertheless, Doris was immediately separated from her son after birth. Clearly, motherhood operated under a different set of circumstances in the prison system.

### Anniversary

Although she detested working in the electrical shop under the crass, vulgar, and mean-spirited DeSimon, Piper’s electrical skills were markedly improving. After word got out that she successfully fixed a radio for a fellow inmate, Piper began earning some respect from the broader prison community. She developed a reputation as Danbury’s resident mechanic, making her and the entire electrical crew more popular around the prison.

After months of being told it was unavailable, Piper was finally able to acquire a portable radio from the commissary. The radio became her constant companion on her daily runs through the yard. Piper particularly enjoyed a program on a local college radio station that played a lot of early-90s alternative rock music—bands like Nirvana, Teenage Fanclub, and Blur. Hearing this music (which was no longer being heavily played on mainstream rock stations in 2005) transported Piper back to the days of her youth, when she was carefree, foolish, and filled with limitless possibilities. **Like so much else, it was a precious connection to her life in the world outside.**

Another connection to the outside presented itself on May 17, when Piper celebrated her eighth anniversary with Larry. To honor the occasion, she wrote him a message on a Hallmark card (one of the free ones on donation at the prison chapel). The anniversary brought home the reality that she was incarcerated and unable to be with the man she loved. Piper bemoaned her imprisonment and yearned for the day when she would be free again.

### GED Program

**Although Danbury did offer a GED program for inmates, it was notoriously inadequate.** The teachers didn’t care about their students or their results and the program was marred by student delinquency and misbehavior.

The situation was all the more tragic because inmates who lacked a high-school education were not eligible for wage increases unless they completed the GED program. Natalie, Piper’s bunkmate in the Ghetto, was one such prisoner. Although Natalie was highly skilled as a baker, her earnings were capped at $0.14 per hour because she lacked a high school diploma.

Even worse, **the failures of the prison education program put recently released prisoners, especially women, in an incredibly vulnerable position**. Without a high-school education, most of these ex-convicts were unable to secure legal and gainful employment. This, of course, led them right back to a life of crime in the underground economy—as prostitutes or drug dealers—which, in turn, landed them right back in prison.

Despite the obvious failures of the program, some women did manage to complete it and earn their GEDs. The spring that Piper was at Danbury, Natalie graduated. Graduation Day was always a huge occasion for celebration at camp. It was an extraordinary accomplishment for these women, who overcame enormous struggles in their journey to earn an education and build better lives for themselves and their families. Many entered the program with almost no formal education at all, having dropped out of school more than a generation ago. Their differences with the worldly and college-educated Piper could not have been more stark, but Piper was nevertheless ecstatic on Graduation Day. Piper was overcome with emotion when Natalie was called to receive her diploma.

Not long after Natalie’s graduation, Piper began mentoring an inmate, an “OG” named Mrs. Jones. Piper had a reputation as book-smart and Mrs. Jones wished to tap into Piper’s academic skills to help her in her coursework. Mrs. Jones was Danbury’s longest-serving inmate, incarcerated there since the mid-80s. She also seemed to Piper to be somewhat mentally unstable—a combination, Piper learned, of domestic abuse at the hands of her husband and of her long incarceration.

Now, however, Mrs. Jones was due to be released within the year and she wanted to wrap up her GED before she stepped back out into the real world. She needed to write a paper for her business course, but, as Piper soon realized, Mrs. Jones expected _Piper_ to do all the work. Piper had qualms about helping a student essentially cheat in her coursework, but reasoned that the greater injustice would be to let Mrs. Jones fail.

Piper dutifully wrote a generic three-page essay for the course, for which Mrs. Jones received an A. She ultimately helped Mrs. Jones “earn” an A- for the course. The sudden transformation of a barely literate student into one who could write eloquent term papers on the Industrial Revolution and hybrid cars never raised the slightest suspicion from the clearly apathetic course instructors.

But when Mrs. Jones graduated with her cohort, Piper had the privilege of witnessing the speech of a prisoner named Bobbie, who was the class valedictorian. Bobbie was exuberant and inspiring, reminding the women on stage that they had overcome extraordinary odds to earn their degrees and that it was proof they could achieve anything. It was a powerful assertion of the inmates’ agency—**a victory over the systems of oppression and discrimination that held them back for their entire lives.** For her part, _**_ Mrs. Jones sent Piper a card with a single message on the back: “To a dear friend. I made it. God bless you.”

### The Lake

As spring turned to summer and the weather began to warm, Piper became reinvigorated. She saw that her sentence, which once seemed so daunting and insurmountable, was gradually going by—one-quarter complete, one-third complete. Each time milestone was a small victory.

One day in June, Piper was reading a book on one of the benches in front of the electrical shop, on a day when DeSimon hadn’t shown up for work. The scene was peaceful, although occasionally marred by the crack of rifle fire from the COs’ shooting range—unsettling because Piper knew the COs on the range were preparing for the day when they might have to shoot _her_ and her fellow prisoners.

Suddenly, the boss of the carpentry and construction shops pulled up to Piper in a white pickup. Although he could be vulgar, Mr. Thomas was generally garrulous and jovial, at least for a CO. He invited Piper to hop into the pickup truck, not telling her where they were headed.

Piper was delighted when Thomas pulled up next to a picnic area beside a blue and glistening lake. _**_ Inmates from carpentry and construction were sitting at the picnic tables, laughing and enjoying the rare opportunity for outdoor recreation. Piper plunged her hands into the lake, feeling the cool water rush over her. She spent the rest of the day painting the scenery and taking in the entire sight—a rare opportunity to see something beautiful in the middle of the ugliness of prison. Although the lake trip reminded Piper that this was the first summer she wouldn’t be swimming, it was still a glorious day.

### Out of Electrical

But working in the electrical shop with the detestable Mr. DeSimon was a grim reminder for Piper that **she was still in prison and, therefore, subject to the whims and power trips of the COs**. Piper had particular distaste for DeSimon, who took delight in emotionally tormenting her. One of his favorite ways to tweak her was to call her “Kermit,” instead of her last name, Kerman. The whole experience of working in the electrical shop was degrading, dehumanizing, and often dangerous.

One day, the electrical crew was working on a project to fix the air conditioning in the visitors’ room on the floor above. This required them to snake long, thick cables through a hole in the roof and connect them on the next floor. It was a multi-person job, and quite a dangerous one at that—someone had to lift the cables off the ground floor, hand them to someone perched atop a ladder, who then needed to feed them through to the person on the next floor. If someone dropped the heavy cables, the person on the ladder could fall and become gravely injured. DeSimon assigned Piper the job of “greaser.” She was to lubricate the cables with a petroleum jelly, which would make them easier to snake through.

He deliberately gave Piper this job so he could direct leering and menacing sexual innuendos at her. He ordered her to grease up the “horse cock,” in reference to the phallic-looking cables. The rest of the day, he made lewd jokes to Piper about how much she enjoyed “horse cock.” It was the most disgusting and threatening experience she’d had at Danbury, one which demonstrated to her **the rampant culture of sexual harassment and abuse among the male COs.**

Outraged, Piper reported the incident to DeSimon’s boss and requested a transfer out of the hated electrical shop. To her great relief, her request was granted and she secured a transfer to construction in July.

Working on the construction crew that summer, Piper was part of a team that was building a house on campus for the incoming prison warden (Warden Deboo was leaving for a new position in California). Although the work was hard, Piper enjoyed the opportunity to be working inside a house instead of toiling in the electrical shop. She noticed how physically strong she had become since arriving in Danbury that February.

Working on the house one day, she went into the bathroom and took the opportunity to strip off her clothes—something she lacked the freedom and privacy to do in the cramped quarters of the Ghetto. It was the first time she’d seen herself naked in a mirror in over half a year. To her amazement, **Piper saw that she’d lost many of the physical marks of thestressshe’d accumulated since being indicted**. She looked as young as she had when she jumped the waterfall in Indonesia ten years ago. Somehow, prison had recharged and rejuvenated her. It was as if she had gotten a new beginning.

### New Arrivals

If summer brought Piper a new job assignment and more exposure to nice weather, it also brought about other changes around the prison. She noticed that conditions got noticeably worse in the summertime months, as washing machines and hair dryers began to break down, due to the limited electrical supply and the overuse of air conditioning in the warm weather. The camp began to get dirtier, uglier, and meaner. The social ties that bound individuals and groups together frayed. For Piper, it was like _Lord of the Flies_.

**That summer, a new prisoner named Vanessa came to camp from the maximum security facility.** Vanessa was an object of great curiosity and some apprehension—she was a post-op transgendered person, having been born a male. Many of the women at Danbury feared her, believing that her muscular, masculine body (partially the result of being deprived certain hormones in prison) gave Vanessa a dangerous physical advantage.

Others harbored traditionalist prejudices against her, believing that it was sinful or unnatural to change one’s gender. Unfortunately, such attitudes were not confined to the inmates. Many of the COs (never an LGBT-friendly lot to begin with) refused to respect her gender identity and insisted on calling her by her original male name of Richard.

But Vanessa was not one to be easily intimidated. She became a popular figure in the Ghetto, showing off her womanly features and displaying her colorful personality. She was charming, funny, and insightful, in addition to being a full-blown diva. Piper liked and admired Vanessa for her courage, although she disliked her nightly ritual of loudly (and poorly) singing religious hymns as the rest of the dorm attempted to sleep.

Piper got another new neighbor, a 22-year-old nicknamed Pom-Pom. Pom-Pom told Piper that her mother had also been an inmate at Danbury, though she had no idea what had become of her. Hearing this story was deeply distressing to Piper. She feared that Pom-Pom’s mother was dead, but could not bring herself to share this belief with her new neighbor. **Pom-Pom’s story was all too common—multigenerational convicts in a single family, with parents, children, siblings, and cousins sometimes locked up together in the same prison.**

### A Failing System

**The failures of the prison system were all around Piper. The American criminal justice system was very good at locking up addicts but spectacularly bad at treating their addiction.** The ideology driving the prison system was entirely retributive—there was almost no focus on restoration or rehabilitation, on making sure that people who were released from prison didn’t come back. Piper knew that many inmates would simply become part of the revolving- door criminal justice system, falling back into lives of addiction, crime, and almost-inevitable reincarceration.

The consequences of this failing system were everywhere—broken families, squandered opportunities, and ruined lives. Every time Piper saw an inmate walking around with track marks (scars from injecting heroin) on their arms, she felt tremendous guilt. Even though it had been long ago, her criminal activity with Nora contributed to this suffering. **On the other side of her glamorous, thrill-seeking, jet-setting life with Nora was terrible social destruction, lives lost to addiction, and families torn asunder.**

Even events that were meant to be uplifting were sobering reminders of the grim consequences of incarceration on these women and their families. Each year, the prison organized a Children’s Day carnival with games and activities for kids while they came to visit their incarcerated mothers. Piper manned the face-painting booth at the carnival and genuinely enjoyed meeting and bonding with the children. They were sweet kids who were clearly suffering from the absence of a parent. It was emotional to see so much happiness in such a dreary place. **But witnessing the tearful goodbyes at the day’s end was a terrible reminder of the human toll of the prison system.**

### The Exam

Danbury, despite being a women’s prison, made minimal accommodations for women’s health. The facility failed to provide even basic items like tampons or Maxi pads, forcing inmates to purchase them at the commissary at inflated prices, using their sweatshop-level wages. Each prisoner was entitled to an annual gynecological exam. The other inmates darkly warned Piper not to take the prison up on this offer. In fact, every woman she knew at Danbury had refused the exam. Piper decided to buck the trend, reasoning that her health should come before everything else. She soon found out why everyone else had turned down the exam.

When she reported to the camp hospital, she saw, to her horror, that her gynecologist was an octogenarian white _man._ He coldly ordered Piper to get onto the examination table and put her feet in stirrups. He then proceeded to probe and prod her in the most painful, clinical fashion. It was an awful experience, one that left her feeling more alone and vulnerable than ever.
