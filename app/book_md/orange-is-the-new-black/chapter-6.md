## Chapter 6: The Final Stretch

**Now a seasoned prisoner, Piper acknowledged to herself that she had been indifferent to suffering before coming to prison—but that a transformation had taken place within her.** She was, in fact, a good person, capable of compassion and empathy and able to provide real comfort and help to those in need. Piper found that she was now experienced enough to serve as a comforting and nurturing figure to new inmates (just as people like Pop and Rosemarie had been to _her_).

Just like Pop, Piper herself could dispense tough love when she needed to, as when she warned a young inmate named Camila not to lose her temper with the guards; but, also like Pop, she could also be soothing and maternal when the situation demanded, on one occasion cradling a girl named Amy while the distraught young lady cried for her father. The other women at Danbury, Piper saw, had taught her to be better and more compassionate. She hoped that her grandmother would be proud of her for that.

Unfortunately, the thing Piper most feared eventually came to pass when her grandmother finally died on the day after Thanksgiving. It was a devastating loss, especially not having the opportunity to properly say goodbye, but she was able to mourn with the new community of women she found at Danbury.

### Failures of Pre-Release

As November turned to December, Piper began to eagerly anticipate her March release. She was in the final stretch of her sentence, tantalizingly close to closing this chapter in her life. Piper was not the only one whose thoughts were drifting to life after Danbury. Pop and Natalie were also slated for release, when they would be living together at a halfway house on Brooklyn’s Myrtle Avenue (known as “Murder Avenue” by Danbury’s Brooklynites). When she got out, Piper would likely be headed to the same halfway house.

**Her impending release made it clear to Piper just how woefully inadequate the prison system’s pre-release programming was**. It was meant to help inmates adjust to life on the outside, but these pre-release programs offered no information about how to access health and reproductive care services (obviously a priority for destitute women), find a job, secure housing, get drug treatment, and regain custody of their children. These were urgent needs for all of these women and they were entirely unaddressed by the pre-release program.

**The system, through negligence, indifference, and incompetence, set ex-convicts (especially women) up to fail.** Lacking the skills needed to thrive in the mainstream economy (or even access it in the first place) many would simply drift back into the illegal economy, which would land them right back in prison. The system was not only cruel, it was stupid and inefficient—prisoners reentering prison wasted taxpayer resources, when a more rehabilitative approach would have been more fiscally prudent in the long term.

Piper’s friend Pom-Pom, for example, would be released back into a dangerous ghetto and be forced to fend for herself with no job prospects. Her choices would be to either hit the streets, check into a homeless shelter, or fall back into a life of crime. In that kind of situation, dealing drugs or engaging in theft was probably the best option for survival.

### Christmas at Danbury

In the second week of December, Piper’s lawyer contacted her to tell her that her time in Danbury might be coming to an end very soon, but _not_ because she was getting early release—there was a good chance, he warned her, that she would be transported to Chicago to testify against an old drug ring associate named Jonathan Bibby. Piper had never met Bibby and didn’t remember him, but her lawyer said this made no difference. Part of Piper’s plea agreement stipulated that she would serve as a government witness if asked to do so. Now, she was going to be called upon to hold up her end of the bargain. Pop darkly warned Piper about what it would be like to be air transported on a BOP plane, telling her, “Oh baby, the airlift is nothing nice.”

Piper had heard the horror stories from other women who’d flown courtesy of BOP. Some women she knew told her that they’d been sent to gruesome local prisons (especially in the South) while waiting to appear as witnesses in federal trials, where conditions were far worse than anything at Danbury. In her last phone call with Larry before packing out, Piper was careful not to discuss any specific details about the journey, knowing that the feds were listening—and might think she was planning an escape if she revealed too much.

On Christmas Day, Piper learned that she would definitely be transported to Chicago in the new year to participate in Bibby’s trial. This was dreadful news—she did not know how long this would take, if she would ever be returned to Danbury before her ultimate release, and **if she would ever get to enjoy a proper goodbye party with her friends and “family” at Danbury.** This knowledge put a damper on her holiday, though she still enjoyed seeing how the inmates transformed the drab TV room into a stunning Christmas village using nothing more than homemade decorations. Even in prison, these women found ways to create beauty.

On December 27, Larry published a piece in the _New York Times_ ’ “Modern Love” column. This piece was about his relationship with Piper, their life together, and his thoughts on their engagement and impending wedding. He talked about marrying Piper as an act of sweet and wonderful euthanasia, putting him out of the misery of his singlehood and his life before he knew her. For Piper, it was the sweetest gift of all.

### Packing Out

On January 3, the guards told Piper to pack out—she was leaving Danbury. She put her few possessions in a duffel bag and made her way to the transport bus. On her way out of Danbury, she received advice and warnings from the other inmates about how to handle the grueling journey she was about to undertake.

One woman told Piper to wear a sanitary pad inside her underwear, because she might not be able to urinate for hours on end. They also advised Piper to eat whatever was offered, because they didn’t know how long it would be until she would have the chance to eat again. **Perhaps the grimmest piece of advice Piper got was to smile at the guards escorting her onto the plane so they wouldn’t cuff her too tightly and kill her circulation.**

As she boarded the transport bus that would take her to the plane, Piper had only her duffel bag and a piece of paper, on which she wrote the names and contact information of everyone she knew both inside and outside of prison. She was afraid of getting “lost” in the sloppy prison bureaucracy and wanted to make sure she would be able to contact the outside world to make sure her lawyer, friends, and family knew her whereabouts.

**Surrounding the plane were US Marshals with automatic weapons—an intimidating sight for all the women being packed onto the aircraft toward an unknown fate**. Piper boarded the plane in the company of her friend Jae and Jae’s cousin, who went by the name Slice. Jae and Slice were also being transported to give testimony in the trial of a co-defendant. When she got onto the plane, Piper had to help her seatmate into her seat and later feed her during the flight, as the woman was totally shackled and immobilized. There were many co-defendants traveling on the plane together, even members of the same family like Jae and Slice.

To her shock, the plane was also filled with male convicts. Although the marshals admonished the male prisoners and forbade them from looking at or speaking to the women, it was no use. **The male convicts made lewd and menacing catcalls as the women boarded the plane, with several of them addressing Piper directly as “Blondie.** ” Piper didn’t like COs or the militarized security procedures that treated every prisoner as if they were a dangerous killer, but she made an exception in this case—she was _very_ glad to see the shackles on these men.

### Oklahoma City

After picking up several new prisoners at stops along its journey west, Piper’s plane finally landed in Oklahoma City. Piper was ushered immediately from the plane into the Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City. The prison seemed to be located right at the edge of the airport, because Piper never saw any of the outside world in her quick trip from the plane to the facility.

She learned that this was a temporary holding facility that held prisoners either awaiting trial or waiting to testify in someone _else’s_ trial. _**_ No one stayed long in Oklahoma City, but this would be Piper’s home until her time came to testify against Bibby in Chicago. Upon arrival, she was issued a meager breakfast consisting of cereal, a bag of milk, and some coffee. She and Jae worried that they would starve if they were forced to live on such a diet.

Unlike the open dormitory plan at Danbury, the inmates at Oklahoma City lived in cells, complete with bars and locks. Although she’d had bunkmates in Danbury, this was the first time since her self-surrender that she had a _cellmate_. Conditions in Danbury had obviously been awful and unlike anything Piper had ever experienced before. But she had a community of women there that she loved and that loved her back. It was what had sustained her for nearly a year.

**Now, in Oklahoma City, she was deprived of all that. She was alone all over again and completely isolated.** The phones didn’t work, and there were no televisions, radios, or even newspapers. Piper lacked almost all contact with the outside world. She had no job in Oklahoma City, no way to pass the days. Life was dull and monotonous—the lack of windows made it difficult to even tell the passage of time. Days melted into one another. How long would she be here? When would she be whisked out of Oklahoma City onto a transport to her next prison, as had many of the women with whom she'd arrived? Piper began to feel as if she was adrift, lost in Neverland, not knowing when she’d get back to the real world and her real life.

### A Reunion

**One day, Piper saw a familiar figure emerge from a cell and take her place on the breakfast line. Piper was floored—it was Nora Jansen,** the woman who’d sent her to prison. The woman who had entirely derailed her life. The woman who was responsible for the last six agonizing years. The woman who had robbed her of her chance to say goodbye to her grandmother. Now she was before her in the flesh.

Piper told Jae who Nora was when they sat for breakfast, openly fantasizing about taking violent revenge. Thankfully, Jae was the voice of wisdom and restraint that Piper desperately needed to hear at this time. Piper was mere months away from getting out of prison, Jae explained. It would be colossally stupid and self-destructive to make a move on Nora, maybe get some temporary satisfaction, only to then be sent to the SHU and possibly run the risk of getting an assault charge on top of it all. Of course, Piper knew that Jae was right. **It was Piper’s _own_ self-destructive tendencies that had drawn her to Nora in the first place all those years ago**. Her relationship with Nora had already cost Piper so much— _nothing_ was worth adding to it.

After lunch, Nora attempted to say hello, but Piper coolly rebuffed her former lover’s outreach. She wanted as little as possible to do with Nora. For the rest of her time in Oklahoma City, Piper did as much as possible to keep herself from the Jansen sisters, maintaining an icy distance and refusing to even acknowledge their presence.

### Sweet Home Chicago

In mid-January, Piper was told once more to pack out and board a plane to Chicago. She was joined on the flight by Nora and her sister, Hester. The marshals even made Piper sit next to Nora on the long flight to Chicago. Following some advice she’d received in Oklahoma City, Piper stored Vaseline under her ears and used it to periodically dab her lips to keep them from cracking during the long flight without access to water.

When they landed, the three women were transported by van to the Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago. It was surreal for Piper to be travelling through the bustling metropolis that she knew well, but to be viewing it from the inside of a prison van. More surreal experiences were to come.

Piper, Hester, and Nora were assigned to the psych ward at Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC), Chicago. There, dazed and zombie-like women (under heavy medication) wandered the halls staring blankly at television screens. It had the atmosphere of some sort of demented nursery school. Piper began to experience a thaw in her attitude toward her former girlfriend. They were no longer enemies with a tumultuous history. Now, they were fellow travelers on this bizarre journey together. In a chaotic and weird place like the psych ward of MCC Chicago, Nora Jansen represented a small piece of normalcy. And Piper soon found that Nora was her old funny, charming, scheming self.

**All of Piper’s hard-earned knowledge about prison life proved to be useless in Chicago.** It was a different environment than what she’d known in Danbury (or even Oklahoma City), one that operated by a different set of rules. Even the more unsavory aspects of the social hierarchy at Danbury, like the racial tribalism, were unreliable guides in Chicago. The cracks in the BOP hierarchy were apparent there as well—guards seemed to be a minimal presence in the ward, with the inmates largely left to fend for themselves. She had the sinking feeling that no one was really in charge. Piper couldn’t even shop at the commissary because the BOP was either too lazy or too incompetent to process the paperwork to unlock her account from Danbury.

Although there was no SHU to be sent to, an even worse threat loomed over those unfortunate inmates who stepped out of line: being sent to Cook County Jail, about which Piper heard bloodcurdling stories from women who’d been placed there (one woman had been blinded there after another, more violent inmate threw bleach in her eyes). As bad as regular prison was, Chicago taught her a new lesson—it could always get worse.

**In this environment, Nora and Hester (who was now calling herself Anne) were the only people with whom she was capable of forming some sort of friendship**. They formed a trio in Chicago, hanging out together, cooking meals with one another (the sisters were accomplished prison chefs), and generally lamenting the sloppy and unprofessional conditions at the Chicago MCC. This comradeship was a source of comfort for Piper, but she wanted closure from Nora. She wanted Nora to finally admit to her that _she_ had been the one to give her name to the feds.

Nora finally told her side of the story, saying that when she’d been arraigned, the authorities claimed to have _already_ known about Piper. Nora insisted that she’d told them that Piper was just a girlfriend and had no involvement with the drug ring. Piper was conflicted when she heard Nora tell this story. One the one hand, it was entirely plausible. On the other hand, Piper knew Nora to be a cunning and manipulative liar.

In the end, she decided to accept that she would never know the truth and let go of it. Piper had been consumed with rage and bitterness about and toward Nora for the better part of a decade. It had gnawed at her and taken her to places in her mind that she never thought she would go. Now, it was time to make peace and move on.

### The Congress Hotel

One day, Piper was taken out of MCC Chicago to the federal court building in the city. There, she met with her lawyer, who explained to her how her participation in Bibby’s trial would unfold. He also told her that it was unlikely she would ever be returned to Danbury, as the process of transferring her back would simply take too long and she would hit her release date by then.

Larry at last came to visit her in Chicago. She was careful to keep her visit secret from the other women at MCC Chicago—for many of these women, a man coming to visit all the way from New York was a big deal. The last thing Piper wanted was to arouse the jealousy of the other women, either over Larry’s visit or her imminent release. **She was surrounded by people who had little left to lose in life. In such circumstances, arousing jealousy could be a very dangerous thing.** Piper clung to every moment of Larry’s visit, even backing out of the room as she was leaving to be able to look at him as long as possible. She knew she would soon be with him for good, but it still felt an eternity away.

The weeks continued to pass at MCC Chicago in the winter of 2005. One day, Piper and the Jansen sisters were getting some recreation time on the roof of the prison. Their position on the roof afforded them a view of the entire city. Nora pointed out a notable building to Piper. It was the Congress Hotel, where Piper had, a lifetime ago, carried a suitcase of drug money for Nora. Piper had stayed in a luxury suite then. She never thought she would be seeing it again under these circumstances.

### Paranoia

At last, the day came for Piper to testify against Bibby. She and the other witnesses were furious with Bibby for not taking a plea deal as the rest of the co-conspirators had and, thus, forcing them to disrupt their lives (albeit prison lives) to testify at his trial for what seemed like an inevitable “guilty” verdict anyway. The whole thing was incredibly wasteful and selfish as far as Piper and the other witnesses, including Nora, were concerned.

At the trial, Piper spent hours on the stand recounting the scant details she remembered about Bibby and his involvement with the drug ring. But the questions the prosecutor asked her were routine and ordinary. **It was clear that Piper was not the star witness—Nora was**. As everyone expected, Bibby was found guilty after a very short deliberation by the jury. The trial was over and, in theory, there was no reason why Piper couldn’t return to Danbury. But her attorney’s prediction was correct: Piper wouldn’t be leaving Chicago. She would not see her old friends in Danbury, especially as her March 4 release date loomed closer and closer.

She had spent over a year clinging to this date. But as it got closer and closer and she spent her final stretch in disorganized, dysfunctional Chicago, she got paranoid. When she inquired about what preparations were being made for her impending release, the staff at MCC Chicago had no answers. They didn’t even seem to be aware that she _was_ getting out at all.

**Her fear began to mount. What if the BOP had messed up her paperwork? What if whoever was in charge of processing her release never passed that information along to Chicago?** Would she just rot in her cell long past the date when she was supposed to be free? In a madhouse like MCC Chicago, screened by the opaque and inept bureaucracy of the BOP, it was easy for Piper’s mind to wander to frightening places.

### Reflection and Release

Shortly after the Bibby trial, the Jansen sisters were boarded onto a BOP plane and sent off to a new federal facility. Piper would not be joining them this time. They exchanged a quick farewell with Piper, although they did not understand why Piper was not coming on the plane with them. Although there was no love lost between Piper and Nora after everything that had happened between them, it was a bittersweet moment. Piper was wistful at seeing her go—she knew she would probably never see her again.

**With her release just around the corner, Piper took the time to reflect and take stock of her experience and the wild journey she’d been on**. She’d been brought face-to-face with people from backgrounds so different than her own, people with whom she never would have thought she’d have anything in common. Now, she saw how wrong she was. The community of women in prison had saved her. Isolated from everyone and everything she’d loved before, these women—Pop, Yoga Janet, Jae, Pennsatucky, Pom-Pom, Nina, Rosemarie—had made her feel less alone in the world. Their struggle and success in preserving their humanity in the face of a system that sought to crush it was nothing short of heroic. They taught her compassion she never thought herself capable of and revealed strengths she never knew she had.

At last, the day came. On March 4, Piper received her final call to pack out. (She was released two months early for good behavior.) She had no street clothes to wear after she handed in her prison uniform, so she was given some ill-fitting male clothes. The BOP also gave her $28.30 in cash, what they termed (bizarrely) as a “gratuity.” The COs took her down the service elevator of MCC Chicago. And just like that, she was on the streets in Chicago in broad daylight, a free woman once more.

Larry was waiting outside to meet her. She sprinted over to him as fast as she could. Piper’s long ordeal was over at last—**but she would be forever shaped by her experience and the incredible women with whom she’d shared it.**
