## Exercise: Create More Value During Your Next Negotiation

Use Malhotra and Bazerman's tips for identifying and creating value to achieve a better negotiation outcome for both you and your counterpart.

* * *

Think about an upcoming negotiation you have. Describe the parties involved and the context of the negotiation.

Make a list of what you’re interested in getting from the negotiation and rank those items according to how important they are to you.

Based on your current knowledge, write down what you believe your counterpart's interests to be.

Compare the two lists. What are some differences in priorities between you and your counterpart that you could take advantage of when making offers?

Leading up to the negotiation, what are some ways you can gather more information to uncover more of the other side’s interests? For instance, you might meet up beforehand to build trust or plan indirect questions to ask during the negotiation.
