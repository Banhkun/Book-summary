## Chapter 3: Build an Envelope of Trust

If you want a relationship to be successful, you must build a foundation of trust. Obviously trust matters in friendships and marriages, but we sometimes forget its importance in managing employees. Trust means employees can safely make themselves vulnerable because managers have created a protective, nurturing environment. **People can take risks and innovate at work when they know managers and teammates “have their back.”**

Chapter 3 outlines principles that can help to build trust in the workplace.

### Create Psychological Safety

**The principle:** Build trust within your teams so they can do their best work. This type of trust is also known as “psychological safety,” and it often leads to productive task conflict and eliminates relationship conflict. (Task conflict informs us of the best ways to make decisions and get things done. Relationship conflict leads to low morale and poor decision-making. Conflict over tasks is healthy, but conflict over relationships is unhealthy.)

Campbell insisted that high-performing teams don’t consist of people with similar personalities who never disagree about anything; they consist of **team members who feel psychologically safe.** You can create psychological safety within your teams by ensuring that everyone can be fully themselves and take risks without fear of reprisal from other team members.

(Shortform note: Organizational behavior scientist Amy Edmondson coined the phrase “psychological safety” in 1999, describing it as an environment where people can speak out, challenge, and contribute to a group dynamic without fear.)

**Example:** At one point when Campbell was CEO of Intuit, the company was having a rough quarter and wasn't going to make its numbers. Campbell met with the board, who wanted to focus on investing for the future and not worry about the current quarter. Campbell disagreed. He wanted to curtail spending immediately. After much discussion, board member John Doerr of the investment capital firm Kleiner Perkins spoke up, saying, “We should back the CEO.” Even though Doerr didn't agree with Campbell's position, he thought it was important to create a psychologically safe environment in which Campbell could function, knowing his board would support him.

(Shortform note: In 2018, billionaire Doerr authored _Measure What Matters,_ a handbook for setting and achieving big goals. Read our summary of Measure What Matters.)

### Be a World-Class Listener

**The principle:** Listen to people with your full and undivided attention. Campbell believed that teams would be more successful if every team member felt like his or her opinion was thoroughly listened to, especially by the manager or team leader.

Since the 1950s, communications researchers have studied the importance of “active listening,” which means giving the person speaking your complete attention, not checking your phone for texts while they’re talking, not letting your mind wander, not interrupting or reacting, and not thinking about the next thing you’re going to say.

Today we might call this behavior “being present” in conversation with another person. It means a wholehearted attempt to fully grasp the speaker's perspective.

Campbell's style of listening included asking many questions. It's the classic Socratic method used in many college classrooms. **When you listen closely to what someone is saying and ask relevant, probing questions that target the real issue, people feel encouraged to share more information.** They also feel highly valued.

**Supporting research:** Studies on attention show that it’s typical for our minds to wander about half of the time that someone else is speaking. It's easy to get distracted by external interruptions (loud conversations, emails, or Slack notifications) as well as inner distractions (like being in a bad mood or feeling hungry, tired, or uncomfortable). Any of these can impact your ability to be an active, attentive listener.

### Give Tough, Candid Feedback

**The principle:** A strong leader or coach is unafraid to state a harsh truth or an unpopular opinion. Honesty and authenticity are key. To get the most out of your employees, give honest, direct assessments—sometimes even tough critiques—that nudge the receiver forward.

The key, according to former Google employee Kim Scott, author of _Radical Candor_ , is the “tough love” concept. Deliver the blunt truth in such a way that the recipient knows you care. **It might mean cushioning unpleasant words with encouragement and validation to lessen the sting.** For Campbell, who was fond of using four-letter words, it usually meant swearing and hugging at the same time. Somehow the people he worked with found this approach comforting, not offensive (but if you don’t have Campbell’s charisma, you might not want to try it.)

(Shortform note: For more of Scott’s advice on honesty and candid feedback in the workplace, read our summary of Radical Candor.)

Campbell encouraged teams and individuals to see feedback as a way to strengthen and build upon their ideas and processes, not simply as criticism. For negative feedback, prompt timing is critical. **Tough criticism should always be delivered immediately** —don't wait until a performance review that's scheduled for three weeks from now.

**Also, negative feedback should always be delivered in private.** No team member should ever be publicly criticized.

**Supporting research:** Campbell's approach is backed up by what scholars call “relational transparency.” We are often divided in our desire to support people and also demand more of them. But if we stick to providing honest feedback, we can do what good parents do with their children—maintain high standards while simultaneously encouraging them to do better.

**Example:** Campbell was coaching CEO Dan Rosenweig at Chegg during a difficult period in the textbook-rental company's history. Chegg had nearly gone bankrupt and the CEO saved the company by making major cuts. He was thrilled that he'd managed to pull off a miracle. Campbell gave him a big hug of congratulations, then reminded him that this was no time to celebrate—in fact, Rosenweig needed to get back to work. The company needed to grow to survive, so the CEO shouldn't be rejoicing about making cuts.

**Example:** Campbell was a friend and neighbor of Pat Gallagher, who worked for the San Francisco Giants in the years before they became world champions and had their new beautiful playing field in San Francisco's South Beach District. Campbell once told Gallagher that he had to make himself into the world's greatest marketing manager because he worked for a losing team who played at America's worst ballpark. (Harsh words, but true.)

### Don't Tell People What to Do

**The principle:** Guide people toward making their own good decisions. Campbell didn't tell people what the right answer was. Instead, he believed in the instructive power of stories. Instead of doling out his version of the best decision, he would tell anecdotes about events that had happened in his own business career that might help guide them to making the best decision on their own. Often he would simply listen and ask probing questions, then let them come to their own conclusions.

Coaches and leaders can help people discover what they need to do and solve their own problems without telling them directly. **Campbell suggested that managers should stop using controlling language and instead frame their guidance as questions.** Instead of saying, “Here’s what we’re going to do,” say “What do you think?” Instead of saying, “Do it this way instead of that way,” try “How could you do it differently?” Employees feel more engaged when managers reframe the way they communicate to sound less authoritative.

### Insist on Humility, the Key to Improvement

**The principle:** In order for anyone to improve, they need to be humble. The traits that make an employee or executive “coachable” include humility, honesty, perseverance, and a perpetual willingness to learn. Campbell's theory of coaching started with the idea that all people have value, and it’s not based on their title in the company. It's based on who they are and how much they're willing to improve. A coach's job is to increase the value of the person they're coaching, but that requires the “coachee” to be humble, hungry for self-improvement, and always willing to learn. **The “coachee” needs to be self-aware and understand his or her own strengths and limitations.** There's no room for pretending you're more than you are.

**Example:** When Jonathan Rosenberg, a seasoned CEO who had worked with other startups, came to Google's offices for a meeting in 2002, he thought he was coming to accept a job offer. But instead he had to face one final hiring hurdle—he had to meet Campbell—and Rosenberg had no idea who he was. Campbell asked Rosenberg point-blank if he was coachable.

Rosenberg replied, “It depends on the coach.” This infuriated Campbell, who stood up to leave the meeting. Rosenberg started back-pedaling, realizing that maybe he shouldn’t have been so brash. Campbell eventually sat back down and explained that he was only willing to work with people who were humble, curious, and wanted to learn.

### Inject Bravery Into Your Team

**The principle:** It's a leader's job to make his or her team more courageous. People are naturally afraid of taking risks, so effective leaders offer encouragement and push for bolder action. Campbell often said that much of what he did during coaching sessions was **convince people they could do much more than they thought they could.**

Teachers learn early on that their primary role is to believe in their students more than the students believe in themselves. It's the same for managers and the people they manage. This doesn't mean mindless cheerleading—it means setting someone's aspirations high. It means doling out positive messages based on what you know someone is capable of.

### Encourage Diversity and Self-Expression

**The principle:** People are most effective when they can be completely themselves and bring their full identity to work. Campbell was not a tech wizard, and he didn't have a bunch of fancy engineering degrees. He claimed that he “didn't even know how to do HTML.” He earned his reputation by being exactly who he was—an ex-football player and coach with superior people skills and valuable experience running companies (and a habit of swearing a lot and hugging people). He didn't fit the Silicon Valley mold, but it didn’t matter.

**Campbell believed that when you're not being yourself, people know it, and that creates mistrust.** He encouraged people to bring their full, transparent selves to the workplace. And he instructed CEOs and managers to avoid making their employees conform to dominant norms. Unique personalities play a critical role in the workplace. People from different backgrounds and walks of life create valuable diversity, which makes teams more interesting and productive and can deflect the dangerous effects of “groupthink.”

For Campbell, diversity also applied to the sexes. When he helped companies with hiring and team-building, he always made sure the teams were staffed with women as well as men. **The tech industry is notoriously male-dominated, and Campbell believed that having more women in the mix would lead to better decision-making.**

**Example:** Campbell coached David Drummond, Alphabet's head of corporate development and legal affairs, who is Black. Drummond said that being Black in Silicon Valley made him feel uncomfortably self-conscious—he was noticeably different from most everybody else. But Campbell encouraged Drummond to be proud of his identity, to make it his source of motivation and strength rather than diminish it in an attempt to conform. He told Drummond that people would respect him for being who he was, not for trying to be someone else.
