## 1-Page Summary

In _When Helping Hurts_ , Steve Corbett and Brian Fikkert, two experts in finance and poverty alleviation working at the Chalmers Center, a Christian non-profit, explain **how poverty relief efforts can reinforce the recipients’ sense of powerlessness** , especially when administered in a spirit of paternalism. When this happens, it undermines the program’s effectiveness because the sense of powerlessness is an even more fundamental component of poverty than a lack of physical resources.

In this guide, we’ll first discuss the authors’ exposition of the problems with common methods of poverty alleviation. Then we’ll consider the solutions they propose.

Most of Corbett and Fikkert’s observations come from Christian ministries to the poor, and the authors also have a background in evangelical Christianity. The book’s original target audience was North American Christians, and especially church leaders who might be involved in planning short-term missions or other programs to help the poor. While we’ve preserved the authors’ advice to church leaders in this guide, we’ll also explore the implications of their advice for people outside of Christianity.

### The Problems With Current Poverty Alleviation Efforts

Corbett and Fikkert identify a number of problems that commonly affect short-term missions and poverty alleviation efforts. Combining a few of the more closely related ones, we can present them as three basic mistakes: providing aid with the wrong mentality, providing the wrong kind of aid, and having the wrong people administer it.

#### Proving Aid With the Wrong Mentality

Corbett and Fikkert assert that thinking of poverty in strictly material terms is problematic because it leads us to provide assistance in ways that actually make the root of the problem worse.

(Shortform note: Other authors have applied the principle that trying to solve a problem before you correctly define its root cause can be counterproductive to a variety of problems other than poverty. For example, in _Principles: Life and Work_ , Ray Dalio discusses the importance of identifying root causes when solving business problems.)

The authors cite extensive studies showing that when poor people are asked what it means to be poor, they tend to define poverty in terms that are more psychological than physical. From this, they deduce that **poverty is fundamentally a mental state of shame and powerlessness** more than a physical lack of money or other resources.

There is still a connection between material and psychological poverty: Not having the resources to take care of yourself and your family tends to produce a mental state of shame and powerlessness. And this mental state saps your initiative, which hinders your efforts to earn money or accumulate wealth, creating a vicious cycle.

##### The Root Cause of Poverty

Corbett and Fikkert trace the root cause of poverty even deeper, arguing that **the psychological state of poverty is caused by the broken relationships that resulted from the Fall of Man** , as recorded in the Bible. They argue that when the first humans fell into sin, it damaged their relationships with God, each other, the rest of creation, and even with themselves.

When these relationships were broken, people were no longer able to fulfill their God-given role as masters of God’s creation, managing earth’s resources in a way that would allow them to support themselves, benefit society, and glorify God. Because we fail to live up to the role that we were created for, we experience the psychological state of poverty: feelings of shame and powerlessness.

Corbett and Fikkert note that since everyone suffers the effects of the Fall, everyone is “poor” in a spiritual sense. Nevertheless, they stress that material poverty is particularly difficult to get out of because of the vicious cycle we discussed above.

> **Secular Perspective on the Root Cause of Poverty**
> 
> In _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ , T. Harv Eker similarly argues that the root cause of poverty (and wealth) is psychological rather than physical, but he arrives at this conclusion based on a different line of reasoning and develops it in a secular context. Let’s briefly compare and contrast Eker’s perspective with Corbett and Fikkert’s.
> 
> Eker asserts that material poverty is caused by a mental state of powerlessness and low self-esteem, which leads to poor money management. This mirrors Corbett and Fikkert’s definition of poverty.
> 
> But whereas Corbett and Fikkert trace these feelings of shame and powerlessness back to the fall of Adam and Eve, Eker only traces it back to the childhood of the poor person in question. He says the feelings and beliefs that determine your financial success or failure are conditioned by your upbringing, creating a threshold of wealth that you’re not likely to exceed. He refers to this threshold as your “financial setpoint.” At a subconscious level, you’re not comfortable managing more money than your financial setpoint, leading you to make mistakes that sabotage your efforts to make more money.
> 
> These two perspectives aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive: The bad experiences that might affect a person’s ability to manage money generally involve broken relationships and “fallen” human nature.

##### The Result of the Wrong Mentality

According to Corbett and Fikkert, **when people fail to understand the psychological nature of poverty and its spiritual roots, it makes their poverty alleviation efforts counterproductive**. This is because, if we assume poverty is just a lack of material resources, the obvious solution to poverty seems to be to give poor people more resources. But stepping in and giving people things they can’t get for themselves or doing things for them that they can’t do for themselves highlights and reinforces their sense of powerlessness, actually making their poverty worse.

The authors also warn that all too often, when we take this approach of giving things to people or doing things for them, we do it with an attitude of superiority: We think we can save them from poverty by taking charge of their lives, telling them what to do, and doing it for them when they don’t immediately comply. We may not intend to make them feel inferior, but our sense of superiority comes across in our actions. Again, this tends to reinforce their sense of shame and powerlessness.

> **Giving Without Hurting the Recipient**
> 
> Some people disagree with Corbett and Fikkert’s assertion that giving people money only makes their poverty worse by emphasizing their helplessness.
> 
> In principle, a poor person could also interpret a monetary gift as a vote of confidence, as if the giver were saying, “I know that you’re capable of improving your situation and that you’ll put any resources at your disposal to good use, so I’m giving you enough resources to make a quantum leap forward.”
> 
> Studies have found that, at least in certain countries, poor people who receive cash transfers do use the money efficiently to improve their situation. This could be taken to imply that at least some poor people interpret cash transfers positively in practice.
> 
> So it appears that the key to giving poor people money without hurting them is to figure out who to give it to—to identify which people would benefit from a gift and which might be injured by it. As we’ll discuss later, Corbett and Fikkert emphasize the importance of getting to know the people you want to help. So this fits with their overall approach to poverty alleviation, even though it implies that there may be more opportunities to help the poor with cash donations than they identify.

#### Providing the Wrong Kind of Aid

Even if you understand the psychological nature of poverty, applying the wrong approach to poverty alleviation can still do more harm than good. Before we discuss how the wrong type of aid can do more harm than good, we need to go over the basic types of aid that disaster victims and impoverished people may need.

##### Classifying Types of Aid

According to Corbett and Fikkert, there are three basic types of aid:

  * **Relief** consists of providing immediate assistance to people in a time of crisis, bringing in outside resources to prevent a bad situation from getting worse. 
  * **Rehabilitation** consists of helping people to recover from a crisis. The relief phase begins as soon as the situation stabilizes and concludes when pre-crisis conditions have been restored.
  * **Development** consists of empowering people to improve their situation beyond what it’s been in the past. The authors assert that development should involve a mutually beneficial relationship between the person providing aid and the person receiving it.



For example, imagine your neighbor's house was destroyed by a tornado. Letting him stay in your guest bedroom free of charge for a while is relief. Lending a hand as he rebuilds his house is rehabilitation. Spending time strategizing with him about how you can both be better prepared for the next tornado season is development.

> **Systems of Classifying Aid**
> 
> Corbett and Fikkert are often credited with classifying aid into relief, rehabilitation, and development. While this system of classifying aid is widely used, some organizations, such as the US Agency for International Development (USAID) use different systems with different definitions for similar terms, making it important to know what system you’re using. Under the USAID system:
> 
> **Relief** is the first stage of crisis response and consists of providing food, medical attention, and transitional shelter to disaster victims, as well as helping them salvage what they can and get infrastructure that can readily be restored to working order functioning again. This definition of “relief” is similar to Corbett and Fikkert’s but slightly broader.
> 
> **Development __** is the _second_ stage of crisis response in the USAID system. It consists of restoring and rebuilding infrastructure and homes to the point where they are livable again after the disaster. Since “development,” as defined by USAID, is still part of the process to get back to pre-crisis infrastructure, Corbett and Fikkert would consider this work part of rehabilitation, not development.
> 
> **Institutionalization** is the final stage of the USAID system and involves moving away from direct involvement in reconstruction toward letting the locals finish rebuilding on their own. It may consist of training locals in construction management, providing financial services, or other indirect forms of assistance. Corbett and Fikkert consider some of these training activities part of development in their system, and the emphasis on increased responsibility of the locals for their own success at the institutionalization phase resembles their description of development. But in USAID’s system, the purpose of institutionalization is still primarily to get the community back to where it was before the crisis, so in Corbett and Fikkert’s system, “institutionalization” would still consist mostly of rehabilitation.

##### The Inappropriate Application of Relief Is Unhelpful

Corbett and Fikkert advise that it’s important to consider which of the three types of aid the community you’re trying to help needs and to provide the right type of aid. They observe that **many churches default to providing relief, but most poor people need development, not relief**.

At any given time, only a small percentage of the poor people in the world need immediate relief: victims of recent natural disasters, for example. Even in the case of a natural disaster, the authors observe that by the time a church has heard about the disaster on the news, planned a charitable mission to help the victims, raised funding to support the mission, and sent a missionary team to the affected area, the need for relief is typically over. By that time the victims need rehabilitation or development.

As we discussed above, giving things to poor people or doing things for them can make their psychological poverty worse, but giving people things to meet their immediate needs is an integral component of relief. As such, the authors emphasize that **you should provide relief sparingly and only as an immediate response to a real crisis**.

> **The Rising Need for Relief**
> 
> Some sources might contest Corbett and Fikkert’s assertion that efforts to help the poor need to shift away from relief toward rehabilitation and development on the grounds that the increasing frequency of natural disasters is increasing the demand for relief.
> 
> This perspective exists in both secular and Christian circles, although secular sources generally attribute the increasing frequency of natural disasters to human-caused climate change, while Christian sources often attribute it to the impending end of the world, as Christ prophesied in Matthew 24:3-8.
> 
> However, the increased need for relief doesn’t lessen the importance of providing the right kind of aid in any given situation, nor does it reduce the global demand for rehabilitation and development.

#### The Wrong People Provide the Aid

Even if you understand the nature of poverty and correctly identify the type of aid that a person or group needs, Corbett and Fikkert argue that, depending on the situation, **you may not be the right person to provide that aid.**

By way of illustration, imagine that your friend is suffering from appendicitis. He needs an appendectomy. Should you try to remove his appendix? Unless you’re a trained surgeon with suitable facilities available for performing an operation, probably not. It would be much better to let a doctor who has the right training and equipment perform the appendectomy.

Similarly, Corbett and Fikkert argue that **the best people and organizations to provide aid are usually the ones closest (both geographically and culturally) to the people who are in need.** Local churches (or other organizations) in poor communities are in a much better position to engage members of their own community effectively because they have a better understanding of their situation. And they’re better able to help them improve their situation over the long term because their close proximity makes it easier to maintain long-term relationships.

> **Business Perspective on the Wrong People for the Job**
> 
> We can draw additional insight on the issue of selecting the right person for a task—in this case, poverty alleviation—from other authors who discuss the same problem in the context of business management. For example, in _Traction_ , business consultant Gino Wickman advises that for your company to be successful, you have to have the right people in the right positions.
> 
> On the one hand, someone who wholeheartedly embraces your company’s mission but doesn’t have the right technical or interpersonal skills to do a certain job can’t thrive in that position and may end up causing problems for the company. You need to move this person into a position that matches her skill set, if there is one, or let her go if there isn’t.
> 
> On the other hand, Wickman says someone who has the right technical skills to function in a certain position but doesn’t share your company’s culture and vision will also do more harm than good for the company. You need to let this person go before he stirs up dissension within the company.
> 
> Based on Corbett and Fikkert’s discussion of problems with aid and missions work, we can apply Wickman’s advice to poverty alleviation as well: Someone who doesn't have the right mindset (for example, someone who suffers from a superiority complex or just wants to make a show of helping the poor for the sake of building his own reputation) isn’t ready to take part in the ministry at all. Someone who has a genuine desire to help but isn’t qualified for front-line ministry because of cultural or logistical barriers may still be able to play a supporting role, as we’ll discuss later.

### The Solution to Providing Better Poverty Alleviation

Now that you understand how traditional methods of helping the poor like giving them things or building infrastructure for them can end up doing more harm than good, what _can_ you do to help? We’ve condensed Corbett and Fikkert’s advice down to a three-step solution.

#### Step 1: Cultivate Humility

The first step is to adopt a mindset that will enable you to plan and execute effective aid. **Recognizing that we all share the same basic spiritual problem that, for some people, results in material poverty can help us repent of any feelings of superiority**. It also makes it easier to relate to poor people, which we’ll discuss more in Step 3.

Furthermore, we need to accept the solution to spiritual poverty ourselves before we can help others solve their problems with poverty, whether spiritual, material, or both. Given their assessment of the root cause of poverty, Corbett and Fikkert assert that Christ provides us with the solution to spiritual poverty by restoring our relationship with God when we accept Christianity.

> **Controversy and Original Sin**
> 
> In a secular context, the idea that the first step to poverty alleviation is accepting Christ’s atonement ourselves (so that we can then teach it to the poor) is one of Corbett and Fikkert’s most controversial assertions. Some even make the opposite claim, asserting that a Christian worldview may perpetuate poverty by helping poor people find meaning in their suffering rather than seeking material solutions to their problems.
> 
> But in the context of Corbett and Fikkert’s Christian background, their assertion makes sense, because it is simply a specific application of the Christian doctrine that human suffering (including poverty) is ultimately the result of sin (either the particular sins of the person who suffers, or the sins of someone else who may be causing him to suffer, or just the original sin of Adam and Eve that made human suffering possible).
> 
> In Christian theology, sin is the problem and the ultimate cause of all other problems. Christ’s atonement—his ability to forgive sins because he voluntarily suffered the penalty for everyone’s sins—is the solution to the problem of sin, and thus, ultimately the solution to all problems.

#### Step 2: Collaborate With Those Who Can Provide the Best Aid

Corbett and Fikkert point out that humility enables you to more objectively assess what role you (or your church) should play in helping the poor. Particularly when it comes to alleviating poverty in faraway places, indigenous organizations are usually in a better position to have a lasting positive impact. So, **rather than running the show yourself, connect with local churches or other organizations that are already ministering to the poor** in their own communities.

Start a dialogue with them to learn more about the situation and determine how you can best support their efforts. The authors discuss a number of possible ways to help, such as**providing or subsidizing training for indigenous missionaries and ministers, or donating funds to facilitate their work**.

(Shortform note: To help quantify the effectiveness of collaborating with members of the indigenous church, it’s worth considering the case of Wycliffe Bible Translators, a non-profit that facilitates Bible translations into local languages around the world. In the 2010s, Wycliffe transitioned from having a missionary first learn a language and then translate the Bible into it to hosting workshops to help native speakers translate the Bible into their own languages, typically from regional trade languages that already had Bible translations. This new approach allowed for better quality translations to be completed in about a tenth of the time.)

In the case of donations, the authors caution that you generally shouldn’t pay the _whole_ cost of anything (such as a training program or a minister’s salary). That could create dependency or even undermine their credibility in the local community by implying that they can’t do anything without foreign aid. Instead, Corbett and Fikkert recommend letting the locals pay whatever portion of the costs they can and donating just enough to make up the difference, enabling them to do _more_ than they could with only their own resources.

That said, the authors also warn you not to be stingy with donations. They observe that efforts to economize on aid by standardizing the approach have generally proved counterproductive. **Each impoverished individual and community faces unique challenges and requires a unique solution.** Finding that solution hinges on developing long-term relationships with the individuals in question, which in turn drives up the cost of the project by increasing the time and attention that the aid workers must invest in it. But the greater investment is worth it because it produces a better outcome.

> **What Business Startups Can Teach Us About Funding Ministries**
> 
> In _Crossing the Chasm_ , business consultant Geoffrey Moore offers advice for start-up companies making the transition from the small early market to the mainstream market. While Moore doesn’t discuss poverty or philanthropy, his advice on business finance runs sufficiently parallel to Corbett and Fikkert’s advice on financing poverty alleviation efforts to provide a corroborating perspective and some additional insight on the issue.
> 
> Moore explains that in the early market, most startup companies are dependent on venture capital for their daily operations. At this stage, profits serve mostly to reassure the company’s financial backers that they’re making a good investment. But Moore advises start-ups to become self-sustaining on profits as early as possible, warning that running too long on venture capital can create a “welfare mentality” within the company. This mentality can cause the startup to stall by decreasing workers’ sense of focus and urgency.
> 
> By the same token, Corbett and Fikkert would likely agree that providing limited resources to a poverty alleviation ministry may actually increase its chances of success, because it forces those involved to focus on what’s most important.
> 
> At the same time, Moore also echoes Corbett and Fikkert’s praise of custom solutions and elaborates on it in a business context. He explains that mainstream customers usually prefer to buy from the companies with the largest market share, making it hard for start-ups to break into the market. But if you identify a specific niche application and design your product to solve that particular niche customer’s problems in a way that no generic product can, then this allows you to gain a foothold in the market and establish your credibility.
> 
> If we generalize Moore’s approach, this principle could apply to poverty alleviation as well: If you try to come up with a standard solution that solves everybody’s problems, you’ll probably end up with a product, service, or program that doesn’t really solve anybody’s problems. But if you focus on one specific scenario, you (or the people you’re backing) are more likely to come up with a compelling solution.
> 
> So, combining these two principles, we infer that there’s an optimal level of funding for any project: enough to develop a complete and compelling solution to the problem in question but also little enough to keep the solution narrowly focused.

##### Promote Microfinance

Corbett and Fikkert point out that **poor people often benefit from programs that enable them to accumulate savings or allow them to borrow money** that they can use to improve their situation.

Again, these programs are usually best administered at the local level. The local church can directly establish a savings and credit association—a group of people who pool their savings, make small loans to each other, and collect interest on the loans, which helps build their savings. Or the local church may, in turn, collaborate with a microfinance company—basically a bank that’s willing to handle smaller loans than traditional financial institutions.

Corbett and Fikkert note that if the indigenous ministry isn’t already using savings and loan programs, you can bring these options to their attention or even provide training on how they work. Depending on the situation, it may or may not be appropriate to donate additional capital to the savings association or microfinance company. One case the authors endorse is donating funds to the microfinance company to cover the cost of teaching their loan recipients about the Christian perspective on managing money.

> **Criticism of Microfinance**
> 
> Some sources argue that microfinance institutions are actually not as effective at helping the poor as Corbett and Fikkert suggest. In _Poor Economics_ , Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo discuss a number of factors that limit the usefulness of microfinance loans.
> 
> For one thing, they note that microfinance companies typically prefer to make a loan to a group of people rather than to an individual. Relative to making individual loans, this reduces administrative costs (because there are fewer loans to track). Moreover, it reduces the risk of non-payment, both because other people in the group must make up the difference if one person fails to repay his share of the loan and because this possibility motivates the members of the group to verify each other’s integrity before taking out the loan. However, **shifting more of the liability and credit verification to the loan recipients also makes loans less attractive to poor people**.
> 
> Both Corbett and Fikkert and Banerjee and Duflo also note that microfinance companies were created to provide poor people with a more helpful alternative to predatory lenders (lenders that charge exorbitant interest rates to cover the risk of loaning money to people with no credit). But some sources report that in recent years the distinction between predatory lenders and microfinance institutions has become blurred, **leading poor people to borrow money at high interest rates and become trapped in debt**.

#### Step 3: Connect With the People You Want to Help

In some cases, you may not need to go beyond Step 2, but what if you find that there _isn’t_ another church or organization that’s positioned better than yours to assist a particular impoverished community? Corbett and Fikkert point out that there are unmet needs and opportunities to make a difference in poor neighborhoods throughout the United States. **If your church _is_ the local church, you may very well be the best people to help the poor in your own community.**

As we’ve discussed, Corbett and Fikkert emphasize the importance of getting to know the people you are trying to help through your program. This is because to help them find effective solutions to their problems, you need to understand their unique situation. However, they don’t recommend asking people to discuss their problems up front, because focusing too much attention on their problems may only make them worse by amplifying their sense of shame.

Instead, the authors **recommend** **starting off any relationship with a poor person by asking him about his strengths, skills, or other unique assets.** You need this information because the most effective solution to his problems will involve leveraging his strengths. But more importantly, asking him to list his strengths reminds him that he _has_ valuable qualities, helping him regain a measure of dignity and confidence. This in itself begins to alleviate his psychological poverty, and it starts the relationship off on a positive note. You can discuss his problems later, after you’ve gotten to know him and gained his trust.

> **Why You Should Help the Poor Develop Their Strengths**
> 
> Just as Corbett and Fikkert recommend focusing on poor people’s assets when you’re trying to help them, in _Strengths Finder 2.0_ , Tom Rath argues that the best way to advance your career is to focus on cultivating your strengths, rather than on fixing your weaknesses. Since poor people generally need career development, Rath’s discussion provides some additional insight on how understanding a person’s strengths could allow you to coach her through career advancement.
> 
> For one thing, Rath asserts that it’s just not possible to fix all your weaknesses. No matter how much time and energy you devote to self-improvement, you’ll always have weaknesses, so you might as well accept that. Moreover, even if you spend a lot of time and energy improving your abilities in an area of weakness, chances are you’ll still only end up with average ability in that area. But if you spend the same amount of time and energy honing an ability that comes naturally to you, you’ll end up far above average. Exceptional ability in certain areas is more useful for advancing your career than average ability across the board. For a poor person, career advancement is especially important because it's empowering, both psychologically and materially.
> 
> Rath also points out that many human traits are not intrinsically either strengths or weaknesses, but rather can be perceived as either one, depending on the context. So trying to eliminate a trait that’s a weakness in one context may only hold you back from excelling in a context where it’s a strength. For example, maybe you’re a perfectionist. At a job where you need to finish tasks quickly, and there’s a generous margin for error, perfectionism is a weakness. But at a job that’s slower-paced and requires careful attention to detail, perfectionism is a strength.
> 
> In the case of poverty alleviation, this underscores the importance of getting to know the people you’re trying to help and understanding their unique abilities, so you can help them find jobs where their abilities will be strengths rather than weaknesses.

##### Organize a Support Network

Corbett and Fikkert also offer some advice on the organizational structure of your poverty intervention program. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. The optimal program might involve meeting with poor people one-on-one, meeting in groups, holding classes, or some combination thereof. The classes you offer could teach them biblical principles for teamwork, problem-solving, money management, work ethic, or other “soft skills” that could help them find jobs, mend relationships, or otherwise improve their situation.

The authors do advise that **each poor person should have contact with at least two and preferably about five different aid workers.** This has several advantages: It spreads out the workload over more aid workers, helping to keep individual workloads manageable and preventing volunteers from burning out. It also helps to ensure that if the poor person has an urgent concern come up, at least one of the people she knows in the program will be available to talk with her about it. And it lets the poor person network with more people, which is beneficial for finding job opportunities.

(Shortform note: Typically, church members helping with a poverty alleviation program are volunteers, not paid employees of the church. Based on other sources, ideally you should structure your program so that each volunteer’s time commitment is about 100 hours per year.**** In _Give and Take_ , Adam Grant points out that people who volunteer between 100 and 800 hours of their time per year get the most satisfaction from their volunteer work. He also reports that volunteering up to 100 hours per year correlates with a measurable improvement in health, but the improvement plateaus above 100 hours.)

> **Comparing _When Helping Hurts_ to _Development as Freedom_**
> 
> In _Development as Freedom_ , Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen discusses the problem of poverty and possible solutions. Sen approaches poverty—and poverty alleviation—from a more theoretical and systemic perspective, while Corbett and Fikkert focus more on practical advice, specifically for churches looking to help the poor. Yet there are enough parallels in their reasoning that their respective viewpoints reinforce each other to some extent.
> 
> To begin with, Sen defines poverty as a lack of freedom or a lack of opportunity, rather than a lack of material resources. As we discussed earlier, Corbett and Fikkert define poverty as a mental state of shame and powerlessness. These two definitions may have some subtly different implications, but they both equate poverty with powerlessness, which is the antithesis of freedom. Consequently, **their respective solutions focus on finding ways to empower the poor.**
> 
> Sen focuses on empowering the poor by guaranteeing them various rights, including the right to participate in government, the right to engage in commerce, and the right to basic services like education and healthcare.
> 
> Corbett and Fikkert suggest ways that your church can empower local poor individuals: Helping them identify their assets and strengths is psychologically empowering. Offering classes or other training can empower students by teaching them new skills or making them aware of opportunities that they didn’t know about. Letting them network with several volunteers also gives them more opportunities, especially for job placement and career advancement.
