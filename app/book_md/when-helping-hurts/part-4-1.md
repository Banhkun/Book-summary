## Part 4.1: Effective Solutions｜Local Interventions

In Part 3, we discussed how we have to change our approach for our poverty alleviation efforts to be effective. In Part 4, we’ll explore specific strategies to provide aid.

The authors point out that churches are often best equipped to help the poor in their own communities. And while missions to alleviate poverty in developing nations may get more press, there are still poor people and poor communities in North America. So in Part 4.1, we’ll start with a discussion of the poverty intervention programs that North American churches can most readily implement in their own neighborhoods.

But before we address the programs that Corbett and Fikkert say your church can use to help the poor in your local area, we need a clear picture of what poverty looks like in the contemporary United States (the “local” context of Corbett and Fikkert’s original audience).

### Components of Local Poverty

As we discussed earlier, broken relationships give rise to broken systems, and broken systems can trap people in poverty. Corbett and Fikkert identify five broken systems that trap the poor in poverty in the United States.

**Inadequate Employment Opportunities:** The authors observe that job opportunities in the US for people without special skills are limited, and many low-skilled jobs don’t pay enough to live on. They attribute this partially to the shift from manufacturing to a service economy, noting that workers on an assembly line typically earn more than unskilled service workers, such as grocery checkers.

**Lack of Education:** Low quality of public education is often a persistent problem in poorer communities. Perhaps this is because most public schools depend on local tax levies for their funding, and thus schools in poorer communities have less funding. Also, when the quality of education is poor, members of the community tend to place less value on it, and communities that don’t value education aren’t likely to invest in improving it.

**Financial Instability:** Poor people are particularly vulnerable to recessions or other economic instabilities because any financial setback (such as losing a job) can be devastating to people who have no savings to draw from, and it’s challenging for poor people to accumulate savings.

**Lack of Affordable Housing:** Almost half of low-income households in the US spend more than half of their income on housing. This financial burden amplifies their other financial woes.

**Lack of Affordable Healthcare:** The authors also cite the high cost of healthcare in the US as a systemic problem, especially for the poor. They say more than a third of poor people in the US forgo medical treatment that they need because they cannot afford health insurance, nor can they afford to pay for treatment out of pocket.

> **Corroborating Analysis and Additional Factors**
> 
> Most secular sources that seek to characterize poverty in the United States describe the problems facing the American poor similarly to Corbett and Fikkert, although each source adds its share of nuances. For example, one article echoes their perspective on education, omits any explicit discussion of employment, housing, or wealth accumulation, and elaborates on the healthcare problem.
> 
> Specifically, the article adds statistics to the discussion of healthcare that illustrate the consequences of inadequate healthcare, including shorter life expectancy, increased risk of chronic disease, and higher infant mortality rate.
> 
> The article adds two more factors to the list of problems entrapping the poor: malnutrition and crime. Corbett and Fikkert may have overlooked malnutrition because it’s less severe and less visible in the US than in less developed countries. But in many parts of the world, a lack of nutrients leads to health issues, growth issues, and cognitive issues that make it difficult for the poor to escape their circumstances.

### Local Solutions

The solutions that Corbett and Fikkert present for local poverty alleviation focus primarily on helping the poor improve their employment prospects and financial security. This is because, while they affirm that unemployment, education, finance, housing, and healthcare are all significant problems for the American poor, they believe that most churches are better positioned to help in these areas than they are to solve the problems with the educational system, the housing market, or the cost of healthcare.

They outline three specific intervention tactics for your church to consider as you contemplate ways to help the poor in your area: job preparation, financial education, and opportunities for wealth accumulation. Let’s discuss each in turn.

#### Job Preparation

According to Corbett and Fikkert, **one of the most effective interventions churches can offer is job preparedness programs, which serve to address the poor’s lack of education and training**. They advise that an effective job preparedness program has several components:

First, it should train participants in soft skills such as teamwork and problem solving from a biblical viewpoint. Second, it should address important job preparation skills like work ethic, punctuality, and appropriate dress.

Third, there should be a group of mentors who engage with participants one-on-one to encourage them, get to know them, and help them solve problems as they come up. Ideally, your mentoring team should be large enough that each participant can meet alternately with about five different mentors. This spreads out the mentoring workload so that individual mentors are less likely to feel overwhelmed.

(Shortform note: Typically, church members helping with a poverty alleviation program are volunteers, not paid employees of the church. Based on other sources, ideally you should structure your program so that each volunteer’s time commitment is about 100 hours per year.**** In _Give and Take_ , Adam Grant points out that people who volunteer between 100 and 800 hours of their time per year get the most satisfaction from their volunteer work. He also reports that volunteering up to 100 hours per year correlates with a measurable improvement in health, but the improvement plateaus above 100 hours.)

Pairing participants with multiple mentors also allows them to network with more people, which opens up more job opportunities: There’s a greater likelihood that one of a participant’s mentors knows someone who knows of a job opening that’s a good fit for the participant if the participant has several mentors than if he just has one.

Fourth, while your church may not have the resources to teach “hard” (technical) skills like welding or computer programming, you can help the poor pursue further education at vocational schools and community colleges. There they can learn “hard” skills and obtain degrees or certificates that will improve their employment options.

Finally, try to get local businesses to agree to interview everyone who graduates from your job preparedness program. This will improve their chances of job placement.

> **Getting Jobs Versus Getting _Better_ Jobs**
> 
> A 2015 study found that, in America at least, most poor people have jobs. They’re not poor because they’re unemployed, but rather because the jobs they have don’t adequately cover their expenses.
> 
> Prior to that study, poverty alleviation efforts in the United States had focused on reducing unemployment, often through job preparedness programs similar to what Corbett and Fikkert propose. Thus, it’s worth evaluating the authors’ job preparedness program principles to consider whether they’re useful for getting poor people _better_ jobs or just for finding jobs for the unemployed.
> 
> **Teamwork and Problem-Solving:** These skills tend to be increasingly important the more responsibility (and compensation) a job entails. So this will likely still be effective for helping the poor get better jobs.
> 
> **Work Ethic, Punctuality, and Dress:** At a basic level, these are prerequisites for almost any job, so they’re geared more toward just getting a job. However, you might be able to modify this kind of soft-skills curriculum to help workers get better positions, because things like workplace culture and dress code are often different for higher-paying jobs, such as managerial positions, than they are for minimum-wage jobs.
> 
> **Multiple Mentors:** This advice remains important because networking is just as useful for career advancement as it is for getting a job in the first place.
> 
> **Promoting Technical Training:** This might take on proportionately greater importance if the goal is to help the working poor get _better_ jobs because most higher-paying jobs require some kind of specialized knowledge. It might also change the focus of training because some skills and degrees are worth more than others to employers. For example, a radiology technician earns more than a graphic designer.
> 
> **Local Business Involvement:** As originally presented, this seems tailored more to helping people get jobs in the first place. In principle, it might still be effective, but the goal of helping people find better jobs instead of entry-level positions would likely change the types of businesses that you need to network with.

#### Financial Education

Corbett and Fikkert maintain that another effective intervention churches can offer is financial education. **This enables the poor to make the best use of their limited financial resources by helping them develop better financial management skills.** The authors recommend that financial education programs follow several guidelines.

First, programs should cover topics like Christian stewardship, budgeting, saving, debt reduction, taxes, banking, and managing credit, among others. Second, when choosing a curriculum for the program, take into consideration the target population’s needs, education level, and cultural background.

Third, regardless of the specific curriculum, instructors should teach content from a biblical perspective that’s sensitive to the particular culture of the population. Finally, a team of mentors should foster long-term development by building relationships with participants and holding them accountable.

In addition to these guidelines, Corbett and Fikkert say that churches can guide participants in leveraging the US government’s earned-income tax credit (EITC) to mitigate low income, if capable of doing so. They explain that although it’s the largest federal program providing assistance to low-income working families, 15–25% of those who qualify either don’t know it exists or don’t know how to access it.

(Shortform note: More detailed information on the EITC, who qualifies for it, and how to claim it is available from the IRS. Additionally, the IRS advises that people who qualify for the EITC may also qualify for other tax credits, such as the child and dependent care tax credit, the child tax credit, and the education tax credit. These tax credits provide tax relief to lessen the financial burden of raising children and pursuing higher education, respectively.)

> **Comparing Financial Education Curriculums**
> 
> As Corbett and Fikkert mention, there are a variety of financial education curricula available, and different programs are tailored to different circumstances. Let’s briefly examine and compare a few options:
> 
>   1. Dave Ramsey’s “Financial Peace University” is arguably the most popular financial education curriculum used by Christian churches in North America. It focuses more on helping middle-class or “vulnerable non-poor” people get out of debt, improve their financial security, and avoid slipping into poverty in the first place than it does on solutions for the lowest-income families.
> 

>   1. The Chalmers Institute provides training programs focused specifically on helping low-income adults make the best use of their limited financial resources. Corbett and Fikkert are associated with Chalmers and were involved in developing this curriculum. It’s targeted mostly at North Americans, but they also provide separate curricula designed to teach poor people in developing nations how to accumulate savings and manage home and business finances.
> 

>   1. There are also curricula designed to teach financial management skills to children. While the focus of the curriculum is not necessarily on escaping poverty, per se, the earlier in life people learn to handle money wisely, the less likely they are to be poor as adults.
> 


#### Opportunities for Wealth Accumulation

A final way that Corbett and Fikkert suggest churches can address the issues of local poverty is by designing interventions that target wealth accumulation. **The purpose of this type of intervention is to offer the poor a better chance to save and grow their money.** They say that according to a four and half year study, the poor are capable of—and successful at—saving enough to build wealth when given the opportunity.

Corbett and Fikkert say that one proven way to help the poor accumulate wealth is through Individual Development Account (IDA) programs, which help low-income individuals save toward an asset to increase their financial independence. They recommend that churches follow the guidelines of existing models:

First, have a savings-match policy where your church’s IDA matches the monthly savings of participants (which could be anywhere from a 1-1 to 3-1 ratio). These funds would come from the church itself, donations, foundations, and financial institutions that support IDA programs, or in some cases government programs.

Second, have participants save money for a specified purpose, such as continuing their education or acquiring a house or car. Once their goal has been reached, release the funds directly to the vendor to ensure that the participant uses the savings as intended.

Finally, offer financial education alongside the savings program. If possible or applicable, include training related to managing the specific assets that participants are saving for.

> **The Effectiveness of Wealth Accumulation Initiatives**
> 
> In addition to the research mentioned by Corbett and Fikkert, other studies corroborate their claim that the poor are capable of building wealth if given the chance to do so through saving subsidy programs like the authors propose. For example, one 13-year study found that the majority of low-income families not only accumulated assets but grew their net worth over the course of the study.
> 
> Part of the reason that savings programs are particularly effective over the long term is the compounding effect: If you save even a little bit of money each month and put it into an interest-bearing account, your savings will grow exponentially because the more money is in the account, the more interest it accumulates.
> 
> The compounding effect works with monetary savings, but it can also apply to other things. In his book _The Compound Effect_ , Darren Hardy extrapolates it to habits and goals, arguing that continually making small positive changes to your habits will result in exponential growth and large successes.
> 
> This, in turn, provides additional insight into Corbett and Fikkert’s multi-faceted approach to poverty alleviation: As you help poor people make small improvements in their job situation, budgeting skills, and savings, all these changes compound each other, building up to life-changing results.
