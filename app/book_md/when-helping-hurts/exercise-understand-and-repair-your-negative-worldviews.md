## Exercise: Understand and Repair Your Negative Worldviews

Reflect on your views on God, yourself, others, and creation, and consider how negative feelings and opinions about them might limit your potential.

* * *

Reflect on your views on God, yourself, others (family, friends, humans in general), and creation (the planet, with its ecosystems and natural resources). Identify at least two negative feelings you’ve recently had about each of them. (For example, have you been irritated with anyone lately?)

For each instance you wrote down, identify an opinion or perspective you formed as a result of that negative feeling. (For example, if you’ve been irritated with anyone lately, how did that sense of irritation affect your opinion of them as a person?)

Now, consider how those perspectives may have negatively affected your life. (For example, if you’ve been avoiding contact with someone because you have a negative opinion of them, how might that limit your—or their—opportunities for success in any area of life?)

Finally, what could you do to mend each of the relationships you’ve identified?
