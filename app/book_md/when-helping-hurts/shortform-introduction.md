## Shortform Introduction

_When Helping Hurts_ encourages Christians to take an honest look at the way they approach poverty alleviation at home and overseas to determine whether their efforts are causing more harm than good. The authors explain how poverty relief efforts can reinforce the recipients’ sense of powerlessness, especially when administered in a spirit of paternalism. This undermines their effectiveness because the sense of powerlessness is an even more fundamental component of poverty than the lack of material resources. After exploring this problem, the authors recommend ways to improve our poverty alleviation strategies so that we can genuinely help impoverished communities.

### The Book’s Publication

_When Helping Hurts_ was originally published in 2009 by Moody Publishers but was updated in 2014 after the authors became concerned that readers were misinterpreting their message. Specifically, after reading the book, many people concluded it was best _not_ to help the poor for fear of causing harm—the exact opposite of what the authors intended to communicate. Therefore, they revised the first version by making small changes to the original chapters as well as adding a fourth part intended to inspire readers to take action by summarizing the principles, resources, and steps they need to get started. We cover this latest updated version in our guide.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

_When Helping Hurts_ was published following the dramatic growth of short-term mission trips in the 1980s and 1990s. Although they received substantial positive press, they also spurred debate among church leaders and the greater public. Whereas proponents insisted that short-term missions expanded the reach of Christianity and brought much-needed assistance and resources to people in need, critics argued that they undermined the efforts of local communities and pulled the focus away from serious, long-term engagement.

In response to this debate, the authors wrote _When Helping Hurts_ , which both acknowledges the harms of short-term missions and other common poverty alleviation approaches and offers strategies to improve them.

#### Intellectual Context

_When Helping Hurts_ was one of several books on the topic of poverty that were published around the same period. However, _When Helping Hurts_ is unique in that it discusses poverty within the context of Christianity. Instead of separating their faith from the subject matter, the authors see these as intertwined. They emphasize the role of God and the Bible in poverty alleviation and insist that the poor cannot escape poverty without receiving the word of God.

_When Helping Hurts_ also stands apart from its contemporaries by discussing poverty alleviation from a uniquely actionable angle. Before Corbett and Fikkert’s publication, books on poverty tended to discuss the topic from two perspectives. On the one hand, some authors chose to illustrate the experiences of the poor to help the non-poor better understand the severity of the problem. For example, in _The International Bank of Bob: Connecting Our Worlds One $25 Kiva Loan at a Time_ , author Bob Harris describes his travels to impoverished countries to show Americans the difficulties of day-to-day life for poor people across the world.

On the other hand, other authors focused on proposing strategies for alleviating poverty on a big-picture, systemic level. For instance, in _The American Way of Poverty: How the Other Half Still Lives_ , author Sasha Abramsky explores income inequality and suggests ways to create a more equitable system, such as better housing policies, wage protections, and affordable higher education.

Rather than describe the poor’s hardships or propose systemic changes, _When Helping Hurts_ explores the strategies that Christian churches and individuals can use to alleviate poverty at home and abroad. In this way, it differs from the other books by providing action steps that the average person can immediately implement in any context. It also takes a controversial stance by emphasizing the harm that the non-poor have caused in poor communities around the world by trying to help in the wrong ways. This is an issue that hasn’t been discussed at length by other authors.

#### The Book’s Impact

_When Helping Hurts_ created a paradigm shift within the Christian community with regard to poverty alleviation and ministry. This is evidenced not only by the number of copies printed—over 450,000—but also the frequency with which the Christian community has cited the book as a must-read for those looking to serve poor communities at home and around the world.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

Overall, _When Helping Hurts_ was well-received, especially within the Christian community. Positive reviews praise the book’s organization, which they say progresses logically from theory to application. Readers also applaud the book for offering a clear, holistic view of poverty and applicable strategies for alleviating poverty. Moreover, they appreciate that the authors include real-life examples that encourage self-reflection.

Negative reviews primarily criticized the book for its narrow appeal: The authors’ solutions to poverty alleviation are so intertwined with Christian theology that its actionability for non-Christians is limited. Some reviewers also felt that the authors unfairly blame North American Christians for causing and exacerbating global poverty.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Overall, the authors effectively support the main argument of the book, which is that Christians’ efforts to alleviate poverty are well-intentioned but harmful. They not only provide examples detailing the specific strategies that are problematic but also offer recommendations for how to fix them.

In many cases, the ideas that the authors present in _When Helping Hurts_ are clearly developed and backed by credible sources. For example, in Chapter 8, the authors discuss the different factors involved in local poverty in North America and recommend specific strategies for addressing those issues. They include relevant research and examples that serve to both substantiate and explain their recommendations.

However, particularly in the early theoretical chapters, the authors’ logic is not always easy to follow, especially for readers who may not be well-versed in Christian theology. At times, the content of the book is also somewhat redundant.

As an example of both these issues, throughout the book, the authors repeatedly assert that humans’ purpose in life is to glorify God by using the abilities God has given them to support themselves and their families through productive labor. They don’t provide a detailed explanation or defense of this assertion, although they do make reference to a few passages from the Bible and the Westminster Catechism that collectively support it.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

The authors arrange the book’s chapters to progress from theory to practice. Part 1 begins with foundational concepts such as what it means to be poor and what the Bible has to say about poverty. Part 2 progresses to a discussion of the general principles that should underlie all alleviation efforts. Part 3 builds on those principles by detailing specific strategies that churches can use at home and abroad. Finally, Part 4 offers summarizing thoughts to help churches begin applying what they’ve learned.

The benefit of this organization is that it helps readers develop an understanding of important concepts before being introduced to practical strategies based on those fundamental ideas. This ensures they’re more successful when trying to implement them. However, the repetitive nature of the authors’ writing somewhat detracts from the effectiveness of this approach because it makes readers feel as if the book is less organized than it actually is.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Although the book’s organization is logical and effective, we chose to arrange the authors’ ideas differently to eliminate repetition. Ultimately, this resulted in combining parts of different chapters and rearranging the order in which the authors originally presented their ideas.

Whereas the book contains 12 chapters divided among four parts, our guide forgoes chapters entirely and contains parts (with subparts when necessary). In Part 1 we’ll lay a philosophical foundation for our discussion by examining the fundamental nature of poverty. These philosophical underpinnings are drawn mostly from chapter 2 of the book.

Then, in Parts 2 and 3 we’ll cover the problems with current poverty alleviation methods and the things that need to change, respectively. This content comes from the first six chapters of the book. After clarifying the problem in Parts 2 and 3, we’ll present the solution in Part 4, which is based on chapters 7-9 of the book. This guide doesn’t explicitly address chapters 10 through 12 of the book because they served primarily to recap information from earlier chapters.

Since the book was written mainly for Christians, and especially church leaders, we’ll provide additional background from other sources to make Corbett and Fikkert’s ideas accessible to those who may be less familiar with Christian beliefs. We’ll also consider the implications of their advice for a broader audience, including those of other faiths and those with a strictly secular perspective.
