## Part 4.3: Effective Solutions｜Global Interventions

In Part 4.2, we discussed how you can manage STMs to reduce the risk of harming the communities that you’re trying to help. In Part 4.3, we’ll widen the scope and consider Corbett and Fikkert’s discussion of poverty alleviation in developing countries more generally, the pros and cons of different models, and what North American churches can do to support those efforts.

As we alluded to in the previous section, Corbett and Fikkert argue that short-term missions, by themselves, aren’t particularly effective in encouraging long-term development, which is what poor people usually need. They argue that the most impactful—and least harmful—way for North American churches to alleviate poverty outside of their local communities is to **support long-term development efforts by frontline organizations that are already at work**.

They identify microfinance as a particularly effective tool for catalyzing long-term development and helping poor people in developing countries improve their lives and businesses. So we’ll discuss microfinance first and then consider some other ways to support development.

### Microfinance

**Microfinance (MF) consists of very small loans (anywhere from a few cents to a few hundred dollars) made to people who wouldn’t qualify for credit at traditional banks.** As the authors explain, the MF movement originated in 1976, when an economics professor established Grameen Bank in Bangladesh to provide credit to poor people. His motivation for establishing the bank was to create an option for poor people to borrow money without having to turn to predatory lenders or meet the high loan amount requirements of larger financial institutions. Corbett and Fikkert say that as of 2014, the Grameen Bank has lent over $7.4 billion and has nearly 8 million borrowers. In addition, almost 100% of the loans have been paid back in full.

Because of Grameen Bank’s success, organizations have established many microfinance institutions (MFIs) to help poor communities across the world. This means that North American churches have many opportunities to team up with churches and ministries in impoverished communities to provide support on a global scale. Corbett and Fikkert mention a number of models for church involvement in MF, which we’ll discuss in turn.

> **Criticism of Microfinance**
> 
> Some sources argue that microfinance institutions are not as effective at helping the poor as Corbett and Fikkert suggest. In _Poor Economics_ , Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo discuss a number of factors that limit the usefulness of microfinance loans.
> 
> For one thing, they note that microfinance companies typically prefer to make a loan to a group of people rather than to an individual. This reduces administrative costs (because there are fewer loans to track). Moreover, it reduces the risk of non-payment because other people in the group must make up the difference if one person fails to repay his share of the loan. However, this shifts liability for the loan to the recipients, rather than the lender, which makes loans less attractive to poor people.
> 
> Both Corbett and Fikkert and Banerjee and Duflo note that microfinance companies were created to provide poor people with a more helpful alternative to predatory lending services (lenders that charge exorbitant interest rates to cover the risk of loaning money to people with no credit). But some sources report that in recent years the distinction between predatory lenders and microfinance institutions has become blurred, leading poor people to borrow money at high interest rates and become trapped in debt.

#### Provider Model

Corbett and Fikkert explain that **the provider model consists of a church in a developing country establishing and running an MFI on their own**. They caution that this model is rarely successful. One reason for this is that sustaining an MFI requires a large amount of technical, managerial, and financial resources, which churches and other local ministries rarely have.

In addition, because churches are built on values like grace and empathy, they often struggle to enforce loan repayment—especially when the borrower is in a dire situation. For example, it’s hard to penalize a sick, elderly woman who’s struggling to repay a loan.

> **The Case for Church-Run MFIs**
> 
> Despite Corbett and Fikkert’s observations about their low success rate, church-run MFIs might offer a solution to the problem of predatory lending that some sources identify as a growing issue among existing MFIs.
> 
> Furthermore, while the challenges that Corbett and Fikkert identify are significant, they’re not necessarily insurmountable. If a poor church in a developing nation wants to start their own MFI, a wealthy American church could help by providing start-up capital and managerial training.
> 
> And when someone’s struggling to repay a debt, there are ways the church can show compassion without neglecting loan enforcement: Even secular financial institutions will sometimes reduce your monthly payments, give you more time to pay, or reduce your interest rate if you’re struggling to repay a loan.
> 
> Finally, there is statistical evidence that churches can succeed at running MFIs in practice. According to some studies, Christian MFIs have about the same success rate of loan enforcement and repayment as secular MFIs.

#### Promotion Model

With the promotion model, Corbett and Fikkert continue, churches establish a Savings and Credit Association (SCA), where members save and lend each other money from their collected savings. **In contrast to a traditional MFI, which primarily uses donor money to fund loans, SCAs function solely on the money of their members.**

In an SCA, each member agrees to contribute a fixed sum every week. They also participate in a weekly meeting, where they collectively decide how much money to lend and to whom they should lend it. At the end of a fixed period (usually six to 12 months), members receive all of the money they’ve contributed, plus the interest that borrowers paid on their money when it was loaned out.

(Shortform note: In some SCAs, the members agree up front to loan out the association’s money to each member in turn for a specified period of time on a fixed rotation, rather than meeting weekly to decide how much to loan to whom. This is called a “rotating SCA” or ROSCA. Some sources describe ROSCAs as more equitable than traditional SCAs because they’re less susceptible to racial or other bias on the part of the members who decide who to lend money to in a traditional SCA.)

Corbett and Fikkert argue that this model has a variety of benefits. First, SCAs can fulfill a need that traditional MFIs can’t, because traditional MFIs are often unable to make loans smaller than $40 or $50 due to the administrative costs of making a loan. SCAs can also administer loans for any purpose (like funerals or medical bills), whereas most MFIs only make business loans.

(Shortform note: Some sources report that SCAs are particularly useful for helping members improve their housing situation because they don’t require collateral like home loans do, and, as Corbett and Fikkert point out, they can make loans for any reason, including housing needs.)

Although churches can establish SCAs, SCAs are run by the members themselves. This not only takes the burden of lending and collecting money off the churches but also empowers the poor to manage their own money. And the founding church can more easily integrate biblical teachings into the SCA’s weekly meetings than it can into traditional MFIs.

However, Corbett and Fikkert also acknowledge that there are some disadvantages. In particular, poor people sometimes struggle to manage the SCA, including keeping records and enforcing loan repayment. It’s also harder for SCAs to mobilize larger sums of money because their money supply is limited to what the members themselves can contribute.

> **The Hi-Tech Future of SCAs**
> 
> Digital SCAs may soon become the solution to the limitations of traditional SCAs that Corbett and Fikkert discuss while amplifying their existing advantages. A digital SCA would work the same way as a traditional SCA, except that software would facilitate interaction between members and take care of most of the recordkeeping. This would reduce the administrative burden on the members, making the SCA easier to manage. Digital communications could also allow the SCA to span a larger geographical area, increasing the pool of capital that members would be able to access.
> 
> However, digital SCAs are still in the early stages of development, and developers will have to address a number of challenges to realize these advantages in practice. User interfaces will need to be intuitive. The software will need to function reliably, even in areas where internet access may be spotty or unreliable. And if users of digital SCAs don’t necessarily meet all the other members in person, they may have to develop new protocols for vetting new members to ensure that the SCA doesn’t become a target for scams or theft.

#### Partnership Model

According to Corbett and Fikkert, the partnership model consists of a collaboration between MFIs and churches: **The MFI is responsible for offering financial services, while the church supports the poor through services** like counseling, training, emergency assistance, and evangelism. By working together, you can address poverty at both the individual and systemic levels.

The advantage of this type of partnership is that it eliminates the problems of the provider model. In particular, it removes responsibility from the churches to provide technical, managerial, and financial resources, because the existing MFI does that on its own. It also provides an opportunity for churches to integrate evangelism into the MFI, which is usually absent without their involvement.

However, Corbett and Fikkert acknowledge that although this is an effective model in theory, it’s not always easy to carry out in practice. This is because both MFIs and churches sometimes lack a holistic vision—churches sometimes have difficulty expanding their focus beyond people’s spiritual needs, and MFIs tend to function on the belief that money alone can alleviate poverty. If the church and the MFI have difficulty reconciling their perspectives, they may have difficulty working together.

> **Managing a Partnership**
> 
> If your church is considering using the partnership model, some of the principles used in forming and managing business partnerships can provide relevant insight, even though your church isn’t a for-profit business, and the MFI may or may not be.
> 
> For example, in his book _Crossing the Chasm_ , business consultant Geoffrey Moore observes that when two businesses—especially two businesses with relatively different cultures and values—try to coordinate their operations extensively through formal processes, the result is usually detrimental to both companies instead of beneficial. He advises keeping partnerships simple, mutually beneficial, and relatively informal: You produce one product or service, your partner produces a different product or service, and you each make sure your customers are aware of your partner’s products because the products are complementary.
> 
> Similarly, business and marketing consultant Regis McKenna asserts that the two keys to a successful partnership are adequate communication and adequate separation: Both partners need a clear understanding of who is responsible for doing what. And both partners need to retain their autonomy so that they _can_ be responsible for their respective parts.
> 
> From this standpoint, a partnership between a church and an MFI such as Corbett and Fikkert suggest seems viable, because the respective services that they typically provide can be complementary but have very little overlap.

### Business as Mission

In addition to microfinance, Corbett and Fikkert explain that “Business-as-Mission,” or BAM, is another method you can use to support the development of the poor, particularly if you have a background in business administration.

**To practice BAM, you start up a business in an area where development is needed.** This allows you to help the poor people in that area directly by offering them jobs. The business also serves as a means for you to engage the local community as you develop relationships with your employees, which often provides ample opportunities for evangelism.

The authors point out that the advantage of BAM over microfinance is that bringing in outside capital, technology, and expertise usually helps people increase their productivity and income by a greater degree.

But they also caution that BAM has its own risks and limitations. For one thing, BAM typically impacts fewer people because a given business can only hire a certain number of employees. There is also a risk of creating dependency, which is particularly problematic if the business isn’t likely to continue operations after you retire or move on to other ventures.

Furthermore, the authors warn that business management skills acquired in North America don’t necessarily translate into other cultural contexts. As we discussed in earlier chapters, missionaries operating without adequate knowledge and appreciation of the local culture are at risk of doing more harm than good, and missionaries using BAM are no exception.

> **BAM and the Problem of Corruption**
> 
> Other sources corroborate Corbett and Fikkert’s perspective on the risks and opportunities inherent in BAM and add some additional information. They tend to emphasize the importance of creating a profitable, sustainable business to mitigate the risk of dependency and increase the likelihood that your business will continue to operate after you leave. This also makes it possible to continue providing the job opportunities, community engagement, and opportunity for evangelism you created.
> 
> They also discuss the issue of corruption in business and government as both a risk and an opportunity for BAM. Corruption is present in every country to some extent, but it is often a more visible problem in developing nations. It usually takes the form of government officials demanding bribes to issue businesses operating permits or other licenses, or giving preference to companies that bribe them in terms of awarding government contracts. It can also manifest in diverting welfare funding or charitable donations to the pockets of government or corporate officials who oversee these programs.
> 
> Corruption is a problem for BAM because Christian businesses may face setbacks or disadvantages if they refuse to bribe officials, but they cannot afford to compromise their integrity by engaging in bribery. And it’s a problem for poverty alleviation because it diverts money from welfare programs and honest businesses to corrupt officials.
> 
> But BAM also provides an opportunity to benefit society and help the poor by fighting corruption. BAM ventures that maintain their integrity and persevere in spite of the difficulties that corruption causes often become instrumental in social reforms aimed at reducing corruption. In this way, going _against_ local practices, which the authors repeatedly caution you not to do, can be beneficial when those local practices are harmful.

### Other Forms of Support

In addition to BAM and the various models of facilitating microfinance, Corbett and Fikkert suggest a few more ways you or your church can support the development of the poor.

Instead of trying to minister to the poor in a given area directly, the authors recommend that you **provide training to the indigenous missionaries or ministers who are already working with them**. This can expose them to new tools and methods (such as microfinance and asset-based interventions) that may increase the effectiveness of their ministry.

Or, if the indigenous church is capable of organizing training for its ministers, you can just financially subsidize training. Don’t pay _all_ the training expenses because they’ll value the training more if they have to invest their own funds in it, and they may even find the exercise of raising some funds on their own empowering. But donating enough money to make training missionaries readily feasible for the local church in an impoverished area is an effective way you can help.

Finally, another option is to donate funds to MFIs with the stipulation that they use these funds to integrate evangelism and discipleship into their financial development programs.

> **A Specifically Religious Form of Support: Prayer**
> 
> The support that Corbett and Fikkert discuss above—training and subsidization—are supports secular aid organizations would likely also offer. But one form of support that _only_ religious organizations would consider is prayer. For instance, Southern Baptists believe you can also pray for the success of ministers and missionaries involved in poverty alleviation efforts, whether in your own community or in faraway countries. Some sources assert frequent, fervent prayer is actually the most impactful thing you can do to help because it prompts God to create opportunities for the missionaries, gives them courage to deal with difficult situations, and changes circumstances that are beyond their control for their benefit.
