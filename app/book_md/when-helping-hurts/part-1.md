## Part 1: Understanding the Poverty Problem

_When Helping Hurts_ encourages Christians to take an honest look at the way they approach poverty alleviation at home and overseas to determine whether their efforts are causing more harm than good.

Steve Corbett and Brian Fikkert, two experts in finance and poverty alleviation working at Christian non-profit the Chalmers Center, explain how poverty relief efforts can reinforce the recipients’ sense of powerlessness, especially when administered in a spirit of paternalism. When this happens, it undermines the program’s effectiveness because the sense of powerlessness is an even more fundamental component of poverty than lack of physical resources.

After exploring this problem, Corbett and Fikkert discuss ways to improve our poverty alleviation strategies so that we can genuinely help impoverished communities. In this guide, we’ll present their concerns and their proposed solutions, with additional perspectives from other authorities on poverty such as Amartya Sen.

Further, because the book’s original target audience is North American Christians and especially church leaders, we’ll also explore the implications of their advice for people outside of Christianity to some extent.

We’ll spend Part 1 of this guide detailing how Corbett and Fikkert define poverty and the root causes of poverty that they identify, because **misunderstanding the nature of poverty is one of the main reasons for inappropriate poverty alleviation efforts:** Sometimes churches' attempts to help the poor do more harm than good because they’re trying to solve the wrong problem. Corbett and Fikkert point out that you need a clear understanding of the problem of poverty before you can implement an effective solution.

(Shortform note: The principle that it’s counterproductive to try solving a problem before you correctly define its root cause applies to most problems, not just poverty. For example, in _Principles: Life and Work_ , Ray Dalio discusses the importance of identifying root causes when solving business problems.)

### Defining Poverty

Corbett and Fikkert observe it’s not easy to define “poverty” because poverty is a complex issue, as evidenced by the diversity of ways that different people define and describe it. They observe that middle- to upper-class white North American Christians often describe poverty as a lack of material things like water, food, money, medicine, and housing.

(Shortform note: This tendency to define poverty in terms of material goods shouldn’t be surprising, considering that it aligns with most official definitions. For example, Webster’s dictionary defines poverty as a state of “lacking the usual or socially acceptable amount of money,” while the US Census bureau defines poverty as having less than a certain level of household income.)

But **when poor people are asked to describe what poverty is, they tend to focus on psychological problems more than material shortages.** In a survey of 60,000 poor people from 60 different low-income countries, most respondents named feelings such as shame, powerlessness, fear, hopelessness, depression, voicelessness, and isolation as the essence of poverty. Corbett and Fikkert affirm that this is the correct definition of poverty—after all, nobody knows what it means to be poor better than the people who are poor.

(Shortform note: In _Secrets of the Millionaire Mind_ , T. Harv Eker takes this concept even further, arguing that psychological issues are _the cause_ of poverty. He explains that when people think negatively, they reinforce the belief that they’re powerless when it comes to money. This results in the failure to take actions to improve their circumstances. And because the poor often suffer from low self-esteem, they feel unworthy of more money and unconsciously sabotage opportunities to improve their finances.)

### The Root of Poverty

Despite poverty’s complexity, Corbett and Fikkert argue that we can trace all of its components back to one source: a breakdown in a person’s relationships with God, self, others, and the rest of creation.

#### The Four Broken Relationships

According to Corbett and Fikkert, **when Adam and Eve disobeyed God, it damaged all humans’ relationships with Him, themselves, the people around them, and the rest of creation**. As a result of these broken relationships, humans have developed a series of harmful worldviews, which make them poor by causing them to make poor decisions:

**Negative view of God:** Instead of serving and praising God, people may lack faith in Him, not believe in Him, or even believe in other gods. This may lead them to squander resources trying to curry the favor of false gods through offerings or expensive rituals.

And even if it doesn’t, it facilitates other negative worldviews: Without a correct view of God, people can’t readily form correct views of themselves, others, or their role in creation. They can’t understand themselves or each other without knowing God because God made humans in his own image. And they can’t understand their place in managing creation without knowing what role God gave them. As such, Corbett and Fikkert emphasize that teaching the Christian worldview (that is, a correct view of God) is a crucial element of liberating people from poverty.

**Negative view of self:** Instead of recognizing their inherent value and superiority to the rest of creation (for example, animals), they lack self-confidence and self-worth. This contributes to their sense of powerlessness and holds them back from pursuing the opportunities that are available to them.

**Negative view of others:** Instead of knowing, loving, and encouraging others to use their unique gifts, people become self-centered, treating others with hostility or indifference, and exploiting or manipulating them when given the opportunity. This contributes to their poverty by driving others away, making them feel more isolated, and exacerbating their powerlessness because they lack empowering social or professional connections.

**Negative view of creation:** Instead of managing, protecting, and engaging with the rest of creation, people disconnect from the world around them and in some cases believe that life is entirely outside of human control.

> **Background and Controversy on Broken Relationships**
> 
> Corbett and Fikkert’s assertion that poverty results from the four relationships that were broken when Adam and Eve sinned isn’t so much an original idea as a specific application of the Christian doctrine that human suffering (including poverty) is ultimately the result of sin. Christian theology holds that when Adam and Eve sinned, their sin corrupted all of creation, making human suffering and death possible. Adam and Eve’s original sin was also passed down to their offspring as a propensity to commit more sin.
> 
> Consequently, sin can cause suffering in three ways: A person may suffer as a direct consequence of his own sins (for example, poverty caused by bad decisions or expensive idol worship). A person may also suffer as a consequence of someone else’s sin (for example, someone who’s poor because predatory lenders take all his money for exorbitant interest payments). And a person may suffer simply because of the collateral effects of Adam and Eve’s original sin on creation (for example, someone who’s poor because of an illness that prevents him from holding a job).
> 
> In Christian theology, sin is the problem—and the ultimate cause of all other problems—and Christ is the solution, because Christ is able to forgive sin. Thus, in a Christian context, the idea that mending your relationship with God by receiving God’s forgiveness is the first step to solving any problem, including poverty, is relatively intuitive and non-controversial.
> 
> But in a secular context, the idea that teaching people a Christian worldview (or “how to mend their relationship with God”) should be central to poverty alleviation is one of Corbett and Fikkert’s most controversial assertions. Some even make the opposite claim, asserting that a Christian worldview may perpetuate poverty by helping poor people find meaning in their suffering rather than seeking material solutions to their problems.
> 
> Nevertheless, even secular sources tend to agree that the other three relationships Corbett and Fikkert identify _are_ important for overcoming poverty, or succeeding at anything for that matter. For example, in _The Success Principles_ , motivational speaker and self-help author Jack Canfield emphasizes the importance of a positive self-image for achieving your goals, which corroborates Corbett and Fikkert’s concept of mending your relationship with yourself.
> 
> In _Never Eat Alone,_ entrepreneur Keith Ferrazzi emphasizes the importance of building mutually beneficial relationships with other people to succeed in your career. And in _The Compound Effect_ , Darren Hardy emphasizes the importance of taking control of your environment in order to be successful in your endeavors.

##### Broken Relationships Lead to Broken Systems

Furthermore, according to Corbett and Fikkert, **humans’ broken relationships with God, self, each other, and creation result in broken social, political, economic, and religious systems** , since these systems are made up of humans. Broken systems tend to reinforce negative worldviews, creating a vicious cycle. And the poor are the most vulnerable to this vicious cycle because they have the least influence over the systems under which they live.

For example, suppose a homeless man goes to a church looking for help. This particular church doesn’t know much about helping the homeless (a broken religious system), so they refer him to a government program that puts him in run-down public housing in an impoverished, crime-ridden neighborhood (a broken social and political system). From this experience, the homeless man infers that God doesn’t care about him (since the church just sent him to the government) and other people don’t care about him (since the government sent him to live in a hostile neighborhood). These conclusions further damage his views of God and other people.

(Shortform note: While Corbett and Fikkert acknowledge the influence of broken systems, their focus is primarily on poverty alleviation _by churches_ , which don’t typically have much influence over political or economic systems. Other books, such as Amartya Sen’s _Development as Freedom_ , discuss the subject of poverty more from the point of view of systemic reform. Like Corbett and Fikkert, Sen identifies powerlessness as the essence of poverty. He suggests empowering the poor by guaranteeing them various political rights, including the right to participate in government, the right to engage in commerce, and the right to basic services like education and healthcare.)

##### Why Only Some People Are Materially Poor

If broken relationships are at the root of poverty, and everyone has them, why isn’t everyone poor? According to Corbett and Fikkert, **there is a sense in which everyone _is_ poor: The essence of poverty is more psychological than physical.** Someone with a lot of money can still feel isolated, depressed, or hopeless due to broken relationships.

That said, the authors also stress that _material_ poverty is particularly difficult to overcome because, as we noted in the section above, the people with the least resources and influence are the most vulnerable to getting trapped in a vicious cycle: Their negative worldview leads to poor decisions. Their poor decisions have negative consequences, which are often exacerbated by broken systems. And the negative consequences reinforce their negative worldviews.

In some cases, individuals become so deeply trapped in a web of factors like insufficient assets, oppression, vulnerability, powerlessness, and isolation, that each time they try to escape, they end up even more tightly confined. With so much holding them back, they resign themselves to simply staying where they are.

> **Material Poverty Is Material Powerlessness**
> 
> In _Development as Freedom_ , Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen discusses the problem of poverty and possible solutions. Comparing Sen’s definition of poverty to Corbett and Fikkert’s definition provides some additional insight as to why material poverty is particularly difficult to escape from.
> 
> Sen defines poverty as a lack of freedom or a lack of opportunity, not a lack of material resources, per se. As we discussed earlier, Corbett and Fikkert define poverty as a mental state of shame and powerlessness. These two definitions may have some subtly different implications, but they both equate poverty with powerlessness, which is the antithesis of freedom.
> 
> And yet money (or material assets, which have monetary value) is arguably also a form of power: The less money and fewer material assets a person has, the less power she has over her situation, and the easier it is for her to feel powerless. As such, someone who is only _spiritually poor_ by Corbett and Fikkert’s definition may _feel_ ashamed and powerless, but someone who is _materially_ _poor_ is also materially powerless, or at least has fewer options for improving her situation.
> 
> This material powerlessness is both an obstacle in itself, which is what Sen primarily discusses, and a catalyst for the _feeling_ of powerlessness, which is what Corbett and Fikkert’s definition of poverty focuses on.
