## Exercise: Rethink a Past Punishment

Unconditional parenting is about doing away with rewards and punishments completely. Think through how you might do this in practice.

* * *

Think of a punishment you’ve experienced in your life. This can be either a punishment you’ve doled out as a parent or one that you received as a child. Describe what happened. What behavior was being punished? What was the punishment?

Was the punishment effective? Why or why not?

Based on the principles in this book, what might have been an alternative? (For example, could the behavior have been prevented ahead of time by setting limits or controlling the environment? Could it have been dealt with more calmly and wisely in the moment, perhaps using one of the techniques in the last section?)
