## Exercise: Plan Your Collaborative Approach

Plan how you’ll use Greene’s method to collaborate with your child on solving a behavioral problem.

* * *

What are the practical challenges your child struggles with most? Which ones tend to lead to the most outbursts?

Using one of the practical challenges you listed above, make a list of who, what, when, where, and why questions you can ask your child to better understand their perspective. For example, if your child often struggles to do their homework, you might ask when they have an easier time with it or what subject they find most difficult.

Write down your perspective on your child’s practical challenge, focusing on the consequences of them not accomplishing it. For example, when your child doesn’t do their homework, they get detention.
