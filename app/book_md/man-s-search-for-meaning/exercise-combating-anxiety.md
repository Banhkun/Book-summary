## Exercise: Combating Anxiety

Try to break out of hyper-intention or anticipatory anxiety.

* * *

What’s something in your life that’s causing you anxiety? Describe how that anxiety feels--is it hyper-intention (focusing on yourself or something you want to do) or anticipatory anxiety (worrying that something bad will happen in the future)?

If it’s hyper-intention, try looking at the bigger picture--is there a person you care about who’s involved, or a purpose that’s important that connects to the issue? Find something outside yourself or the thing you want that you could focus on. | If it’s anticipatory anxiety, form your own paradoxical intention and write it here.
