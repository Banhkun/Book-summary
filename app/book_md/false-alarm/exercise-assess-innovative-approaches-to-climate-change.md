## Exercise: Assess Innovative Approaches to Climate Change

Lomborg proposes a variety of innovative approaches to climate change: investing in energy storage, nuclear energy, air capture technology, and geoengineering. In this exercise, evaluate these strategies for mitigating climate change.

* * *

Which of Lomborg’s innovative approaches to climate change do you find _most_ promising? Why do you think this approach has potential?

Which of Lomborg’s innovative approaches do you find _least_ promising? Why are you skeptical of this approach?

Imagine that you’re charged with devising a plan to fight climate change. How would you divide investments between innovative approaches (like geoengineering) and adaptive approaches (like building dikes)? If your split isn’t 50-50, why do you think that one approach deserves more funding than the other?
