## Chapters 14-15: How To Choose Stocks, In More Detail

We now have a general understanding of how to think about a company’s long-term prospects, and also how the market prices the company’s stocks. We can now think about how to choose specific stocks. We’ll start with defensive investors, then cover aggressive investors.

### How Defensive Investors Should Choose Stocks

Let’s begin by questioning the premise. Should a defensive investor choose stocks at all? Nowadays, the answer is likely no—**defensive investors might best be served by _not_ choosing individual stocks, instead buying an index fund** representing a broad swath of the stock market. This will provide broad diversification, and your performance will be in line with the overall market.

But if you want to choose your own stocks, **as a defensive investor you should buy only high-quality stocks at reasonable prices**. In practice, defensive investors should look for stocks with these **seven criteria** :

  1. **Size:** More than $100 million in revenue
     * Small companies face more volatility and may be unable to survive bad events.
     * Graham’s criterion was set in 1970, and $100 million in revenue may be too small today. In his commentary, Zweig defines sufficient size as having a market value of at least $2 billion.
  2. **Strong financials:** Assets at least double liabilities, and working capital more than long-term debt
  3. **Dividends:** Paid continuously over the last 20 years, without interruption
  4. **Earnings:** Positive in each of the past 10 years; no unprofitable year
  5. **Earnings growth:** At least 33% total growth in per-share earnings in the past 10 years (a bit less than 3% annually)
     * A company that is shrinking over time will not be a good long-term investment.
     * Use 3-year average earnings at both the beginning and end of the 10-year period.
  6. **Price-to-earnings ratio:** No more than 15 times the average past 3-year earnings
     * Beware of analysts who calculate a “forward P/E ratio” using not historical earnings but “next-year’s earnings.” Predictions are notoriously unreliable, and often the forward P/E ratio is used merely to justify an overpriced stock.
  7. **Price-to-book value ratio:** No more than 150% of book value (also known as net asset value; calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total assets)
     * The last two measures can be combined to form a multiplier no more than 22.5 times. For example, a stock at 10 times earnings can have a price-to-book value ratio of 2.25 or lower.
     * In his commentary, Zweig notes that many companies today have a greater amount of value in intangible assets such as brand value and intellectual property, which don’t show up in book value. Thus, more companies are priced at higher price-to-book ratios.



These seven criteria are stringent and often cut away the majority of stocks. In 1970, Graham found that the 30 stocks on the Dow Jones index met the criteria in _aggregate_ , but as individual stocks only 5 of the 30 stocks passed all the criteria.

(Shortform note: At times, particularly in bull markets, there theoretically could be zero companies in the market that pass all seven criteria. Graham doesn’t comment on what to do in this situation, since in his time there remained plenty of stocks to choose from.)

In his commentary, Zweig cautions that defensive investors should treat stock picking as just an entertaining intellectual pursuit and not their core investment strategy. As a defensive investor, if you really want to pick your own stocks, allocate only 10% of your stock value to individual stocks; 90% should go into an index fund.

### How Aggressive Investors Should Choose Stocks

Unlike defensive investors, aggressive investors who want an above-average return will need to make investments out of line with the overall market. This often means choosing individual securities, using a strategy that is unpopular in the market.

Graham starts with a **reminder that the task is difficult** —most professional money managers who are intelligent and diligent fail to beat the market. But his own investment record shows that opportunities do exist—if you adopt a rigorous method to invest in select bargain securities, and if you are in firm control of your own psychology, you can earn above-average returns. (Shortform note: Review chapter 9 in this summary if you’d like a reminder of these ideas.)

Graham cautions that **new investors should _practice_ investing first before putting their real money at stake**. There are plenty of online virtual portfolios you can use to make fictional trades. This will let you exercise your judgment and make mistakes without losing real money. Then, you can measure your returns against the S&P 500 and decide whether you want to pick stocks with real money.

#### Graham’s Criteria

How should you choose stocks? Like the defensive investor, start with statistical criteria for filtering all the stocks available. However, you can **relax the criteria to include more companies** :

  1. **Size:** No requirement for size. You can limit your risk with small companies by carefully identifying good companies and diversifying.
  2. **Financials:** Assets at least 1.5 times liabilities, and debt less than 110% of net current assets
  3. **Dividends:** Some dividends paid recently
  4. **Earnings:** Last 12 months’ earnings is positive
  5. **Earnings growth:** Last 12 months earnings’ more than earnings from 4 years ago.
  6. **Price-to-earnings ratio:** No more than 9 times earnings from the last 12 months
  7. **Price-to-book value ratio:** No more than 120% of book value.
     * (Shortform note: While all other criteria here are looser than their analogue for defensive investors, this ratio is more restrictive compared than the “no more than 150%” criterion above. This is not explained.)



After applying this filter, you’ll be left with companies that are more likely to be bargains and out of favor with the market, but still with a good position and with possible good long-term prospects.

#### Additional Criteria

From here, how do you choose? This is where a subjective understanding of the company comes into play. There are many roads.

Graham covers one special situation: **Stocks selling below working capital value (net current assets).** This means the market believes the stock is worth well less than what the company would gain if liquidated today. Sometimes this means the company is actually headed for a permanent downturn (and will burn cash to get there), but often it simply means the company has fallen out of favor with the market and will recover soon. (To calculate net current assets, take current assets, deduct current liabilities, and count fixed and other assets as zero).

(Shortform note: In the Chapters 6-7 summary, we covered other opportunities for the aggressive investor, such as unpopular large companies, secondary companies, and acquisition arbitrages.)

In his commentary, Zweig offers other criteria from value investors who are adherents of Benjamin Graham:

  * **Warren Buffett’s criteria:** Buffett likes choosing solid businesses that will continue to grow. Specifically, this often means companies with consumer brand loyalty, business models that are easy to understand, in strong financial positions, and have monopolist positions in their markets. Notably, he’s patient to wait to buy when the stock is undervalued, such as after a scandal or temporary setbacks.
  * **Return on invested capital (ROIC):** This measures how well the company used its money to generate its returns. ROIC is calculated by taking Owner Earnings and dividing by Invested Capital.
    * Owner Earnings = Operating profit, plus (depreciation and amortization of goodwill), minus (federal income tax, cost of stock options, essential capital expenditures, income generated by unsustainable returns on pension funds)
    * Invested Capital = Total assets, plus (past accounting charges that reduced invested capital), minus (cash and short-term investments)
    * An ROIC above 10% is noteworthy. An ROIC above 6% is acceptable if the company is well managed and has a competitive advantage.
  * **Study the value of subsidiaries:** Dice up a company into its subsidiaries or business segments. Then compare the financials of that subsidiary with comparable companies that have been acquired recently. You can then estimate what that subsidiary might be worth to an acquirer, and invest if it’s a bargain.
  * **Assess management:** While Graham thinks assessing management is too unscientific to be reliable, some investors look for certain signs of good management:
    * Their financial statements are easy to understand and don’t obscure the truth.
    * They focus more on managing the business than on messaging expectations of Wall Street.
    * They have sizable investments in the company, ideally by purchasing stock with their own money rather than being awarded stock or options.
    * They have a consistent message about what they will do, and they execute on it.
    * They do not have high executive turnover.
