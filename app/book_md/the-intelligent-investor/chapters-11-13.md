## Chapters 11-13: Security Analysis

If you want to choose individual stocks and bonds, you will need to understand the company’s financial position and future growth prospects. This work is called “security analysis” and it involves diving into the company’s financial statements. It also involves reading between the lines to infer what is really going on behind the numbers.

While no one has a crystal ball and can foresee the future with complete accuracy, certain indicators help you understand whether a company is situated for long-term growth or whether it’s likely to collapse within a few years.

Security analysis tries to answer two basic questions:

  1. **How safe is this bond or stock?**
  2. **What is the value of this stock?**



### Stock Analysis

The chief question when buying stocks is **whether the stock’s current price is too high or too low relative to its underlying value**.

The current price is easy to determine since it’s quoted as market prices on stock tickers. The stock’s underlying value is more difficult, since it involves predicting how the company will perform in the future.

While Graham doesn’t give precise formulas for calculating company value (that’s more complex and out of the scope of this book), he discusses the _general_ factors that determine a company’s value. This should be sufficient for nonprofessional investors to understand what professional analysts are saying.

#### Valuing Companies in General

The traditional way to calculate a company’s value is to estimate its earnings over a range of years in the future, then to multiply that by a “capitalization rate.” The capitalization rate depends on the company’s stability and future performance; the better a company will do, the higher the capitalization rate.

For example, after analysis, you may decide that a company with earnings per share of $5 deserves a capitalization rate of 10, implying a stock value of $50. However, this rate is subjective; another investor may decide it deserves a rate of 20, implying a stock value of $100.

Another measure of stock value that is more common today is price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which is the current stock price divided by the company’s current earnings per share. A stock with a higher P/E multiple implies a faster earnings growth rate than a stock with a lower multiple.

In general, Graham suggests a few major factors that affect the capitalization rate:

  * Future long-term prospects
  * Management
  * Financial strength
  * Dividend record and rate



##### Future Long-term Prospects

How well will the company do in the future? Is it growing or shrinking? Will it be a market leader or a minor player?

Graham doesn’t provide more specifics on evaluating this, but in his commentary Zweig adds a few factors:

  * **Competitive advantage or “moat”:** The company has a strong position that will endure over time. These include strong brand loyalty, monopoly status, or economies of scale. (Shortform note: For more on competitive advantage, see our summary of Understanding Michael Porter.)
  * **Consistent historical growth:** The company should have grown revenues and earnings steadily over the past 10 years. Be skeptical of a company that promises 20% growth without a track record of such growth.
  * **Research and development budget:** A reasonable amount or R&D suggests the company will retain its competitive edge and introduce new product lines instead of becoming obsolete. The average budget is different depending on industry (consumer packaged goods companies may spend 5-10% while technology companies may spend more).
  * **Real growth:** The company doesn’t grow merely on the backs of debt. On their cash flow statement, look out for “cash from financing activities”—this is cash flow from raising money and shouldn’t be confused with real sales growth.
  * **Lack of customer concentration:** A company relying solely on a single customer is in a very precarious position.



Graham also cautions that **it’s easier for smaller companies to grow fast, and it gets harder to grow as the company gets larger**. Thus, a company that started with just $100 million in revenue might have grown 40% each year for the past 3 years, causing market enthusiasm for boundless growth and a high P/E multiple. However, the company might find that once it reaches, say, $250 million in revenue, it starts stagnating, and its early investors that bought in at a high multiple may be disappointed as the stock price drops.

##### Management

How capable is the management team? Will they lead the company to success or ruin?

While financial analysts often include management as an explicit factor, Graham believes management capability is already reflected in the company’s track record and future prospects, so including it again is “double counting” and leads to overvaluations.

However, he notes that sudden changes in management have yet to play out and might thus not show up in the track record. Changes in management can be both positive and negative. For instance, in 1921, Walter Chrysler took over a dying Maxwell Motors and revitalized it into an automobile powerhouse.

In his commentary, Zweig adds a few other warnings signs of bad management:

  * **High executive pay:** Management may be running a company to benefit themselves and not shareholders.
  * **Repricing stock options:** When companies cancel existing stock options (that are often “out of the money” and worthless) to issue more options to employees at better prices, it suggests a lack of responsibility and refusal to accept consequences.
  * **Repeated insider sales:** Management that repeatedly sells big parcels of stock have less incentive alignment with you as a shareholder.
  * **More talk than action:** Management should spend time managing the company privately, not on managing relations with Wall Street and press.
  * **Distorted accounting:** Opaque financial reports may suggest management is hiding something.
  * **Buying back shares at high prices:** This suggests management is propping up stock prices using cash (thus benefiting the value of their own stock prices), when that cash would be better paid as dividends.



##### Financial Strength

A company with a large stockpile of cash and little debt is in a better position than one with little cash and significant debt. If these two companies with the same earnings and the same stock price, the first is clearly a better buy than the second.

**Graham recommends an assets to liabilities ratio of 2:1 or better.**

In his commentary, Zweig adds:

  * On the balance sheet, long-term debt should be under 50% of total capital.
  * Calculate “owner earnings,” or what a 100% owner would take home in cash each year. This is calculated by net income plus amortization and depreciation minus capital expenditures. Owner earnings more sensibly relates company profits than the reported net income, which can be subject to accounting manipulation. (Warren Buffett popularized this metric.)



**Beware of companies that are growing revenue quickly but showing increasing losses and a precarious financial position.**

  * A dotcom company, Exodus Communications, had a market capitalization of $14 billion in 1999, with just $242 million in revenue. Compare this to a “boring” industrial company, Emerson Electric, which had a market capitalization of $25 billion for $14 billion in revenues. While Exodus had grown revenue by nearly 400% that year, it had doubled losses to $130 million and had $2.6 billion in debt. In 2001, Exodus filed for bankruptcy.



##### Dividends

A company with a long history of paying substantial dividends (over the past 20 years or more) is a positive sign for stock quality.

In Graham’s day, it was standard for companies to distribute around 55% of its dividends. However, since then dividend payouts have dropped significantly to 30-40%, because of beliefs that reinvesting in the company was better than paying dividends. We’ll return to dividends when discussing company management in Chapter 19.

#### Formulas for Valuing Growth Stocks

Growth stocks are growing rapidly, and using their historical performance may underestimate the company’s value in the future.

Graham thus proposes the following formula for growth stocks:

> **Company Value = Current Earnings x (8.5 + 2x expected annual growth rate over next 10 years)**

(Shortform note: This simple formula became popular and is now known as the Benjamin Graham formula.)

This formula represents the company’s total market capitalization in dollars. The current earnings is factual and found through the company’s financial statements. The expected annual growth rate is a prediction about the future and thus subjective. (Graham doesn’t give specific guidance on figuring out a company’s growth rate, other than considering the general factors in the last section.)

The formula can also be rearranged to figure out the company’s proper value to earnings ratio (also known as price to earnings ratio, or P/E):

> **Value / Earnings = 8.5 + 2x expected annual growth rate**

For example:

  * A company with an expected annual growth rate of 20% could justify a P/E ratio of 48.5 (8.5 + 2*20).
  * A company with an expected annual growth rate of 10% could justify a P/E ratio of 28.5.
  * A company with an expected annual growth rate of 0% could justify a P/E ratio of 8.5.



The formula can be reordered to figure out what the market believes the company’s growth rate will be, based on its current stock price:

> **Expected annual growth rate = (P/E ratio - 8.5) / 2**

For example, if the market prices a company’s stock at a P/E ratio of 20, it believes the company will grow earnings by 5.75% every year.

These formulas help you determine whether a company’s stock is over- or undervalued.

  * If, through your analysis, you find that a company’s fair value is $500 million, but its current market capitalization is lower at $400 million, the stock may be a bargain.
  * Likewise, if you believe a company’s value is $500 million but its market value is $1 billion, the stock may be highly overpriced and need to achieve incredible growth to earn its valuation.



(Shortform note: Graham doesn’t discuss situations where the company’s earnings are currently negative, as is the case with many public companies today. They likely wouldn’t meet his criterion for safety and would see investing in these companies as too speculative for most investors.)

#### Accounting Shenanigans

While we’ve treated earnings to be a fairly dependable number, in practice **companies may use accounting sleight of hand to make their financials look more promising**.

For instance, a company might present a business expense such as taxes on stock options as an “extraordinary nonrecurring event,” saying that it’s not part of normal business. It then shows “pro forma” earnings that ignore this expense.

Using techniques like this usually isn’t outright illegal; rather, it takes accounting tools that have reasonable intended purposes and stretches them to the edge of plausibility.

Graham and Zweig highlight some common tricks to be aware of:

  * **Timing of losses:** When a company’s project fails, it typically reports a loss on it in the year that it actually takes the loss (such as when it closes down a factory). However, some companies may report a loss early under the guise of “anticipating future losses,” reporting the loss well before it actually happens. 
    * Why would a company do this? To take advantage of investor expectations—if the stock market has had a bad year and investors have already resigned their expectations for the company, it’s a good time to declare possible future losses. In essence, this shifts the loss from future years to the current year, thus making future years’ earnings higher.
  * **“Special”, “extraordinary” or “one-time” items:** These are one-time charges or revenues that the company believes is not indicative of normal operations and won’t recur in future years. Examples of legitimate extraordinary items include a regulatory fine or eliminating debt. However, some companies may improperly report regular business expenses as “one-time charges,” which makes company earnings look better than they really are. A regular pattern of “one-time” items appearing more than one time is a red flag. 
  * **Choice of depreciation:** How a company chooses to depreciate assets will affect its earnings. In particular, if a company changes its choice of depreciation from one year to another, it can cause a short-term change in earnings that doesn’t represent any material differences in the business.
  * **Pro forma financials:** While GAAP accounting (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) is the standard for financial reporting, companies may report alternative “pro forma” financials, which pretend as though certain items are not part of normal operations. One legitimate use of pro forma financials is during a business acquisition, to show the acquirer how the business would operate when acquired. However, during the dotcom bubble, many companies improperly used pro forma financials to inflate their earnings.
  * **Aggressive revenue recognition:** Say a company sells a product that the customer pays for over the course of months or years. Realistically, the cash goes from the customer over this long period of time. However, the company may “recognize” the revenue over years as having been collected instantaneously at the moment of the sale. This inflates revenues and can overestimate the solidity of the business, particularly if the customer later stops paying.
  * **Treating normal expenses as capital expenditures:** A company may report normal operating expenses as capital expenditures. This allows the company to boost assets on its balance sheet and take less of a hit on its net income.
  * **Over-optimistic pension projections:** A company with a pension will estimate how much money it needs to pay future pensions. When a company earns more than this estimated amount, it can report the difference as net income. However, a company can also artificially change this number by changing its estimations. 
    * For instance, a company might previously estimate its pension plan would grow at 6% per year. If it suddenly improved the estimate to 8% per year, it would need less money today to meet future obligations. This presents an artificial “gain” that can be reported as net income.
    * Pay attention if the “net pension benefit” is a big portion of the company’s net income—say, over 5%.



The details of corporate accounting can be abstruse and difficult to unpack. One reliable way around these shenanigans is to **use a long period of earnings, say 10 years, with all the adjustments added in. Don’t rely solely on a single year’s earnings for your investment decisions.**

When studying a company’s financials, **beware of any reported changes in the company’s accounting methods**. These are opportunities for companies to inflate performance over previous years.

(Shortform note: Accounting regulation is an ever-changing field. In reaction to major accounting frauds such as Enron and Worldcom as well as the dotcom crash, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was passed in the United States to standardize financial reporting and decrease flexibility of some of the tools mentioned here. However, as Graham notes, companies will always find creative ways to toe the line of regulation.)

### Bond Analysis

The chief risk of buying bonds is that the issuing company defaults and goes bankrupt. By studying certain criteria of safety for a bond issuer, you can avoid risky bonds that might become worthless. This is particularly important as the historical trend has been for companies to take on large loans even as they struggle to show profits.

(Shortform note: In his commentary, Zweig issues a reminder that since bonds are sold in large increments (say, $5,000), an investor buying bonds herself would need $100,000 to properly diversify. Instead, modern investors are likely better suited by bond funds, which do the hard work of bond research and diversification for you.)

#### Interest Coverage Ratio

The major metric for bond safety is the **ratio of earnings to total interest charges** , also known as the “**Interest Coverage Ratio**.” This is a measure of how well the company can pay the interest on its loans.

If the ratio is below 1, then the company isn’t generating enough profits to pay off its loans; this can in turn mean the company may default on its loans, which can then lead to bankruptcy and a reorganization of the company.

To be more precise, the ratio can be calculated in a few different ways:

  * The earnings can be before taxes or after taxes
  * The window of time can change. Graham proposes using either the average ratio of the past 7 years, or the single worst year in the past 7 years.



Different industries have different minimum coverage ratios. For example, Graham proposes that retail and railroad companies should have a minimum interest coverage ratio of 5 averaged over the past 7 years, while utility companies can have a lower minimum of 4 due to its relative stability.

#### Other Safety Factors

Beyond the interest coverage test, study other factors of the company:

  * Size of business
  * Asset values, particularly in real estate, utilities, and investment companies. In other industries, the value of the assets may fall while the company’s earnings power falls.
  * Ratio of earnings to the total debt principal, as opposed to total interest charges. This is useful particularly in high interest rate periods, when it becomes more difficult for companies to cover multiples of their interest charges
