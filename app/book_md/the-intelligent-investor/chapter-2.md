## Chapter 2: Inflation

Inflation is an increase in prices over time. A dollar today buys a lot less than a dollar did 20 years ago: the purchasing power of a dollar has decreased.

Inflation is an insidious problem, because it doesn’t change the actual balance of your bank account, it only changes the purchasing power of how much money you have. If 2% of your bank balance were deducted per year, you’d take notice and be alarmed. But when the same amount of money can buy 2% less in goods and services each year, it’s nearly undetectable.

Therefore, if you were to hold all of your savings simply in cash, it would gradually lose value because of inflation. In contrast, **holding stocks in your portfolio reduces the effect of inflation**. Even if inflation occurs in a given period, increases in the stock’s dividends and price may offset inflation. Bonds, being loans with fixed terms, don’t have the same flexible resistance to inflation.

We’ll discuss inflation in more detail and why stocks protect against it.

### Measuring Inflation

How bad can inflation get? During certain periods, inflation can be rapid:

  * In the US, in the 6 years from 1915 to 1920, cost of living nearly doubled.
  * Also in the US, in the 10 years from 1973 to 1982, cost of living more than doubled.
  * Zweig notes that since 1960, two-thirds of market economies have experienced inflation of at least 25% per year for at least a year. The US hasn’t yet experienced this, but it’d be unwise to assume it could never happen.



Averaging across much of the 20th century, Graham predicts that a reasonable assumption around inflation is 3% per year. (Shortform note: Since the start of the 21st century, inflation has stayed at a relatively steady 2% per year.)

### Inflation and Stocks

How do stocks and businesses perform during inflation? There’s a lot of variability and plenty of exceptions to any rule, but, in his commentary looking back over the 20th century, Zweig notes in general:

  * In periods of steady mild inflation, stock returns outperformed inflation.
  * In periods of high (above 6%) inflation, stocks performed poorly. This might be because high inflation disrupts the economy—consumers purchase less, and businesses suffer.



#### Why Do Stocks Resist Inflation?

(Shortform note: This is a technical section we’ve included to be comprehensive; it’s not too relevant for the typical defensive investor.)

One theory of why stocks resist inflation is that during a time of inflation, a business’s costs increase, but it can also increase its prices at the same time, thus preserving its profits. In theory, a business can grow its revenues and profits at the same rate as inflation, and its stock price rises with inflation as well. In other words, a business can pass on the costs of inflation to its customers.

Graham analyzes these claims and finds that they fall short. Looking back on the 20th century, he agrees that stock prices have risen faster than inflation, but not because inflation had a direct effect on company financials. If the theory above were true, then companies would show higher earnings on capital during inflation (because the earnings should rise with inflation while the old capital investment stays the same). But this hasn’t appeared—earnings on capital have not kept pace with consumer prices.

Instead, much of the gain in earnings and stock price from 1950 to 1970 was due to two factors:

  * Reinvestment of profits into the business
  * Increasing corporate debt, used to grow the company faster



### Protecting Against Inflation

Other than stocks, these two asset classes can also help protect against inflation:

  * **Real estate:** Prices of real estate tend to rise with inflation. However, Graham warns that real estate prices can be volatile, and you can easily make mistakes buying the wrong property for the wrong price. In his commentary, Zweig recommends Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), which are tradable securities that hold a diversified basket of real estate properties.
  * **Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS):** Introduced in 1997, TIPS are inflation-indexed bonds, meaning the value adjusts to inflation. You can buy them from the US government or from a fund as offered by Vanguard. Oddly, increases in TIPS principal value are taxed as income, so consider buying TIPS in a tax-deferred retirement account like an IRA or 401(k).



Other assets are commonly considered to protect against inflation, but **Graham is skeptical** :

  * **Gold:** Gold’s supply doesn’t change much over time, as opposed to central banks creating more paper money, so it’s theoretically less subject to inflation. However, the price of gold has historically had a poor correlation with inflation, since gold prices fluctuate based on other factors.
  * **Exotic assets** , like art or diamonds. Graham says he’s out of his depth here, and most readers likely are too.
