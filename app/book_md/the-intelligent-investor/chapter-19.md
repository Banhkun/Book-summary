## Chapter 19: A Stock Owner is a Business Owner

When most people buy a share of stock in a company, they see it as an item of abstract value, rising and falling with the whims of the market. In turn, they see themselves as passive observers of a business, content to let management do whatever it thinks is best.

Graham urges you to see a stock in a much more concrete way: **as a piece of ownership in a real business**. If you owned 100% of stock in a business, you’d see yourself as a business owner. Similarly, even if you own only 0.001% of a company, you should _still_ see yourself a legitimate part-owner of a business. The CEO of the company works for you, and its board of directors answers to you.

As a business owner, **you should actively monitor the business’s performance and the decisions of its management**. If you are disappointed by this performance, you should actively demand that management do a better job. Should management continue to perform poorly, you should actively demand that current management be fired and new management be installed. You have a voting right in how the company is run, and you should see this duty nearly as important as voting in your national election.

Most individual investors do none of this. The majority of individual investors don’t vote in company proceedings. Graham was visibly disheartened by this indifference and urged investors to take stronger action.

(Shortform note: Since Graham’s times, “activist investors” have taken a larger role in steering companies. These are often investment firms that take sizable minority stakes—say, 1-10% of a company—and vocally demand certain directions by management. This is no substitute for an individual’s active involvement, but Graham might have seen these movements as directionally positive.)

Beyond general stewardship of a business, Graham focuses on one particular issue related to management duties: dividend payout policy.

### Dividend Policy

In the first half of the 20th century, it was common for businesses to pay out the majority of profits to shareholders. This seems like common sense—the purpose of a business is to make money, and that money should belong to shareholders. Successful businesses therefore paid high dividends, while faltering businesses paid only a paltry amount.

However, over time the opposite fashion emerged—businesses began retaining more of their profits and reduced dividend payments. (Shortform note: In the 1960s, companies paid 55-60% of its profits; in recent years, the payout ratio is closer to 30%.)

**The theoretical justification was that the business could use the profits to further grow the business** , and so the money was better retained in the business than paying shareholders. For a set of growing businesses that clearly could deploy capital to achieve growth, this made sense.

This trend inverted how successful businesses behaved—the more successful, growing businesses paid less in dividends (as a percentage of profits); shareholders, enthusiastic about the growth in stock price, happily accepted this situation. In contrast, faltering businesses couldn’t lift their stock price through growth, so they had to pay dividends instead.

Over time, as this habit became the new normal, the **dividend policy morphed into a signal about future company prospects**. If a profitable, growing company with no history of paying dividends suddenly began doing so, it might suggest that the company had run out of good ideas to reinvest its profits. Counter-intuitively, paying dividends might lead to a _decrease_ in stock price, since shareholders would worry that the company’s growth was soon to stop. Guided by this fear, companies refrained from paying dividends.

Why should the shareholder care if the company doesn’t pay dividends? Wouldn’t this cash simply be stored up to be paid at some later time? Not if the **company wastes the cash on unprofitable projects**. It might fund expensive acquisitions or costly expansions into industries in which it has no competence. This wasted cash would have been better put into the pockets of shareholders.

As an active investor, **you should not take the dividend payout policy of management on faith**. Every company that earns money should by default pay it out to its investors. **If management decides not to pay dividends, it is their responsibility to argue that it can deploy this money profitably.** If it fails to meet its promises, dividends should be paid in the future, or management should be replaced.
