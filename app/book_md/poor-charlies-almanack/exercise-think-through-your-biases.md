## Exercise: Think Through Your Biases

The best way to understand whether you’re subject to psychological biases is to step through a checklist of every bias. This avoids errors and omissions.

* * *

Think of an important, life-changing decision that you need to make. What is it?

Now, as Munger suggests, step through each psychological bias and think about whether it’s hampering your cognition. We’ll provide a reference. First, think about:

  1. Reward and Punishment Superresponse Tendency
  2. Liking/Loving Tendency
  3. Disliking/Hating Tendency
  4. Doubt-Avoidance Tendency
  5. Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency
  6. Curiosity Tendency



Which ones of these apply, and how?

Next, examine:

  1. Kantian Fairness Tendency
  2. Envy/Jealousy Tendency
  3. Reciprocation Tendency
  4. Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency
  5. Simple, Pain-Avoiding Psychological Denial
  6. Excessive Self-Regard Tendency



Next, examine:

  1. Overoptimism Tendency
  2. Deprival-Superreaction Tendency
  3. Social-Proof Tendency
  4. Contrast-Misreaction Tendency
  5. Stress-Influence Tendency
  6. Availability-Misweighing Tendency



Finally, examine:

  1. Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency
  2. Drug-Misinfluence Tendency
  3. Senescence-Misinfluence Tendency
  4. Authority-Misinfluence Tendency
  5. Twaddle Tendency
  6. Reason-Respective Tendency
  7. Lollapalooza Tendency
