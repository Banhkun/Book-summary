## On Rationality and Decision Making

When asked to describe himself in one word, Charlie Munger chose “rational.” He knows he’s subject to the same biases affecting all other humans, and he’s trained himself to recognize when the biases are active and how to limit their damage.

### Objectivity and Changing One’s Mind

**If you want to make better decisions, you need to seek truth** —what is really happening in the world, not what you _want_ to believe is happening. Recognizing the truth is often painful—it may go against your prior beliefs or desires, but recognizing reality is better than deluding yourself.

Here are major principles on staying objective.

First, **recognize that it’s very easy to delude yourself**.

  * “What a man wishes, he will believe.”—Demosthenes
  * “Never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool.”—Richard Feynman
  * “How many legs does a dog have if you call the tail a leg? Four. Calling a tail a leg doesn’t make it a leg.”—Abraham Lincoln
  * “Apply logic to help avoid fooling yourself. Charlie will not accept anything I say just because I say it, although most of the world will.”—Warren Buffett
  * “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."—Max Planck



Second, **you should readily entertain other opinions**. You should deliberately consider arguments of the other side. In fact, try to state the other side’s opinions better than they can themselves.

  * Resist the tendency to accept only information that confirms your prior beliefs and to reject information that contradicts it (also known as confirmation bias).
  * If you don’t take up these practices, you’ll find that you automatically reject ideas you disagree with. This is a dangerous habit you need to train yourself out of.
  * Example: Munger cites “[CBS head] Paley was a god. But he didn’t like to hear what he didn’t like to hear, and people soon learned that. So they told Paley only what he liked to hear. Therefore, he was soon living in a little cocoon of unreality and everything else was corrupt.”



Third, after considering other viewpoints, **you should readily change your mind**.

  * **Be willing to destroy your favorite ideas**. Munger says that any year he doesn’t destroy one of his beloved ideas is a wasted year.
  * “Faced with the choice of changing one’s mind and between proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.”—John Kenneth Galbraith
  * “Both Warren and I are very good at changing our prior conclusions. We work at developing that facility because, without it, disaster often comes.”



Be aware that strong psychological biases are in place that prevent you from being objective. The next chapter in the guide will cover his 25 psychological biases. Here are a few notable ones that distort the truth:

  * Denial: Be willing to admit that you’re wrong. Denying the truth doesn’t make it any less real.
  * Consistency bias: Don’t entrench in your beliefs simply because you’ve held them for a long time. This is related to sunk cost fallacy—don’t throw good money after bad simply because you’re unwilling to change your mind.
  * Incentive bias: If you have an incentive to believe a certain way, then you’re likely to be biased toward that belief.



(Shortform note: Another famed investor Ray Dalio is also well known for his philosophy on aggressively seeking the truth and leaving ego out of it. Read our guide to his book Principles.)

### Practice Divergent and Contrary Thinking

Social proof bias is the tendency to believe what others believe, to improve social cohesion. This causes humans to think like sheep, even if the ideas they believe are wrong. **Practicing contrary thinking invites new ideas that might be more correct than what everyone else thinks**.

Munger and Buffett practice this regularly in their financial management. If you adopt the same investment practices as everyone else, you can by definition only get average returns. To achieve outstanding returns, you need to think differently from the crowd.

  * Munger bemoans how many institutional investors are unwilling to deviate from the crowd, because doing so and failing would make them look dumb.
  * Given Berkshire Hathaway’s successful investment record, why don’t more investors try to emulate their strategy? The answer might be that their multidisciplinary approach to investing (described later) is simply too difficult, or that people are afraid to look dumb by not following the crowd.



“The ‘silly’ question is the first intimation of some totally new development.”—Alfred Whitehead

Munger demonstrates a few examples of contrarian thinking in his writing:

  * Japan’s recession had endured for ten years, despite their government trying to stir growth through monetary policy. At the same time, there was an asset bubble in Hong Kong. Economists struggled to come up with an explanation. Munger thought it was simple—Japanese and Chinese people have very different cultures, and “the Chinese are gamblers.” But economists wouldn’t have accepted this explanation, not least of all because it’s politically incorrect. Munger cited this as an example of how successful investors need to practice multidisciplinary, divergent thinking to succeed.
  * To get better at tennis, Charlie didn’t practice serves or powerful swings, like most people. Instead, he bought a tennis ball practice machine and practiced volleys endlessly. This is tedious and no one really likes practicing volleys, but mastering them gave him a competitive advantage.



### Invert, Always Invert

One way to practice divergent thinking is to **invert your view on a situation, to look at it from the opposite perspective**. This can reveal new insights. “Many hard problems are best solved only when they are addressed backwards.”

Here are a few examples of inverting thinking:

  * Instead of thinking about how something can succeed, think about how it can fail. “What can go wrong that I haven’t seen?”
  * When physicists were trying to revise Maxwell’s electromagnetic laws to be consistent with Newton’s mechanical laws, Einstein inverted the situation—he revised Newton’s laws to fit Maxwell’s, and so discovered special relativity.
  * Great bridge players not only think, “how can I take the winners?” but also “how can I avoid taking too many losers?”
  * If you want to help a developing country like India, don’t just think, “how can I best help India?” Also think, “how can I most hurt India?” Then you find what can do the worst damage, and then you try to avoid it.



### Know Your Circle of Competence

To make good decisions, you need to know what you’re good at and what you’re bad at. Munger calls this the **“circle of competence”—know where your boundary is, and don’t step outside of the circle**.

Here are elaborations of this idea:

  * “Knowing what you don’t know is more useful than being brilliant.”
  * “People are trying to be smart—all I am trying to do is not to be idiotic, but it’s harder than most people think.”
  * “You have to figure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you are going to lose.”
  * “It’s great to have a manager with a 160 IQ—unless he thinks it’s 180.”
  * “It is impossible to begin to learn that which one thinks one already knows.”—Epictetus
  * “If you have competence, you know the edge. It wouldn’t be a competence if you didn’t know where the boundaries lie. [Asking whether you’ve passed the boundary is] a question that almost answers itself.”
  * “Not ignorance, but ignorance of ignorance is the death of knowledge.”—Alfred Whitehead



#### Examples of Circle of Competence

##### Planck and Chauffeur Knowledge

To illustrate the idea of circle of competence, Munger tells a story about the physicist Max Planck and his chauffeur. Planck was driving around Germany giving lectures on physics, and his chauffeur listened to every lecture and soon memorized it. One night, the chauffeur asked Planck if he could pretend to be Planck and give the lecture in his stead. Amused, Planck agreed. That night the chauffeur gave a flawless performance of the lecture, and the crowd was none the wiser. Then a physicist stood up and asked an advanced question that the chauffeur had no chance of answering. The chauffeur responded, “I’m surprised you’re asking such a basic question, so I’m going to ask my chauffeur to respond.”

The point of the story is that there are two types of knowledge.

  * The first is Planck knowledge—they have true competence and they know what they’re talking about. 
  * The second is chauffeur knowledge—they’ve learned to imitate the talk and make an impression, but they don’t _really_ have actual knowledge.



In each domain, **you need to know whether you have Planck knowledge or chauffeur knowledge**. Don’t act like you have Planck knowledge when in reality you’re the chauffeur.

##### Bee Dances

Munger gives another example about bee dances. When a bee finds nectar, it returns to the hive and does a dance to tell the hive where to find it—how far to go in what direction. The dance is baked into the bee’s genetics.

A scientist decided to test the limits of this system and put nectar straight above the hive. In normal situations, nectar is never above the hive (flowers don’t grow in the sky), so the bee doesn’t have natural programming to signal this.

So what does the bee do? Ideally, it’d just sit there and do nothing. But instead, the bee dances a crazy, incoherent dance. The other bees see this dance and misinterpret where the nectar is, and so this single confused bee throws off the entire hive.

**Many people are like the confused bee—they answer questions outside their circle of competence.** Even when they know they’re confused, they try to bluster and pretend they know what they’re talking about. Munger actively looks for people who pretend to have confidence they know nothing about, and then he gets rid of them—they confuse the rest of the hive.

#### Circle of Competence and Investing

In investments, Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett know what they’re good at and what they’re bad at. They hesitate to stray outside their circle of competence.

For example, they have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand.

  * First, Munger looks for an easy to understand, dominant business franchise that can sustain itself and thrive in all market environments. Most businesses don’t make this cut.
  * Certain businesses, like pharmaceuticals and technology, go into the “too tough to understand” bucket. Munger finds that the dynamics of software and computer chips are simply outside their area of expertise, so they reject them completely. **Munger and Buffett don’t try to grasp the esoteric—they simply try to remember the obvious.**
  * “Hot” deals and IPOs get rejected as no’s (Munger considers these as overhyped and overpriced).



As a cautionary tale, Munger tells the story of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. The firm employed plenty of brilliant, hardworking people, but they became overconfident and took on too much leverage. Within four months in 1998, it lost $4.6 billion, needed to be bailed out, and eventually dissolved.

### Have Discipline in Choosing Good Ideas

After collecting more information and trying to be as objective as possible, you then need to make actual decisions. Here Munger stresses the discipline of **making few, high-quality decisions with discipline, instead of chasing too many seemingly promising ideas**.

Warren Buffett articulated this as follows—**if you were given only twenty possible investments in your lifetime, you would be much more successful as an investor**. You’d be forced to think through each investment very carefully, and if you saw a good opportunity, you’d bet big. In contrast, typical investors make far too many careless bets, knowing that they have unlimited opportunities to make up losses.

Li Lu, a fundamental investor and a disciple of Warren Buffett, describes a similar idea with a baseball analogy: “Ted Williams is the only baseball player who had a .400 single-season hitting record in the last seven decades. In _The Science of Hitting_ , he explained his technique. He divided the strike zone into seventy-seven cells, each representing the size of a baseball. He would insist on swinging only at balls in his ‘best’ cells, even at the risk of striking out, because reaching for the ‘worst’ spots would seriously reduce his chances of success. As a securities investor, you can watch all sorts of business propositions in the form of security prices thrown at you all the time. For the most part, you don’t have to do a thing other than be amused. Once in a while, you will find a ‘fat pitch’ that is slow, straight, and right in the middle of your sweet spot. Then you swing hard.”

Surprisingly, **the worst risk often isn’t chasing bad ideas** —bad ideas are relatively obvious and they’re hard to overdo. **It’s the seemingly ‘good’ ideas with some attractive kernel of truth that are dangerous, because you can easily overdo them.**

  * This is especially true in boom times, when things seem to be going well. You can easily overdo too much of a good thing, overstep your circle of competence, and ruin yourself. Munger spoke kindly of money manager Lou Simpson, who during the dotcom bubble avoided the calls to reap higher gains and stuck to his fundamentals.



### Learn Vicariously from Others’ Mistakes

Munger and Buffett both read and learn constantly, and one of the reasons is to**learn from other people’s mistakes**. You can learn vicariously from other people’s terrible experiences and save yourself from the same fate. Munger offers a few quotes on this:

  * “I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out. I don’t believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself.”
  * “I sought good judgment mostly by collecting instances of bad judgment, then pondering ways to avoid such outcomes.”



### Avoid Ideological Bias

Ideology can be an especially heavy form of bias. Because it consists of deep-seated beliefs, **ideology can distort your view of reality and your cognition**. In turn, ideology causes you to make worse decisions.

Young people are especially vulnerable to ideology, since it locks the brain into a biased pattern.

Here are a few examples of ideology and its effects:

  * Linguist Noam Chomsky maintained for years that language isn’t genetic, while Munger (and other scientists) found it obvious that, like every other behavior, language was established in human genetics through natural selection. Munger mused about why a genius like Chomsky was so clearly wrong, and he believed that it was because of Chomsky’s leftist, egalitarian ideology. If Chomsky conceded this one Darwnian point, it would throw into question his entire ideology.
  * While many people carry the ideology of egalitarianism and total equality, Munger thinks this is silly in many contexts. You wouldn’t want your brain surgeon to have gotten into medical school by random straw picking; you’d want the very best brain surgeon possible. You don’t want the airplane you ride in designed in an egalitarian way either. Sometimes the best decisions contradict common ideologies.



If there’s one ideology to have, it’s in favor of objectivity, rationality, and discipline.
