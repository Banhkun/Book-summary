## On Investing

In _Poor Charlie’s Almanack_ , Munger doesn’t talk directly about Berkshire Hathaway’s decisions much, but he does share the general investment philosophies and practices that have made them successful over decades. In this chapter, we’ll discuss his perspectives as an investor; in the next, we’ll discuss perspectives on creating a successful business.

### Berkshire Hathaway

Despite its giant size, **Berkshire Hathaway’s model is relatively simple** :

  1. Use insurance companies to generate “float,” or cash collected from insurance premiums before claims have to be paid.
  2. Use this float to invest in businesses at a much higher rate of return than has to be paid out.



In essence, if you can take in money at 3% and invest it in things that grow at 13%, and you can do this for 50 years, you can grow to be very large, as Berkshire Hathaway has.

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are famously hands-off in the management of companies they acquire. They decentralize all the decision-making to the owned companies, trusting that the company managers are in the best position to make technical decisions for their companies. In this way, they recognize their circle of competence—they’re good at spotting businesses to invest in, but they know they’re not the best to run them. (Shortform note: For a detailed look at Berkshire Hathaway’s management style and its investment model, read our guide to The Outsiders.)

Compared to other public companies, **Berkshire Hathaway has the advantage of being very patient, long-term planners** who don’t mind lumpy results in the short-term and don’t care about pleasing Wall Street. When the market is unfriendly, Berkshire is willing to underwrite less insurance and avoid doing deals. Then, when the market flips, Buffett and Munger can swoop in and take advantage of great deals.

However, Munger notes that Berkshire’s historical returns will be hard to match as it grows. It’s much harder to find underpriced, low-competition investments when you have $10 billion than when you have $10 million.

### Be Patient But Decisive

Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger make successful investments because they’re able to wait patiently for great deals. Unlike many investors, they don’t mind staying inactive, even for years at a time, when they don’t see great opportunities. However, when they _do_ see great opportunities, they bet big.

When Warren Buffett lectures at business schools, he’s known for saying that everyone would make better investments if they were given a punch card with twenty slots in it and **were restricted to only twenty investments throughout their entire lifetime**. Once they punched all twenty holes, they would be able to make zero additional investments. Under these conditions, investors would be much more discerning about which investments to pursue, and they’d bet big on the few investments they found.

We’ll break down both aspects of patience and decisiveness.

#### Wait for the Great Opportunities

Munger waits for business deals that aren’t just good opportunities, they’re so _obviously_ good that they’re “no-brainers.” The rest of the time, they don’t do anything.

This makes life easier by simplifying how much you need to know. You don’t need to know how to do everything in every business and have a hundred valuable insights in your life. Instead, **you just need to have two or three very important insights and bet big on them**. Munger notes that Berkshire Hathaway was really built on the top ten decisions they’ve ever made.

Being patient has practical benefits too—when you make fewer transactions, you pay less in broker fees, you pay less in taxes (presumably through less frequent realization of capital gains), and you can tune out a lot more noise about irrelevant details.

#### Be Decisive When You See Great Opportunities

**When you do see a great opportunity, then bet big on it.** Don’t bet tepidly, what Munger calls “buying with an eyedropper” what they should be buying in volumes. And even worse, don’t sit on your hands and do nothing. Munger states that the biggest errors in Berkshire’s history were “mistakes of omission”—they saw the opportunity, but didn’t act on it, and so lost billions in value.

This often means countering the common ethos of the time. When markets plunge, the herd mentality is often fearful, when in reality this is when things are cheapest and the deals at their best. In these situations, Munger and Buffett buy more of a stock they like as the prices keep dropping.

### How to Find Good Investments

Buffett and Munger are disciples of value investor Benjamin Graham, who advocated for investing in businesses that were underpriced relative to their value. However, the two expand beyond Graham’s principles by considering more factors than just book value, such as the quality of a business, its growth prospects, and its management.

(Shortform note: To learn Graham’s value investing fundamentals, read our guide to _The Intelligent Investor_.)

#### High-Quality Businesses

Beyond just looking for cheap deals, Munger looks for high-quality businesses. In sum, these are profitable businesses that have a sustainable competitive advantage and good growth prospects. (Shortform note: We’ll discuss competitive advantage in the next chapter.)

The quality of a company may even override cheapness—”**a great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price.** ” A company that returns 18% on capital over twenty years can get amazing results, even if you pay a price that looks expensive at first.

The benefit of a high-quality business is you don’t need to fret over when to sell it. When you buy a cheap low-quality company, you have to worry about when to exit your investment, since future opportunities may never come again. In contrast, great businesses will stay great for years or decades, and you can wait patiently to sell when it’s in your favor.

Not all profits are made equal. Some businesses earn 15% on capital, and you can take the profits out as cash. Other businesses make 15% too, but the cash needs to be reinvested to sustain the business, so there’s never cash that you can take out of the company.

#### Management Matters

Ben Graham never accounted for management quality in his value investing principles, partially because he was writing to a mass audience who wouldn’t have the opportunity to talk to and assess management, and partially because he had an intrinsic distrust of management.

But Munger and Buffett believe management can make a big difference. For example, famed CEO Jack Welch made a big difference for General Electric, in ways that the manager of Westinghouse didn’t.

Munger **looks for management that is 1) unusually skilled and 2) trustworthy**.

However, management shouldn’t be the dominant factor—it’s better to bet on a high-quality business than to bet on great management.

#### Valuing Companies

Of course, to earn great returns, it’s important not just to find great businesses, but also great businesses at great prices. **Even a fantastic business can be a terrible investment if the price is too high.**

Consider betting on a horse race. The best horse is often obvious, based on its track record, weight, health, and so on, and it’s clearly better than a sickly horse with a bad record. But the odds already reflect that—the best horse might have odds of 2 to 1, while the bad horse has odds of 50 to 1. Which is the better deal? It’s not immediately clear.

Likewise, a company with strong management, a great competitive moat, and a profitable business model is a sound business, but its price probably already reflects much of that. It’s not a good idea to invest in a business at _any_ price.

However, the market is not perfectly efficient at all times. **Great businesses can _sometimes_ be found at great prices, due to the erratic nature of the market.** Ben Graham conceptualized this in the idea of Mr. Market, a manic-depressive who shows up at your doorstep each day and offers you a price that can be far higher than what you think it’s worth, or far lower. You have the choice of whether to buy from Mr. Market, sell to him, or do nothing. If you’re patient, you can find the times when the market underprices a good company.

### Compounding

Compounding growth is a formidable force. Growing consistently at a steady-but-not-impressive rate, like 15%, can yield big results over time—such an investment will double every 5 years, and thus grow by 16 times over 20 years.

Taxes make a big difference in compounding growth as well. Compare a passive and active investment approach with the same annual rates of return.

  * In the passive approach, you earn 15% per year for 30 years, then liquidate at the end of the period, paying a one-time 35% tax. You’ll have 43x your initial investment at the end.
  * In the active approach, you earn 15% per year, but need to pay 35% tax each year due to active trading and creation of capital gains. Here you earn only 9.75% per year; at the end of 30 years, you’d earn only 16.3x your initial investment. 



With growth that’s not taxed, you have a difference of 2.6x in the same investment period, despite having the same nominal pre-tax growth per year.

However, there are natural limits to compounding. Because of finite resources, a company or investment cannot grow at the same compounded rate indefinitely (if it did, it would eventually consume all the money and resources in the universe).

The idea of compounding applies to general life as well. Say Munger: “You don’t have to be brilliant, only a little bit wiser than the other guys, on average, for a long, long time.”

### Common Investment Pitfalls

Given how competitive and profit-seeking financial investment is, it’s prone to developing false wisdom and red herrings. Munger cautions investors against a number of common pitfalls.

#### Embellished Synergies

When investors think about buying and combining businesses, they often point to financial synergies that can result—often through cutting shared overhead costs or expected growth through combining business forces.

Munger is aware that these synergies exist, but finds that many people embellish the synergies that will actually materialize.

#### Too-Complicated Systems

Munger and Buffett like simple investment philosophies—buy good businesses with sustainable competitive advantages at low prices. They find mathematically and theory-heavy investment models, like modern portfolio theory and beta, incomprehensible. For example, Munger finds the idea that a stock’s volatility is a measure of risk nonsense.

Munger thinks the same about derivatives, which can have incredibly complex structures and become nearly impossible to do reliable accounting on. Derivatives books are often constructed out of thin air, fanciful thinking, and false profits. He pointed out how derivatives obfuscated the terrible situation at Enron, and in 2003, well before the 2008 financial crisis, he predicted that “there are big troubles to come.”

#### False Oracles

Investors always wish for people who can predict the future, and they seek out prophets. But this is foolhardy—people are no better at predicting the future of financial markets than they are at reading tea leaves.

#### Not Expensing Stock Options

Munger and Buffett both believe issuing stock options must be accounted for as part of expenses. Avoiding this reduces expenses and inflates company earnings, which is why executives like doing it. In the short term, this can raise stock prices, but eventually the finances don’t add up, and confidence in the company plummets along with the stock price. (Shortform note: read this HBR article for a more thorough discussion of why managers falsely believe options shouldn’t be expensed, and why those reasons are foolish.)

### Passive Investing

Despite their personal prowesses in investing, Buffett and Munger are **staunch supporters of passive investing for the vast majority of the population** , even for large endowment funds deciding what to do with their money. Specifically, passive investing means investing in the market overall through index funds, rather than choosing stocks personally or hiring money managers who do more than passive investing.

Consider the simple statistics of the matter. Of the entire investing population, strictly half of people will do better than average, and half of people will do worse. And the average result may actually be quite poor. If you were to aim for better results, note that only 10% of people can be in the top ten percentile.

This contravenes the presumptuous optimism of the retail investor or active professional investor, both of whom tend to think they are well above average. In reality, long-term studies have shown that most active investors earn less than the overall market.

Munger has special ire for active investment managers who take a percentage of the invested capital in fees. Even in the unlikely case that active investors beat the market, after deducting fees and transaction expenses, they underperform the market.

This might be counter-intuitive to the smart and confident. Surely a well-heeled foundation, with very strict hiring practices, pedigreed investors, and rigorous investment discussions, should do better than average? But these very practices might hurt, because they contribute to overconfidence.

Munger acknowledges that the market is not perfectly efficient, and that a small number of motivated, intelligent, disciplined investors will be able to find the rare opportunity among millions of false leads. But the percentage of people who can do this consistently over time is vanishingly small.

### Wealth Effect and Booms/Busts

Stock markets, of course, go through booms and busts. During booms, stocks become irrationally overpriced far out of pace with the underlying company fundamentals.

To explain this, Munger describes the economic/psychological concept of the “wealth effect”—when stock prices go up, people act as though they have more money and spend more money. In turn, when spending increases, stock prices increase. This can lead to lollapalooza effects that cause huge rises in stock prices.

Even more specific contributions are:

  * People who buy stocks not based on their fundamental values, but largely because the prices have risen. If people buy stocks like they buy fine art, not because of intrinsic value but because of what other people are willing to pay for it, then surely the markets would be distorted.
  * Rising stock prices increase corporate earnings by reducing pension cost accruals.
  * Stock options being issued that aren’t properly expensed, thus inflating earnings.



A 100-point increase in the S&P adds about a trillion dollars in market value, so it’s not hard to see how that can lead to further increases in stock prices through the wealth effect.

### Charlie’s Investment Checklist

Incorporating all the principles we’ve learned so far, Munger follows a 10-step checklist for making investment decisions.

**1\. Think Independently**

  * Don’t follow the folly of crowds. Make up your own independent mind, ignoring who agrees or disagrees with you.
  * Following the herd guarantees you’ll regress to the mean and have average results.



**2\. Stay Humble**

  * Recognize your circle of competence and stay within it.
  * Find evidence that disagrees with your most sacred beliefs.
  * Recognize when you’re overconfident and deluding yourself about your certainty.



**3\. Prepare and Work Hard**

  * Learn constantly through continuous reading. Try to get a little smarter every day.
  * Build a broad base of knowledge across many different fields of study. Build a wide latticework of mental models.
  * Keep asking “why?” to understand how things work.



**4\. Analyze Rigorously**

  * Understand the value of businesses independent of price; real growth independent of motion; and wealth independent of size.
  * Use checklists to avoid biases and omissions.
  * Don’t lose the forest for the trees—understand the few major effects that really matter instead of the many minutiae that don’t.
  * Look at second- and third-order effects.
  * “Invert, always invert.”



**5\. Measure Risk**

  * Avoid working with people without integrity.
  * Avoid big mistakes that can wipe you out.
  * Seek compensation commensurate with risk taken.
  * Build in a margin of safety.
  * Safeguard your reputation—trust can be lost in a single decision.



**6\. Allocate Assets Wisely**

  * Remember that the real cost of an investment is the opportunity cost.



**7\. Be Patient**

  * If you don’t see good opportunities, be content to sit on your hands and do nothing. The tendency to act can lead to bad decisions and unnecessary costs.
  * Allow compound growth to work its magic—being a little better over long periods of time can lead to amazing things.



**8\. Be Decisive**

  * “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”
  * When the odds are in your favor, bet big.



**9\. Adapt and Change**

  * The world won’t adjust to you; you need to adjust to the world.
  * Be willing to kill your most beloved ideas.
  * Recognize when you’re wrong and learn from it. Denial hurts.



**10\. Stay Focused**

  * Don’t get overconfident. Don’t get bored.
  * Make sure your investments and businesses perform optimally.
  * If you have problems, face them head-on instead of ducking from them.
