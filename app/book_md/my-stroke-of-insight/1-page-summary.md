## 1-Page Summary

Doctors have made great strides in understanding both the functions and the illnesses of the brain, but one neuroscientist knows them better than most. On December 10, 1996, Jill Bolte Taylor suffered a stroke on the left side of her brain, and as a scientist who specialized in the study of the brain, she was uniquely qualified to observe and report the subjective experience of losing one cognitive function after another as the damage of the stroke spread through her left hemisphere.

However, despite its disabling effects, Taylor’s stroke triggered feelings of deep inner peace and a sense of connection to the world around her. With her faculties for linear logic and judgment silenced by her left brain’s trauma, her right brain’s capacity for empathy and stillness redefined her awareness of herself and the world. In _My Stroke of Insight_ , Taylor explains that we all have the mental wiring to find inner peace and connection with others and that if we become aware of how our brains function, we can consciously tap its resources and reprogram ourselves to live happier, more fulfilling lives.

Jill Bolte Taylor is a neuroanatomist who (before her stroke) did research at Massachusetts’s McLean Hospital to understand the brains of people with schizophrenia. She also worked as a mental health advocate on the board of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. She’s now a public voice for educational awareness relating to the human brain and serves as the national spokesperson for the Harvard Brain Tissue Research Center.

In this guide, we’ll begin with Taylor’s explanation of the brain’s structure and how it’s affected by stroke. We’ll then summarize the events of Taylor’s stroke and how she began the process of recovery. We’ll look at the lessons Taylor drew from her experience that have shaped her new outlook on mental and emotional self-care, as well as highlight Taylor’s recommendations for how you can provide support and encouragement for anyone in your life who’s suffered a stroke.

In addition to Taylor’s expertise, we’ll examine the findings of other experts on brain science, psychology, and neuroplasticity (the ability of the brain to change itself). Because many of Taylor’s insights from science and first-hand experience mirror those of mindfulness and meditation experts, we’ll compare the overlap between science and spirituality in the area of mental well-being.

### The Science of the Brain

To understand what happens during a stroke, it’s necessary to understand how the brain works when it’s healthy. Though each part of the brain serves its own function, they all work in tandem to create your sense of self, direct your body’s movements, and generate a coherent picture of your surroundings. In this section, we’ll explain the brain’s general structure, the specific functions of its left and right hemispheres, and how the brain is physically damaged when a stroke occurs.

#### The Brain’s Structure

The brain is the most complex organ in the body, and Taylor explains the broad details of how it operates. The brain is an intricate parallel processor (a system that can manage many functions simultaneously) composed of billions of nerve cells that are grouped into distinct regions. Brain function depends not only on those regions, but on how the nerve cells network and communicate with each other.

(Shortform note: Not only is the brain incredibly complex, but it is also highly malleable—a quality known as **neuroplasticity**. In _The Brain That Changes Itself_ , psychiatrist Norman Doidge defines neuroplasticity as the brain’s ability to reshape itself in response to both external and internal stimuli. Because of neuroplasticity, our brains’ network pathways don’t only change over time, but can also completely rewire themselves into new patterns.)

The innermost layers of the brain are the oldest from an evolutionary perspective. This is the limbic system, also known as the “animal brain,” which Taylor identifies as the source of your initial emotional reactions to anything you perceive in your surroundings. Surrounding the old brain is the cerebral cortex, which in humans is twice the size of that of any other species. The outermost layers of the cerebral cortex were the most recent to evolve, and they house your abilities for language, logic, and abstract thinking.

(Shortform note: Though Taylor describes the cerebral cortex as the most advanced portion of the brain, that doesn’t mean it’s more important than the rest. In _The Whole Brain Child_ , Daniel J. Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson argue the importance of integrating the upper (cognitive) and lower (instinctive) parts of the brain as we develop in childhood. While the cerebral cortex is essential for its ability to reason and empathize with others, the inner region of the brain is crucial for its “gut instincts” and immediate responses to stimuli. When you swerve out of the way of a sudden car collision, it’s your “animal brain” that just saved your life.)

All parts of the brain are made up of information-transmitting cells, called **neurons** , which differ from other cells in your body in that they stop growing and replicating when you’re born. In other words, says Taylor, the brain cells you had when you were a baby are the same ones you’re using to read this right now. What changes as you mature is the way those cells connect to each other. As you age, those connections become more complex. They allow for better processing of the neural inputs from your senses, they let your cerebral cortex override your emotional limbic system, and they create new cognitive pathways for data that become ingrained as you absorb new information and practice new skills.

(Shortform note: Modern research shows that the brain’s neural connections don’t simply become more complex as we age; the parts of the brain performing certain tasks can change over time. In _The Brain That Changes Itself_ , Doidge explains that this process begins in infancy when the brain is absorbing vast amounts of new data. Later in life, the circuits of your brain will continue to reshape themselves, and if brain function is lost—as in the case of stroke—the remaining healthy portions of your brain will compete to make use of any nerves in the damaged area that still function.)

The cerebral cortex in which all this occurs has two distinct halves connected by a bundle of nerves called the corpus callosum. **The two halves of the brain work in unison but each with its own abilities, perception, and personality.** When functioning normally, the two halves of the brain are an inseparable whole, and every cognitive activity—such as reading, talking, painting, or driving—takes place in both hemispheres, with each side contributing to the thought process in a different way.

(Shortform note: The simplified model of the brain that Taylor uses is one that’s generally understood by the modern public, but in _Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain_ , Lisa Feldman Barrett argues that it’s overly simplistic, to the point of being misleading. The model gives a false impression that specific regions of the brain control specific bodily functions, when in fact each function is controlled by clusters of neurons networked throughout the brain. Taylor acknowledges this complexity, but nevertheless insists that the different regions of the brain behave and contribute to cognition in different, identifiable ways.)

#### The Two Hemispheres

According to Taylor, you experience the differences between your brain’s hemispheres as different sides to your personality. The left brain is the seat of logic and judgment, while the right brain is the home of intuition and empathy. Here, we’ll consider the specifics of how each hemisphere contributes to cognition and then focus on how the two halves work in tandem.

**As information flows in from your senses, the _right_ brain collates all that data into a full sensory picture of your surroundings in the present moment**. Taylor claims that to the right hemisphere, there’s no sense of time—everything is _now_. While your right brain lives wholly in the moment, it also perceives things as they relate to each other, with little or no conception of boundaries. The right brain doesn’t impose value judgments and is therefore open to new information and possibilities. It’s enthusiastic about new sensations, and because it perceives itself and the world as part of a continuum of existence, it’s the source of your feelings of empathy for others.

**The _left_ brain is your cataloger and storyteller. It takes the flow of impressions from the right brain and classifies it all via language and numbers**. Unlike the right, your left brain understands time. It sorts your memories into chronological order and is able to plan ahead for the future. Taylor says the left brain is the source of your internal monologue, that voice you hear in your head that continually tells you the story of who you are. This can be both good and bad—the left brain creates your sense of identity, but the stories it tells can get stuck in a loop that often includes negative judgments. When you dwell on things, it’s your left brain’s fault.

> **Brain Lateralization**
> 
> The differing functions of the left and right hemispheres—also known as brain lateralization—were originally mapped in the 1930s by Canadian surgeon Wilder Penfield as he was studying the brains of epilepsy patients. Penfield was strongly against the practice of frontal lobotomy, which was common at the time, and explored the brains of patients while they were awake and conscious in order to search for a more humane treatment. Our understanding of the left and right brain’s functions was further advanced by Roger W. Sperry in the 1960s, and it still serves as the underlying paradigm of research for many psychologists and neuroscientists, including Taylor.
> 
> However, the extent to which different functions in the brain are localized and segregated is still subject to debate. Some research suggests that left/right lateralization isn’t as significant as previously believed and can even vary depending on a person’s gender or left-right handedness. Critics of the left-brain/right-brain model argue that while there is evidence that certain functions are localized in the brain, the concept has been misconstrued outside the field of science, giving birth to the myth that one hemisphere dominates the other in most people, or that creativity and analytical thought are diametrically opposed to each other.

Despite their different jobs, your two halves work together, and from that cohesion, your consciousness emerges. The left brain needs inputs from the right to create its comprehensible view of the world, while the right brain needs the left’s logic and structure in order to focus amidst a sea of distraction. In terms of communication, the left brain provides your vocabulary and syntax, while the right brain adds interpretation and intuitive understanding of nonverbal cues. While we sometimes characterize people as mainly “left brain” (logical but rigid) or “right brain” (imaginative but flaky), Taylor says that **a balanced brain is both open to new experiences (right brain) while disciplined enough for self-management (left brain).**

(Shortform note: In _Maps of Meaning_ , psychologist Jordan Peterson describes in narrative terms how the right and left hemispheres work together in any given situation. The left brain contains your mental “map” of reality, based on prior learning and experience. When something unexpected intrudes on your reality, the right brain uses its abstract creativity to devise a response. Once your right brain assigns the proper meaning and reaction to whatever new factor encroached into your world—whether that be a minor inconvenience or a major, life-changing occurrence—it passes that understanding to your left brain, which encodes it into language, memory, and reason.)

#### Facts About Stroke

Given the importance of each section of the brain, any trauma suffered by one part will have a devastating effect on the whole. **A stroke is a particular kind of brain injury that results from a malfunction of the circulatory system providing the brain with oxygen and blood.** Taylor describes three different types of strokes and the ways they manifest, including a list of symptoms that may indicate you’re experiencing one.

The most common strokes are _ischemic_ , in which a blood clot blocks the brain’s circulation, causing cells to starve from lack of oxygen. A smaller fraction of strokes are _hemorrhagic_ , in which a blood vessel bursts, as with an aneurysm, flooding the brain and drowning its cells. A very rare form of hemorrhagic stroke results from a congenital defect in the brain’s blood vessels called an _arteriovenous malformation (AVM)_. Though AVMs account for less than half a percent of all strokes, they are the most common reason for strokes among young people, and it was precisely this type that Taylor experienced at the age of 37.

(Shortform note: AVMs like Taylor’s occur in fewer than 1% of people, and of those cases, under 4% experience bleeding that can lead to stroke. More common risk factors that everyone should be wary of include obesity, high blood pressure, heart disease, and a history of stroke in other family members. Research has also shown a link between severe Covid-19 and stroke. Because one of the symptoms of Covid-19 is increased clotting of the blood, this can elevate stroke risk factors even in people below the age of 50. Whichever type of stroke a person has, the risk of a second stroke remains high: one in four over the next five years.)

Taylor says that strokes are four times more likely to occur in the left hemisphere, which is why they so often impair a person’s ability to speak. A stroke in the left brain also inhibits a person’s ability to define their body’s boundaries or to perceive the passage of time. Damage to the right brain, on the other hand, impairs a person’s ability to interpret meaning, nonverbal cues, or spatial orientation. Because every brain is wired differently, the effects of strokes vary from person to person. Nevertheless, there are warning signs that may give you time to call for help, including the sudden onset of speech difficulties, problems with vision and balance, memory issues, numbness, tingling, or a sharp, severe headache.

(Shortform note: Current research shows that ischemic strokes are only 10% more likely to occur in the left hemisphere, though left-side strokes are also more damaging. The higher frequency and impact may be due to anatomical differences between the hemispheres’ arteries, though it’s also possible that the symptoms of left-side strokes (such as loss of language) are more easily recognized, whereas the symptoms of right-side strokes (such as disorientation) are not as readily apparent.)

**If you believe you’re having a stroke, call emergency services or seek help from someone nearby.**

(Shortform note: It’s possible to feel some symptoms of stroke that fade after minutes or hours. _Don’t ignore them_. You may have had a transient ischemic attack in which blood flow to your brain was temporarily blocked. If you suspect you’ve experienced one of these attacks, **seek medical help immediately**. Transient ischemic attacks are a warning that you’re at high risk for a full, debilitating stroke.)

### The Author’s Stroke and Recovery

As a neuroscientist, Taylor was aware of the biological processes involved with a stroke, but it was a different thing entirely to experience one firsthand. On the morning of December 10, 1996, between the time she woke up and when she would have left for work, an undiagnosed AVM ruptured and bled into Taylor’s brain’s left hemisphere. After years of recovery, Taylor has reconstructed her actions, thoughts, and feelings immediately during and after her stroke, and she recounts the painstaking process that followed in order to regain her cognitive abilities.

#### During the Stroke

Even with Taylor’s professional background, the fact that she was having a stroke wasn’t immediately apparent. Once she realized what was happening, Taylor used what mental and physical strength she had left to call for help while observing what was taking place in her mind. Throughout that morning, she experienced increasing symptoms of stroke and systematically made use of the faculties she had left to plan and enact a way to rescue herself.

The first symptom she felt was a stabbing pain behind her left eye, followed by an increasing sense of disconnection from her body. As she moved around her apartment, she felt that she was unusually conscious of having to direct the muscles in her legs. Normal levels of light and sound seemed unnaturally bright and loud. Taylor says she started to guess that her symptoms must have had a neurological cause, but that the constant babble of her mind’s inner voice had gone strangely silent. At first, she was unable to diagnose herself and was distracted with a growing sense of oneness with the world. It was only when her right arm ceased to function that she realized she was having a stroke.

(Shortform note: There are several medical and neurological conditions with symptoms that can mimic those of a stroke. These conditions include epilepsy, brain tumors, and biochemical imbalances. Because as many as one in five potential stroke cases are in fact something else, it’s important for doctors to make the correct diagnosis before treatment. If you or someone close to you is experiencing neurological symptoms, though, do not “wait and see” if they go away. Of the many stroke symptom acronyms to remember, the most on-point is probably _BE FAST: Balance, Eyes, Face, Arms, Speech, Time to call emergency services_.)

Taylor reports that her immediate reaction was an unexpected sense of pleasure at being able to watch a stroke from the inside out. However, her dying left brain insisted that she had to get help. Unfortunately, **she couldn’t use the phone to call for an ambulance because she’d lost the ability to comprehend numbers.** Concentration grew painful, but her right brain offered feelings of peace and blissful tranquility. During her lucid moments, which grew further apart, she devised a plan to call a colleague at work. Because she’d dialed his extension many times, some of that memory was stored in her right brain as the pattern that the numbers formed on the phone’s touchpad.

Nevertheless, it took many tries to pull the right sequence of numbers from her thoughts and scribble them down with her left hand. (Taylor is right-handed, but her right hand was useless.) Because her right brain could still think in pictures, she had to go through the painstaking process of matching the shape of the numbers she’d written to the shape of the numbers on the phone. She was unable to speak when her colleague answered, but he was able to deduce she was in trouble and arranged for an ambulance to come to her rescue. Once she was on her way to the hospital for treatment, Taylor says that she lost any sense of her body, and her mind completely shut down.

(Shortform note: Taylor was acutely aware that time was of the essence in minimizing the damage to her brain. Proper medical treatment must begin as soon after a stroke as humanly possible. For this reason, if you’re with someone having a stroke, help keep them awake, don’t give them food or drink (the stroke may impair their ability to swallow), don’t give them any medication, and wait for first responders. To be effective, stroke treatment must begin within a few hours of the onset of symptoms, but it cannot begin until the stroke has been diagnosed and imaged with a CT scan. Only when the type and location of the stroke have been identified can doctors determine the appropriate treatment.)

#### After the Stroke

On the afternoon of the day of her stroke, Taylor woke to an entirely different sense of awareness than she’d ever felt before. Though her left brain was dying and in shock, her right brain was fully aware and cognizant. Taylor recounts the experience of being in the world from a purely right-brain perspective and how it affected her physically, emotionally, and intellectually.

Her first sensation was a tremendous amount of pain, and not just in her head. Her senses seemed extremely sharp, so that every sound, light, and touch was nearly too much to bear. Beyond that, she realized that she no longer had any sense of her body’s physical boundaries. Instead, she felt like a liquid part of a universal continuum that included everything around her. Taylor recalls that she perceived herself as a being of energy tied to a painful material husk, and her energy was severely depleted. Every interaction with other people in the hospital threatened to drain her energy even more, prompting a desire to withdraw inside herself.

(Shortform note: Some of the sensations Taylor describes, such as an overwhelming feeling of peace and a sense of disconnection from her own body, are similar to those reported by people who’ve had near-death experiences and complex partial seizures in which portions of the brain go dormant while others remain fully active. Likewise, people who’ve taken psychedelic drugs report a weakened sense of self and a feeling of connection with everything around them. Because certain psychedelics, such as psilocybin and DMT, can reduce neural inflammation and promote neuroplasticity, doctors are currently exploring the possibility of using psychedelics as a recovery treatment for stroke survivors.)

However, Taylor also remembers feeling a great sense of peace between moments of painful intrusions from the world. **Her left brain had shut down, but her right brain was fully active and conscious.** Because the right hemisphere doesn’t perceive time, she experienced her existence fully “in the moment,” with no memory of the past. In that sense, she had regressed to the nonverbal mental state of an infant who lives in a perpetual “now.” Because her right brain was fully engaged, she was very aware of the body language of the people around her. If they were gentle and caring, they restored her sense of energy, but if they were anxious or hurried, she felt they depleted what reserves she had left.

(Shortform note: Connecting with other people’s emotions and feeling them yourself is a real biological process. In _The Whole Brain Child_ , Siegel and Bryson identify specific cells called **mirror neurons** that reflect and absorb the actions and emotions you see expressed around you. For example, if you see someone near you get angry, your mirror neurons activate as if _you’re_ the one who’s angry. When Taylor’s left brain was damaged, she lost the cognitive ability to differentiate between others’ feelings and her own. If her mirror neurons reflected the tenderness or anxiety of the people around her without the filter of her left brain’s sense of self, it may have heightened her sensitivity to those feelings.)

Taylor says she was struck by the silence she now experienced in her mind. She recognized that her brain was no longer functioning normally, but without her left brain’s sense of ego, she didn’t feel any grief. With very little access to language, when someone spoke she had to absorb each word as an individual unit and puzzle them together in a painstaking process. Without her left brain’s ability to catalog and order her sensations, she had to focus on each individual sense and make a concerted effort to identify what every incoming signal told her. Interacting with the world was a painful distraction from the deep, inner calm that her right brain continued to offer as an alternative.

(Shortform note: Taylor’s description of her stroke is vivid, but it isn’t the only post-stroke account, nor is it descriptive of every stroke experience. The CDC, AARP, and the Stroke Awareness Foundation offer stories from a variety of stroke survivors, including those of a man whose first symptoms were cramps in his left arm and leg, an attorney who experienced a series of mini-strokes, and a businessman whose gut instincts warned him that his symptoms were more serious than his emergency room doctors initially believed.)

#### Recovery Begins

Despite the temptation to sink into the bliss of mental silence, Taylor understood how important it was to keep her mind active in order to have any chance of regaining her cognitive abilities. During the immediate post-stroke recovery period, she focused on maintaining her energy, challenging her language skills, and strengthening her body and mind enough to undergo a surgery to remove the mass of blood that had congealed in her head.

Taylor explains that the doctors and nurses who treated her weren’t cognizant at all of how their interactions depleted her energy, so she took responsibility for managing her reserves. If hospital staff treated her gently, she would respond and cooperate with what they wanted. However, if they were forceful and taxing, she would ignore them as much as she could. She discovered that **sleep was the most important factor in restoring her energy levels** , so she learned to respect her body’s need for rest.

(Shortform note: Even for people who haven’t suffered brain trauma, sleep is vital to human cognition. In _Brain Rules_ , biologist John Medina explains that in addition to maintaining your biological rhythms, sleep plays a role in encoding information into memory, helping you retain what you learned while awake by solidifying new cognitive pathways. He says that sleep also lets the brain flush out toxic chemicals that build up throughout the day, creating a fresh mental slate with which to process even more information when you wake.)

Unlike sleep, the act of thinking was a great drain on Taylor’s energy, but she knew that keeping her brain active was also vital to the recovery process. To exercise her mind, Taylor worked to regain control of her body and her ability to speak, but even the simplest of tasks, such as walking or speaking simple words, were too much to tackle all at once. Taylor describes the process she went through to break every physical or mental action down into its smallest possible steps.

She uses the example of getting out of bed, for which she first had to master the skill of rocking back and forth. Once she could rock her body in successively greater increments, she could then move on to the next step of rolling into an upright position. For mental tasks, her caregivers focused on multiple-choice questions, rather than simple yes-or-no answers, as a means to reactivate her dormant mental connections.

(Shortform note: In _Brain Rules_ , Medina says that even the act of paying attention to something is a multistep process, much like getting out of bed. Different parts of the brain must activate in sequence—alerting you to stimuli, orienting your awareness toward it, then engaging your higher brain functions. He argues that splitting your focus doesn’t work, especially in situations when concentration is vital. Attempting to multitask presents the brain with a constant stream of interruptions, after which the attention process must repeat itself again and again. For Taylor, focused concentration was absolutely essential because she had to relearn every step of every process she’d previously taken for granted.)

It was important for Taylor to regain as much energy and cognitive function as she could to improve her chances of successfully coming through a surgery that was needed to repair her AVM and remove the mass of blood from her left hemisphere. At that point, says Taylor, only some of her brain cells had died, but many more were still in a state of shock. While the surgery was needed to prevent further damage, it ran the risk of taking away her capacity for language or bodily control completely. Nevertheless, two weeks after her stroke, Taylor’s surgery was a success. When she woke afterward, she felt emotionally lifted, and she retained the power of speech she’d worked so hard to regain.

(Shortform note: While any surgery comes with an amount of risk, operating on the brain is especially dangerous. Potential side effects include mental impairment, swelling, bleeding, infection, and another stroke. As part of the recovery process, doctors have to continually assess the patient’s neurological and physical functions, as well as take measures to ensure that harmful blood clots don’t form. Once released, the patient and their caregivers must be alert for signs of worsening cognition or physical pain that may warrant a return to the hospital.)

Surgery didn’t guarantee that Taylor would regain enough of her cognitive abilities to function as a fully independent person. In fact, it took eight years of dedicated work—rebuilding memories, vocabulary, motor functions, and scientific knowledge—for Taylor to reach the point where she considered herself to be fully recovered from her stroke. Some of that work included reconstructing her memories of the stroke in light of her restored left-brain functions.

Taylor is careful to point out that how she defines “recovery” is subjective. She hasn’t regained every skill, memory, or emotional response, and some of that has been deliberate. As she relearned who she was and how to live, **the stroke gave her the opportunity to choose who this new version of herself would be** and to leave behind parts of her previous life that she didn’t want anymore.

(Shortform note: Though Taylor eschews standardized stroke recovery timelines, the medical community offers guidelines to manage expectations for stroke survivors and their caregivers. Johns Hopkins Hospital suggests that the first three months are crucial for healing and recovery, while improvements will proceed more slowly after six months from the stroke. Physical therapist Signe Brunnstrom established a series of benchmarks used to determine progress in body coordination and mobility. The Stroke Recovery Foundation provides a cognitive and emotional to-do list for recovery without attaching time expectations.)

### Lessons Learned

Though recovering from her stroke was a long, arduous, and often painful process, Taylor says she decided to view her stroke and recovery as a gift. Her experience taught her valuable lessons about the inner workings of the mind that she wanted to share with others. These include the insight that **understanding your mind lets you change the way you think** , take responsibility for your emotional responses, and tap into the well of inner calm and peace that we all have embedded in the wiring of our brains.

#### Take Charge of Your Thoughts and Emotions

The first life lesson Taylor learned in the process of rebuilding her cognitive functions was that it was entirely up to her which parts of her past she reclaimed or left behind. Taylor argues that she’s living proof of the plasticity of the human mind—that who you were in the past doesn’t strictly define who you can be in the future. She highlights the differences she discovered between her left and right hemispheres in terms of personality and emotion, and she suggests that if you’re aware of how your different hemispheres influence your mental state, **you can make the deliberate choice to control your thoughts and emotional processes.**

(Shortform note: In _The Brain That Changes Itself_ , Norman Doidge argues that neuroplasticity is a blessing and a curse when it comes to reframing your emotional responses. It’s only because of your brain’s plastic nature that you’re able to reshape your ways of thinking, but since your brain reallocates unused space, any neural paths you’re not used to using may be appropriated by other mental functions. For example, if you’ve formed the habit of viewing time spent with your family in a negative light, then the mental circuits for _enjoying_ time with your family might have been directed elsewhere, such as enjoying a hobby or sport.)

For Taylor, this truth was thrown into stark relief when her stroke forced her completely into right-brain thinking for a significant period of time. As she worked to regain her left hemisphere’s functions, Taylor felt when the left brain’s emotional patterns began to resurface, and she questioned whether she wanted to bring all of her old personality back. After all, it became clear to her that her right hemisphere was the source of many of her positive emotions, such as happiness and empathy, while her left side had housed her anger and judgmental tendencies.

(Shortform note: Despite Taylor’s subjective experience, a survey of neurological research studies shows little support for the theory that specific classes of emotions originate in different parts of the brain. Instead, the data support the view that emotions arise from networks of cells located throughout all areas of the brain. Further research shows that prior studies were flawed because they were conducted primarily on right-handed people. As discussed in the earlier section on brain lateralization, left- and right-handedness has been shown to signify different arrangements of cognitive functions between the left and right hemispheres.)

Taylor says that some of our “negative” feelings are intricately linked with the left brain’s cognitive functions, such as assigning cause and effect to sensory information. However, when growing into her new sense of self, Taylor worked to disentangle her higher left-brain functions from her old self’s previously ingrained emotional cycles. When she recognized judgmental or anxious thought patterns forming, she made the conscious choice to redirect her mind and frame her thoughts in a more calming light, which helped to create _new neural pathways_ to replace the ones that existed before. In many ways, she was becoming a whole new person, and she learned to be deliberate about which pieces of her old life she kept or left behind.

(Shortform note: Taylor’s system of self-reconstruction is similar to the therapeutic practice of Internal Family Systems (IFS), as described by psychologist Richard Schwartz in _No Bad Parts_. In IFS, your mind is treated not as a single unit, but as a multiplicity of competing “selves,” almost like a family of personalities with complicated interpersonal dynamics. The goal of the practice isn’t to excise unwanted traits, but to untangle your disparate selves from each other and take conscious control of your emotional life.)

##### The Root of Negativity

Taylor explains that strong emotions arise in the “animal brain” of your limbic system, which responds to stimuli faster than your right or left brain can process information and floods your brain with chemicals to put you in “freeze, fight, or flight” mode. However, those chemicals are flushed out of your system in approximately 90 seconds and any emotions you continue to feel are entirely in the realm of your higher brain functions. By this point, you’ve often unconsciously chosen to let your initial reaction continue, _feeling_ it with your right brain and _justifying_ it with your left. While Taylor was rebuilding her reactions from scratch, she realized that if you’re aware of this process, you can choose to short-circuit it and elect a more balanced response.

(Shortform note: The limbic system serves many more functions than Taylor describes, such as triggering the brain’s reward system, storing and retrieving memories, and managing the body’s autonomic functions. Taylor doesn’t cite any scientific studies to back her claim that the limbic system’s chemicals fade after 90 seconds, nor does she identify which chemicals she means. Adrenaline, for example, can stay in the body for up to an hour. Nevertheless, Taylor’s “90-second rule” has become a touchstone for therapists, who tout it as a powerful technique to promote self-control, deal with stress, and build emotional resilience.)

It helps to become mindful of how emotions manifest themselves in your body. By becoming aware that certain emotions were physically upsetting, Taylor learned that she could avoid those emotions. Doing so led to the realization that **how she felt from moment to moment was entirely her own decision.** This is where the left brain comes into play, with its constant stream of internal dialogue. Taylor’s inner voice slowly returned as she exercised her language skills, and she learned that she could talk to herself about the way she felt. Instead of letting your own inner voice spin stories that reinforce resentment and anger, Taylor suggests that you can use your self-talk to draw a line between which emotions are helpful and which are destructive.

> **Emotional Self-Regulation**
> 
> In _How Emotions Are Made_ , Lisa Feldman Barrett goes a step further than Taylor and suggests that “feelings” and “emotions” are two separate things. _Feelings_ , she says, are your body’s internal signals, such as pleasure or discomfort. _Emotions_ , on the other hand, are mental constructs created by your brain to give your feelings meaning. Like Taylor, Barrett argues that you can consciously manage your emotional responses, both for your sake and the well-being of others around you.
> 
> Though 21st-century neuroscience has confirmed the brain’s ability to rewire its emotional responses, the idea has been around since at least the fifth century BCE. In _Happy_ , Derren Brown extols the ancient Greek philosophies of the Epicureans and the Stoics, both of whom cited taking responsibility for your emotions as a cornerstone to happiness and life. In _The Art of Happiness_ , the Dalai Lama explains a comparable Buddhist process of cultivating happiness through consciously examining and retraining your thoughts and emotions.

That’s not to say that you should never feel emotions like anger, sadness, or regret, but only that you should do so consciously, so that those emotions don’t control your life. Taylor says it’s particularly useful to give yourself a 90-second break whenever you feel a strong emotional reaction. That allows you time for the limbic system’s chemicals to wash out of your system, after which you can consciously decide on the appropriate emotional response. If it’s necessary to indulge a painful emotion so that it doesn’t go unresolved, Taylor proposes setting aside a specific block of time to feel it, and then telling yourself it’s okay to let it go.

(Shortform note: In _Emotional Intelligence_ , Daniel Goleman gives other practical tips on dealing with feelings such as anger, fear, and grief, but he highlights the importance of being aware of your emotions first. He presents _managing_ your emotions as a preferable alternative to _fighting_ them, which consumes even more energy. He lists the pros and cons of repressing unwanted emotions—some people do it through healthy self-management, while others are simply out of touch with themselves. He does suggest that repressing emotions has been linked to heightened neural activity in the left hemisphere of the brain.)

#### Find Peace Inside You

Beyond our capacity for taking control of our emotional lives, Taylor says the most important lesson her stroke taught her was that **a deep sense of peace and connection with the world is hardwired into the human brain,** if only we can learn to engage it. She describes the overwhelming feelings of peace and connection she experienced during and after her stroke, and she gives advice on how to engage that mental process without having to go through the ordeal of a stroke.

When Taylor’s stroke silenced the left side of her brain, she felt a deep, abiding sense of calm that was separate from her ego or the confines of her physical form (both of which are defined by left-brain perceptions). With only her right-brain processing to guide her, she saw and felt herself and the world as a flow of energy, not as simple matter. Because she’d lost her perception of time, Taylor concludes that **peaceful awareness lies in the right hemisphere’s perception of the present moment,** not in the left brain’s remembrance of the past or ambitions for the future. While she worked to bring her left hemisphere back from its trauma, Taylor was determined not to lose sight of the sense of peace and connection she’d discovered.

(Shortform note: In _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown discusses focusing your thoughts on the present in the context of managing time, energy, and resources. He argues that when you ignore the future in favor of what’s most important in the present, you’ll be more relaxed and time will move more slowly. Just as Taylor did when she rebuilt her cognitive functions, McKeown recommends devoting your energy to one task at a time without worrying about the next. He even advocates putting your brain on “pause” when you’re distracted, taking a quick time out, and letting go—much like Taylor’s method of dealing with unwelcome emotions.)

Taylor insists that she didn’t develop feelings of inner peace because of her stroke—they’d been there all along, inside her right brain, but she’d been distracted by the nonstop verbal chatter of her left hemisphere. Just as many meditation experts suggest, you can achieve that sense of peace if you can learn to quiet your thoughts. The process entails slowing your mind, listening to your thoughts, learning which ones trigger negative cycles, and encouraging those that foster calmness, empathy, and joy. It may take lots of practice to quiet your inner voice, but if you do you’ll find a wellspring of compassion and contentment that’s been hidden in your brain’s right hemisphere.

(Shortform note: Consciously slowing and quieting your thoughts is a skill that takes time and practice, but it can be achieved. In _Mindfulness in Plain English_ , Bhante Gunaratana differentiates between being aware of a thought and thinking it. In meditation, the idea isn’t to stop thoughts completely, but to notice them when they occur and let them pass. Gunaratana says that a thoughtless state of mind is as detrimental as one that’s continually distracted. The practice of mindfulness meditation encourages letting go of your ego and the barriers you put up between yourself and the world, and it does so in a gentler way than what Taylor experienced with her stroke.)

### What Stroke Survivors Need

While every stroke will be somewhat different, depending on which parts of the brain are most affected, Taylor’s experience provides an important guide to how doctors and loved ones can help stroke survivors cope with the realities of their new lives. People should be mindful of stroke patients’ energy levels, their need for positive reassurance, and the importance that caregivers maintain their belief that stroke patients _will_ recover, while celebrating every step along the way.

Taylor makes it clear in her description of her stroke that her energy levels quickly plummeted and were difficult to maintain during recovery. For someone whose brain has been traumatized like hers was, anything that requires concentration is draining. This includes _any_ personal interaction. **It’s important that doctors and caregivers be careful about the demands they make on stroke survivors’ time and energy.** Rest is crucial both to healing and recharging, and it has to be taken as the body demands, not forced to conform to family members’ needs or the schedule of doctors making rounds.

> **Allostasis: The Brain’s Unsung Duty**
> 
> One function of the brain that’s taken for granted but rarely discussed is _allostasis_ —the process by which the brain budgets and allocates the body’s energy usage. In _Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain_ , Lisa Feldman Barrett calls allostasis the brain’s single most important function. Through allostasis, the brain goes so far as to adjust your sensory perceptions in order to regulate energy usage. It does this by drawing on past experience to create the sensations your body needs in order to regulate temperature, food intake, and threat response.
> 
> Energy management is especially important when healing from brain trauma, since the brain accounts for 20% of your daily energy usage. Our brains use twice as much energy as those of our closest evolutionary cousins, chimpanzees, but studies show that it’s not because of our relative intelligence. Rather, the determining factor seems to be the size of the brain in relation to the body—marmosets have a similar proportion of brain-energy usage to that of humans.
> 
> In _What Is Health?_ , Peter Sterling argues that allostasis can fail when the body is stressed for extended periods (such as by fast-paced urban lifestyles on our Stone Age hunter-gatherer bodies). The result is higher energy demands that trigger a shift in what the brain considers “normal.” Damaged allostasis expresses itself in hypertension, depression, addictive behaviors, and many other modern ills. Properly functioning allostasis, on the other hand, is crucial for healing the brain and the body.

Doctors and family members should also be aware that while a stroke survivor may be nonverbal, they might still be fully conscious and sensitive to their emotional environment. Taylor acknowledges that being around someone who’s had a stroke can be stressful, but she warns that a stroke survivor can pick up on that stress and may strongly react to others’ negative emotions. **What stroke patients need most is to be treated with gentleness, compassion, patience, and respect.** Doing so can help give them the necessary courage and feelings of support to face the difficult challenge of recovery.

(Shortform note: Responding to a stroke survivor with empathy—a sense of connection and understanding—rather than sympathy, which conflates sadness and pity, can put you in a painfully vulnerable position, so much that people who deal with it regularly can suffer from compassion fatigue. However, in _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach advocates accepting your own pain in order to show true compassion for others—a compassion that reinforces your connection and helps you give support to those in your life who need it.)

Recovery itself doesn’t adhere to any timetable and will take different shapes for different people. Arbitrary benchmarks and schedules should be ignored, and **every step forward should be celebrated** in order to give the stroke survivor the encouragement needed to keep going. Taylor points out that it’s important to remember that the person who recovers after a stroke will not be the same person they were before. Friends and family need to cherish the person they become rather than dwell on the person who was lost. In addition, Taylor says that what’s most encouraging of all is to **always treat the person you love as if you’re certain they’re going to recover.** That, in itself, may be the ultimate boost they need.

(Shortform note: Because stroke recovery is a difficult process fraught with challenges and setbacks, it’s important to help stroke survivors maintain a positive outlook. In _The Happiness Advantage_ , Shawn Achor argues that such an outlook is a mental habit that can be learned through practice. The benefit of such a habit is the self-perpetuating cycle it creates. A positive mindset reinforces itself by recognizing and grabbing opportunities for progress. In addition to celebrating each success, as Taylor says, such a mindset increases feelings of gratitude and connection to a wider community of support.)
