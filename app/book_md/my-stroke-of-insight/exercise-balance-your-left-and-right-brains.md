## Exercise: Balance Your Left and Right Brains

Taylor writes that the mental wiring for compassion, connection, acceptance, and inner peace already exists in your brain’s neural patterns, but that your left brain’s rational, judgmental nature often gets in the way.

Remember a time and place in your life when you felt most at peace with yourself and the world. Describe the setting and what you were doing. If you close your eyes, take a deep breath, and place yourself back in that moment, what feelings does the memory evoke?

Remember a time when you were angry with yourself. What story did you tell yourself about the situation? Thinking back, were you overly self-critical? If another person was in the same situation, what would you say to show them more compassion than you showed to yourself?

You’ve just explored the peaceful side and the critical side of your brain. How did you feel about the experience of shifting between the two? If you could switch between the two modes at will, as Taylor suggests you can learn to do with practice, how might you use that to improve your well-being?
