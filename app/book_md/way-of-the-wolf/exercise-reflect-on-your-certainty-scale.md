## Exercise: Reflect on Your Certainty Scale

For every decision, your certainty about what to do falls somewhere on a scale of 1-10, with 1 as most uncertain and 10 as totally certain. As you work through information and emotions, your certainty moves up or down on the scale.

* * *

Recall a recent decision you made to buy something significant—for example, an appliance, clothing, a car, electronics, or even a pet. What was your certainty level between 1-10 on the product, salesperson, and company or brand?

What factors moved you to a 10 on each of the three scales—for example, did your research on the brand or the salesperson’s pitch make a difference?

What roles did each of the two types of certainty— logical and emotional—play in your decision to buy?

Try going through this exercise again, but this time, analyze a decision you made _against_ buying something. What was the key difference between the two situations?
