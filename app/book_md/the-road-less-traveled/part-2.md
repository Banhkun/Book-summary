## Part 2: Love

The last chapter was about discipline, and the four tools used to practice it. To grow spiritually, you need to be willing to confront reality, and discipline supports you in doing that. But what motivates discipline?

According to Peck, developing your will to love is how you improve your relationship to discipline, which then enhances your ability to confront reality. In this chapter, we’ll discuss myths about love, what genuine love is, how genuine love supports spiritual growth, and how to act with it.

**To genuinely love is to be willing to stretch the boundaries of your “self” to support your or another’s spiritual evolution.** Before we can explore what love is in greater depth, we first need to understand the myths around it.

### Myth #1: Love Is a Feeling

What seems to be love can often be some other motivating force or emotion (for simplicity, let’s call this force _nonlove_). This is because there is a misconception that “falling in love” is genuine love or a manifestation of it. In fact, falling in love is simply an experience we feel intensely. There is a feeling of “I love you,” but it’s not a feeling based in reality.

#### Why Isn’t “Falling in Love” Genuine Love?

One reason falling in love isn’t genuine love is that it’s linked to erotic feelings. We only fall in love when the underlying motivation is sexual in nature. Additionally, the feeling of falling in love is impermanent and chemical.

#### Why Is Falling Out of Love Inevitable?

Love as a feeling occurs when you find a person or object you are attracted to and committed to beyond your ego boundaries. This process is called _cathexis_. To “cathect” someone is to become invested in them in a way that pulls you outside of yourself. Paradoxically, when you stretch outside of yourself to invest in a person (or thing), you also incorporate them into yourself. This creates a bond. Once something has been cathected, you see it as an extension of yourself.

  * Cathecting is not love because it can occur with any object, not just sentient beings.
  * Cathecting doesn’t mean you care about the other person’s spiritual growth, which is a defining component of “true” love. In fact, a dynamic built on cathexis often causes one person to fear the growth of the other, because that would threaten the unstable security of the bond. 
  * You can decathect just as quickly as you cathect, and a person who has loving feelings shouldn’t always act on them. For example, if you’re in a relationship, and you meet someone you feel loving feelings towards, if you value your relationship, you should not act on those feelings. 
  * Furthermore, not being able to distinguish genuine love from nonlove is the basis for deception (of ourselves and others), because you may justify behavior that ultimately isn’t loving. For example, let’s say someone who is experiencing chemical love hits the object of that “love” out of jealousy. This is not a loving action. 



#### The Truth: Love Is an Act of Will

**Love as action occurs when you do what is best for the higher growth of others, whether or not you feel a sensation of love for them (cathexis).** You can be loving towards people for whom you have no loving feelings. The distinction is passivity versus action. “Desire” on its own is passive. “Will” is a form of desire, but unlike pure desire, it’s actionable. In other words, desire is, “I _want_ to be good to you,” whereas will is, “I _will_ be good to you.”

Genuine love requires committed action, and this requires discipline. We choose to commit because we understand that not committing will have a harmful effect on the growth of the relationship, but more importantly, the growth of the individuals in it.

For example, commitment is crucial in a therapy dynamic. A patient has to know the therapist is committed to being there throughout the therapeutic growth process. In this context, commitment is demonstrated by the therapists’ willingness to do their job whether they feel like it or not. In the context of a romantic relationship, commitment is demonstrated by each partner’s willingness to show up for the relationship even if they don’t feel like it.

As you will learn in Part 4, genuine love is a force rooted in evolution. When you truly love someone, you extend your limits to accommodate, receive, or support them, which expands your own growth. Furthermore, spiritual growth requires discipline, so if you don’t have the discipline to accommodate your own growth, you won’t be able to extend that discipline to nurturing the growth of others through love.

### Myth #2: Love Is Dependency

The second most common myth about love is that love and dependency are the same. _Dependency_ is being unable to feel a sense of wholeness without the certainty that someone else is going to care for you. **Freedom and choice are not present in dependency, because dependency is based on need.** When you need another person in order to survive, that is a parasitic dynamic, and in an otherwise healthy adult, a type of mental illness. That being said, we can differentiate dependency from “dependency needs” or feelings. We all want to be nurtured. The problem occurs when those needs run your life.

_A passive dependent personality disorder_ is characterized by dependency on others to the point that you spend all your energy seeking to be loved or nurtured, leaving you empty of the energy necessary to give genuine love (to yourself or others). Commonalities amongst sufferers:

  * They become bottomless pits, always empty, needing, and never satisfied.
  * They can’t be alone and are defined by relationships.
  * They have intense but shallow relationships because they are based on need rather than genuine intimacy.
  * They don’t care who they are dependent on, as long as they have someone filling the emptiness.
  * They are focused on what other people can give to them, and not what they can give to themselves.
  * They have no real sense of identity.



Increased dependency means decreased freedom. Consider the wife who “cannot drive,” and her husband who drives her around everywhere in his spare time. There is a sense of security for both of them because of mutual dependence. He is secure because she needs him, and she is secure because she is being taken care of. But this is not a healthy relationship, nor is it one rooted in real love. People in healthy relationships have habits that encourage mutual independence (like trading off with chores, or routine tasks like picking up the kids from school).

**Dependency impedes spiritual growth because the priority of the dependent person is always meeting their own needs.** Growth is neither the motivation nor the goal. Any relationship dynamic based on need is not genuine love. For example, we tend to think we love our pets, but they can’t communicate their thoughts or feelings to us, and they are dependent on us for survival. We have simply cathected them. Not only can we project anything we want onto them, but we can also control them. We sometimes even get rid of pets who have a will that we cannot control (or at least send them to obedience school).

Similarly, you are experiencing cathexis when you are only willing to be loving towards people if they behave the way you want. For example, you should be wary of a partner who treats you like a child or a pet. It’s possible their loving behavior will become dependent on you playing the role they want (no will of your own, no strength, no independent needs, and so on).

#### The Truth: Love Is Interdependence

**Genuine love is rooted in freedom of choice.** It means knowing you are capable of living without someone, but choosing them anyway. Additionally, genuine love is not just about being giving. Genuine love asks that you use your best judgment to determine when it is healthy to give, and when it might be healthier to withhold.

To foster interdependence in your relationships means to set strong boundaries (which at first will feel aggressive if you are used to suppressing your needs to meet the needs of others). For example, you’re nurturing interdependence when you tell a family member that they are not entitled to your space and need to knock before entering your bedroom.

### Myth #3: Love Is Self-Sacrifice

When you think love is self-sacrifice, you end up with two problematic results.

#### Result #1: “Love” Becomes Social Sadomasochism

Social sadomasochism is the unconscious desire to hurt or be hurt emotionally in interpersonal relationships. Sometimes, when we continually accept mistreatment, we do so because we are getting something out of that experience. For example, if we are mistreated in childhood, in adulthood, we may become attached to the moral superiority of our role in an abusive dynamic. We may also accept mistreatment in the name of “being loving,” seeking to martyr ourselves. Regardless, the motivation for these behaviors isn’t genuine love. In reality, we’re seeking a type of revenge on the people who first made us feel mistreated (generally our parents), and the behavior is motivated by something closer to hatred.

Consider the woman who repeatedly goes back to an abusive partner as long as they beg for another chance. On the surface, she speaks about the suffering of mistreatment, but on a deeper level, she may put up with it because it makes her feel like “the good guy.” In order to maintain that sense of self, she needs her partner to be “the bad guy.” The partner begging for another chance serves that goal because they highlight (if only for a moment) her moral superiority.

#### Result #2: “Love” Becomes Destructive Nurturing

In destructive nurturing, the nurturer is wearing a mask of love, but their deeper intention is to ensnare another in codependency in order to meet their own needs (not maliciously, but out of a need to be needed).

**Anytime you consider what you are doing to be “for” someone, you are not taking full accountability for your own choices.** Parents who tell their children they aren’t grateful enough for everything being done for them could be lacking in genuine love, because if they feel resentful towards their children for being “ungrateful,” their loving behavior may not be coming from healthy intentions. What you choose to do for others is often done to fulfill your own needs. As stated before, this is not necessarily malicious. We engage in loving behavior because it feels good and right to be loving. Generally the effect of that behavior is positive for the person receiving it as well.

#### The Truth: Love Is Self-Replenishment

Love should not be martyrdom or masochism. Genuine love requires an extension of the self, not a total sacrifice of it. The goal is to self-replenish. It’s not that genuine love is unselfish, and nonlove is selfish. Genuine love can be both selfish and unselfish. The difference is that with nonlove, the goal is anything but spiritual growth, whereas, with genuine love, the overall goal is always spiritual growth.

### Myth #4: Love Is Effortless

Put simply, we tend to expect love to be easy, believing it shouldn’t require work (and that if it does, it’s not “true love”).

#### The Truth: Love Is Effortful

Love can be measured by effort and energy. You can only expand your limits through deliberate effort. Love is supposed to take effort, and effort requires attention.

Being a good listener is the best way to demonstrate attentiveness. When you genuinely love someone, you listen as an act of love. You determine that the person is valuable to you, and you invest your will to love in the form of attention. As a listener, you are both giving and receiving. This is true for the speaker, as well. That being said, it’s hard work. People who don’t listen well either don’t understand that it requires effort, or are not willing to commit that effort.

##### A Note on Parenting

With children, most listening approaches have some sort of merit. Sometimes kids need to be quiet, sometimes they need to chatter away and they don’t care who is listening. Sometimes it’s sufficient to make a few acknowledgments so they know you are there, other times they prefer to go in and out of communication which makes selective listening plenty. Other times it is essential that you listen fully. The difficulty of parenting is determining the proper balance of all these methods for your child’s particular set of needs. Why listen to children?

  * It demonstrates that they are valued, and feeling valued is crucial to the well being of your children as they grow.
  * The more valuable they feel, the more likely they are to share valuable things (they meet your expectation of their value).
  * Once you treat them with value, you will realize they truly do have value to share.
  * The more you listen to your child, the better you will be able to guide them, and the more they will value your guidance.
  * The more you value and respect your child as an individual, the more they will value and respect you in return.
  * This demonstrates mutual spiritual growth (mutual expansion of the self, for both parties).



These truths are not limited to parenting. **Listening with full attention is a critical act of genuine love for any type of relationship.** The best tool you have for practicing this is _bracketing_ , which requires you to temporarily set aside your “self” (belief systems, wants, needs, and so on) to create space for another person to connect with you and be fully received.

For example, let’s say you’re in an argument with your partner, they’re saying things that are triggering for you. You set aside your emotion to hear what is really being said. You’re using bracketing by temporarily setting your worldview aside to integrate new information into your knowledge bank. This allows you to temporarily accept others in their totality (as a result of setting your own self aside). It’s effective because people sense when they are being totally accepted and become willing to open up further. Bracketing can only be fueled by love, due to the immense effort it requires.

**Love, in all its forms, is discipline in action.** If you care about yourself or others, you will put forth your best effort to support mutual spiritual growth.

#### A Common Misconception About Emotions and Discipline

There is a widespread, erroneous belief that being disciplined means ignoring your feelings. In reality, feelings are meant to be used as tools. There are two traps we fall into when addressing our feelings.

##### Trap #1: No structure

We fall into this trap when we let our feelings run the show, setting no limits, and allowing them to make all our choices. This is destructive because it generally causes chaos.

##### Trap #2: Too much structure

We fall into this trap by strangling our feelings with too much control. We might repress them or punish ourselves for having them. The problem with this is that eventually we start to rebel against the rules and this causes the same chaos as the first trap.

##### Solution: Balance

The best way to handle your feelings is with measured discipline. With this method, you build security by being respectful of your feelings, asking yourself questions, giving yourself reassurance, and giving your emotions clear roles. It’s especially important to treat feelings of love with measured discipline because to overextend your capacity for love is to eventually cause harm to the spiritual growth of others. Why? You will not be able to show up with the presence or energy necessary to genuinely support anyone. For example, if you’re in a relationship, but you continually prioritize giving your energy to new and exciting friendships, you will not have the energy to give to the growth of your relationship.

##### A Note on Discernment

It’s important to determine if the person you wish to give genuine love to is able to support your spiritual growth the way you are able to support theirs. If they are not, then giving love will be a waste of your energy. Alternatively, there are some who have a greater capacity for love than others, and it is important that they love to their full capacity, rather than limit themselves. If you fall into this category, discipline is essential to be sure you do not spread your love too thin.

### Myth #5: Love Prioritizes Growth as a Couple

We often think there is one true soulmate meant for all of us, and once we meet them, we will live happily ever after. If the relationship with “the one” doesn’t work out, we think we made a mistake. It’s a lie that primarily serves the survival of our species (the myth entraps people in marriage, so they can have children and stay together long enough to raise them). Even when the magic has worn off in a relationship, and you have fallen out of love, you may likely still try to force that relationship to fit the myth. **Couples who do this value togetherness more so than growth and this is precisely what keeps them from growing after breakdowns in the dynamic of the relationship.**

In interpersonal relationships, there is often a failure to distinguish between the self and the other. In its most severe state, this inability to distinguish manifests as narcissism, which renders the narcissistic individual unable to connect with others outside the context of themselves. For example, parents who are narcissistic lack empathy and don’t give proper emotional support or validation. Their children grow up with little to no ability to understand or manage their emotions. This lack of healthy individuation creates conflict in all intimate relationships as the child ages, because they are unable to appreciate the separateness of others, and consequently unable to give or receive genuine love.

#### The Truth: Love Prioritizes Growth as an Individual

Genuine love always recognizes that there is a distinction between the self and the other. Furthermore, genuine love seeks to respect and honor that separation. It requires that both individuals embrace true mutual acceptance. That separateness is necessary to build or rebuild a healthy foundation for a long-lasting relationship. **In the context of spiritual evolution, a relationship is a supportive entity, meant to function as a respite where each individual can replenish while pursuing their own growth.**

##### A Note on Love and Ego Boundaries

Mystics believe that you can only truly experience reality when you give up your ego boundaries and become one with all of the universe. However, you need a solid awareness of your ego boundaries before you can release them (in other words, you need to know yourself before you can transcend yourself).

For example, infants are great at tuning in to oneness because they don’t yet have an ego. However, while the infant has no ego boundaries, and therefore is closer to reality, they are still defenseless without the care of adults and don’t have the ability to verbalize any wisdom they may have from living in that oneness. Clearly, their oneness is neither the result of spiritual growth nor an entirely good thing—their lack of boundaries and dependence on others threatens their survival. In contrast, because adults _do_ have ego boundaries, they have the opportunity to access the state of oneness and consciously use it to become fully present in reality, enriching their spiritual growth.

Cathexis love merges your identity with that of another, but this expansion of your ego boundary is too limited—it doesn’t truly connect you to reality, which is much bigger than your merged egos. Genuine love also expands your ego boundaries, but it takes you a step further and actually _dissolves_ your ego boundaries.

In sum, you need to be willing to make sacrifices to support your spiritual growth, and you are better equipped to do that when you embrace separateness. Genuine love uses that separateness to enhance each individual’s growth, which consequently also enhances the growth of the relationship and society at large. Eventually, once your ego boundaries have served their purpose, you’ll transcend them into oneness.

### The Risks of Love

Once you dispel the myths around love, you must then confront the risks you engage with when you pursue genuine love.

#### Risk #1: Loss

To love is to risk change, rejection, losing pieces of ourselves, abandonment, and more. Therefore, love requires the courage to risk loss (courage is the ability to take action even when experiencing fear).

When you avoid risk, you diminish yourself, and this diminishes your growth. For example, while cathexis is not love, it can still precede genuine love. A feeling of cathexis motivates you to extend yourself in egoic ways but still requires risk. Once you determine someone is important to you, you automatically risk loss or rejection. Additionally, when you cathect, pain is inevitable, because even if someone does not deliberately leave or reject you, all living things die, so you will experience loss no matter what. If you don’t have the courage to cathect anything, you are unlikely to have the will to sustain genuine love. **To love genuinely is to risk, to risk is to act with courage, and acting with courage requires discipline.**

##### A Note on the Parallel Between Loss, Love, Death, and Life

One might say that our relationship with death is what will determine our relationship with life, and all its most meaningful experiences. If you are afraid of death, if death is your enemy, you will fear all death, including the little deaths (losses and transitions) you experience through a fully lived life. Trying to avoid the pain inherent in real love will cause you to live a life that is devoid of meaning and fulfillment. If you can accept the reality of death and allow its wisdom to guide you, you can use your awareness of time being limited to live the most full, meaningful life possible.

#### Risk #2: Independence

The more you act with genuine love, the more risk you encounter, and no risk is greater than the risk of independence. To be independent is to take the minor and major steps necessary to establish yourself as an adult separate from your parents. What does this have to do with love? Discipline is needed to complete the steps towards independence, and discipline is fueled by self-love. Additionally, establishing independence is the enlargement of the self (a key aspect of genuine love). **If you value yourself, you will value living a life that is yours, and love fuels the courage you need to take these steps.**

It’s worth noting that the love messages you received from your parents will impact your ability to access courage. If your parents communicate to you that their love is based on approval, you will have great difficulty embracing a life that doesn’t match their desires. You may not take steps towards independence and stay fearfully stuck in a psychological state of childhood, living by values passed down from your parents, and ultimately living a life that is not your own. Fortunately, courage can be developed at any age. For example, maybe you’ve been in a 20-year marriage with a person who infantilizes you, and you divorce them to learn how to build a life you value.

Alternatively, if your parents communicate that you are loved for who you are no matter what, you will be more willing to take the risk of establishing independence. When you allow yourself to do so, you prepare yourself to experience higher levels of growth, and therefore you support yourself to deepen your experience of love. The greatest manifestations of love are created from accepting and embracing the freedom to choose the life you live.

#### Risk #3: Commitment

As we’ll see, many people view commitment as a risk. But first, why is commitment important? Commitment is the cornerstone of genuine love. Deep commitment is your greatest tool for ensuring the longevity of your relationships. If you care for the spiritual growth of another person, you recognize that consistency is required if that growth is to take place. For example, children cannot grow if they are always afraid their parents will abandon them. They need to know it is safe to grow. So it is with any relationship. **If you don’t make a commitment to the other person, they will not have the safety or endurance to work through difficult interpersonal issues.**

As discussed earlier, there are two directions you’re most likely to go when your upbringing isn’t based in consistent, genuine love: neuroticism (overly responsible) and character disorder (averse to responsibility). People with character disorders generally make shallow commitments. They understand the idea of commitment, but not the reality of it (likely because they did not see it demonstrated growing up). Neurotics _do_ understand commitment but are terrified of it. This is usually due to an experience in childhood of parents being committed initially, then retracting that commitment. The child experienced intense pain as a result of their own commitment to their relationship with their parents, and consequently, they are averse to commitment in adulthood. The neurotic can obtain healing only through a positive experience of commitment to counter the negative one.

If you did not experience a solid commitment from your parents in childhood, you may be an adult who now engages in the dance of leaving before you can be left. The closer you get to another person, the more prominent this defense mechanism may be. This is why commitment is critical in the therapeutic relationship. Patients only grow when they commit and trust the commitment of the therapist. Changing yourself, whether or not that occurs as a result of therapy, is an immense personal risk. Changing means having experiences that are new and unknown, and this kind of vulnerability can often be more terrifying than feeling physically unsafe. Additionally, there is always the risk that the fear will be too great, and you will fall back into old, more comfortable habits.

#### Risk #4: Confrontation

A huge risk you take when you genuinely love is the risk of confrontation. Confrontation is the exercising of power for the purpose of redirection. There are two kinds of confrontation you can engage in: toxic or loving.

_Toxic confrontation_ has an air of “I’m right, you’re wrong, and you should change.” It’s often impulsive, coming from anger or irritation, and full of self-righteous criticism. People who engage in toxic confrontation do so with the impulsive conviction that they are right, and the other person is wrong. Confrontation without genuine love is akin to thoughtlessly playing God and can be extremely destructive.

_Loving confrontation_ is characterized by the awareness that confronting someone you love means establishing yourself (temporarily) as superior to them. Lovingly confrontational people acknowledge and honor the other person’s individuality and engage in confrontation only after meticulous self-examination. They must determine if they truly understand the needs of their partner well enough to offer redirection, if their desire to confront is self-serving, and if they are seeing the situation clearly. Loving confrontation is also playing God, but with full awareness of the seriousness of that act, which allows it to be nourishing instead of toxic.

**A confrontation is an expression of leadership. Failing to confront when doing so would enhance spiritual growth is to miss an opportunity to act with genuine love.** It is the choice not to care. Loving confrontation redirects another person’s path for their greater good and therefore is rooted in genuine love. Regardless of the method, confrontation is necessary if we want to support the spiritual growth of the people we care about.

Exercising power for the purpose of redirection is not limited to confrontation, and it should be noted that confrontation is not always the best way to exercise power. Genuine love means expanding yourself to meet the other person where they’re at, and that may mean adjusting the way you communicate to match their needs. Confronting someone who isn’t ready to handle what you want to say can be pointless or even destructive. Sometimes gentler forms of redirection (like positive reinforcement, or storytelling, if kids are involved) are more appropriate.
