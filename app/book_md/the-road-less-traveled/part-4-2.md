## Part 4.2: Openness to Grace

To overcome the obstacles to spiritual growth, become open to grace.

Based on theology, grace has traditionally been defined in two ways. The first is the _Doctrine of Emanance_ , which is the notion that a god outside of ourselves passes grace down to us. The second is the _Doctrine of Immanence_ , which is the notion that grace exists within us as a manifestation of God. This is a paradox, and the issue with this paradox (or any paradox) is that we want to categorize the concept cleanly. This tendency makes us want to “make sense” of grace by determining whether it comes from God or comes from us. Truly, the relationship between us as individuals and the mystery of grace as it relates to God is an integrated one. Grace is an external force that is of God but nonetheless moves through us.

All manifestations of grace share the following:

  * They contribute to and protect the growth of the human spirit.
  * They make only partial sense (dreams) or completely defy the laws of nature (paranormal events). 
  * They occur frequently and universally.
  * They do not originate in the conscious mind, nor can they be deliberately summoned by the conscious will. 



These characteristics all can be explained as being an expression of the influence transcendent of human awareness and comprehension which exists to support the spiritual development of humanity, known as grace.

### Grace and Resistance

You have many tools available to you on the spiritual growth journey, but using them is a matter of discipline. **Your will to heal is what will determine your growth, and your openness to the tools of growth, including grace.** The determining factor for how much the tools impact your life is your level of commitment to using them. There are plenty of severely ill people who heal, and plenty of mildly ill people who do not. For some, no matter what is available to them, they are resistant to growth, and therefore none of the tools are put to effective use. The will to grow can be directly compared to the will to love, as love is defined as the will to extend yourself for growth. The influence of grace, which cannot be measured, represents God’s love. It is available to all, but not everyone is open to receiving it.

#### Why do we resist this loving grace?

If grace is a representation of love given by an external God who supports our spiritual growth, there is the question of why. What is the purpose of this evolution? It might be said that the purpose is to become our loving God, but we don’t like this idea, because it’s easier to believe in a God whose position is exalted above us and unattainable. To believe that we can access God’s position ourselves would ask of us an astronomical level of responsibility and effort. If we see God as nonexistent or hating, or untouchable in some way, we have no obligation to grow spiritually. We can live life at the most comfortable level, and not push ourselves to become our most loving, most responsible, or most competent selves.

Essentially, if we accept that we can become God, we will never be able to justify lack of effort again. The level of responsibility we give to God we would then be responsible for embodying ourselves. **The idea that God is encouraging our growth so that we can become God forces us to confront our greatest problem in life: our laziness.**

### Consequences of Rejecting Grace

To gain insight into the consequences of rejecting grace, consider the following truths:

  * Strong mental health occurs when you embrace reality and the pain of growth. 
  * Neurosis arises when you avoid reality and the pain of growth.
  * The impetus to embrace reality comes from the will of a loving God who wants you to spiritually evolve.
  * The impetus to avoid reality comes from the conscious will of the individual and is motivated by entropy.
  * Mental illness is the result of rejecting the will of God within you (growth fueled by love) in favor of your own individual will (stagnancy fueled by entropy).



To live your best possible life you must live it in accordance with reality to the best of your ability. Understanding reality requires rigorous internal and external examination and making adjustments where necessary. This process is difficult and painful. The more you use defense mechanisms to avoid the pain of seeing reality as it is, the less accurate your perception of reality. This can cause your actions to become unrealistic, and this will be apparent to those who observe you. These observers might then identify you as mentally ill, even if you yourself are convinced you are seeing reality accurately.

Your unconscious communicates this disconnect to you before the external observers do. Symptoms can include panic attacks, nightmares, depression, and so on. The unconscious, having full knowledge, tries to alert the conscious to the disconnect between the truth of reality and the denial of it. Only those willing to accept total responsibility for the symptoms of their mental illness will come to understand that the symptoms are a result of their conscious actions being out of alignment with their soul, recognize their occurrence as a manifestation of grace, and take action to heal themselves through deliberate effort towards growth.

### Evidence of Grace

One way to become more open to grace is to reflect on the evidence of its existence. What is the evidence of grace?

#### Evidence #1: Physical, Mental, and Spiritual Resilience

Psychology can explain exactly how mentally ill patients came to be mentally ill, but oftentimes there are patients who, based on their traumatic experiences, should be more severely mentally ill than they actually are. These people often, despite experiencing terrible traumas, grow, and excel immensely in their lives. Additionally, we know quite a bit about the causes of diseases that are physical, but not much about the causes of physical health. Why do some get sick while others remain healthy? The medical world calls this “resistance,” asserting that the body is simply defending itself well against illness. But why? How? When someone falls ill, can it be that the forces that often protect us simply failed to operate in this person?

How about automobile accidents in which the car is twisted into a pretzel but the occupant escapes unscathed? Alternatively, consider people who go through a series of unfortunate events and terrible things keep happening to them one after another. Why are they so accident-prone or subject to “bad luck?” Many explain survival as instinct, but while we know of instinct, we know little about what drives instinct. We tend to accept that instinct is a product of a mechanism from within the individual, initiated by external stimuli. However, we can’t explain how, when someone survives an accident that should have killed them, instinct as a mechanism could be the reason. Does the car instinctively protect the human? Does the human in the car instinctively mold their body so they’re unharmed?

On the subject of evil, for every evil experience, there are countless people who react to that evil by becoming enlightened. Experiences of evil expand your awareness and show you where not to go. **The miracle, therefore, is not in the failure of the resistance system in some, but the thriving of the resistance system in most.** For physical, mental, and spiritual health, it appears that there is a force that protects and facilitates our growth even after horrific experiences. We know little about how or why this is the case. However, it can be suggested that phenomena like freak accidents with no injuries might be explained by aspects of grace, such as synchronicity and the unconscious.

#### Evidence #2: Synchronicity

The _principle of synchronicity_ details the potential of unlikely occurrences that arise with unexplainable frequency and defy natural law. Timing is the most intriguing factor, as often these types of events occur at a time or with a frequency that is significant in some way.

_Serendipity_ is defined as the ability to locate meaningful, positive occurrences, and a skill you can hone to tune into manifestations of grace. **Occurrences of serendipity arise all the time, but most choose to view them as chance or coincidence and do not ascribe any deeper meaning or significance to them.** Because of this, we derive no value from them either. This relates directly to grace, as grace is specifically defined as something that is available to all, but not all are open to. If you don’t experience it, it is likely that you are not seeking it, or are not open to it arising.

For example, let’s consider the survival of a freak car accident. There is no natural law that demonstrates how a car could change form in such a way that the occupant remains unharmed, nor a law that demonstrates how the occupant could influence the car to change form in such a way that they remain unharmed. Despite this, somehow, the car and the occupant can change form in such a way that the occupant remains unharmed. This kind of event occurs a lot more often than can be explained by chance, and the timing seems to be a significant factor, which supports the principle of synchronicity.

A key characteristic of miracles, synchronicities, psychic phenomena, and so on is that most incidents appear to be positive or to benefit the experiencer(s) in some way. It’s possible just as many occurrences exist that are harmful, but it seems that there are more beneficial occurrences than malignant ones. It’s not necessary for these occurrences to be life-altering to qualify, often they simply offer avenues of improvement.

#### Evidence #3: The Unconscious

The unconscious makes up 95% of the human mind. Only 5% of our mind is conscious. The unconscious mind communicates to us in a variety of ways, the most commonly known being dreams, but also through random thoughts, emotional and physical symptoms of illness. One of the ways grace communicates directly to us is by popping up through the unconscious into our conscious awareness.

Dreams are an especially well-known form of unconscious communication (used heavily in psychotherapy) because generally, we all have them. Regardless of the nature of the dream, the information given to us seems always to be beneficial for our growth. When we are awake, we can also get some of these insights through being open to “idle thoughts” and images. These thoughts can either give us insight into ourselves, or insight into others.

The unconscious communicates information that supports us in the following ways:

  * Warnings to avoid potential missteps
  * Guidance for problems we’ve been struggling to solve
  * Confirmation that we are either right or wrong about something we’ve been contemplating.
  * Insights into our personality, wants, and needs. 
  * Guidance for the next steps we may need to take in our growth.



The main characteristic of information from the unconscious is the sense of it being unfamiliar and that it arrives without permission (or desire, at times). Because of this unwanted quality, traditional psychologists like Freud believed the unconscious mind was bad. With Freud’s patients, the feelings representing mental illness were discovered in the unconscious, so he determined that the unconscious mind itself was the cause of mental illness.

Another view considers that these “bad” feelings cause mental illness because they are repressed. The unconscious contains all that is beneath the surface and is the “truth” unfiltered. The conscious mind rejects negative feelings because it is too painful to accept and address them. Therefore, it is the conscious rejection and disowning of the feelings that cause the mental illness, not the unconscious itself. Jung believed that the wisdom we hold is passed down, and recent research indicates that this is true. **Knowledge can be stored inside cells, and the reality of this indicates that there are vast amounts of knowledge present in our brain matter that we do not readily access.** With this in mind, he rebranded the unconscious as a wealth of wisdom, able to give you key insights into yourself and your psyche.

The unconscious speaks to you through your own behavior, and if you embrace that, it can contribute to your growth. The way it speaks to you is through “slips” or “accidents” in things you say or do (also known as Freudian slips). It should be noted that these slips can be positive or negative. The unconscious contains all, and when there is a slip-up, it is simply the unfiltered truth, positive or negative. The conscious mind is always busy trying to hide from itself, and slips are the unconscious slipping through the cracks to consciousness. For example, in a therapy setting, it is actually the unconscious that is prepared to be most truthful, not the conscious (as demonstrated by exercises of free association and the resistance of some patients who undergo it).

#### Evidence #4: Evolution

Spiritual growth and individual evolution are indistinguishable, but while the spirit is limitless, the body is not. Physical bodies change throughout life but they don’t evolve. That being said, the process of physical evolution can give us insight into spiritual evolution and the mystery of grace.

Based on what we know of science and the universe, evolution itself is a miracle because the law of thermodynamics clearly indicates that the universe is always “winding down,” rather than expanding. It states that energy automatically devolves, demonstrating lower and lower differentiation, becoming naturally more disordered over time. Visually, you can compare this to a stream of water flowing downwards. It’s unnatural for the water to reverse course. It would take a great deal of effort and many tools to redirect the water back to the top of the stream. The energy for that process can’t come from the stream, it has to be applied externally.

Again based on thermodynamics, we know that after a certain number of years, this downward flow of the universe is destined to wind down entirely with “higher differentiation” eventually no longer possible. Once it reaches this state, it will have reached a state of _entropy._ The automatic downward motion is what we call __ the _force of entropy_. The action of evolution is counter to the force of entropy. Evolution is characterized by organisms developing increasing complexity. As an image, you might draw a triangle, put humans at the top of the triangle, and entropy at the bottom. On both sides, flowing downward is an arrow that marks the force of entropy. Evolution pushes up against this force in order to evolve organisms to the point where we are now (humans being the current highest expression of this process).

You can also draw the image from above by replacing entropy (at the bottom) with “low spiritual competence,” and placing the term “high spiritual competence” at the top (where we would place “man”). The process of spiritual growth also moves against the forces of entropy. It is inherent in us (and therefore much easier) to resist spiritual growth. Entropy supports us to stay stuck in the same old patterns and use the same old maps. However, spiritual growth does occur. Human beings, in spite of entropy, grow and evolve out of old patterns with the appropriate effort.

Therefore, **spiritual growth is a miracle, because it defies the laws of nature.** This miracle indicates that there is a force outside of you that supports you to defy entropy. Every individual must overcome entropy to grow, and in doing so, each growing individual supports society to also evolve in spite of entropy. Furthermore, there is more evidence that society is indeed growing spiritually than there is evidence it is not. Many of us look at the state of the world with a mentality of “this should be better,” but the fact that we have that mentality at all is proof that we hold ourselves to a higher standard than perhaps generations before us. There are so many aspects of society which, while unsatisfactory to us in the present, in the past used to be unheard of, and therefore represent progress. We need this disillusionment to motivate growth.

##### What is it that motivates people to grow even in spite of entropy?

Love has been defined in this book as the dedication to stretching your boundaries of identity to support your own or someone else’s growth. Growth requires effort, and you put that effort in when you genuinely love yourself and others. This love supports your growth and motivates you to support the growth of others. In essence, the force of evolution is the force of love. Love defies entropy.

Where does the force of love come from? Grace is not part of consciousness, but love is. What is love in the context of grace? The theory is that the mystery of grace and the miracle of evolution are a result of a loving God. This is simplistic, but it is perhaps the only definition available due to us not having a sophisticated way of measuring or studying these processes.

##### The Evolution of Consciousness

We have discussed a great deal at this point about awareness. For example, in regards to evil, it is not a malintent but a deliberate lack of awareness that pushes evil to its extreme. Spiritual evolution, alternatively, is characterized by the deliberate pursuit of awareness. Every principle we’ve explored thus far is, at its core, part of a pursuit for greater/deeper awareness. Therefore, spiritual evolution is indistinguishable from the evolution of awareness (or consciousness).

_Conscious_ can be translated as “to know with.” What does this mean? Based on what we know about the unconscious mind, we know it is full of knowledge. If we identify generally with our conscious self, we might say that the unconscious knows more than we do. In reality, the information from the unconscious is the knowledge you already possess, but in accepting the truth of the knowledge, you relearn it. In other words, true consciousness is actually just acknowledging what your unconscious mind already knows. Awareness is developed by making what is unconscious conscious, so the overall goal is the integration of the unconscious into consciousness.

Taken further, consider that the unconscious is God. Consider that God is the source of all the knowledge in the unconscious. That would make the unconscious at least in part a vessel for grace to operate within us from an external source. If the collective unconscious is God, and the conscious is the human identity, then the individual unconscious is like a bridge between God and humanity. This is how God has been within us all this time. The process of bringing the unconscious to the surface to be integrated into the conscious is to know God within us and bring God into conscious action through us.

Given that the conscious is the actionable part of our being, **the ultimate goal of spiritual evolution is to develop the consciousness to the point where it is identical to the consciousness of God.** In this way, we become conscious and spiritually competent, and as God works through us, we become an embodiment of the mystery of grace which supports others to come to consciousness as well.

### How to Welcome Grace

Grace is not something you can search for. It arises for you and/or through you. Some ignore the knocking at the door of grace; others might say it comes into their lives in such a way that they experience it whether they choose it or not. It’s true that you can’t force grace, but you can prepare for its arrival. If you exercise discipline, genuine love, and build an accurate map of reality, you can put yourself in a receptive position for the magic of grace to move to or through you. The fact that you can choose to open to grace, and yet also must wait for grace to arrive on its own is an example of serendipity (the mysterious paradox explored earlier in the chapter).

For example, Buddha became enlightened while sitting underneath the bodhisattva tree. He was ready to receive, but not seeking, yet he spent years preparing for that moment. This is mirrored in the growth process for human beings. Let’s use dreams as another example. Patients who believe in dream analysis and excessively analyze their dreams may not find significant benefit until they learn to release their grip, allowing insight to arise naturally, rather than analyzing every detail of every dream. Alternatively, there are patients who are unaware of the value of dreams and may dismiss them as meaningless. These patients benefit from being taught to value and utilize the gifts and insights inherent in their dreams.

In the context of grace, and all other forms of mysterious assistance (love, premonition, serendipity, synchronicity, and so on), you must always prepare yourself for assistance. For example, we all desire to be loved, but you must first be able to receive love. This requires you to become a person who has the discipline to love genuinely. If you are looking for love externally, you will never find genuine love—instead, you will find dependency. If you treat yourself and others with genuine love and are not seeking to get love from that behavior, you become lovable simply by being the source of love. Consequently, you will attract the love you want without having sought it out (this is the case with the love of God as well).

#### What happens when you are receptive to grace?

The result of opening to the grace-driven messages of the unconscious and facing mental illness enough to make concrete changes in yourself is that, not only are you healed of your symptoms, but you are freed from the suffering of your childhood, and you experience the world in a brand new way. Obstacles become opportunities to overcome challenges, undesirable thoughts become opportunities to gain insight into oneself, undesirable feelings become fuel for growth, and perhaps the experience of mental illness itself becomes a blessing in disguise.

Once you are aware of grace, every aspect of your life becomes meaningful. The awareness communicates to you that your growth is bigger than you, and motivated by something bigger than you. So far as to say that grace proves the existence of God and proves that God desires that you spiritually evolve. **You are indeed the center of the universe, but rather than this being in an egocentric way, this centricity is for the purpose of bringing the world into God-consciousness, and as a result, bringing God-consciousness into the world.**
