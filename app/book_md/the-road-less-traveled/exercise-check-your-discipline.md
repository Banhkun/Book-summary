## Exercise: Check Your Discipline

Consider the key components of discipline as it relates to delayed gratification.

* * *

Think of a time recently where you had an impulse to do something but chose to take your time before acting on that impulse (maybe you had the urge to snap at your mom, but instead took a breath and explained your frustration calmly. Or maybe you had the impulse to buy some ice cream while out, but you knew you already had some at home so you chose to wait). What was that experience like? Was it easy or hard to delay acting on the impulse?

How were you able to delay taking action?

Consider the other three components of discipline (acceptance of responsibility, commitment to truth, and balancing). Which of these tools did you use? Are there any tools you could have used that you didn’t?

Continuing to consider the four components, what is one component you’d like to improve in the future? How might you do so?
