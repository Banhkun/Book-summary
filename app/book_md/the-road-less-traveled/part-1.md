## Part 1: Discipline

In _The Road Less Traveled,_ psychotherapist M. Scott Peck teaches you how to face the inevitable challenges in your life, grow through hardship, and ultimately attain deeper self-knowledge.

_The Road Less Traveled_ is based on three assumptions:

  1. The mind and spirit are connected (mental growth is spiritual growth and vice versa).
  2. Spiritual growth is a painful, complicated, lifelong process.
  3. The purpose of life is to develop full spiritual competence and spiritual power.



According to Peck, our greatest impetus in life is to spiritually evolve. **Our greatest obstacle to spiritual growth is the reality that it only occurs through the overcoming of obstacles.** We would rather complain, suffer, and resist, because acceptance means confronting our problems, and the confrontation process is often uncomfortable or painful. However, avoiding spiritual growth eventually leads to poor mental health. In fact, the core of mental illness is the inability to confront problems and the pain or discomfort associated with them. Avoiding problems = decreased growth and increased suffering.

In contrast, **confronting and solving your own problems builds courage and allows you to develop wisdom.** You can do this by developing discipline, love, personal religion, and grace. _The Road Less Traveled_ is an in-depth exploration of these tools through the lens of Peck’s experiences as a psychotherapist.

* * *

**The first and most valuable tool you can develop to support spiritual growth is discipline.** There are four key components to discipline.

### Key #1: Delay Gratification

To delay gratification means to confront pain when it arises because you know it will allow you to experience greater pleasure in the long run. The goal is to get the challenging part out of the way first, then be able to enjoy yourself without anxiety.

How you are parented is what determines whether or not you develop the discipline for delayed gratification. There are two subtle problems that can occur when a child does not learn how to delay gratification.

#### Problem #1: Underdeveloped Problem-Solving Skills

When you don’t develop the discipline to delay gratification, you don’t learn how to work through feelings of frustration or discomfort, and consequently, your ability to problem-solve will be underdeveloped. Unless you have a mental disability or difficulty, **you are capable of solving your problems as long as you’re willing to take the time to do so.**

For example, say you get a flat tire, and because you don’t know how to change a tire, you just take the bus until you can afford to pay someone to do it. Your choice to take the bus reflects an attachment to instant gratification (immediate access to transportation), whereas, with the willingness to delay gratification (taking the time to find out how to change your own tire), you would have saved money and developed greater confidence in your ability to problem-solve.

#### Problem #2: Tendency Towards Avoidance

When we have issues solving our problems, it is usually partially because we are hoping they’ll go away on their own. This is another example of the trouble with delayed gratification. Solving problems requires discomfort upfront, and the willingness to suffer through that discomfort for long-term happiness.

For example, undisciplined parents who avoid their own problems and growth will often punish their children for behaviors they themselves demonstrate, resulting in kids who struggle with problem-solving and impulse control (a crucial factor in delayed gratification). Parents who demonstrate healthy discipline will inspire their children to use the same healthy habits.

There are two critical components to the development of discipline in a child.

##### Component #1: Love

Parents who improperly teach discipline often use abandonment as a threat to control a child’s behavior. What this tells the child is that they need to behave in a specific way in order to be loved and cared for. The parent dismisses love in favor of power. Children grow up in fear and engage with life from that fear (as if the world is not safe). Consequently, they have immense difficulty in becoming healthy, disciplined adults. For example, if a parent says loving words, but their actions don’t match, the child may consciously accept this. However, on a subconscious level, they can sense that they are not valued.

Alternatively, **homes where there is chaos but some amount of genuine love produce children who can still become healthy, disciplined adults.** For example, if parents truly love their children, the children will feel it even during times of struggle in the relationship. Love is crucial because when you love something or someone, they become valuable, and when we consider things valuable, we take care of them. Children learn their value by being shown by their caretakers that they are valuable. Knowing your value is crucial for mental wellness and for self-discipline because self-discipline is self-caring.

##### Component #2: Attention

If you don’t take the time to truly observe your children, not only will you not accurately pick up on the subtle moments where healthy discipline is needed, but you will teach them that they aren’t valuable. Additionally, when parents aren’t dedicated to deeper awareness, they often become overwhelmed by a buildup of behavior and are likely to distribute disproportionate discipline (usually violent or cruel) without considering the context. This impedes the growth process because when you see the world as threatening, you will cling to the comfort of instant gratification instead of trusting the value of delaying gratification.

Parents who pay attention to the details of their children’s lives and behaviors will pick up on subtleties that they can respond to with encouragement or light discipline before it comes to a point where more firm discipline is needed. Additionally, in paying such close attention to your child, you will empathize more deeply with them. **Children with empathetic, supportive parents are more willing to support themselves, which is the foundation of self-discipline.**

### Key #2: Accept Responsibility

Another aspect of discipline is accepting responsibility. There are three important realities you must accept in order to accept responsibility.

  * Problems can only be solved after you’ve taken responsibility for solving them. 
  * We often try to avoid the suffering of problems by making them the responsibility of someone else, but if you say something is not your problem, you will not solve the problem.
  * Taking responsibility for a problem is a practice of discipline.



#### Why Do People Avoid Responsibility?

Taking full responsibility for your choices gives you access to total freedom. Most people avoid taking responsibility because they are afraid of the consequences of their free will. For example, psychiatrists say that most patients who are struggling with a sense of powerlessness don’t actually want to be responsible for their lives, so they give their power away to things outside of themselves, and then wonder why they feel powerless.

Additionally, the process of truly accepting responsibility requires the discipline to conduct rigorous, regular self-reflection. This type of self-examination is often painful and difficult.

#### What’s the Result of an Imbalanced Sense of Responsibility?

Figuring out what you are responsible for in life is one of the most difficult problems you will ever encounter. For this reason, to some extent, we all end up expressing one of two types of mental illness: neuroticism or character disorder. Neurotic and character disordered people respond to problems in contrasting ways.

  * Neurotic people make themselves responsible for too much, and see everything as their fault. Consequently, they have a fear of commitment, suffer from generalized anxiety, engage in codependent relationships, and experience a lower quality of life.
  * Character disordered people make themselves responsible for too little, and believe everyone else is at fault.**** Consequently, they lack the discipline to work through their problems and have a low quality of life. If you engage with life in this way, you become stagnant, like dead weight, because if you don’t solve your problems, nothing in your life will move. 



#### How Can You Learn to Accept Responsibility?

Through experience and self-reflection, usually over a long period of time, we are able to get a realistic sense of what we owe to the world versus what we owe to ourselves. Parents can assist children in the process of accepting responsibility by recognizing opportunities to address a lack of responsibility, as well as opportunities to discourage a sense of responsibility that is unrealistically high. This requires time, attention, and effort, and is usually uncomfortable for all parties.

  * Neurotics, being willing to be responsible for so much, can make incredible parents, as long as they don’t get overwhelmed by an unrealistic sense of responsibility, taking action on things that ultimately aren’t necessary.
  * Character disordered parents are generally terrible because their behavior is often destructive for their children without them being aware of it. Because character disordered people want to blame others for their problems, this will extend to the raising of their children. They don’t take responsibility, and that is what they demonstrate to their children. Taken further, they will also blame the children rather than take responsibility themselves. If their children internalize that responsibility, they will develop neurotic behavior and thought patterns. If they resist, they will become character disordered themselves.
  * If you can accept responsibility, and accept the nature of life being a series of choices with consequences, you will experience freedom. 



### Key #3: Commit to Truth

Truth = reality. Your perception of the world is like a road map. When you see reality, you see the world as it is, and you can make wise choices from that standpoint. You can only see the path clearly if you see the world clearly. This requires the discipline to engage in constant awareness and revision of your perception.

Many avoid making the map clear because seeing the reality of the world is painful, but if you see the world underneath a lot of illusion, lies, and so on, the path will be unclear, and you will feel lost.

#### Obstacle: Transference and the Outdated Map

Transference is what occurs when an individual builds a belief system based on the environment of their upbringing and carries that belief system into adulthood even when it no longer aligns with reality. It is the basis of most mental illness, manifesting in both overt and subtle ways (all of which are generally unhealthy).**Transference is a problem because you end up living by values you created to protect yourself from certain circumstances, and these values may no longer be valid or may have been built erroneously.**

For example, you may have been abused by a parent and realized you could not trust that parent, which led to the belief “I can’t trust anyone.” It was protective when the abuse was occurring, but in adulthood, it’s destructive, because the perception was never meant to be applied across the board. Now, it’s keeping you from developing healthy intimate relationships. You might even unconsciously create experiences that reinforce the lack of trust.

It can be very difficult to overcome transference and revise your perceptions. In many cases, it requires you to confront the exact feelings you’ve been protecting. For example, changing your perception of distrust would require you to accept that you did not have a normal upbringing, and perhaps that your abusive parent did not love you (among other things). All of this might be very painful to confront.

#### Solution: Willingness to Meet Challenges

We are often extremely resistant to revising our map of reality, but to be healthy, we must confront reality and let go of outdated perceptions of it. This requires the discipline to see the truth at all costs. Being dedicated to the truth also requires an openness to challenge, because the truth of reality can be difficult to accept and you will often feel confronted by it. Spiritual healing has not taken place until being open to challenge is second nature.

For example, most people seeking therapy are looking for relief, rather than growth. Many quit once they realize therapy is a challenge. The therapist tries to teach the client that relief is found through practicing the discipline to embrace challenges. Sometimes, the patient will continue therapy but resist the process of growth. Consider free association, which is a method therapists often use to encourage openness in a client. Free association is saying whatever words come to mind without a filter, and if there are multiple, choosing the least comfortable words to share. Many patients end up curating their “free associations” to leave out any information that feels too vulnerable.

#### What Does It Mean to Be Committed to the Truth?

A life dedicated to truth means a life that is completely honest. To be honest is to be sure that all your communications are reflective of reality. This includes word choice, tone of voice, both verbal and written communication, and so on. This is not easy.

Lying is an attempt to avoid real pain, but this avoidance often leads to mental illness. Avoidance encourages shortcuts, which can prevent you from completing the steps necessary to ensure a healthy, lasting outcome. That being said, a shortcut is not always bad. There is a distinction between a productive shortcut and a destructive one.

##### Destructive shortcut: Psychotherapy as a “Fix It”

This occurs when you are in therapy or seeking therapy for the wrong reasons. Maybe you’re getting therapy with your partner because you want the therapist to fix your relationship, but you think your partner is the one who needs help, and you are doing nothing wrong. You are not looking to grow, you are looking for a way to avoid the pain of growth by putting the responsibility on someone else (your therapist and your partner).

##### Productive shortcut: Psychotherapy as a Tool for Growth

This is productive because support during the process of growth makes the experience overall less arduous, without sacrificing the quality of growth.

#### The Lies We Tell

The required self-discipline for truth-telling is such an overwhelming idea that most people avoid living a truly honest life. They instead settle for a life of limited vulnerability, limited authenticity, and limited visibility. **Everyone lies to some extent, but habitual lying (to yourself or others) as a way to avoid the pain or challenge of reality eventually leads to mental illness.**

There are two types of lies.

##### Type #1: Black Lie

This is the traditional lie. It is a knowingly false statement.

##### Type #2: White Lie

This is a lie that omits an important part of the truth. The intention is not to make a blatantly false statement, but to misrepresent the truth.

White lies can be just as toxic as black lies. They are hard to detect or address because of their covert nature. White lies are also more socially acceptable because many people think lying to avoid hurting others is justifiable, even an act of kindness. This is very common in families. It’s a problem because:

  * You think you are protecting people when you tell white lies, but really, you are depriving them of their right to choose how they relate to reality.
  * When parents lie by omission to their children, they deprive them of opportunities for growth, knowledge, reassurance, and good role models.



The tricky thing is that lying is sometimes necessary. Or, at least the withholding of the truth is sometimes necessary. Here are some examples:

  * Therapists need to be thoughtful about when to reveal observations of their clients. They may withhold an observation until they feel the client is prepared to healthily engage with it. 
  * Parents need to be thoughtful about how much they tell their children about their relationship. If it’s on the rocks, and they’re considering divorce, they might withhold that piece of information until the idea is more concrete. 
  * In politics or business, you might need to withhold strong opinions at times, in order to serve the greater good, or out of respect for those in greater positions of power. 



To be successful in many types of environments you will often need to make decisions based on the needs of the whole equally as much as on your individual needs. The key here is balance.

#### Rules for Balanced Truth-Telling

Rule #1: Never communicate something that is untrue.

Rule #2: The choice to withhold should always be for the needs of others, and not to serve your own needs. Withholding the truth will always involve some form of lying, therefore, each time you consider withholding, be prepared to engage in this moral dilemma.

Rule #3: Because identifying someone’s needs is a delicate responsibility, you can only make a morally accurate decision in regards to withholding if you are operating with genuine love (we’ll define this in detail in Part 2).

Rule #4: In assessing others from the context of genuine love, you should be assessing whether or not the truth will progress their spiritual growth.

  * If it won’t, that is a solid reason to withhold
  * If it will, you should not withhold



Rule #5: We usually assume that people can’t handle the truth. When deciding what to do with the truth, you should be aware of the likelihood that you are underestimating the capacities of others.

The benefit of being truly honest in life is an experience of continual growth, long-lasting intimate relationships, the knowledge that you are a source of illumination for others (rather than shadow), and ultimately true freedom.

### Key #4: Find Balance

Even discipline requires discipline, and that’s where balancing comes in. Balance is the component of discipline that allows us to remain pliant and adaptable, rather than rigid with extreme expectations of ourselves or others. Balance looks like:

  * Having the courage to be truthful, but also knowing when it is appropriate to withhold honesty. 
  * Having the willingness to be responsible for yourself, but also knowing the difference between what you are and are not truly responsible for.
  * Having the discipline and forethought to delay gratification, but also knowing when to fully live in the moment.



For example, anger is a survival mechanism. We experience anger when we sense someone might be trying to harm or control us. Without it, we would let others walk all over us. However, it’s not always appropriate to express anger. Whomever you perceive to be a threat may not actually be a threat, or, it may not be wise to confront someone who is a threat. In either case, you need to have the flexibility to moderate your expression of anger. Sometimes it’s necessary to express it loudly and in the moment. Sometimes it’s best to express it after careful thought and consideration, or in a calm, measured way.

#### The Flexible Response System

It is the responsibility of your _flexible response system_ to determine the best balance for anger, as well as all other emotions and behaviors. We all have difficulty with our flexible response system. Most therapy includes some attempt to improve the efficacy of this process. The more mired in mental illness the patient is, the more difficult it is to refine their flexible response system.

Consider someone who is deeply mentally ill and has a very black and white flexible response system (all or nothing). This person might struggle to discern boundaries. So, if they determine a response to something, it becomes the default response, even when it would cause less suffering to deviate. For example, maybe they had a bad experience in childhood with parents taking things from their room without permission. Perhaps in adulthood, they decide anyone who wants to come into their room is not trustworthy, or they simply don’t allow anyone in their room at all. They are not recognizing that some people warrant a response of trust, and some don’t.

#### How to Find Balance

**True mental wellness requires the ability to find a balance between contrasting objectives or needs.** To establish that kind of balance you need to make sacrifices. This is what makes balancing a discipline. Giving things up is painful, but the loss of balance is more painful than the pain of giving things up. In life, you must give up all kinds of things to maintain balance, such as old belief systems or old personality traits, or you will not be able to grow on your life journey. Often, people choose not to grow rather than experience the pain of giving something up.

Major things that need to be given up during a successful journey of spiritual evolution:

  * The security of being a child
  * Overblown ideas of your parents
  * The freedom of having no commitments
  * The fruits of youth 
  * Control of your kids
  * The clinging to impermanent senses of power 
  * The identity of the self and the experience of being alive 



The last on the list may seem impossible to accept, like a terrible twist of fate that makes our lives meaningless and without purpose, because western culture is terrified of death, considering it a cruel ending to the sacred light of life. In reality, **giving up the attachment to self and honoring the reality of death allow you to experience the most vibrant life possible.** Death gives life its meaning. Giving up the self is also required in order to experience genuine love (discussed further in Part 2). During our lives, we are learning how to live, but we are also, in many ways, learning how to die.

Giving up the self is generally a gradual, lifelong process, but you can use a tool called _bracketing_ as a way to practice (we’ll also explore this in Part 2). Bracketing involves suspending your “self” temporarily in order to integrate new knowledge.

#### A Note on Growth and Depression

For serious growth to take place, much of the old version of you has to be let go of, or “given up.” The unconscious mind tends to know this before the conscious does (discussed further in Part 3). Therefore, you might seek therapy because of depression and not realize that at least part of the old self is already in the process of being given up. The choice to attend therapy is demonstrative of that giving up (you are “giving up” on “being ok”).

Depression is unhealthy when it becomes chronic. This can occur if the “giving up” process is interrupted by an event or stagnates for some other reason. Often when this occurs, depression does not resolve.
