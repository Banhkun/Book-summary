## Solving Dysfunction Two: Empowering Constructive Conflict

To recap, Dysfunction 2 is fear of conflict, in which teammates avoid having productive, ideological debate and steer away from discussing controversial topics. When this happens, problems go undetected, mistakes are repeated, and opportunities are squandered.

The general theme to fixing this is **by encouraging teams to deal _directly_ with sources and topics of disagreement**, rather than ignoring them. Once they see that conflict can be a _productive_ endeavor, they will get comfortable making it a more regular part of their decision-making process.

Here are some specific tactics teams can use to get comfortable leaning into conflict.

### Mining

This involves teams bringing up previous disagreements and **forcing them to work through issues that they would otherwise avoid.** This direct acknowledgment is key, since _not_ talking about a conflict doesn’t resolve the underlying issue at all—it just causes it to manifest in other, more destructive forms (like personal grudges).

When employing the mining technique, it’s important to **limit the discussion to one disagreement at a time** , to avoid getting sidetracked by smaller, tangential disagreements. Once the main disagreement is resolved, move on to the next one. Assign a member of the team to take on a supervisory role if needed.

### Real-Time Permission

Here the leader coaches and encourages the conflict. When people get uncomfortable with conflict, the leader reminds the team that debate is a _productive and necessary_ part of team-building. Since dysfunctional teams are often accustomed to team leaders suppressing debate or shielding individuals from conflict, this exercise reverses that effect and **gives the team the confidence and permission structure to continue on with debate**.

### The Leader’s Role

To promote healthy and productive conflict, **a leader must resist the urge to protect the team from peer criticism**. Stifling a lively debate is one of the worst mistakes a leader can make. They must also model appropriate conflict behavior by never engaging in personal attacks themselves and always bringing their own sources of disagreement to light.

### Benefits

Teams that employ these strategies are able to engage in constructive conflict free of personal grudges. **They learn to** **discuss and resolve issues _as soon as they arise_ **and focus on _ideological_ arguments, rather than personal rivalries.

### Example

Kathryn uses both the mining and real-time permission strategies. She declares that the group is not going home without having articulated what their goal should be. She then nurtures and encourages the discussion as it unfolds, even observing at one point, “This is the most productive conversation I’ve heard since I’ve been here. Keep going.” Later on, she facilitates open debate by urging the team, “Let’s have this out. And **let’s not pretend we’re doing anything wrong...this is not a religious battle. It’s about strategy**.”
