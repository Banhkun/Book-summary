## Exercise: Testing Teamwork

By thinking about DecisionTech’s flaws, you can improve your effectiveness as part of a team.

* * *

Have you ever been part of a team that was unable to work together and achieve its stated goals? How do you think you might have contributed to this dynamic?

Can you think of a real-world example of a team (whether in sports, politics, business, or anywhere else) that was made up of talented individuals that were unsuccessful working as a group? What do you think were the reasons for this team’s failure?

Of the characters in the book, which one most resembles someone you have trouble working with? Describe this person, and share an experience that frustrated you.
