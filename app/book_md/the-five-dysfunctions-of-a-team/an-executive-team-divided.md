## An Executive Team Divided

_Five Dysfunctions of a Team_ explores the dysfunctions that prevent teams from working cohesively as a unit and outlines some key strategies that teams can employ to identify and resolve them. The book does this through a parable about a troubled (fictional) company called DecisionTech, whose executive team exhibits all five of the dysfunctions.

### Missed Opportunities

DecisionTech seems to have everything going for it. They have a seasoned executive team, a solid business plan, plenty of startup capital from investors, and leading-edge technology.

Unfortunately, they find themselves unable to capitalize on these advantages and are instead mired in dysfunction. With missed product delivery deadlines, a growing turnover problem, and an eroding cash position, the company is on the brink of failure.

**The problem is the executive team** , which is:

  * Mistrustful of one another
  * Unable to discuss issues
  * Ambiguous and unclear about priorities
  * Unwilling to hold one another accountable
  * Overly focused on individual and departmental goals



Amid this turmoil, the Board of Directors asks the CEO and cofounder to step down, replacing him with their new choice, Kathryn Petersen. Kathryn may lack experience in tech, but she is brought in for her track record in building great executive teams.

### The Executive Team

All the executives are highly skilled, experienced business leaders who have achieved notable success at previous companies. Unfortunately, they are far less than the sum of their parts. Each exhibited some dysfunctions in their approach to teamwork.

#### Jeff Shanley, Co-Founder and CEO

**Jeff was afraid of conflict** , and never used the opportunity of meetings to discuss important issues. This led to ambiguity and lack of commitment on the part of the team, with nothing ever being decided or accomplished. He was also unwilling to hold his team accountable because he didn’t like being seen as an authority figure.

#### Michele Bebe (“Mikey”), Head of Marketing

**Mikey was known for her acerbic style and difficult personality**. She had a low opinion of her teammates’ intelligence and was dismissive of their ideas, frequently making sarcastic and hurtful comments to her colleagues.

#### Martin Gilmore, CTO and Co-Founder

**Martin was uncommitted to team priorities and group discussions** , rarely paying attention during meetings. He only dealt with his teammates in the most remote and detached manner, never engaging them on a personal or emotional level.

#### Jeff Rawlins (“JR”), Head of Sales

**JR displayed a lack of commitment,** being inattentive to detail, missing deadlines, and blowing off assignments that weren’t immediately relevant to his work. He was also inattentive to team results, only being interested in one measurement of success: _his_ personal sales figures.

#### Carlos Amador, Head of Customer Support

**Carlos was unwilling to open up to his colleagues** , rarely saying what he actually thought.**** He also displayed a lack of commitment, failing to update his colleagues on progress and adhere to deadlines.

#### Jan Mersino, CFO

**Jan didn’t trust her fellow executives** to make wise decisions with company money and held them back from making important investments and taking necessary risks.

#### Nick Farrell

**Nick was uncommitted to team priorities** and vague about his responsibilities because he lacked a clearly defined role at the company.

The team needs to reevaluate its approach to teamwork. When Kathryn announces that the team will be going on two off-site retreats to work on their dysfunctional teamwork, there is resistance.

  * Some question the wisdom of taking time away from the office when the company is already struggling. 
  * Others believe that a retreat will be unproductive (as so many DecisionTech executive meetings were).
  * Others believe that they have no need to improve their teamwork skills and that the whole exercise is a waste of their time.



Still, Kathryn is adamant. The only alternative was a continuation of the status quo: poor results, bitterness, and lack of clarity around team priorities.

Over the course of the retreats,**** Kathryn builds a model identifying the five dysfunctions that prevent DecisionTech’s executives from working effectively as a team.
