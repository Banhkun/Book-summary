## Solving Dysfunction Four: Promoting Accountability

To recap, Dysfunction Four is avoidance of accountability. This is when teammates fail to hold each other to high standards of performance and force the leader to become the sole source of discipline. It results in the spread of low standards across the organization, an exodus of achievement-oriented people, and resentment towards those who refuse to pull their weight.

In general, this can be fixed by **making clear what goals the organization is meant to achieve and incentivizing individuals to work for the group rather than for themselves**. For accountability, teams should engage in peer pressure tactics, which is scalable and reduces the bureaucracy needed for oversight.

Below are some tools designed to achieve this shift in behavior.

### Publication of Goals and Standards

This clarifies what the team needs to accomplish, everyone’s individual responsibilities to the team, and a code of conduct so people know how to behave.

Creating public goals and standards **puts everyone on the same page**. It facilitates accountability, since everyone knows what the proper measurement of success is and what each individual’s responsibility is toward the achievement of the goal.

### Team Rewards

This shifts performance incentives from individuals to teams, **rewarding individuals based on how their _team_ performs, not how _they_ perform personally. **

This discourages turf wars and rivalries, since _anyone’s_ failure becomes _everyone’s_ failure. There’s no point in hoarding resources for your department if it’s going to harm other departments and drag down the team as a whole. Instead, team rewards encourage cooperation and efficient pooling of resources across departments.

### The Leader’s Role

A leader must be willing to step back from being the sole source of discipline, and encourage peers to hold _one another_ to high standards. This is more scalable and reduces the overhead needed to build high-functioning teams.

When disagreement arises, the leader must also serve as the judge to decide cases, then return power back to peer accountability.

### Benefits

Teams that make use of these practices hold each other to high standards, knowing that **everyone sinks or swims together**. These teams create a positive, self-reinforcing cycle, in which individuals _know_ that they’re going to be responsible to their peers for their performance, so they work harder to deliver results. This actually helps poor performers as well: rather than letting them establish counterproductive working habits (which will only harm them in the long run), a culture of accountability gives such individuals the opportunity to improve themselves through constructive peer-to-peer criticism.

### Example

Nick demonstrates his willingness to hold his teammates accountable by requesting that the full DecisionTech executive team attend a two-day sales training session for the salespeople. He makes the case (correctly, and with Kathryn’s full endorsement) that since the company needs to improve its sales, everyone should learn to think and act like salespeople. When Mikey complains about having to attend a training session that she believes isn’t directly relevant to her job, **Nick immediately pushes back at her and holds her accountable in front of the entire team**. He asks her what else could be more important. When she can’t come up with a suitable reply, she backs down.
