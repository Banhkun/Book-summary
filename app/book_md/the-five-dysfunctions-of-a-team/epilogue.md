## Epilogue: Realizing Results

As a result of the team’s in-depth exploration of the Five Dysfunctions, DecisionTech undergoes a series of large-scale changes. These changes do not suit everyone’s personality and working style, but they are necessary: those who are unable or unwilling to adjust their behavior and thinking will only drag the organization down. **The team emerges as a stronger and more cohesive unit by losing those members of the team who can’t make this transition**.

### A New Direction

The team ultimately decides on new customer acquisition as the company’s overarching goal for the year, landing upon 18 new deals as the target number. They reason that the achievement of this goal will generate positive press, create references for the _subsequent_ round of customers,and prove that there _are_ customers interested in DecisionTech’s products.

### JR Quits

JR’s attitude indicates that he was not a good cultural fit for the company DecisionTech needs to become in order to succeed. **His ego, inattention to detail, and refusal to set aside his own agenda demonstrate why he had to go.**

He was also afraid to be vulnerable, having confessed to Jeff that he didn’t know how to sell in DecisionTech’s emerging market without a strong brand name. The way he chose _not_ to fail was to quit—showing that **he was always more concerned with his reputation than with helping the company succeed.**

### Nick Expands his Role

JR’s sudden departure expands Nick’s role and gives him a greater commitment to DecisionTech’s success, one which he was sorely missing when he was floundering looking for a way to define himself at the company.

Furthermore, the decision to head up sales is one _he made himself_ , which only strengthens his commitment and buy-in to the new approach.

### Mikey is Fired

After observing Mikey’s destructive and egotistical behavior over the course of the retreats, Jan decides that she is a poor fit for the company.

She cites Mikey’s pattern of uncooperative (and borderline abusive) behavior towards her colleagues, like the constant eye-rolling, her hurtful remarks (at one point she calls Martin a SOB), and her general lack of emotional intelligence in being able to see how harmful her presence has become.

Mikey also **displays a general and consistent contempt for the _idea_ of working more collaboratively with her colleagues** (like not wanting to attend the sales training, despite it being a stated company priority which everyone else has committed to).

Kathryn tells Mikey that **her total inability to work as part of a team far outweighs her talent as a marketing expert** —consequently, she is doing more harm than good.

### Generating Positive Results

By committing to a clear goal and removing those who are unwilling to work within the new team framework, DecisionTech starts to see positive results, as sales grow significantly, the company makes its revenue goals for three out of four quarters, and they move into a tie for number one in the industry.

Because the executives trust one another, have learned how to constructively disagree, are fully committed to team priorities, hold one another accountable, and are focused on team results, **they make the transition from a _dysfunctional_ team to a _functional_ one**.
