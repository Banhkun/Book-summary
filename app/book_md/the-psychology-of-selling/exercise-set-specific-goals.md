## Exercise: Set Specific Goals

Specific goals are far more motivating than vague goals.

* * *

Run through the exercise outlined above to determine your goals and subgoals. First, decide a reasonably ambitious goal for your annual income for the upcoming year. Then, figure out how much of your product you would need to sell on an annual basis to make that goal.

Next, figure out how much youâ€™ll need to sell monthly, weekly, and daily to meet this annual goal.

What specific activities will you need to engage in to meet each of those subgoals? How will you need to structure your day to make time for those activities?
