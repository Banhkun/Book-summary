## Exercise: Delight Your Customers in Small Ways

Exceeding expectations doesn’t always mean providing freebies. There are a multitude of small things you can add to your service to keep your customers coming back.

* * *

Think of small ways that you can make your service feel more personal. (For example, sending personal emails instead of automated ones, remembering customer preferences, and so on.)

Think of small ways you can reward your customers after specific milestones. (For example, a gift card after they have spent a certain amount.)

Think of small branded items you can give away to show customers you value them, while also promoting your business. (For example, good quality tote bags.)

Think of one-off events you can create to delight your customers. (For example, free shipping day, or a “10% off” day, and so on.)
