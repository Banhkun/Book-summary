## Happy Customers Are Core to Your Success

_Raving Fans_ is a fable in which a newly hired Area Manager’s plans to focus on quality are upended when told by the President of the company to instead prioritize successful customer service strategies, the foundation of any strong business. The ill-equipped Area Manager worries that, like his three predecessors, he will quickly fail at this task and lose his position. Miraculously, his Fairy Godmother appears to offer guidance. The first piece of advice his Fairy Godmother offers: **businesses need to go beyond merely satisfying their customers and instead focus on how to create “Raving Fans.”**

(Shortform note: Business fables have become an increasingly popular way to disseminate management principles due to the accessibility of their narratives. Other classics include _The Greatest Salesman in the World, The One Minute Manager, _and _The Five Dysfunctions of a Team._)

According to the authors, whatever work you do, the people you serve are central to your success. Acquiring and holding onto customers and clients is essential. Happy customers can share positive reviews with thousands of people. Likewise, disgruntled customers can write terrible reviews, can damage your reputation, and won’t hesitate to abandon you for your competitors. With one click, your customers have the power to make or break you.

> The world of business has rapidly evolved since1993 when _Raving Fans_ was published. Today, the marketplace is saturated with competitors for every type of product and service, and businesses now understand that they have to pay as much attention to their customer experience strategies as they do to their product and service offerings. Further, **consumers now have more buying power and higher expectations than they did when _Raving Fans_ was originally released**. Consequently, some modern readers have argued that the principles in the book are outdated since consumers do not _have to_ put up with poor service since they can easily move to a competitor.
> 
> However, the principles covered in _Raving Fans_ may be _more_ significant today than they were in 1993—due to the increase in competition and consumer buying power, **businesses have to work harder to impress customers and stay ahead of the competition**. Therefore, creating “Raving Fans” is essential to business survival.

### Why Focus on Excellent Customer Service?

Blanchard and Bowles argue that there’s a clear distinction between satisfying your customers and exceeding the expectations of your customers. If you merely seek to satisfy your customers, they’ll only stay with you as long as you’re not worse than the competition. However, if you invest in the customer service experience to exceed expectations and build trust, your customers will be so impressed and happy that they’ll willingly contribute to your success.

This is because emotions shape attitudes and drive the decision-making process. According to the authors, if interacting with your business makes people happy, they’re more likely to become emotionally attached to you because they enjoy the feeling of interacting with you. Without this emotional attachment, they’re more likely to feel disconnected and move to another competitor if they find more value in what they have to offer.

> **Forming Positive Emotional Connections Keeps Customers**
> 
> Research confirms that forming positive emotional connections provides enormous opportunities for growth and profitability and is key to winning customer loyalty. Further, the research reveals that customers have a wide range of underlying motivations that businesses need to identify and fulfill before they can achieve this connection. Consider the following examples:
> 
>   * You identify that your customers are motivated by the need to feel unique and special. You cater to this motivation by offering a more personalized service. In addition, you offer customizable products and services to fulfill this need.
> 
>   * You notice that your customers care about climate change. You take steps to reduce your carbon footprint by using environmentally friendly packaging. Further, you donate a percentage of your profits to a conservation organization and emphasize your commitment to sustainability in your marketing materials.
> 
> 

> 
> When you align your customer service experience with your customers’ underlying motivations, you’re more likely to forge positive emotional attachments and drive customer engagement.

Providing an excellent customer service experience is essential to the growth and success of your business. The authors argue that happy customers are likely to:

  * Become loyal customers and offer a reliable source of revenue
  * Promote your business by becoming brand advocates and help grow your customer base
  * Offer feedback and a deeper understanding of their motivations, which will help you to create better products and services
  * Test or become early adopters of your latest products and services



According to the authors, businesses that successfully implement customer service experience strategies achieve **higher customer retention rates and increased revenues**.

> Businesses tend to spend more on acquiring new customers than they do on investing in keeping the ones they already have. However, these customer acquisition and retention marketing statistics highlight how costly this approach can be:
> 
>   * It can cost five times more to acquire a new customer than it can to retain an existing customer
> 
>   * The success rate for selling to new customers is 5-20%, whereas the success rate for selling to existing customers is 60-70%
> 
>   * A 5% increase in customer retention can yield higher profits ranging from 25-95%.
> 
> 

> 
> Clearly, it pays more to invest in making your existing customers happy than it does to acquire new customers.

We’ve synthesized five steps to achieving excellent customer service and propelling the success of your business:

  * Step 1: Define Your Ideal Customer Service Experience
  * Step 2: Discover Your Customers’ Ideal Service Experience
  * Step 3: Integrate Your Vision With Their Needs
  * Step 4: Build Effective Systems to Ensure Consistency
  * Step 5: Exceed Customer Expectations



We’ll cover each step over the next five chapters.
