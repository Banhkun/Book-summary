## Exercise: Identify Obstacles in Your Workplace Environment

Your team may face a variety of obstacles that prevent them from performing their best. Identifying these obstacles is the first step towards creating a positive workplace environment.

* * *

Think of a recent time when you felt blocked from performing your best at work. (For example, there were too many distractions, or you were unable to find necessary information quickly.) Briefly describe the problem.

Think of a small step you can take to lessen the impact of this obstacle. (For example, schedule times for focused work and let colleagues know you donâ€™t want to be interrupted; discuss how to better organize access to files.)

Think of one of your team members. Brainstorm all possible obstacles that this teammate may face at work. This can range from lack of time or resources, to lack of confidence or motivation.

Pick one of the obstacles from your list. Think of small steps that you or your teammate can take to lessen the impact of this obstacle.
