## Shortform Introduction

Do you pride yourself on being the _nicest guy in the world_? Does your fear of disapproval lead you to people-please, avoid conflict, and repress parts of yourself? If this sounds like you, you might be what Dr. Robert Glover calls a _Nice Guy_.

Throughout his time as a marriage and family psychotherapist, Dr. Glover noticed a trend among dissatisfied men: **Although they consider themselves kind, generous people, they fail to see their efforts turn into a fulfilling life.** In the face of struggle, these men use the tactic they know best: _Be nice_. However, according to Glover, “being nice” rarely yields the desired outcome and Nice Guys’ insecurities frequently emerge as passive-aggressive or dishonest behavior. **Their repetitive, ineffective approach to life leads to unsatisfying intimate relationships, bitterness, and disappointment.**

In _No More Mr. Nice Guy: A Proven Plan for Getting What You Want in Love, Sex, and Life_ (referred to throughout this guide as _NMMNG_), Glover guides you through understanding and overcoming the Nice Guy mindset so that you can become what Glover calls a fully realized and self-accepting “Integrated Male” (who we will from here on out refer to as the “Ideal Man” for simplicity).

### About the Author

Dr. Robert Glover is an author, life coach, and the internationally recognized authority on “Nice Guys.” Formerly a marriage and family psychotherapist (and minister), he now hosts online classes, podcasts, and group therapy focused primarily on empowering recovering Nice Guys. He’s also the founder of TPI (Total Personal Integration) University, which offers classes that help both men _and_ women live with intention.

In addition to _NMMNG_ , Glover has also written _Dating Essentials for Men: The Only Dating Guide You Will Ever Need_.

As the “Godfather of the Manosphere” (or pro-male corners of the internet) and a regular contributor to many male-centered podcasts and radio shows, Glover has become somewhat of a cult figure among the men’s rights movement and pick-up artists. His long-time dedication to men’s empowerment—specifically in reference to men embracing their masculinity _and_ developing their “game” with women—and his insistence that the modern man cares too much about pleasing women has made him popular among these groups.

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Running Press

Originally published as an e-book in the fall of 2000, **_No More Mr. Nice Guy_ became a media phenomenon when Glover caught the attention of conservative talk-shows _The O’Reilly Factor_ and _The Rush Limbaugh Show_. **The book was then officially published in winter of 2003 by Running Press. Since then, it’s been translated into eight different languages. Today, it’s one of the top-selling “personal transformation” e-books on Amazon and has sold hundreds of thousands of copies.

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

The negative connotation around “nice guys” existed long before _NMMNG_. In fact, there’s an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to the term and the various studies, perspectives, and stereotypes it’s spawned since the mid-20th century.

For instance, you’re probably familiar with the idiom “ _Nice guys finish last._ ” This phrase has existed since the 1940s and, although it was originally in reference to _playing nice in baseball_ , it’s since come to encapsulate many of the negative stereotypes associated with the success and dating lives of nice men (such as being pushovers or generally bad with women). Even Glover plays with this phrase in his online class, “Nice Guys Don’t Finish Last, They Rot in Middle Management.”

Starting in the 1990s, sociological and psychological studies began examining the general success (or failure) of men best described as “nice.” These studies were usually based upon _women’s opinions_ of different types of men. For example, one 2003 study wanted to understand why some women say they want a “nice guy” but end up pursuing those who possess other (maybe not-nice) traits. (The study found that women looking for long-term relationships prioritized nice men and those looking for casual hookups prioritized attractive men.) However, these studies mostly failed to define a “Nice Guy,” as its meaning often depended on the subject’s interpretation of the term.

**Unlike these studies, Glover approached Nice Guys from a self-reflective, distinctly male point of view.** Rather than scrutinize women’s opinions, he tapped into his psychotherapist background and turned instead to Nice Guys’ opinions of _themselves_ and how that affects their approach to life. Today, our popular understanding of what constitutes a “Nice Guy” (in the negative sense) aligns closely with Glover’s definition.

#### Intellectual Context

Within the online _manosphere_ , two texts pop up again and again as required reading for men seeking to improve themselves by fully embracing themselves and their masculinity: _NMMNG_ and David Deida’s 1997 _The Way of the Superior Man_.

Although both authors acknowledge that _men lose their way when they repress their true selves_ , Glover spends more time discussing the traits, origins, and recovery process of Nice Guys (aka “Non-Superior Men”). Deida, on the other hand, focuses more heavily on the inner, spiritual life of the Superior Man (aka Ideal Man) and how it affects his world approach.

Because these texts have equally influenced men’s movements of the 21st century (and overall discussions about masculinity), we will continue to compare and contrast their messages throughout this guide.

#### The Book’s Impact

The fact that Glover was able to quit his private practice as an LMFT and focus on helping Nice Guys full time (and continues to do so almost two decades later) shows how much of a community has arisen around his program. However, despite Glover’s good intentions and desire to help men become more self-accepting and less bitter—particularly towards women—**the online communities that have formed around male-centric texts like _NMMNG_ and _Superior Man_ have taken on a life of their own.**

The most controversial of these communities is arguably “The Red Pill.” Deemed so offensive by Reddit that the forum has been quarantined since 2018, this community of men believes women—especially feminists—have stripped all men of their masculine identity. More specifically, the community discusses “sexual strategy” and rigid gender roles.

Despite the fact that Glover actively criticizes Nice Guys who are resentful and furious towards women, many of the men in this community adopted his book as gospel, interpreting it in ways that aligned with their views. For example, when discussing boundaries, Glover says bad behavior from your partner shouldn’t be tolerated or rewarded. He then provides an example: If your puppy kept peeing inside the house, you wouldn’t reward it with a treat for doing so.

While the use of a dog metaphor here might not have been the most sensitive, the Red Pill community took it even farther, interpreting this to mean, “Training a woman or child is no different than training a dog.” Although _NMMNG_ is meant to steer men _away_ from this kind of thinking, Glover’s hard stance on gender roles—including the implication that women and feminism are partially at fault for the existence of Nice Guys—made room for the Red Pill interpretation of his work.

This being said, _NMMNG_ seems to have hit peak popularity within the Red Pill community years ago (it has since been replaced by other texts in the forum’s sidebar). More recently, the book is being reclaimed and discussed by ex-Red Pill men. Having decided to leave the manosphere, these men seem to discuss _NMMNG_ with greater nuance, acknowledging that while the text was helpful in guiding them on their journey to self-acceptance, they disagree with some of Glover’s personal opinions on gender and women.

These (somewhat) opposite communities both find value and insight in _NMMNG_ , demonstrating the text’s ability to be interpreted in different ways based on who’s reading it. Either way, **Glover’s text remains both controversial _and_ useful decades later.**

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

As a controversial text, _NMMNG_ has provoked strong positive _and_ negative reactions (although 76% of Amazon reviews give it five stars). As we mentioned, the book first gained popularity on conservative talk-radio and TV, but it ultimately gained a wider readership.

Positive reviewers say they appreciate Glover’s concrete tips and activities, many stating the book “cured” them of their Nice Guy mindset or “saved their life.” Many men say it’s a clear, accessible, and executable program that they saw themselves in.

There are a number of female reviewers who appreciate the book as well. Some women were happy to see the program work for their husband and ultimately improve their relationship, while others read the book for themselves, noting that everyone— _male or not_ —could benefit from much of Glover’s advice.

This being said, there are those who criticize Glover. One of the main complaints from reviewers—of which we saw proof of in the Red Pill community—was that the book is sometimes so vague that two different people with totally different values may come away having read what seems like two different books. Glover’s gender essentialism—the idea that men and women have intrinsic traits due to their gender—is another point of contention for some, as he encourages men to embrace their “innate” masculine qualities.

Further, in her review 15 years after _NMMNG_ was published, author and coach Julia Goodman said she thinks Glover under-emphasizes the ways in which the Nice Guy way of thinking harms women and over-emphasizes how this mindset prevents Nice Guys from getting what they want in life. Knowing Glover’s intended audience (Nice Guys) and the importance he places on defining yourself as a man separate from the women in your life, one can imagine this was an intentional choice.

**Many negative reviewers acknowledged they still found parts of the book useful,** even if they didn’t always agree with Glover’s points and how he presents them.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Basing most of his arguments on his experiences as a psychotherapist, Glover relies on observation and anecdotal evidence more than specific studies or statistics. This approach makes _NMMNG_ less like a straightforward non-fiction book and more like a multi-step self-improvement program. Here are a few points to keep in mind if you wish to complete Glover’s program in full:

  * Because this book suggests major changes in thinking and behavior, Glover recommends Nice Guys’ partners read along and join in on the process.
  * Glover also encourages you to find “safe people,” including a network of other men, to aid you in your journey. This network could include your therapist, a support group, honest friends, or trusted community members. 
  * The book includes concrete “Breaking Free Activities” attached to every chapter. To experience the full program, refer to these activities in addition to those in this guide.



### Our Approach in This Guide

Glover’s original text is divided into nine chapters (not including the introduction and epilogue), each of which can be grouped into three distinct sections:

  1. Defining the Nice Guy and where this mindset comes from
  2. Exploring the main roadblocks that perpetuate the Nice Guy mindset (and how to overcome them)
  3. Providing specific strategies that Nice Guys can use to improve their love life, sex life, and career



Within each section (and chapter), Glover does a lot of jumping back and forth between problems and solutions, weaving in patient anecdotes, executable exercises, and—especially in later chapters—many repeated points (presented in slightly different contexts). To reduce repetition and streamline the text’s focus on problems and solutions, we’ve combined some of the book’s chapters—for a total of five parts—to group problems together, then solutions together. We’ve also omitted anecdotes and most of the exercises.

This guide will start by teaching you what it means to be a Nice Guy and why it’s a problem. Then, in Part 2, we’ll explore where this mindset comes from. Part 3 will focus on how Nice Guys live for others and the strategies you can implement to start living for yourself. Part 4 examines how Nice Guys surrender their power and what you can do to reclaim it. Finally, in Part 5, we’ll dive into strategies that will help you find success in love, sex, and your career. **Ultimately, this guide will help you go from a passive Nice Guy to a confident, self-accepting Ideal Man who lives life on his own terms.**
