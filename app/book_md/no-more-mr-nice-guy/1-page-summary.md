## 1-Page Summary

Do you pride yourself on being the _nicest guy in the world_? **Does your fear of disapproval lead you to people-please, avoid conflict, and repress parts of yourself?** If this sounds like you, you might be what Dr. Robert Glover calls a _Nice Guy_. Released in 2003, _No More Mr. Nice Guy_ (referred to throughout this guide as _NMMNG_) by marriage and family psychotherapist Dr. Robert Glover helps you understand and conquer the frustrating—and often manipulative—Nice Guy mindset so that you can become what Glover calls a fully realized and self-accepting “Integrated Male” (who we’ll call the “Ideal Man” for simplicity).

### The Nice Guy and His Origins

In the face of struggle, dissatisfied men use the tactic they know best: _Be nice_. However, according to Glover, “being nice” rarely yields the desired outcome, and Nice Guys’ insecurities frequently emerge as passive-aggressive or dishonest behavior. **Their repetitive, ineffective approach to life leads to unsatisfying intimate relationships, bitterness, and disappointment.** We’ll explore the intricacies of Nice Guy behavior, and its consequences, later in this guide.

So, how can Nice Guys improve their lives? According to Glover, the key is to become an _Ideal Man._ The Ideal Man is—above all—self-accepting. Unlike the Nice Guy, he’s secure in his self-image, masculinity, and sexuality. This allows him to live the life he wants.

> **The Ideal Man and The Superior Man**
> 
> Within the online _manosphere_ , two texts pop up again and again as required reading for men seeking to improve themselves by fully embracing themselves and their masculinity: _NMMNG_ and David Deida’s 1997 _The Way of the Superior Man_. Both authors end up at similar conclusions: **To be a real man, you must wholeheartedly accept yourself as you are.**
> 
> The Superior Man shares many traits with the Ideal Man, such as the ability to face his fears, release shame and self-doubt, and accept life’s challenges as opportunities for growth. However, Deida’s male archetype differs slightly from Glover’s in his spiritual connection to the world at large. For example, Deida believes the Superior Man is in touch with both masculine and feminine energy—within himself, in those around him, and in the push and pull of the universe. He also notes that the Superior Man knows how to be present and approach every situation with an open and loving heart.
> 
> While _NMMNG_ never implies these traits are _not_ part of the Ideal Man, the spiritual aspects of Deida’s Superior Man aren’t a focus for the psychoanalytical Glover.

#### When Nice Guys Aren’t So Nice

Glover stresses that **in their frustration with life, Nice Guys are often far from _nice_.** Their indirect and avoidant nature results in an angry cycle of self-victimization:

**Nice Guy does something to _appear_ nice → He stews in silent resentment when things don’t go his way → Unable to contain his anger any longer, he lashes out **

Overall, this cycle of repression, self-pity, and fear brings out Nice Guys’ undesirable characteristics, such as dishonesty and manipulation.

(Shortform note: Psychoanalyst Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries presents a similar cycle when discussing victimhood, or the “victim mentality.” Just as a Nice Guy believes he must people-please to get what he wants out of life, de Vries’s _victim_ stage is defined by a belief that all control over your life rests in the hands of external forces. And like a Nice Guy’s eventual angry outbursts, his _victimizer_ stage sees the “victim’s” feelings of powerlessness turn into rage. However, unlike Glover, de Vries adds a final _rescuer_ stage in which the “victim” decides to “rescue” others in an attempt to fix everyone’s problems except their own. When someone tries to help them in return, they invent reasons to resist it to maintain their status as a victim.)

#### The Nice Guy Mindset

According to Glover, the Nice Guy’s misguided actions are driven by the following mindset:

**Conceal your true self → Be who others want you to be → Have a perfect, fulfilling life**

Where does this inaccurate life approach come from? **Glover says it stems from a boy learning—explicitly or implicitly from his parents—that he must be “good” to be loved.** This belief is the result of a vicious sequence of abandonment, shame, and self-doubt:

**Abandonment:** Glover begins with the fact that a child is completely dependent on his parents. This—along with the childish belief that the world revolves around him—causes the boy to interpret all forms of inattention or neglect as _abandonment_ , which he fears _and_ blames himself for.

> **Childhood Abandonment and Insecure Attachment**
> 
> Is childhood abandonment a crucial factor in Nice Guys' later development of unhealthy relationships with others? Psychological research on childhood attachment may suggest so.
> 
> According to attachment theory in developmental psychology, children form either a _secure_ or _insecure_ “attachment style”—or behaviors as they relate to our emotional bonds—based on parent-child interactions. The theory also asserts that we carry these attachment styles into our adult relationships.
> 
> In their book _Attached_ , Amir Levine and Rachel S. F. Heller describe two insecure styles: “anxious attachment”—defined by a constant need for reassurance from your partner—and “avoidant attachment”—defined by a desire to keep your partner at arm’s length. Both of these styles result from abandonment as a child. Glover recognized similar behaviors among Nice Guys in relationships: many of his patients struggled to be fully intimate with their partner, either smothering them with attention or neglecting them altogether. Thus, we might assume many of these men were abandoned and developed attachment issues in childhood.

**Shame:** Glover continues by noting that if a boy feels he’s at fault for his abandonment, he’ll eventually believe there’s something wrong with him. From there, he’ll try to change himself to gain his parents’ attention. These self-loathing beliefs are called _toxic shame_.

(Shortform note: In _The Power Of Vulnerability, _Brené Brown differentiates between shame and guilt. **While _guilt_ arises when we feel bad about our actions, _shame_ comes from feeling bad about _ourselves_**. And unlike guilt, shame is something we tie to our identity. So when a boy experiences _shame_ following abandonment, he’s not under the belief that his actions are bad, but that _he himself is inherently bad_.)

**Self-Doubt:** Finally, Glover discusses what happens when a child internalizes his toxic shame: He experiences self-doubt and adopts defense strategies to ward it off. Glover says **budding Nice Guys center their coping mechanisms around gaining approval.**

(Shortform note: Although self-doubt can be paralyzing, it can also be helpful; a topic Melody Wilding explores in her Ted Talk on using negative thoughts to your advantage. Wilding says that instead of approaching self-doubt as an enemy meant to be obliterated with positivity, you’d be more productive to make it your ally. To do this, she says to employ the _name it and reframe it_ strategy: First, “name” the doubtful stories you tell yourself so you can recognize them when they arise. From there, _reframe_ your self-doubt: Respond to it honestly and answer its concerns. This will affirm your ability to handle the worst should it happen.)

### Problems for the Nice Guy

Now that you know what a Nice Guy is, let’s explore the main problems holding him back from a life of self-acceptance, empowerment, and satisfaction.

#### Nice Guys Live for Others

Whether people-pleasing or caring for everyone but themselves, Nice Guys live their life for everyone but themselves.

**They seek external validation:** Glover says that Nice Guys use _attachments_ , or external signifiers, to win others’ approval and become “good” in their eyes. Attachments are behaviors, traits, or things you “attach” to your personal value (like always being the first among your friends to own the newest iPhone). Nice Guys don’t value or do these things for themselves but for _the sake of others_.

> **Non-Attachment in Buddhism**
> 
> Glover isn't the only person to highlight the pitfalls of attachments. For centuries, Buddhist teachings have explored this topic, including the concept of "non-attachment," or a state of being in which you sever unhealthy attachments. In the context of Buddhism, attachments aren’t the things you own, but the things in your life that own you. Non-attachment doesn’t mean you can’t buy yourself something nice or enter into a meaningful relationship, but it does stress you **_not allow these things to control your life_.**
> 
> We can apply this definition of “attachments” and “non-attachment” to Nice Guys: If a man thinks he’s good because his car is always clean, then he’s owned by the need to clean his car. He won’t be free until this act is no longer an attachment but something he does in the present moment for himself (simply to do it).

**They conceal their shortcomings and mistakes:** To avoid disapproval, Glover explains that Nice Guys go out of their way to hide their true selves, including their perceived flaws. He says to avoid acknowledging their “bad” true selves, Nice Guys will try to fix the _reactions_ to their mistakes rather than accept responsibility for their actions. When “found out,” Nice Guys may become defensive, make excuses, or rationalize.

> **Why We Get Defensive (and How to Stop)**
> 
> Why do Nice Guys react to conflict or criticism this way? In his book _First Things First_ , Stephen Covey notes that we often respond with excuses and rationalization when what we want to hear differs from what our conscience tells us is right. To deal with this inner tension, we feel we must explain to ourselves why we’re acting against our better judgment. According to Covey, these are the best ways to avoid this type of behavior:
> 
>   * Recognize how you typically respond to this kind of inner tension—are you an over-explainer? Someone who gets defensive?
> 
>   * Listen to your conscience when it’s trying to tell you something.
> 
>   * Make _principle-centered_ choices, as strong values keep you on track.
> 
> 


**They won’t acknowledge their needs:** According to Glover, Nice Guys are afraid of others knowing they have needs (so much so that they’ll unconsciously avoid situations in which their needs are likely to be met). This is because their childhood abandonment issues have led them to believe that being needless and wantless is an _inherently good trait_.

Due to this skewed belief, Glover says Nice Guys lean on a form of manipulation called _covert contracts_ to meet their needs. These are unspoken, unconscious agreements that, to Nice Guys, are implied understandings, but outside parties have no knowledge of their existence. The hope is that both parties will meet each other’s needs without ever acknowledging them: The Nice Guy will do something for someone, and get something back in return. A common example of a covert contract is giving a compliment _just to hear one back_. In this case, your kind words didn’t come from a genuine place but**** from a personal need for external validation.

> **Why We’re Manipulated by Covert Contracts**
> 
> Although Glover says covert contracts are often ineffective, we do see them “work” to an extent in our day-to-day lives. If a coworker surprises you with a holiday gift and you’re empty-handed, you feel guilty for not giving them something in return despite knowing you never agreed to exchange gifts. What makes us feel this way?
> 
> It has to do with what Robert Cialdini—in his book _Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion_ —calls _the reciprocity principle_. According to Cialdini, this principle is the innate indebtedness we feel when someone does something for us (even if we didn’t need or want that something in the first place). Cialdini discusses this principle in relation to business and customer relationships, but we can apply it to our interactions with covert contracts. They “work” on us because they _take advantage_ of our reciprocal nature.

#### Nice Guys Deny Their Power

Nice Guys often feel powerless because they deny their abilities and their masculinity.

**They act like victims in the face of adversity:** Glover says Nice Guys often think they lack control in all aspects of life, which only feeds into their feelings of resentment, frustration, and victimization. Glover adds that although _unpredictability is a fact of life_ , Nice Guys have a particularly hard time embracing life’s ups and downs because they (mistakenly) believe life can be straightforward and smooth.

(Shortform note: If having a smooth, easy life isn’t really possible, why are we inclined to believe it is? Psychotherapist Sian Morgan-Crossley explains that this belief stems in part from our tendency to compare ourselves to others. Under the false impression that everyone around us has it easy, we wonder why our lives aren’t easy, too.)

**They’re attached to their mothers:** According to Glover, Nice Guys who grew up with emotionally needy mothers remain devoted to them in adulthood. This relationship is normal and healthy in boyhood, but eventually, boys must grow up and bond with men to become healthy, masculine adults, and mothers must let their sons go. If a Nice Guy doesn’t have a strong parental presence, this shift may not occur.

> **_Iron John_ and the Transition of Boys to Men**
> 
> Glover isn't the only author to discuss the idea that boys must be ushered into manhood by their fathers. Robert Bly also touches on this topic in _Iron John: A Book About Men_ (1990). The book focuses on the development of the “soft male” in the 1950s, while trying to reclaim a masculine identity Bly and Glover agree has been somewhat lost to time.
> 
> Like Glover, Bly notes that boys must be initiated into adulthood with the help of their fathers. Unlike Glover, Bly says it’s a son’s job to break away from his mother, as she won’t consciously release him to the dangerous world until he proves he can handle it. With this goal in mind, Bly stresses the importance of initiating a boy into the sphere of men to prepare him for this break.

**They’re detached from masculinity and other men:** Due to their poor paternal relationships, Glover says Nice Guys grew up associating masculinity with its negative traits, such as aggression and cruelty. Not only does this lead them to suppress their own masculinity (and thus good parts of themselves), but it also makes them isolated from other men. This causes Nice Guys to miss out on the support and companionship that accompanies male community.

(Shortform note: Everyone needs friends (whether they’re a Nice Guy or not). In fact, research has shown that friendships (or a lack of them) affect our physical and mental well-being. One study found men’s male friendships in particular provided more emotional stability, vulnerability, and social fulfilment than their relationships with their girlfriends.)

#### Nice Guys Keep Themselves From a Satisfying Life

Here are some more reasons Nice Guys fail to live the life they envision:

**They don’t know when to say goodbye:** According to Glover, Nice Guys are less likely to leave dysfunctional relationships because they _dread loneliness_. They would rather stay in a familiar, toxic environment than leave and face themselves.

> **How to Prepare for a Breakup**
> 
> Glover isn’t the only author to discuss the struggle of ending a toxic relationship. In their book _Attached_ , Amir Levine and Rachel Heller also note that we’re likely to avoid breakups because our brain anticipates pain and loneliness in the future. Here’s their advice on how to mentally prepare yourself for a breakup:
> 
>   * **Reflect on the reality of your relationship.** How does your partner treat you? Do you trust each other?
> 
>   * **Bolster your network of safe people _before_ you break up. **This way, they’ll be prepared to support you when you need it most.
> 
>   * **Note your reasons for leaving.** Feeling nostalgic? Write down why things ended. Ask your friends and family to remind you why you left in the first place.
> 
> 


**They assume they know what women want:** Glover emphasizes that women aren’t attracted to “jerks” as many Nice Guys assume. Rather, they’re attracted to fully realized, confident humans. Nice Guys try too hard to be “nice,” “right,” and “good” all the time, which makes for a self-conscious and lifeless shell of a person.

(Shortform note: Why do we find confidence so attractive? It has a lot to do with our own self-esteem. When someone is confident, we tend to assume good things about their skills and personality, often believing that they’re good at all the things we’re bad at. We’re thus drawn to them, as we feel they can protect or look after us.)

**They settle for bad sex:** Glover explains that a Nice Guy may engage his partner in half-hearted (bad) sex through manipulative or sneaky tactics. He thinks if he focuses hard enough on putting her in a good mood, she will enthusiastically reciprocate no matter what. But this tactic only leads to frustrating sex. **Still, to many Nice Guys,_bad sex is better than no sex_. **They continue to engage in partner-focused sexual encounters—which Glover discourages, as it means they ignore their own sexual needs.

(Shortform note: Despite the similarities between Glover’s Ideal Man and Deida’s Superior Man, these authors’ approaches to sex are quite different. While Glover _discourages_ the Ideal Man from partner-focused sex—so he can focus on his own needs—Deida suggests the Superior Man turn his focus outward by prioritizing connection with his woman over his own pleasure. He believes the complete union of masculine and feminine energy is the ultimate goal of sex. Glover, on the other hand, believes _pleasure_ is the main objective.)

### Solutions for the Ideal Man

We know what’s holding Nice Guys back, but what can you do to live your life as a self-accepting and fulfilled Ideal Man?

#### The Ideal Man Lives for Himself

Here are some of Glover’s strategies for reaching a point of self-acceptance and living life for yourself:

**Self-reflect:** Before you can accept yourself, you must look inward and recognize your approval-seeking habits. In order to ID them, ask yourself what _you_ want and what _you_ need, and which habits do and don’t serve _your_ wishes.

> **Ask _What_ , Not _Why_ When Self-Reflecting**
> 
> The ultimate goal of self-reflection is self-awareness, but does all introspection lead to this outcome? Organizational psychologist Tasha Eurich says _not necessarily._ Eurich cites multiple studies that show **self-reflection isn’t directly correlated to our self-awareness**. This doesn’t mean self-reflection is a useless act but that we must do it _with intention_ by asking ourselves _what_ instead of _why_.
> 
> For example, instead of asking _why_ you have a specific attachment, you might ask “ _What_ does this behavior do for me?” or “ _What_ effect does this behavior have on my self-worth?” Unlike _why_ questions, which may prompt us to think of our past or personal failings, _what_ questions help us name and understand our current emotions or even imagine our potential.

**Express your emotions with safe people:** Exposing your true self can be scary, so do it with people you trust. Glover says being vulnerable around our safe people helps us combat self-sabotaging beliefs and serves as a reminder that we’re loved, even when we slip up.

(Shortform note: Your safe people can also keep you on track and prevent you from developing tunnel vision. In _Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ , Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves note that in times of distress, we often get bogged down in the details. But outside parties provide an objective perspective and can help us see the bigger picture, decipher our emotions, and hold us accountable as we move forward.)

**Take responsibility for your needs:** According to Glover, when you prioritize yourself, you assert new, productive beliefs about yourself, your needs, and how to meet them. Understand that _everyone has needs_ and prioritizing yourself is the only mature, direct, and honest means of satisfying yours.

(Shortform note: Although Deida agrees that the Superior Man is responsible for himself, his interpretation of what this responsibility _is_ differs from Glover’s. Deida believes that in his intimate relationships, the Superior Man is responsible not necessarily for his needs, but for knowing his purpose in life and using it to set goals to keep himself and his woman on track. As a man, Deida says it’s your responsibility to cut through female moods and emotions—as well as your own preoccupations with your duties—and provide you both with a clear direction.)

#### The Ideal Man Embraces His Power

Here are some of Glover’s strategies for embracing your personal power and masculinity so you can take control of your life:

**Welcome fear:** Glover asserts the only way to overcome vicious anxiety and fear is to acknowledge it and face what currently scares you.**** You create new beliefs each time you push through fear.

(Shortform note: Facing your fears is easier said than done, but we can look again to _The Way of the Superior Man_ for advice. When you’re feeling uncomfortable, anxious, or afraid, Deida recommends you let go and open yourself to uncertainty by breathing deeply and speaking your fears. These exercises will allow you to be mentally and physically present with your emotions so you can acknowledge them and move on.)

**Set boundaries:** It’s hard to embrace your personal power if you let others walk all over you. So, you must take responsibility for how others treat you. Glover stresses that others have no incentive to change if you reinforce their bad behavior by giving in. Once you realize this, you’ll find changing your _own behavior_ (by setting firm boundaries) is a simpler, more rewarding path.

(Shortform note: Nervous about setting boundaries with a loved one or your boss? Psychology scholar Mariana Bockarova encourages you to practice being assertive in all situations to get used to enforcing boundaries. How can you talk to your partner about being mistreated if you can’t tell a server he got your order wrong? By starting small, you can build your way up to setting limits with your loved ones.)

**Develop integrity:** Instead of defaulting to deceit out of fear, Glover says Nice Guys must develop integrity. According to Glover, the best way to live with integrity is to ask yourself, “ _What do I think is right?_ ” Then do it. Honesty gives you the power to approach everything with clarity, direction, and sincerity.

(Shortform note: How do you know what’s “right”? In _Dare to Lead_ , Brené Brown stresses the importance of developing strong personal values to guide you through difficult matters of integrity. Without guiding values, we’re more likely to take the easy way out than do what’s _right_. For example, if you value accountability, you could set a guideline for yourself that says you will own up to your mistakes and avoid making excuses when you do so.)

**Bond with other men:** Whether hanging out with friends or admiring a role model, Glover urges you to develop solid relationships with other men. Glover says Nice Guys are less likely to smother, resent, or manipulate their partners when they have others they can turn to for support. Additionally, friends and role models can provide new, healthy models of masculinity.

> **How Do You Make Friends as an Adult Man?**
> 
> Bonding with other boys in childhood is relatively easy, but what about making friends in adulthood? Speaking from experience, author Ross McCammon explains how he was able to make and develop adult friendships with other men:
> 
>   * **Utilize your connections.** The partner of your partner’s friends and the parents of your kids’ friends are great places to start.
> 
>   * **Turn vague plans into reality.** Intentionally schedule your hangouts—even better, make them recurring.
> 
>   * **Follow up with texts.** Continue communicating when you’re not together.
> 
> 


#### The Ideal Man Lives a Satisfying Life

Here are a few more strategies Glover suggests you embrace to live a satisfying life as an Ideal Man:

**Take a new approach the next time around:** When entering into new relationships, Glover says to shake things up.**** Instead of falling back on bad habits (like not setting boundaries) or unproductive mindsets (that your needs don’t matter, for example), start from a place of integrity, self-confidence, and vulnerability from the get-go. Keep things from becoming toxic in the first place.

(Shortform note: Following Glover’s advice and getting a fresh start after a bad relationship can be a bit daunting. When entering into a new relationship after a toxic one, The Good Men Project suggests keeping an eye out for red and green flags. It’s easy to ignore someone’s flaws when you’re just getting to know them, but take note of any concerning behaviors. Don’t forget the positive signs—what makes this person seem like they’ll be trustworthy and supportive?)

**Ask for help:** No one can do everything alone, so Glover stresses that Nice Guys learn to ask for help.**** Taking control of your life includes utilizing the people and resources at your disposal.

> **How to Effectively Ask for Help**
> 
> Asking for help can be intimidating, especially if you’re a Nice Guy who’s not used to acknowledging when he needs it. But according to business professor Wayne Baker, the most effective way to get help is by making a request that’s SMART:
> 
>   * **Specific:** Vague requests are less likely to be acted upon.
> 
>   * **Meaningful:** Explain to whoever you’re asking _why_ you need the help you do.
> 
>   * **Action:** Tell the other person what tasks they can do to help.
> 
>   * **Realistic:** Make sure you’re not asking someone to do the impossible.
> 
>   * **Time:** Give the other person a deadline or timeframe for your request.
> 
> 


**Practice healthy masturbation:** Glover says Nice Guys need to learn to have good (consensual, natural, vulnerable) sex. One way to practice the tenets of good sex is through _healthy masturbation_. Like good sex, it’s about doing what feels good and accepting responsibility for your needs and pleasure.

> **How to Practice Healthy Masturbation**
> 
> Many sexual and mental health professionals agree that there are _healthy_ and _unhealthy_ ways to masturbate. Here are some tips for practicing healthy masturbation:
> 
>   * **Take it slow:** Don’t rush through your pleasure. Take your time by experimenting with other parts of your body or changing the speed of your stroke.
> 
>   * **Prep your environment:** Set the mood for yourself. Make your environment comfortable, sensual, and distraction free.
> 
>   * **Pay attention:** Be aware of your bodily responses as you pleasure yourself—your breath, your heartbeat, and any tension you might be holding. Understanding your body will only help you control your sexual functions with yourself or with a partner.
