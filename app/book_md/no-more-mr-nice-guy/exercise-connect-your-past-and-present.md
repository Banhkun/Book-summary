## Exercise: Connect Your Past and Present

Reflect on your childhood to understand the development of your paradigms (or self-limiting beliefs) and coping mechanisms.

* * *

Describe a time in your childhood when you felt neglected or ashamed of yourself (either during a general period or specific incident). What messages about the "right" way to feel or behave may have reinforced your feelings of neglect or shame?

What coping mechanisms did you use to ward off these negative feelings? (For example, did you act out for attention? Become a perfectionist? Hide your failures from others?)

Do you notice any remnants of these coping mechanisms in your life today?

Think about a “safe person” (someone you trust) you would be comfortable sharing this experience with. What kind of feedback or support would you seek from them? (For example, do you just need someone to listen? Be your mirror? Provide affirmations?)
