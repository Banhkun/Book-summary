## Part 5.1: Additional Problems for the Nice Guy | Chapters 7-9

In our final part, we’ll address some additional problems and solutions specific to three Nice Guy problem areas: love, career, and sex. This section will further explore some of the unproductive behaviors that affect these parts of a Nice Guy’s life.

(Shortform note: Although Glover discusses a Nice Guy’s love life and career separately, we have chosen to combine these two categories. Why? Glover states that most Nice Guys come to him with complaints about their unsatisfying love life. However, they tend to realize the self-sabotaging behaviors interfering with their intimate relationships are the same ones preventing them from having the type of career or life they really want. Like Glover, we noticed this overlap in what holds a Nice Guy back from a satisfying love life _and_ career, as well as what he can do for similar success in these areas.)

### Love and Career

Many of the unproductive beliefs and dysfunctional dynamics we’ve already discussed negatively affect a Nice Guy’s ability to be intimate or take charge of his career. But Glover notes a few more behaviors standing between Nice Guys and success in these two areas:

#### They Resist the Generosity of Others

In their quest to be needless saints that must “fix” everything themselves, Glover says **Nice Guys are often poor receivers.** When someone tries to attend to a Nice Guy’s needs—emotional, sexual, work-related, or otherwise—they challenge his negative beliefs about his self-worth and cause inner tension.

Glover explains that to avoid these negative feelings, **Nice Guys will unconsciously avoid situations where their needs are likely to be met.** For example, they’ll seek out needy people, communicate in vague ways, and self-sabotage. And because they rely on covert contracts (assuming no one _wants_ to meet their needs) they rarely _ask_ for help.

> **How to Help Those Who Don’t Want It**
> 
> We’ve discussed earlier in this guide how the victim mentality, as well as being a Nice Guy, can cause this type of resistance to support—so, what do you do when a Nice Guy or someone in the midst of the victim mentality doesn’t want your help? Experts have some advice:
> 
>   * **Listen to them:** According to psychiatrist Mark Goulston, instead of offering advice outright, stop and listen to the person who needs help. You might _think_ you know what’s best for the other person, but providing an attentive and empathetic ear will ensure you understand their needs and where they’re coming from. Goulston says the more a person opens up to you, the less isolated or misunderstood they will feel, which should encourage them to seek out your advice, help, or understanding ear in the future.
> 
>   * **Do your research:** ReachOut, a mental health resource hub, encourages you to explore options that could help the person you’re concerned about. This doesn’t mean bombarding the other person with information and resources but arming yourself with useful knowledge so you’re prepared if they do ask for your help.
> 
>   * **Be an example:** Psychologist Thomas G. Plante agrees that giving unsolicited advice rarely works. Instead, he suggests leading by example. As observational learners, we’re more likely to follow the _actions_ of others than we are to follow their advice. Model healthy habits, including asking for help when you need it.
> 
>   * **Get help yourself:** Mental Health America—a resource network—notes that trying to help someone who doesn’t want it can be a draining and frustrating process. They encourage you to seek out your own help during this time. Not only will you be in a better mindset to support others, but you’ll also gain insight into how to approach your interactions with those who need help.
> 
>   * **Don’t force them to act:** At the end of the day, you can’t make someone do something or be someone they’re not. Addictions writer Katherine Schreiber explains that trying to force someone to do what you think they should do only leads to more stress and negative emotions for the other person, including shame, guilt, and feelings of dependency. (This will only work to perpetuate the victim cycle compelling them to avoid help.)

#### They Don’t Know When to Say Goodbye

According to Glover, Nice Guys are less likely to leave dysfunctional or toxic relationships because they _dread loneliness_. Rather than leave and face themselves, they work endlessly to “fix” their partner. This keeps them in a state of resentment (remember the victim cycle). So when they do try to end things, Glover says it’s usually in a manipulative, dishonest, or accusatory manner.

> **How to Break Up (and Make It Stick)**
> 
> Glover isn’t the only author to discuss the struggle of ending a toxic relationship. In their book _Attached_ , Amir Levine and Rachel Heller dedicate an entire chapter to ending such relationships. Like Glover, they note that we’re likely to avoid breakups at all costs because our brain anticipates pain and loneliness in the future. And when we do break up, our anxiety may cause us to suddenly forget all the red flags and “rebound” with our ex.
> 
> So how do you mentally prepare yourself to break up _for real_? Levine and Heller have some advice:
> 
>   * **Understand your relationship for what it really is.** Reflect and ask questions like: How does your partner treat you? Are you afraid to let your family and friends witness this treatment? How does your partner behave around others compared to you? Does either of you feel compelled to spy on the other? Do you trust each other?
> 
>   * **Bolster your network of safe people _before_ you break up. **Be honest with those you trust most—let them know you’re thinking of ending things with your partner. That way, they’ll be prepared to support you when you need it most.
> 
>   * **Do what comforts you.** Whether you arrange to stay with a friend for a few nights or indulge in some post-breakup ice cream, do what makes you feel good.
> 
>   * **Don’t let guilt and shame overtake you.** If you _do_ call your ex or even go for the rebound, don’t beat yourself up about it (this will simply bring out more bad habits). In the same vein, don’t be ashamed of any of the emotions you’re feeling. Whether it’s deep pain or a sense of relief, your feelings are valid and should be acknowledged.
> 
>   * **Write down the reasons you left.** If you notice yourself viewing your relationship through rose-tinted glasses, take out a piece of paper and write down why things ended. Having trouble remembering? Ask your friends and family to remind you why you left in the first place.
> 
> 


##### Not Knowing When to Say Goodbye at Work

Glover explains that Nice Guys will also remain in a toxic work environment because **they’re able to recreate familiar, ineffective relationships.** Putting up with a familiar—albeit less than ideal—reality is less scary than making a change. However, it ensures Nice Guys remain stagnant.

> **Should You Quit Your Job?**
> 
> Like a breakup, it may be hard to know when it’s time to walk away from your job. Forbes contributor Caroline Castrillon has some guidelines to help you make that decision. You’re probably ready to call it quits if:
> 
>   * You dread going to work or feel uncomfortable while you’re there.
> 
>   * Your poor work-life balance is causing burnout.
> 
>   * Your work requires you to manipulate or compromise your values.
> 
>   * You’re bored because you’re not being challenged.
> 
>   * You see no opportunities for growth.
> 
>   * Your pay is not equal to your position, performance, and/or skills.
> 
> 


### Sex

Glover says that **the pinnacle of approval for the Nice Guy is _sex_.** But the following issues— combined with their lack of self-acceptance and their tendency to ignore their own needs—almost always ensure Nice Guys miss out on a satisfying sex life.

#### They Assume They Know What Women Want

According to Glover, **Nice Guys incorrectly assume a woman is sexually available so long as she’s in a good mood.** This makes them think they’re likely to be “rewarded” with sex if they can keep a woman from getting angry and fix all her immediate problems.

(Shortform note: In 2008, a qualitative review examined multiple studies on how different genders perceived others’ sexual availability. Most of the reviewed studies found men more likely to assign sexual intent to behaviors and actions than women (even if the behaviors or actions in question were not sexual). While the result of these kinds of misconceptions _can_ be as harmful as sexual assault, they may also lead to much less serious outcomes, such as minor embarrassment. If the average man is already more likely to misread “sexual” signs from women, we can assume the average Nice Guy—with his skewed belief that “bad mood = sexually unavailable”—isn’t as skilled at interpreting women’s behavior as he may think.)

Further, Glover emphasizes that women aren’t attracted to “jerks,” as many Nice Guys assume. Rather, they’re attracted to fully realized, confident, independent humans. He states that when Nice Guys grapple with simultaneous feelings of worthiness (“I’m so nice”) and unworthiness (“But I’m so bad”), their inner tension leads to a suppression of the self that can make them appear tense and boring. Ultimately, trying too hard to be “nice,” “right,” and “good” all the time makes for a lifeless (and thus unattractive) shell of a person.

(Shortform note: Why do we find confidence so attractive? It has a lot to do with our own self-esteem. When someone is confident, we tend to assume good things about their skills and personality, often believing that they’re good at all the things we’re bad at. We’re thus drawn to them, as we feel they can protect or look after us. People who are less confident are especially drawn to those who are positive, capable leaders, and confidence is a major indicator of these traits.)

#### They’re Ashamed of and Hide Their Sexual Compulsions

In childhood, Glover says many Nice Guys used arousal as a form of distraction from stress and loneliness. Thus, **compulsions like porn and masturbation became crutches in times of discomfort.**

Glover explains that as children, **Nice Guys thought they were bad for being sexual and therefore practiced their sexuality in secret.** In adulthood, Nice Guys still feel ashamed of their sexual impulses and habits. Because they’re afraid of getting caught, Nice Guys exert a disproportionate amount of time and energy concealing their sexuality.

> **The Effects of Sexual Shame**
> 
> We’ve discussed shame as an integral factor of the Nice Guy mindset, but _sexual shame_ in particular can have serious effects on your mental (or even physical) health. Glover mentions this type of guilt is likely to lead to sexual addictions, but here are a few more outcomes as explained by clinical social worker Rachel Keller:
> 
>   * **Decreased sexual arousal or pleasure:** Mental blocks can prevent your natural sexual responses from functioning properly. Arousal and pleasure may be buried so deeply beneath a layer of shame that they have a hard time coming to the surface.
> 
>   * **Feelings of disgust:** When guilt and shame are tied to sex and the body from an early age, you may respond to things we deem sexual with disgust. This includes being repulsed by your body, genitals, or desires. Being disgusted with bodily functions may cause you to ask, “Is something wrong with me?” even if what you’re experiencing is natural.
> 
>   * **Psychological splitting:** If you actively conceal your sexuality—as Glover says many Nice Guys do—this sexual part of yourself may “split off” from the rest of you, thus enforcing a “bad” self and a “good” self. This will only increase feelings of shame and a need for secrecy, as your “good” self continues to judge your “bad” self.
> 
>   * **Problems with communication:** Discussing things you’re ashamed of is particularly hard, so trying to work through issues in your sex life in these circumstances often leads to frustration, shutting down, and avoiding the real issues out of embarrassment.
> 
> 


#### They Settle for Bad Sex

According to Glover, Nice Guys will distract from their own shame and anxiety by focusing solely on their partner’s pleasure. This may sound generous, but it guarantees a one-way sexual experience in which their partner isn’t able to reciprocate. **Partner-focused sex also causes Nice Guys to keep doing what “works,” which leads to repetitive sexual routines.**

Glover explains that a Nice Guy may also engage his partner in half-hearted sex through manipulative or sneaky tactics. He thinks if he focuses hard enough on pleasing her, she won’t get mad at him and will enthusiastically reciprocate. But this tactic only leads to frustrating sex. **Still, to many Nice Guys,_bad sex is better than no sex_.**

(Shortform note: Despite the similarities between Glover’s Ideal Man and Deida’s Superior Man, these authors’ approaches to sex are quite different. While, as we’ve seen, Glover _discourages_ the Ideal Man from partner-focused sex, Deida _encourages_ the opposite. He suggests the Superior Man turn his focus outward by prioritizing connection with his woman over his own pleasure, as he believes the complete union of masculine and feminine energy is the ultimate goal of sex. Glover, on the other hand, believes _pleasure_ is the main objective.)
