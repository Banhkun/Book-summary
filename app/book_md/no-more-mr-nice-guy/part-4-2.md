## Part 4.2: How to Reclaim Your Power | Chapters 5-6

As we discussed, Nice Guys tend to view themselves as helpless, isolated victims on life’s roller coaster. But know that if you can take responsibility for your self-worth and your needs, you can take responsibility for your _power_ as well.

This section first covers Glover’s strategies to help you tap into your personal power in the face of uncertainty. Then we’ll show you how to find empowerment in your masculinity so you can take control of your life and set an example for future generations.

### Discover Your Personal Power

To break the cycle of self-victimization, Glover says a Nice Guy must change his relationship with fear, uncertainty, and the general “un-smoothness” of life. **In the face of unpredictability, he must cultivate his personal power.** Glover defines**_personal power_** as the ability to handle life's challenges with confidence. It’s not defined by a lack of fear, _but a capacity to manage and grow from it_.

(Shortform note: When it comes to leadership development, personal power is often discussed in opposition to _positional power_ , which refers to the power our position holds in a set hierarchy or organization. Positional power doesn’t come from a place of charisma or respect but from merely pulling rank. In this context, **our personal power refers to our ability to command respect and attention no matter our hierarchical position**. But whether you’ve tapped into your personal power for your own sake or for the sake of influencing others, it comes from a place of self-acceptance, honest communication, and confidence.)

If recovering Nice Guys embrace Glover’s following strategies, they’ll be better equipped to assert their power while welcoming life’s challenges:

#### Let It Go

To reclaim your personal power, Glover insists you first _surrender_. This doesn’t mean giving up completely but instead acknowledging what you can and can’t control. For example, you _can’t_ control the actions and reactions of others, but you _can_ control your own.**** Surrendering to the unpredictability of the universe lifts a burden from your shoulders: **You can only control what you can control.**

(Shortform note: In his book _How to Stop Worrying and Start Living_ , Dale Carnegie also urges you to accept what you can’t control as a way to curb anxiety. Instead of giving up entirely or attempting to change the unchangeable, he suggests you _cooperate with your circumstances as they are_. Say you intend to make an omelet, but it falls apart before you can get it on your plate. Don’t fret that you can’t put the omelet back together—let go of your expectations and enjoy the tasty scramble you just made.)

Surrendering includes curbing your perfectionism. Glover notes that “perfectionism” doesn’t mean doing everything perfectly—it means obsessing over every mistake or small imperfection to a detrimental degree. No project or undertaking is ever _perfect_. **Once you stop expecting and striving for perfection, you’ll be free to take risks and follow what works for you.**

> **Brené Brown on Perfectionism**
> 
> Glover isn’t the only author to discuss the perils of perfectionism. In _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brené Brown decries perfectionism, arguing it’s often driven by a desire to control how others perceive you. According to Brown, striving for perfection is less about avoiding mistakes and more about avoiding the judgement and shame of others. We know Nice Guys avoid judgment and shame at all costs, so it’s unsurprising perfectionism is a common coping mechanism among them.
> 
> Like Glover, Brown agrees that perfection is impossible to attain, but she takes it a step further: Even trying to _appear_ perfect is unrealistic. Thus, the real danger of perfectionism comes from the incredibly high standards we set for ourselves and the negative emotions that arise when we inevitably fail to meet them. With Brown’s framing of perfectionism in mind, we can see how greater self-acceptance and letting go of your high expectations could help to curb perfectionism in Nice Guys.

#### Welcome Fear

Fear is a normal part of life, but Nice Guys have a less-than-healthy relationship with it. Glover says that for a Nice Guy, fear is a constant reminder of every stressful, uncomfortable, and dangerous situation they’ve ever experienced. This fear-response tends to make Nice Guys _overly cautious and risk avoidant_.

Glover asserts **the only way to overcome vicious anxiety and fear is to acknowledge it and face what currently scares you.** Just as self-care and prioritizing yourself help enforce a new self-concept, you create new beliefs each time you push through fear.

> **How the Superior Man Deals With Fear**
> 
> Facing your fears is easier said than done, but we can look again to _The Way of the Superior Man_ for advice on how to approach these situations. When you’re feeling uncomfortable, anxious, or afraid, Deida recommends you let go and open yourself to uncertainty by:
> 
>   * **Focusing on your breath.** Release the tension in your body by standing up straight and breathing deep into your belly. Allow yourself to be physically and mentally open to what you’re experiencing.
> 
>   * **Speaking your fears.** By acknowledging and describing your fears and how they affect you, you allow yourself to be emotionally open to your present feelings.
> 
> 

> 
> Once you’re fully open to whatever life may throw at you, Deida agrees there’s only one thing left to do: **Face it head-on.**

#### Set Boundaries

Nice Guys must learn to set boundaries. Glover argues that even if Nice Guys have boundaries in theory, they tend to give in without much force. In keeping the peace, they hope others will stop violating their wishy-washy limits.

(Shortform note: In _Dating Essentials for Men_ , Glover discusses a type of boundary-crossing that he calls _shit tests_. This term refers to anything a woman does—whether conscious or unconscious—to test the validity and limits of her man’s boundaries. Although men should never accept mean behavior, Glover says standing firm against a woman’s shit tests in particular is a great way to demonstrate your strength, stability, and capacity to be a man.)

It’s hard to embrace your personal power if you let others walk all over you. But like taking responsibility for your needs, **you must take responsibility for how others treat you.** Glover stresses that others have no incentive to change if you reinforce their behavior by giving in. Once you realize this, you’ll find **changing your _own behavior_ (by setting firm boundaries) is a simpler, more rewarding path**.

Glover’s advice for setting boundaries is as follows: If your partner exhibits behaviors that make you uncomfortable, ask, "Would I still be interested in this person if I experienced this on a second date?" If the answer is no, then you know you need to set a boundary. This rule helps you take a step back and realize when you’re being treated unfairly.

> **Tips for Setting (Lasting) Boundaries**
> 
> Glover’s advice on boundary-setting is arguably limited, since it refers only to setting boundaries in romantic relationships. Here are some more tips on how to set boundaries that stick that are applicable to _any_ relationship (be it romantic, familial, or even professional):
> 
>   * Author Mark Manson suggests you have set consequences for others for violating each of your boundaries. This will make you more likely to stick to your guns and follow through no matter the person or the context. But _don’t forget_ to communicate these consequences to the relevant parties. (You wouldn’t want your boundaries to become covert contracts, now would you?)
> 
>   * Psychology scholar Mariana Bockarova encourages you to practice being assertive in all situations to get used to setting boundaries. How can you talk to your partner about being mistreated if you can’t tell a server he got your order wrong? By starting small, you can build your way up to setting limits with your loved ones.
> 
>   * Wellness consultant Alex Elle reminds us that although boundaries should be clearly defined, they’re not set in stone. Just as we change over time, so can our boundaries. Keep asking yourself what you need in the moment and adjust your limits accordingly.
> 
>   * Codependency recovery coach Hailey Magee says we must learn how to accept the boundaries of others while asserting our own. We should thank others for their vulnerability and clear communication when they successfully set a boundary, as we can learn from their example.
> 
> 


#### Develop Integrity

Instead of defaulting to deceit out of fear, Glover says **Nice Guys must develop integrity**. This can be difficult, as their tenuous grasp on the truth is related to their flimsy grasp on reality. Nice Guys can’t behave truthfully when their actions are based on projection or delusions (like their self-limiting beliefs).

To combat this, Glover encourages you to**take a step back and ask yourself if your actions and behaviors are in response to reality.** Are you projecting old insecurities onto your current partner? Or maybe you feel your boss is the only thing holding you back when your attitude is part of the problem. Responding to reality allows you to make realistic and productive decisions about the matter _actually_ at hand. The truth isn’t always easy, but responding to reality with integrity is much easier than the stress of being “found out” or tackling each day from a place of fantasy.

According to Glover,**the best way to live with integrity is to ask yourself, “ _What do I think is right?_ ” Then do it.** Integrity gives you the power to approach reality—be it your relationship or job—with clarity, direction, and sincerity.

(Shortform note: How do you know what’s “right”? In _Dare to Lead_ , Brené Brown stresses the importance of developing strong personal values to guide you through difficult matters of integrity. **Without guiding values, we’re more likely to take the easy way out than do what’s _right_**. She recommends choosing two core values that you _truly_ believe in—such as authenticity, compassion, loyalty, and so on—then setting up guidelines for what these values look like in practice. When you ask yourself “ _What’s right?_ ” you’ll have firm principles to keep you on track. For example, if you value accountability, you could set up a guideline that says you will own up to your mistakes and avoid making excuses when you do so.)

### Find Power in Your Masculinity

If a Nice Guy wishes to feel empowered and get a handle on his relationships with men, women, and life in general, **he must reclaim his masculinity.** This reclamation means embracing your manhood and all its traits. To get back in touch with and draw on the power of your masculine self, Glover recommends you:

#### Bond With Other Men

Glover stresses that **when Nice Guys develop close male friendships, they reap the rewards and support of community.**

How do you connect with other men? Glover says to make plans and hang out! You and the guys can do anything you want, such as:

  * Casual hangouts (movie or game nights, potlucks, bonfires, just relax)
  * Attending events (sports, concerts, discussion groups)
  * Being exercise buddies or starting a team
  * Spending time in nature (camping, hiking, fishing, road trips)
  * Volunteering together



> **How Do You Make Friends in Adulthood?**
> 
> To make plans with friends, you have to _have_ friends. As children, we find ourselves in situations (like school) that are ripe for making friends. However, in adulthood, we get busy, people move, and new relationships (such as partners or kids) take time away from building friendships.
> 
> But if you don’t have many (or any) friends, you’re not alone—the phenomenon of the friendless or lonely adult has been documented in countless surveys. One survey of over 20,000 American adults found 2 in 5 feel isolated and lack meaningful relationships. Another found that the average American adult hasn’t made a new friend in 5 years.
> 
> So what can we do to make friends in adulthood? In “An Adult’s Guide to Social Skills, for Those Who Were Never Taught,” _NYT_ journalist Eric Ravenscraft says it starts with self-motivation—you must decide you’re going to make new friends and actively put yourself in situations where that may happen. **Once you’ve put yourself out there, be brave and start a conversation with someone new.**
> 
> But how do you naturally start that conversation? Author David Hoffeld compiled the findings of various behavioral studies to answer this question. Once we realize we grossly underestimate strangers’ willingness to chat, we can approach new people with these three proven steps:
> 
>   * **Look approachable—smile.** We feel more optimistic ourselves when we do so. Also, a smile back is a great nonverbal cue to start the conversation on a positive note.
> 
>   * **Begin the conversation authentically by focusing on something you have in common.** Start simple: Their hat may let you know you back the same team or maybe you always notice them on your bus route.
> 
>   * **Keep the conversation going by applying the “insight-and-question” method.** Make an observation, then follow it up with a question. Make sure your question is about the other person—not the weather or the traffic—as people love to talk about themselves.
> 
> 

> 
> (In his dating workshops, Glover agrees that learning to talk to strangers is a valuable skill but understands that it’s something that needs to be developed. He encourages men to be “social animals” in all situations in order to practice this. You don’t need to have a specific goal in mind—such as friendship or dating—with every person you talk to, but the more people you interact with, the less scary it becomes and the better you get at spotting those worth talking to.)
> 
> Finally, speaking from experience, author Ross McCammon explains how he was able to make and develop adult friendships with other men:
> 
>   * **Utilize your connections.** The partner of your partner’s friends and the parents of your kids’ friends are great places to start.
> 
>   * **Turn vague plans into reality.** Intentionally schedule your hangouts—even better, make them recurring (like hitting the gym the same time each week or camping the last weekend of every month).
> 
>   * **Follow up with texts.** Continue communicating when you’re not together.
> 
>   * **Hug!** Physical contact is important for friendships too. Plus, it’s a definitive way to let your friends know you care without having to get _too_ sappy.
> 
> 


##### The Benefit of Male Friendships

When a Nice Guy has no friends of his own, he becomes dependent on his partner for 100% of his emotional and social needs. But **friends help meet these needs**. Glover noticed Nice Guys are less likely to smother, resent, or manipulate their partners when they can turn to friends for additional support.

> **Male Social Dependence and Female Burnout**
> 
> The burnout women experience when they’re expected to be their boyfriend or husband’s partner, best friend, cheerleader, secretary, therapist, and more has prompted much discussion about women’s unpaid, emotional labor.
> 
> When journalist Melanie Hamlett interviewed women about their experiences, she found younger women more likely to tie their self-image to being their husband’s everything. However, once women grow older, busier, and more frustrated, they seem to be less willing to put themselves aside for their man’s sake—usually to _his_ detriment. Even if it appears your partner “doesn’t mind” providing this care, she may be struggling with her own self-worth. Having individual lives and friendships outside your relationship will only strengthen it in the long run and ensure neither of you suffer burnout.

#### Address Your Paternal Relationship

To get at the root of his masculinity issues, Glover explains that a recovering Nice Guy must overcome the childhood impression of his father and view him through fresh eyes. Even if the relationship was exactly as you remember, Glover demonstrates that when you reflect as an adult, **you’re likely to see your dad for who he was: human.**

Your father doesn’t need to participate in this reexamination (although if some frank conversation would help, more power to you). However, Glover maintains **it’s necessary to address your feelings about your father—whether fury, disappointment, or love** —so that you can repair your complicated relationship with masculinity overall.

(Shortform note: In _Superior Man_ , Deida agrees that in order to live as a free man, you must release yourself from your father’s expectations. To help you do this, he suggests taking three days to live as if your father had died. Follow your own path. What would you pursue if his judgment was lifted from your shoulders?)

#### Find Positive Male Role Models

To combat old negative assumptions about men, Glover emphasizes **Nice Guys must seek out new, healthy models of masculinity.** When they observe healthy masculinity in action, Nice Guys integrate these positive associations into their conception of manhood.

Your role models can be anyone—a coworker, world leader, old friend, or admired community member. Glover suggests you **identify the positive masculine traits you would like to embrace, then find men who embody them.** And these men don’t need to be real—there are plenty of fictional characters that exemplify the traits of healthy, functioning men.

(Shortform note: While Glover stresses Nice Guys find _male_ role models to help guide them, Deida asks the Superior Man to turn to the wisdom of older women as well. As women age, they tend to embrace their masculine energy more, which according to Deida, decreases their capacity to _tolerate bullshit_. This—combined with their ability for deep emotional understanding as a mature female—makes older women worthy companions on your self-improvement journey.)

##### Passing the Torch

As you look to your role models, you must also provide the next generation with healthy models of masculinity.

According to Glover, healthy male role models help young boys transition into manhood without the stressful process of _unlearning shame_. Instead, they’ll learn to embrace their masculinity outright. And these relationships go both ways—**Nice Guys benefit from the vitality and unrestrained energy that young men and boys possess.**

A biological relationship isn’t necessary to form these bonds. Yes, spend time with your sons, nephews, and cousins. But if you have no young male relatives of your own, Glover reminds you to get involved with your local scouts, sports teams, or big brother program.

> **Tips for Encouraging Healthy Masculinity in Boys**
> 
> Both****Plan International and Promundo are international organizations dedicated to engaging boys and men in the fight for gender equality. In an effort to address questions from the growing number of people interested in raising boys with a healthy understanding of masculinity, they created a list of concrete tips for parental figures:
> 
>   * **Use playtime to build empathy.** Boys can learn a lot about themselves and the world through play. Roleplaying allows you to demonstrate healthy ways of working through a wide array of emotions, situations, and values.
> 
>   * **Allow boys to express themselves—however that may be.** Urge young boys to pick toys or clothing they are drawn to, even when they pick something “meant for girls.” Encouraging honest self-expression will help them define their masculinity apart from harmful stereotypes.
> 
>   * **Teach boys about consent.** Teach boys they must ask for permission to touch others, but make sure they understand consent is a two-way street—they’re allowed to say _no_ as well. You can demonstrate this principle by supporting them when they refuse physical contact—like a hug or a kiss—from family members.
> 
>   * **Lead by example.** Model what you think healthy masculinity looks like for the boys in your life. Children remember what we say and do, so we must address our own behavior if we say something inappropriate or find ourselves slipping into rigid roles. Provide boys with many examples of masculinity by seeking out positive representations in media and additional role models in your community.
