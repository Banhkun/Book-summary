## Exercise: Define Your Masculinity

Before you can reclaim your masculinity, define it for yourself.

* * *

What are positive masculine traits in your opinion? What makes a “healthy male” in your eyes?

Think about other men in your life (relatives, community members, fictional characters). Who do you know that embodies any or all of these characteristics? How could they serve as your role model?

Pick one potential role model. What questions might you ask him? (Gear your questions toward masculinity and being a self-accepting man—if Captain America is your role model, don’t ask him what it was like to wake up decades into the future.)
