## Part 3.1: How Nice Guys Live for Others | Chapters 3-4

Now that you understand Nice Guys, their basic traits, and the formation of their self-limiting beliefs, the remaining sections of this guide delve into Glover’s strategies for updating this unproductive mindset and working to become an Ideal Man.

This section will focus on identifying the ways Nice Guys live for others—specifically their people-pleasing and caretaking habits—and how this stops them from living the life they’ve envisioned.

### Nice Guys Are Skilled Shape-Shifters

Glover repeatedly states that, operating under the belief that no one will love them as they are, **Nice Guys will be just about anyone you want them to be.** But their approval-seeking strategies usually leave everyone dissatisfied—themselves included. In order to gain approval and avoid disapproval, shape-shifting **Nice Guys depend on external validation and the concealment of their shortcomings and mistakes.** Let’s explore these two factors in more detail.

#### Dependence on External Validation

Nice Guys’ fixation with external validation is best observed in their reliance on both _attachments_ and _women’s approval_.

##### Reliance on Attachments

According to Glover, _attachments_ are the external signifiers Nice Guys use to win others’ approval (they “attach” these things to their personal value). These attachments can be something you do to your appearance or a behavior or trait you highlight, such as:

  * Meticulously steaming your clothes for work every morning
  * Obsessively thanking every cashier you interact with
  * Being the first among your friends to own the newest iPhone 



What’s wrong with putting effort into your appearance or doing something kind for a stranger? Nothing, on the surface. Glover asserts that the answer lies in one question: **Who are you doing it for?**

If you notice yourself doing something solely for the sake of others, Glover says you’re using it _as an attachment_. A Nice Guy might think a messy desk at work signifies he’s “bad.” So, he becomes obsessed with keeping it clean to assert how “good” he is. **(If an Ideal Man keeps his desk at work clean, it’s because _he wants to_.)**

> **Non-Attachment in Buddhism**
> 
> Glover isn't the only person to highlight the pitfalls of attachments. For centuries, Buddhist teachings have explored this topic, including the concept of "non-attachment," or a state of being in which you sever unhealthy attachments.
> 
> In his podcast episode “Understanding Non-Attachment,” Noah Rasheta—Buddhist lay minister—explains that in the context of Buddhism, attachments aren’t the things you own, but the things in your life that own you. He notes that the tenet of _non-attachment_ doesn’t prevent you from buying yourself something nice or entering into a meaningful relationship, but it does stress that you don’t let these things control your life.
> 
> Rasheta emphasizes that at its core, non-attachment is about coming to terms with impermanence. **When we release our attachment to something, we’re not necessarily letting go of that thing or relationship altogether, but giving up on our attachment to the permanence of the thing (or its meaning).** It’s also about our tendency to compare things, particularly the past, present, and future. Letting go of your attachments helps you exist in the present moment.
> 
> We can apply this definition of “attachments” and “non-attachment” to Nice Guys: If a man thinks he’s good because his car is always clean, then he’s owned by the need to clean his car. He won’t be free until this act is no longer an attachment but something he does in the present moment for himself (simply to do it). In this case, the man isn’t concerned with how cleaning his car may reflect on his past or predict his future. Instead, he understands this action doesn’t continue to hold meaning past the moment of its completion.

##### Reliance on Women’s Approval

Glover indicates that even more so than other attachments, **Nice Guys connect their self-worth to the moods, behaviors, and approval of women**(be it their partner, mother, teacher, and so on).**** This may cause a Nice Guy to focus solely on his partner’s emotions and opinions (while ignoring his own), but Glover points out that, somewhat concerningly, **Nice Guys place women on such a high pedestal (almost to a God-like degree) that they switch between treating ladies with either intense adoration or resentful fury.**

If you spend time on social media, you’ve probably seen screencaps from dating and social media apps that demonstrate this behavior:

_One minute, a Nice Guy politely reaches out to a woman with adoring compliments. After no response, the Nice Guy changes his tune and lashes out with slurs, insults, and negative generalizations about all women._

> **Stop Putting Her on a Pedestal**
> 
> According to counselor and coach Michael J. Formica, the act of idealizing another person (for instance, in the way that Nice Guys idealize women) actually robs them of their personhood. By making them “perfect,” we fail to see their humanity and begin to view them as an object.
> 
> Here’s how you can stop putting the women in your life—and people in general—on a pedestal:
> 
>   * **Embrace imperfection:** If we can view ourselves and those around us as authentically as possible, we’ll see the imperfect reality of the world. From here, we can accept others—not as a perfect object—but as human.
> 
>   * **Stop gushing:** Compliment your partner and tell her you love her, but don’t overdo it. According to a study in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, subjects felt uncomfortable when they were led to believe their partner perceived them in a far more positive light than they did themselves (some were so unsettled, they sat farther away from their partner after learning of their apparent intense adoration). Instead of something like “You’re the best person I’ve ever met,” try to acknowledge her successes, talents, and the little things she does for you and your relationship.
> 
>   * **Work on yourself:** Like many of the issues discussed in this guide, idealizing others often stems from childhood relationships or trauma carried into adulthood. By reflecting on your past, taking time to love yourself (flaws and all), and acknowledging when you’re in love with the idea of her (rather than her as a person), you can more easily remove her from that pedestal.
>

#### Concealment of Shortcomings and Mistakes

**Nice Guys want to _avoid disapproval_ as much as they want to gain approval.** To stave off conflict and criticism, Glover explains that Nice Guys go out of their way to hide their true selves, including perceived flaws (like being late or sad) or everyday parts of being human (like having sexual desires).

Glover discusses a variety of (conscious and unconscious) tactics Nice Guys use to avoid their “bad” selves, but they can be distilled into one goal: **Don’t address problems—fix reactions.** According to Glover, Nice Guys have trouble accepting responsibility for their actions. They don’t admit fault or address their wrongdoings when they mess up. Instead, he says **Nice Guys want to quickly fix the _reactions_ to their mistakes rather than the problem at hand.**

Glover takes us through some of the behaviors Nice Guys fall back on when they’re “found out” or forced to confront their mistakes. To demonstrate this response, let’s say a Nice Guy’s wife asks if he remembered to take out the trash (he didn’t). Instead of owning his mistake and saying, “ _Sorry, I didn’t_. I’ll handle that now,” the Nice Guy might…

**Justify:** “I already did the laundry today, so what’s the big deal?”

**Defend:** “I was just about to do it. You don’t need to remind me.”

**Excuse:** “I’ve just been really busy and I thought we were out of trash bags.”

The Nice Guy may also try to rationalize their behavior by bringing up the other person’s mistakes and flaws, or by blaming the other person for the mistake.

> **Why We Get Defensive (and How to Stop)**
> 
> Why do Nice Guys react to conflict or criticism this way? In his book _First Things First_ , Stephen Covey notes that we often respond with excuses and rationalization when what we want to hear differs from what our conscience tells us is right. In the case above, the Nice Guy responds this way because his conscience knows he neglected a responsibility, but he doesn’t want to hear his wife point it out (or take out the trash at that moment). To deal with this inner tension, the Nice Guy must explain—both to his wife and himself—why he’s acting against his better judgment.
> 
> According to Covey, these are the best ways to avoid this type of behavior:
> 
>   * Recognize how you typically respond to this kind of inner tension—are you an over-explainer? Someone who gets defensive?
> 
>   * Listen to your conscience when it’s trying to tell you something.
> 
>   * Make _principle-centered_ choices, as strong values keep you on track.
> 
> 


### Nice Guys Are Selfishly Unselfish

According to Glover, **Nice Guys’ “unselfish __ nature” stems not from generosity but a desire to _appear_ unselfish.** Consequently, Nice Guys live their lives for others by ignoring their own needs and tending to everyone else (while assuming incorrectly others will do the same).

This behavior, Glover explains, stems from a distorted self-concept in which they believe—and want others to believe—they’re needless, low-maintenance guys (a trait they think is _inherently good_).

> **Why Do We Want To Appear “Low Maintenance”?**
> 
> Although Nice Guys use it in an unproductive way, “low maintenance” _can_ be used as a positive descriptor—a haircut that doesn’t require much upkeep, for example. It’s when we apply this term to human behavior and our relationships that the concept becomes problematic.
> 
> According to marriage and family therapist Sarah Epstein, the desire to be seen as “low maintenance” often comes from a place of fear. We might fear being viewed as “needy” or fear abandonment if our needs become “too much” for others. She explains that this mindset often develops in childhood when parents ignore, downplay, or overreact to a child’s needs—emotional or otherwise. Epstein emphasizes that because being a selfless caretaker and malleable people-pleaser becomes the goal of the “low maintenance” person, the**desire to appear needless—much like the Nice Guy mindset—is tied to a rejection of the self.**

#### Covert Contracts

Glover asserts that **Nice Guys’ “generosity” almost always comes with strings attached.**

_Covert contracts_ are the unspoken (and often unconscious) agreements Nice Guys use to get what they want. Outside parties aren’t aware of these contracts, but to Nice Guys, they’re implied understandings. By relying on an indirect route to satisfaction, Nice Guys avoid acknowledging their needs.

According to Glover, Nice Guys assume covert contracts work like this:

**I do something for you → You do something for me → We both walk away satisfied, pretending our needs and this transaction never existed**

A common example of a covert contract is giving a compliment _just to hear one back_. When you get a new haircut and no one notices, you might compliment a coworker’s hairstyle to prompt a similar compliment. In this case, your kind words didn’t come from a genuine place but**** from a personal need for external validation.

> **Why We’re Manipulated By Covert Contracts**
> 
> Although Glover says covert contracts often leave Nice Guys disappointed, we do see them “work” to an extent in our day-to-day lives (see our example above). When we hear “I love you,” we’re compelled to say “I love you” back. If a coworker surprises you with a holiday gift and you’re empty-handed, you feel guilty for not giving them something in return. You feel like you _owe them_ despite knowing you never agreed to exchange gifts. What makes us feel this way?
> 
> It has to do with what Robert Cialdini—in his book _Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion_ —calls _the reciprocity principle_. According to Cialdini, this principle is the innate indebtedness we feel when someone does something for us (even if we didn’t need or want that something in the first place).
> 
> Although Cialdini discusses this principle in relation to business and customer relationships, we can apply it to our interactions with covert contracts. **Concepts of fairness—like “I scratch your back, you scratch mine”—are so ingrained in our daily lives that we’re already in a position to be manipulated when presented with the “giving” end of a covert contract.** Covert contracts can “work” on us because they _take advantage_ of our reciprocal nature.

##### Caretaking as a Covert Contract

Glover defines _caretaking_ as spending all your time attending to other people’s needs so that you can avoid your problems, have your needs met, or feel important. Caretaking is, in itself, a covert contract. It’s generosity that stems from neediness rather than love.

**Genuinely caring for someone is not the same thing as caretaking.** Nice Guys might _think_ they’re caring, but Glover points out some major differences:

**Caretaking** | **Caring**  
---|---  
Gives based on the giver’s desires  | Gives based on the receiver’s needs   
Gives to fill a void  | Gives out of an abundance of love   
Gives to get  | Gives to give   
  
> **The Relationship Between Caretaking and Codependency**
> 
> The concept of “caretaking” is most commonly discussed in regards to codependent relationships, especially between parent and child.
> 
> According to marriage and family therapist Darlene Lancer, a caregiving parent provides their child with unconditional love and care. Parents who _caretake_ have their own needs in mind when “giving” to their child and often feel righteous or expect something in return for their “self-sacrifice.” These parents typically feel responsible _for_ their child, rather than a responsibility _to_ their child.
> 
> Lancer notes how **caretakers promote codependency:** When a child constantly has things done _for_ him to meet his needs, he learns that 1. he’s not responsible for his own needs and 2. he lacks the confidence and abilities to tend to them. From there, the child grows dependent on his parents and the caretaking evolves into a _form of control_.
> 
> Further, when a child grows up equating love with self-sacrifice—this being a key tenet of his parent’s caretaking, as noted above—this mindset may be carried into his adult relationships. In his book, _The Road Less Traveled_ , M. Scott Peck says this belief results in:
> 
>   * **Social sadomasochism:** This is an unconscious desire to be hurt in our relationships. The desire comes from an attachment to the _moral superiority_ that comes with being the victim of mistreatment. In this case, you may enjoy feeling like “the good guy.” To uphold this dichotomy, you accept abuse from “the bad guy.”
> 
>   * **Destructive nurturing:** Otherwise known as _caretaking_. (In our case, the _caretakee_ _becomes the caretaker_.)
> 
> 

> 
> Thus, codependency is a vicious cycle and caretaking is both a cause _and_ effect of this imbalanced type of relationship.
