## Exercise: Voice Your Needs

We have to voice our needs if we want them to be met. Swap your covert contracts for direct communication.

* * *

Think of a covert contract that exists between you and your significant other. As per this unspoken agreement, what do you give? And what do you expect in return?

How do you feel when this contract fails and your needs remain unmet? How do you respond (insults, passive-aggressive behavior, tantrums)?

What could you say to your significant other to clearly and directly communicate this need? Do you think this would be a more effective route to satisfying your needs? Why or why not?
