## Exercise: Find Your Safe People

Before committing to change, you need strong foundational support.

* * *

Think about the “safe people” (those you wholeheartedly trust) in your life. Which of those people would make the best advocates in your self-improvement journey? Write down the top three who come to mind.

Consider what you hope to gain from the process of becoming an “Ideal Man.” How can your safe people support you through this process?

Now think about approaching one of your safe people. What method of communication will you use (a phone call, face-to-face, a public or private setting)? What personal issues do you want to discuss with this person, and how will you ask for their support?
