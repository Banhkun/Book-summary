## Exercise: Apply Everything Is Fcked to Your Life

While _Everything Is F*cked_ makes broad statements about humanity at large, its ideas apply to us as individuals as well. Reflect on how Manson’s ideas apply to your life and consider how you could follow his advice to live a happy life without hope.

* * *

Which of Manson’s three stages are you in now—an unhappy life without hope, a hopeful life, or a happy life without hope? How do you feel about being in that stage? If you’d like to move to the next stage, what’s something you could do in the next couple of days to help you do so? (For example, if you feel like you’re in Stage 1 and you’re depressed due to a lack of hope, you could resolve to spend 10 minutes journaling every morning to become more aware of your emotions.)

List one or more ideologies you belong to. What’s the primary virtue of each ideology? Would you like to spend more or less time and energy pursuing that primary virtue, and why? (For example, one ideology you’re a part of may be your team at work. Your team’s primary virtue might be individual job performance. Perhaps you think you’d be happier if you spent less energy improving your job performance and more on improving your health.)

Think back to something you did that you feel was “wrong.” Were you using someone else (or yourself) as a means to achieve some other goal? If so, how? How could you have approached that person (or yourself) as a primary virtue in and of themselves? (For example, maybe one of your coworkers made an expensive mistake at work, and you sent them a cruel email. In this case, you abused someone’s feelings to satisfy your sense of justice. You could have instead used this as an opportunity to help them by offering advice.)
