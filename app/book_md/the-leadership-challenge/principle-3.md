## Principle 3: Challenge the Status Quo

Now that you’ve explored your values, vision, and purpose, and examined how you can engage your team to pursue these things with you, we’ll shift our discussion to another aspect of leadership: _a willingness to challenge the status quo._

Outstanding leaders don’t merely manage the day-to-day tasks of keeping an organization on track; they chart new tracks for their organizations to follow. They recognize things that can be improved and find ways to make them better. They seek out challenges rather than waiting for challenges to find them.

The next two guidelines outline specific ways in which you can proactively drive your organization or team forward:

  * Guideline 5: Search for opportunities.
  * Guideline 6: Experiment and take risks.



### Guideline 5: Search for Opportunities

Envisioning opportunities is a foundational part of leadership: Leaders think about possibilities and then lead other people toward them. Every venture starts with an idea of how life might be different.

Sometimes opportunities arrive at a leader’s feet, but most often, a leader proactively looks for them. Two rules can guide you in this:

  1. Take initiative.
  2. Look outward.



#### 1\. Take Initiative

The first part of searching for opportunity is _taking the initiative_.

A leader guides others to a new place, and to do that, you have to disturb the existing order of things.

  * Existing processes and procedures might have worked for your organization up to the present, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’ll work in the future. 
  * Sometimes change might be incremental, but sometimes, you may need to change something on a fundamental level. 



**People in organizations grow used to doing things a certain way and are often reluctant to change their habits,** defaulting to the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality. Even if they know a procedure could be better, they’ll often resist changing it simply because it’s easier to carry on as usual.

Consequently, as a leader, you must be the one to critically examine the processes and procedures you’ve grown to rely on, and to take the initiative to change them.

##### Ask Questions

As a leader, your job is to see opportunities when others don’t. To spot opportunities that others miss, get into the habit of asking lots of questions.

People naturally ask questions during times of transition, such as when they’re joining an organization or taking on a new project. During these times, you're looking at processes and procedures with a fresh eye, and you’ll naturally question why things are done this way and whether there are better ways to do them.

Be sure to continue this process even after you’ve settled into a position or a role. **Continue to ask questions that test others’ assumptions, so you can stimulate new ways of thinking and find new paths to explore.**

##### Act Before Others

When leaders recognize a problem, they don’t wait for permission or a set of instructions—they start devising a solution right away. **By implementing a solution, you can demonstrate its effectiveness in a way that’s more convincing than a plan would have been.**

When you ask for permission, you might run up against the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality we mentioned earlier, or you may run into endless procedural delays. For this reason, look for opportunities to implement improvements proactively.

##### Encourage Initiative in Others

Everyone on your team, down to the most junior member, should feel they can innovate and improve your team’s systems. When you allow everyone to contribute ideas, you can end up with unexpectedly positive results—**sometimes the most junior members of a team are the ones who can see processes and procedures with fresh eyes.**

  * Hold regular meetings and encourage brainstorming sessions to draw out ideas from every corner. Inspire people to speak their minds and to offer constructive criticism. 
  * Implement training programs that help team members gain mastery of tasks one step at a time. This will build their confidence so they feel capable of responding to difficulties on their own.
  * Set up mentoring programs with peers or role models who have a history of meeting challenges. People learn best by watching other people in action, and mentors can help their mentees with real-time advice as situations arise. Connect people to role models based on the particular skills they need to develop. 



This practice alone will have an outsized effect on team morale: Research shows that those who are frequently encouraged to take initiative in their jobs are about 90% more likely to work harder and longer hours than people who are rarely encouraged to take initiative.

##### Have a Reason

While you want to be constantly on the lookout for opportunities for improvement, **don’t try to improve things where improvement isn’t actually needed.** Don’t be someone who’s always critiquing, nitpicking, and pointing out problems. Further, if you look for problems, have alternate solutions to offer instead of just pointing out what people are doing wrong.

  * Your team members will want to know that your changes are for a greater good, and not just changes for the sake of making changes. 
  * Remember that changes can make peoples’ jobs more unstable and difficult for a while during the transition, so any changes you make should ultimately make things much easier to make it worth the time and effort. If they don’t, people won’t connect with or support the changes, but will instead see them as wastes of time. 



#### Case Study: Dina Campion at Starbucks

Dina Campion, a district manager at Starbucks, provides an example of someone recognizing an opportunity, taking initiative, and acting before others do. She noticed that customers were going to competitors’ stores for blended, frozen drinks. The Starbucks corporate management didn’t think the product was worth pursuing, but Dina disagreed.

Without asking permission, she took the initiative to experiment with a blended frozen drink in one location, to prove the concept. The drink proved so popular that the company expanded it to the rest of the chain, investing in blenders for all locations. The resulting product was the Frappuccino, which became the most successful product launch in Starbucks’s history.

#### 2\. Look Outward

The second part of searching for opportunity is _looking outward_.

Innovations can come from anywhere. A global study showed that most significant innovations come from outside an organization. Ideas can come from, for example, customers, suppliers, business partners, and rival organizations. To increase your chances of spotting opportunities and outside innovations:

  * Expand your experiences.
  * Seek diverse perspectives.
  * Treat every job as an adventure.



##### Expand Your Experiences

Because ideas come from everywhere, actively engage with “everywhere.” When you engage the outside world, you promote conversations that can yield unexpected opportunities and ideas.

  * Make it a priority to stay informed about events, happenings, conversations, and trends. 
  * Keep up with the news headlines, stop by colleagues’ desks to say hello, join your peers at lunch, and attend conferences and training programs. 



**Research shows that when you bombard your brain with new stimuli, you promote creative thinking.** When you mix up routines, your brain gets put on alert and starts noticing things and making new connections. Otherwise, your brain gets used to routines and stops noticing details—it’s an evolutionary feature designed to save energy.

The best way to shake up your routines and spark creativity is to engage in direct, personal experiences outside your normal world. If you’re faced with a seemingly insurmountable problem, the best way to find a solution is to go out into the world and seek information that’s not accessible to you while sitting behind a desk.

##### Seek Diverse Perspectives

To spot new ideas and opportunities, be open to input from a wide range of sources. Even if one person presents an idea that seems valid and sufficient, seek out other opinions, because people from other backgrounds can come up with differing ideas that can shed additional light on the issue.

Sometimes people, especially leaders, avoid seeking other people’s opinions or advice out of a fear that they’ll appear incompetent or unknowledgeable about something they should know. However, the truth is that people tend to view leaders who ask for advice as _more_ competent than those who don’t. This perception is enhanced when the task is more difficult.

To widen your scope of opinions:

  * Encourage your team members to share information with each other and to seek information from outside your team. 
  * Seek out the opinion of someone who irritates you or with whom you often disagree.
  * Reach out to people beyond your comfort zone—people you don’t often interact with. 



Studies of laboratory research teams find that teams engaging in significantly more communication with people outside their labs have much higher performances. These outside influences don’t even have to be immediately relevant to their lab work: Even contact with unrelated departments like marketing, manufacturing, or outside professional groups still has a high correlation to job performance.

Researchers also find that **unless people consciously and actively make a point of seeking out diverse opinions, they tend to become insular and cut off important sources of ideas.** Further, the longer a team has been working together, the less they tend to reach out to people beyond their team, cutting off sources of information and ultimately reducing their own performance. Therefore, make a conscious choice to seek out others, so you and your team don’t end up so comfortable with each other that you become complacent.

##### Treat Every Job as an Adventure

**Your attitude toward your job will define how much you get out of it.** If you see your job as merely a job, you’ll simply complete the task and be done. However, if you see your job as an adventure and an opportunity to learn and grow, you can make something exceptional happen. Outstanding leaders choose adventure.

There are many things you can do to turn your job into an adventure. Essentially, each one points to your willingness to step out of the boundaries of your role:

  * **Explore the world of your organization** : Visit a factory or warehouse. Talk to people in different departments. Reach out to clients who interest you.
  * **Make gathering ideas part of your routine** : Use things such as focus groups, suggestion boxes, and customer feedback forms. Employ mystery shoppers, visit a competitor’s store, or call a few customers who haven’t used your services lately to find out why.
  * **Involve others in idea generation** : Devote time at every staff meeting to brainstorming or listening to concerns from team members. Invite outsiders, such as customers or people from other departments, to join occasionally so they can give you their perspectives as well. 



#### Case Study: Priya Saudagaran in India

While working for a nonprofit organization providing water purification systems for rural India, Priya Saudagaran modeled how to lead by looking outward, expanding her experience, seeking diverse perspectives, and viewing her job as more than just a job.

Management of her organization decided to shut down one particular treatment system because residents of that area weren’t buying the water, and they couldn’t justify keeping the spot open financially. Priya, distressed that the local villagers would lose access to clean water and convinced that the decision didn’t fit with the organization’s mission, went into the field to investigate why the villagers weren’t purchasing the water.

She also reached out to other nonprofits in similar work who were running into these kinds of problems to see how they dealt with them. As a result of her insights, the organization increased its community involvement, adjusted its business model, and was able to become profitable within 12 months. The model she inspired was copied in other locales.

### Guideline 6: Experiment and Learn

As a leader, when you challenge the status quo, you have to convince others to challenge it with you. However, they may be reluctant to embark on an _unproven_ path.

You can alleviate some of these concerns by demonstrating through small experiments how your vision might work. You’ll not only be learning how to improve your strategy through trial and error, but you’ll also be providing proof of concept for your team and others in your organization.

When experimenting, follow two overall principles:

  1. Produce small wins.
  2. Learn from experience.



#### 1\. Produce Small Wins

While your dreams and goals may be big, you should think small when working toward them. **You’ll have more success achieving a goal little by little than trying to accomplish the whole thing at once.** Aim to accumulate small wins—measurable accomplishments of moderate importance—as you progress.

When you work on small pieces of your project, you can experiment and test your vision or strategy in ways that reduce the risks of failure. For example, implementing a new procedure within one department can show you what works and what doesn’t before you roll out the program to the wider organization.

Aiming for small wins has several other advantages as well:

  * **Small wins help the project feel achievable:** If a project is large, it may feel daunting, which can discourage your team. Breaking your progress into a series of small wins will help the project seem more doable and reduce stress. 
  * **Small wins reduce the cost of trying:** A minor achievement takes less effort than a major one, but still results in a completed task that creates a sense of accomplishment.
  * **Small wins improve morale:** Big wins feel wonderful but are infrequent. Small wins can feel equally satisfying and can happen more often, keeping up a team’s spirits. 
  * **Small wins create momentum:** When you're on a roll of regularly achieving goals, even if those goals are small, you create momentum that can propel your team through setbacks. When regularly handling small challenges well, you develop an attitude of competence that helps you deal with larger challenges more effectively. 
  * **Small wins accumulate:** The scientific community has long recognized that major breakthroughs are the results of countless researchers who contribute little improvements that add up to a big improvement. The same is true for any field—business, politics, social work, and so on. 



#### 2\. Learn From Experience

Experiments will lead you to success by allowing you to fail, and research shows that failure is an effective teaching tool. Failures are opportunities for learning, and consistently, leaders who approach failures with an attitude of “What can we learn from this?” outperform leaders who approach failure looking to cast blame. Leaders who leave legacies are the ones who’ve tried, failed, and then tried again, ultimately achieving success by learning from their past errors.

Experiments allow you to try out a technique more than once, and **when people do something more than once, they more readily master it.** An example that illustrates this was a study carried out in a ceramics class. The teacher broke the students into two groups. She told the first group that they would get a higher grade if they made more pots, regardless of the quality of those pots. She told the second group that their grade would be based on the quality of the pots they made, not the number.

The first group immediately started making lots of pots, while the second group moved more slowly and deliberately. At the end of the experiment, the teacher discovered that, counterintuitively, the students who had made the most pots had also made the best pots. The act of practicing the techniques repeatedly produced the better product—the students who were encouraged to fail over and over ended up with a better mastery of the skills.

To get the most out of your learning experiences, follow these practices:

  * Cultivate a growth mindset.
  * Create a culture of learning. 
  * Be resilient.



##### Cultivate a Growth Mindset

To get the most out of your learning experiences, adopt a _growth mindset_ : a belief that you can improve your skills through hard work and practice. This contrasts with a _fixed mindset_ , which is a belief that your basic qualities are settled and permanent.

**Leaders with growth mindsets understand that people can learn to be great leaders, while people with fixed mindsets believe great leaders are born, not made:** You either have what it takes or you don’t. In study after study, people with growth mindsets perform better on difficult tasks than people with fixed mindsets. This is because when faced with a challenge, people with growth mindsets focus on how they can improve and overcome that challenge, while those with fixed mindsets tend to give up more quickly, reasoning that if they were having trouble with a task, they simply mustn’t have the skills to accomplish it.

To foster your own growth mindset:

  * Embrace challenges and see them as opportunities to learn. 
  * Internalize the belief that setbacks aren’t a reflection on your permanent identity—think of setbacks as a reflection on your skills _at the current moment_ , which will encourage you to continue to strive to improve. 



(Shortform note: Read our guide to _Mindset_ by Carol S. Dweck to learn more about how to develop a growth mindset.)

##### Create a Culture of Learning

You and your team will learn best from your experiences if you foster a culture of learning within your organization. To do this:

  * Provide a variety of opportunities to learn, such as online classes, outside seminars, and coaching programs. 
  * Rotate job assignments or responsibilities for special projects, to get people to develop in different ways and gain deeper understandings of others’ roles.
  * Encourage curiosity by allowing people to work on projects outside of their formal responsibilities. 



##### Be Resilient

Not only do you need to learn from your experiences, you also need to be resilient enough to move past setbacks or periods of little progress so that you can put what you learn to use in the future. Though setbacks can be discouraging, set a tone of determination and perseverance that your team members can adopt. Consistently, research shows that people in any industry—from school kids to military personnel to artists—who have resilience have more success in their careers.

Fortunately, resilience is a skill that can be learned and practiced. To develop a resilient mindset in yourself and your team:

  * View setbacks as temporary, taking a longer-term view of your situation so that you can see how this moment fits into the greater timeline for your project. 
  * Examine the situational circumstances that brought about the failure, and look for how the factors that contributed to it are localized and specific.
  * Convey optimism that more victories will be coming.
  * Foster resilience in your team by assigning tasks that are challenging but doable within your team members’ skill levels. 



#### Case Study: Geeta Ramakrishnan in New Delhi, India

When Dr. Geeta Ramakrishnan took over the microbiology department in a private New Delhi hospital, she showed how a leader can use experimentation and small wins to improve an organization.

When she stepped into her new position, Ramakrishnan recognized that many existing procedures needed improvement but would be complicated and risky to change. Instead of trying to change everything at once, she broke down the needed tasks into smaller pieces and prioritized them by need. She chose one area to start with—the lab’s existing policy of manual testing—and convincing the laboratory head that investing in automated testing equipment would reduce labor costs and lower error rates.

After implementing that first change and seeing success, the hospital decided to expand her program to their other laboratories.
