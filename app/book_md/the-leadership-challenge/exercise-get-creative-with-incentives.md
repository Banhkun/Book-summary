## Exercise: Get Creative With Incentives

One of the best ways to personalize your recognition of someone’s efforts is to get creative with it. Informal, spontaneous rewards can often be more meaningful than formal ones.

* * *

Think of one or two people on your team who have done a good job and who you’d like to reward. List some characteristics that make them unique: not just work habits, but personal preferences, hobbies, interests, or personality quirks.

What are some unique or unexpected ways you could reward these people based on their personal interests? What silly, creative, or humorous perks might let them know that you appreciate them not only for their contributions but also for who they are as people?
