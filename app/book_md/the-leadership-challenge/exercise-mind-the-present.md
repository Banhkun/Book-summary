## Exercise: Mind the Present

In order to envision a better future, you must be fully aware of your present—of trends, patterns, strengths and weaknesses in your organization, and challenges and conditions outside your organization. Pay attention to your current world so you can anticipate what’s to come.

* * *

Look around your workplace and make a conscious note of the things people are doing and the things they’re using. What do your colleagues and team members use to complete their tasks? What processes and procedures do they work under? How do they structure their days?

Notice things they’re using on the periphery of their work projects—things that might not directly relate to their task but that help them be more productive or make their day more pleasant. For example, do they refer to a particular news source or use a common app? Do they use any innovative organizational tools?

Look for opportunities in any of these things you notice. Can any of them be improved? Is there anything your team could benefit from that you see them seeking out? Are there any processes you could streamline to help them work more efficiently?
