## Exercise: Define Your Values

Clear values help guide your behaviors and choices so that you stay on the path toward your goal. Your values must be a sincere expression of your own heart.

* * *

Write down what values you hold that set you apart from other leaders. What priorities define who you are? What beliefs drive your decisions?

How are your values reflected in the values of your organization? How do they match? Where do they differ?

How can you let your constituents know your values? What are some ways you can articulate or communicate them?
