## Principle 5: Lead With Heart

To encourage lasting commitment, engage your team’s hearts as well as their minds. This means connecting with them personally.

To engage your team members hearts in a way that increases their motivation and commitment to your project and your leadership, follow these guidelines:

  * Guideline 9: Recognize contributions.
  * Guideline 10: Celebrate values and victories.



### Guideline 9: Recognize Contributions

When you recognize the contributions of your team members, you help them feel appreciated for both what they do and who they are. Encouragement helps people function at their highest level, and helps people endure when hours are long, work is difficult or problematic, and the challenge seems daunting. At times like this, people need emotional replenishment—encouragement—to fuel their commitment.

There are two parts to properly recognizing contributions:

  1. Expect the best
  2. Personalize your recognition



#### 1\. Expect the Best

Your expectations of your team affect how they perform: **When you expect people to do well, they tend to. Conversely, when you expect people to fail, they probably will.** Your expectations become a self-fulfilling prophecy; how you see them is how they will see themselves.

**You broadcast your opinions of other people whether you intend to or not,** through body language, the way you phrase things, or even the type of work you assign. So it's in your best interest to truly believe in the abilities of your team members.

Your expectations provide a framework through which people structure their behavior. One series of studies illustrated this well: Researchers found that when giving feedback, if they prefaced it with a statement like, “I’m giving you this critique because I have high expectations and I’m confident you can do this,” the person receiving the feedback was 40% more likely to accept and act on the feedback.

When leaders make a point of frequently telling people they believe in them and expect great things from them, team members report stronger feelings of trust, team spirit, and commitment.

To show your team that you have high expectations:

  * Show them you believe in them.
  * Be clear about rules and expected outcomes.
  * Provide and seek feedback. 



##### Show Them You Believe in Them

Your job as a leader is to draw out the best in your team. When you trust in their skills, they’ll become more confident and approach tasks with a more positive attitude.

  * Think of them as winners, and treat them accordingly. Be positive, supportive, encouraging, and friendly. 
  * Don’t come across as though you’re looking for mistakes; when people feel their manager is looking for problems, they’re likely to make more mistakes out of anxiety. 
  * Assign them tasks and projects just above their current level of responsibilities. When you do this, you encourage them to stretch their abilities, and you demonstrate your confidence that they can do it.



##### Be Clear About Rules and Expected Outcomes

People can’t live up to your expectations if they aren’t clear on what those expectations are. Make sure your team members know what you're looking for, and praise them when they deliver.

To set expectations, reiterate your goals. Goals give context to your recognition of others’ work and enhance the importance of that recognition, allowing others to see how their actions contribute to the larger picture.

When a team member doesn’t perform to your standards:

  * Outline for them clearly and specifically what they need to do to improve. 
  * Assure them that you have confidence they can do it.
  * Connect their effort to your overriding goal—for example, you might point out, “The more we do this, the better the outcomes for the patients.”



##### Provide Feedback

Without feedback, your team won’t know how they’re progressing—or not—toward their goals. Be clear about what markers of success and milestones you're looking for, so that people know what sub-goals to aim for in pursuit of the larger goal.

People crave feedback because they want guidance. **Research shows that peoples’ motivation increases only when they have both a challenging goal _and_ feedback on their progress. **Feedback helps people self-correct as they work toward a goal so they achieve it sooner and more effectively. When your team makes mistakes, they can learn from them only if you discuss those mistakes, pointing them out and providing clear feedback on how they can do better. Without feedback, mistakes can be overlooked, allowing them to be repeated.

The traditional advice on giving feedback is to give it in a “sandwich” form, where the critical “meats” are sandwiched between two slices of praise. Others, though, have rethought that method and instead recommend a different approach:

  * Start by explaining _why_ you're giving your feedback. People are more receptive to feedback when they understand its reason and feel you have their best interests at heart.
  * Next, share how similar feedback has helped you in your challenges. This helps people be more open to negative feedback because they won’t see you as confrontational, but instead, as a partner.
  * Finally, ask the person if they want to hear the feedback. If they agree (and they usually will), then they’ll feel more ownership of it and will hear it less defensively. 



#### 2\. Personalize Your Recognition

The best way to recognize a team member is with personalized recognition that lets them know you’ve noticed them _in particular_ for a specific accomplishment. This runs counter to many incentive systems, which are routine, bureaucratic, and one-size-fits-all.

**People consistently report that the most meaningful recognition they’ve received is personal rather than financial.** In fact, relying on financial recognition to the exclusion of any personal recognition can be demotivating rather than motivating. For example, one manager at Wells Fargo had a habit of rewarding his team members with bonuses for good work, but never reached out and thanked them personally or gave them any encouraging feedback. Instead, he would simply include a bonus to their paycheck with no explanation. The random and inconsistent nature of the rewards, coupled with the lack of guidance, left his team unable to determine when they were doing well or why. Morale and productivity _decreased_ as a result.

To personalize your recognition:

  * Get to know your team on a personal level.
  * Get creative with incentives.
  * Say “thank you.”



##### Get to Know Your Team on a Personal Level

**Conventional wisdom dictates that you shouldn’t become friends with people you work with. However, research disproves this.** In surveys, employees who say they have a friendly relationship with their superiors report being two-and-a-half times more satisfied with their jobs.

Get to know your team members on a personal level. Go out of your way to speak to them outside of your respective roles. Walk the halls, visit your factories, and regularly meet in small groups with colleagues, suppliers, and clients.

Further, encourage friendships among team members. When people feel a personal connection to others, they’re motivated to work harder because they don’t want to disappoint people they consider friends.

In a five-year study, researchers observed different groups of people cooperating on motor-skill and decision-making tasks. Some of these groups were made up of friends and some of only acquaintances. The groups of friends completed more than three times as many projects as the groups of acquaintances.

##### Get Creative With Incentives

One of the best ways to personalize your recognition of someone’s efforts is to get creative with it. Informal, spontaneous rewards can often be more meaningful than formal ones.

A personalized reward that shows you know the other person is far more meaningful than a generic reward. For example, you might give gas cards to employees who travel or an iTunes card to someone who likes music.

Don’t be afraid to get silly. Adding humor lifts morale; for example, managers have had great results giving out stuffed giraffes, mugs with a team photo, classic car rides, and so on. One team adopted a large plastic fish that would reside at the desk of the employee of the month.

Recognize effort in real time: **Recognition is often most effective when it's immediate.** Don’t wait until a project is completed to dole out praise—recognizing when people are performing well while they’re in the middle of a project is more encouraging. Even small amounts of praise go a long way when delivered in the moment.

##### Say “Thank You”

**The simple act of saying “thank you” is perhaps the easiest and yet most frequently overlooked way to make your team members feel personally recognized.** The phrase can have an outsized effect on employee morale because people want to feel that what they do makes a difference and is noticed.

Personal congratulations consistently rank at the top of the list of most powerful motivators, as reported by employees. Studies show that 81% of people say they’d work harder if they had a more appreciative supervisor.

For example, when the law firm Sullivan and Cromwell noticed their first-year recruits were leaving the firm sooner than expected, they conducted surveys and found that the workers didn’t feel appreciated by their supervisors. The firm enacted a policy requiring all partners to say “Please” and “Thank you” when making a request. This simple change reversed the attrition; one year later, _American Lawyer_ magazine voted the firm the best law firm to work for.

Expressing gratitude has another benefit: It makes the person giving thanks feel good, too. Research shows that people who show gratitude are more optimistic, healthier, energized, and better able to manage stress.

Look for opportunities to recognize, thank, and encourage your team members every day. You might even use a physical prompt to help you remember to do this—for example, you might put three pennies in your left pocket and move one to your right pocket each time you recognize someone, aiming to have all three in your right pocket by the end of every day.

### Guideline 10: Celebrate Values and Victories

You can engage the hearts of your team members by bringing an attitude of celebration to your workplace. In doing so, celebrate not only accomplishments but also the shared values that define your team.

To cultivate a celebratory workspace:

  1. Foster community spirit.
  2. Become personally involved.



#### 1\. Foster Community Spirit Through Celebrations

Creating a spirit of community motivates people to do their best because they’re thinking not only of themselves but of their peers. Their identity becomes linked to the group, making them more invested in the group’s success.

Humans are social creatures, and you should view social gatherings not as a nuisance, but instead as a way to allow your team members to exercise their instinctive drives to form bonds with others. **Strong social connections lead to trust, reciprocity, information sharing, and collaboration** , all of which lead to success for your organization or project.

Research shows that corporate celebrations, ceremonies, and rituals are effective ways of creating a feeling of community. During good times, celebrations make team members feel proud of their accomplishments. During difficult times, celebrations draw people together and increase morale, helping team members persevere through the challenges. Studies show that employees working for leaders who always find ways to celebrate accomplishments are 25% more committed to their jobs than those working for leaders who seldom do.

The purpose of celebrations is not only to build community spirit but also to explicitly reinforce actions and behaviors that demonstrate your organization’s shared values. As such, celebrations don’t have to be elaborate; they can be small ways to connect the everyday actions of your team to the wider organization. For example, you might regularly highlight exemplary employees at staff meetings, and make those shout-outs resonate by specifically listing their accomplishments.

To successfully implement celebrations into your regular work routines:

  * Publicly celebrate accomplishments.
  * Encourage friendships.
  * Have fun together.



##### Publicly Celebrate Accomplishments

Public celebrations build on the technique we discussed earlier, of expressing gratitude for a job well done. Celebrating your gratitude with others as witnesses takes your thanks a step further, using the accomplishments of one to show others what they can aim for. **Public celebrations thus turn the person being celebrated into a role model and set standards for the group.**

Further, public celebrations encourage a culture of positivity, which translates into happy employees. Research shows that people often adopt the mood of others around them in what’s called “emotional contagion.” Brain scans show neurological circuits are activated when a person sees another act in a certain way, as if they’d acted that way themselves. Therefore, celebrating one person’s success makes their teammates feel happy about themselves, too.

One of the managers at Intuitive Surgical, a maker of surgical instruments, did this well when he implemented a “Red Stapler” award, which was simply a red stapler given out at a weekly staff meeting to an employee who’d recently demonstrated the company’s values. It was presented with a short speech detailing the employee’s achievement. The award proved so popular that the company extended it to other departments.

These celebrations and awards become even more meaningful if they are directed by your team, rather than by management. Create a system where team members can nominate and vote for each other. Recognition coming from peers is typically more powerful than recognition coming from management.

Some leaders are hesitant to recognize certain team members in public, out of concerns it might cause jealousy or resentment. Such fears are usually unfounded; winning teams regularly honor their Most Valuable Players, and these honorees are often selected by their teammates.

##### Encourage Friendships

Your organization’s community spirit will be greatly enhanced if your team members are friends with each other. As we discussed earlier, teams made up of friends perform better: They communicate better, evaluate ideas more critically, give more appropriate feedback to help others stay on track, and offer more positive encouragement. This turns into stronger feelings of accountability and commitment to the group and organization.

Studies have shown other quantifiable results when people work with friends:

  * Those who work with a close friend are seven times more likely to engage fully in their work than those who don’t. 
  * People who work with friends have higher incomes than those who don’t.
  * People who don’t work with friends are more likely to ignore collaborative opportunities.
  * People with friends in the workplace more readily engage customers, have higher productivity levels, and have fewer accidents at work. 



Use celebrations to encourage social connections among your team members, even if it’s something as simple as a group cheer at a staff meeting. These kinds of positive interactions reinforce a feeling of being part of a team working toward a common purpose, which is something people crave.

##### Have Fun

Your team’s sense of community spirit will increase when your team has fun. Don’t think of fun as a work luxury, but instead think of it as an important way to boost morale—most people assert that if they’re not having fun, they have difficulty maintaining the level of intensity required to do their best at their jobs.

**Organizations that have fun are consistently more profitable.** In fact, on _Fortune_ ’s list of 100 Best Companies to Work For, an average of 81% of employees who respond say they’re working for a “fun” company. Fun has several tangible benefits for an organization:

  * It increases peoples’ problem-solving skills and creativity.
  * It increases productivity. 
  * It decreases turnover. 



As a leader, you can set the tone for your organization with a clear message that fun isn't just acceptable, but expected. Aim to build fun into the workday so that people don’t have to use their own personal time to engage in it. For example, you might change the structure of your staff meetings, making them more informal with couches or an unusual setting. You can also encourage group dinners or other off-campus events to mark milestones and progress.

Having fun doesn't necessarily mean having parties. Fun can be built into the work itself. For example, if there’s a difficult task, be positive and encouraging, so that the task feels enjoyable.

#### 2\. Be Personally Involved

To effectively build a culture that celebrates its values and accomplishments, be personally involved in those celebrations. When you're present to cheer your team members, you send a stronger message than you ever could through any formal corporate communication. **Being personally involved earns a leader respect, trust, credibility, and loyalty from their team.**

Research confirms the impact that being personally involved can have on your team. Employees who report that their leaders almost always get personally involved in celebrating accomplishments rate themselves 40% to 50% higher on measures of motivation, pride, and productivity than do workers who report their leaders are only occasionally personally involved in recognition.

To become personally involved in your organization’s celebrations:

  * Show you care.
  * Spread stories.
  * Make celebrations part of your organizational life.



##### Show You Care

Showing you care means making your team members feel supported and valued, and assuring them that you won’t ask them to do something where they could be hurt. When you show you care, they feel you have their best interests at heart, and they’re more likely to work hard for you. There are many ways you can do this, including:

  * **Say thanks** : As we discussed earlier, the simple act of saying “thank you” is a great way to show your team that you have their interests at heart.
  * **Deliver bad news in person** : Instead of letting someone know of difficult changes through email, a phone call, or a lower-level manager, talk with them face-to-face. 
  * **Be consistently visible** : Attending meetings or organizational events, stopping by cubicles to chat, visiting customers, and touring labs or factories demonstrates that you care about the people who work in different areas of your organization. 



##### Spread Stories

When you become personally involved in the work routines and operations of your team members, you'll witness activities that exemplify your organization’s values. Remember these examples and be ready to relate them to others in the form of first-person stories (something you saw yourself rather than something someone else told you about).

As we mentioned earlier, stories are powerful ways of communicating ideas and teaching lessons. Stories engage a listener in an emotional, compelling way, making them feel they’ve been in the experience and helping them understand a message in a meaningful way.

You can use storytelling to celebrate someone exemplifying your shared values. This will also encourage team spirit, because when you tell a story celebrating someone’s accomplishment, it encourages others to be proud of the accomplishment, too.

There are many ways you can disseminate company stories, including:

  * Publishing them in a company newsletter
  * Including them in the company’s annual report
  * Making videos about them on an internal network
  * Mentioning them on internal social media



##### Incorporate Celebrations Into Organizational Life

Mark celebratory moments on the company calendar. Include not just birthdays and holidays but also significant milestones of your team and organization. Use celebrations to honor individuals, groups, teams, departments, or organizational accomplishments. This lets your team know that you prioritize these celebrations and allows members to look forward to them.

Aim for at least one large celebration per year that involves your whole team—or your whole organization—and draws attention to your shared, core values.

Some examples of the types of celebrations you can work into your company’s regular calendar include:

  * Cyclical celebrations: for key milestones, anniversaries, or holidays
  * Recognition celebrations: for accomplishments
  * Major milestone celebrations: for large achievements such as opening a new branch
  * Comfort rituals: for banding together after layoffs, the loss of a colleague, or some other setback
  * Personal transitions: for exits and entrances of workers
  * Altruism: for social policies and charitable works
  * Play: for pure entertainment—sporting events, happy hours, games, and so on



### Case Study: Stephanie Sorg of the San Jose Earthquakes

Stephanie Sorg, a coach for the developmental team of the San Jose Earthquakes, a Major League Soccer club, found that leading with heart brought out the best in her team members. After she noticed that her coaching style was not motivating the team effectively, she decided to focus more on the personal needs of her players and less on the strict game fundamentals. She started commenting on their efforts rather than their mistakes and getting to know their interests. After some time, her changed style made a concrete difference: The players paid more attention to her feedback and became more dedicated to their performance.
