## Exercise: Reflect On Virtue

Lewis argues that virtue will change you. As you make a practice of virtuous acts, you will gradually become more aware of opportunities for virtue, and you will confront all of your vices. This exercise provides a chance to reflect on virtue and opportunities for moral decision-making in your daily life.

Lewis argues that humility is the _most important_ virtue. Only when we are truly humble will we be able to surrender to God's moral laws. Do you agree? If so, explain why. If not, write down which of Lewis’s other key Christian virtues (faith, benevolence, moderation) you consider to be the most important to living a fulfilling life and explain why.

Now that you have selected the virtue that is most important to you, brainstorm a list of opportunities to practice this virtue. Think about what your daily life looks like from when you get out of bed in the morning until you go to sleep at night. Consider your daily interactions with family, coworkers, and friends. Where and when could start practicing this virtue?

Lewis asserts that practicing virtue requires surrender—when your will is in conflict with God's law, you must submit. Now that you have a list of opportunities to practice virtue in your daily life, consider this question: What might you have to give up to practice this virtue every day? (For example, you may need to give up an indulgence, let go of a grudge in order to forgive, or tighten your budget to give more to charity.) Explain the sacrifices you would have to make to practice this virtue every day.
