## Exercise: Reflect on the Nature of God

Lewis makes several claims on the nature and character of God. In this exercise, you'll have a chance to reflect on his arguments and develop your perception of God.

* * *

Lewis contrasts three potential understandings of God: (1) Christianity’s moral God who has granted us free will, (2) dualism’s moral God who is at war with an evil God, and (3) pantheism’s morally neutral God. Do you share Lewis's perception that the first one is the most compelling? If so, explain why. If not, pick the model you find more compelling and explain why.

Lewis argues that we can understand that God is moral because God created moral laws—thus making an _inference_ about the mind of God by looking to creation. Could we infer other preferences, properties, or qualities of God by looking at creation? Think about the world around you. What sort of creator does it suggest to you and why?
