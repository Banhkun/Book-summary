## Exercise: Consider Your Expertise

We have seen that 10,000 hours of practice is not a magic number when mastering a new skill. But chances are there are several skills we have spent so much time on that we can do them well without even thinking. Sometimes we may not even realize that we have “mastered” a skill.

* * *

What is a skill or activity that you feel you are an expert at? What makes you feel you’re an expert?

When you picture yourself doing that activity, how would you describe your thought process? (Do you have to think hard about what you are doing? Do you do periodic mental check-ins to make sure you are on point? Can you do this activity without even thinking, maybe even while multitasking?)

How long have you been working on this skill? (You don’t need a specific number of hours, but think about how much you have practiced and for how long.)

Given your answer above, do you feel like this is an activity you are naturally good at, something you have worked very hard to be good at, or a combination of both?

Are there any aspects of how you either learned or currently perform this task that you can apply to another task that you find more challenging?
