## Part 10: Genes and Evolutionary Adaptations

As we have discussed, our genes are influenced by our environment. But the interplay between genes and environment does not begin when we are born. Our genome is a product of thousands of years of evolutionary history. Our genes can help to tell the story of the environment that our ancestors evolved in. Next, we will look at Epstein’s discussion of how **evolutionary environments developed the traits that give modern-day athletes a competitive advantage**. Specifically, Epstein uses ancestral environments to help explain why many elite runners come from very specific populations.

(Shortform note: We use the term “adaptation” to refer to a specific trait that humans have developed over time in response to environmental pressure. This section deals with general adaptations and their relevance to endurance athletes. However, Epstein’s discussion of these principles in the book mainly focuses on explaining why Kenyan runners so heavily dominate the world of distance running. We will do the same.)

### Latitude and Endurance

People with recent African ancestry have long arms and legs relative to the rest of their bodies. A trend that holds true in animal and human populations from around the world is that, **as you move closer to the equator, limbs generally become longer and thinner.** In contrast, cultures like the Inuit people who live in cold environments often have short legs. Epstein notes that this is likely due to the higher temperatures in many low-latitude environments. **Short limbs conserve heat, while long limbs create a greater surface area for cooling.** During long-distance running events, becoming overheated will not only decrease performance but can be dangerous.

> **Body Temperature Regulation During Exercise**
> 
> Our ability to control our body temperature influences our sports performance. Our body releases heat to our environment via our skin. When we need to lose heat the blood vessels in our skin dilate. This allows more blood to pass through, where it can release heat to the air. This is called vasodilation. The larger the surface area of the skin, the more blood that can be nearer to the air, and the greater the potential for cooling (this is one reason why jackrabbits’ ears are so large and full of blood vessels.)
> 
> The other way our skin allows us to lose heat is through evaporative cooling (sweating). During intense exercise, our muscles produce a large amount of heat that our body needs to release. When we sweat, the energy that we perceive as heat is transferred to the water molecules on our skin. This energy causes the water molecules to evaporate, carrying away the energy (heat) from our bodies. This process happens continuously while we exercise so that we do not overheat. The larger the surface area of our skin, the greater the potential for evaporation and heat loss.
> 
> The adaptation of maximizing surface area is especially important for distance events such as the marathon, where runners are exerting themselves for hours at a time.

#### Latitude and Kenyan Running Dominance

Populations from the Nile Valley in Africa evolved in hot low-latitude environments and tend to have long, thin legs. Anthropologists refer to this as a “Nilotic” body type for populations from the Nile Valley. **A Nilotic body type may help to explain a piece of why Kenyan runners dominate in distance running events.**

Kenyan superiority in distance running is one of the most well-known and consistent examples of athletes from a specific community dominating a sport. Epstein includes a few race results for illustration:

  * In the 2013 Berlin marathon, the top five male finishers were all Kenyan, as were the first-, second-, and fourth-place female finishers. 
  * In the 2013 Chicago marathon Kenyan men took places 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 11, and Kenyan women took first and second.
  * The 2013 New York City Marathon was also won by a Kenyan man and a Kenyan woman. 
  * An article in _Runner's World_ calculated that Kenyan runners would have had a one in 1,600,000,000 chance of winning the medals they won at the 1988 Olympics by chance alone. 
  * In cross-country running championships, Kenyans outperformed other groups by a factor of 1,700.
  * Epstein notes that only five American high school runners have ever beaten a four-minute mile but four boys capable of the same feat could be found at the same Kenyan high school at any given time. 



Epstein notes that even more striking than the fact that all of these athletes are from the same country is that most of them are from the same tribe, the Kalenjin tribe from the Kenyan Rift Valley.**Kenyan athletes from the Kalenjin tribe represent only 12% of the country’s population but 75% of its elite runners.** At the time of _The Sports Gene_ ’s __ writing, only 17 men in the United States had ever run a marathon faster than 2 hours and 10 minutes. But 32 men from the Kalenjin tribe did it in just the month of October in 2011!

> **The Tarahumara: A Tribe of Ultrarunners**
> 
> The Kalenjin are not the only tribe where nature _and_ nurture forged elite athletes. In his national bestseller _Born to Run_ , Christopher McDougall highlights the Tarahumara tribe of the Sierra Madre mountain region in Mexico. This tribe lives deep in the wilderness, in cliffside caves and camouflaged dwellings. They are notoriously mysterious and elusive. McDougall describes the Tarahumara as “superathletes” and “the greatest runners of all time.” As he describes it, members of the Tarahumara tribe can run 300 miles through rugged mountain wilderness without stopping. A historian once documented a champion runner from the tribe covering 435 miles in a single run.
> 
> An article from The University of Chicago Press _Journals_ corroborates McDougall’s description of the Tarahumara’s almost superhuman athleticism, and it discusses the impact of culture on the tribe’s running. The article notes that the Tarahumara do not “train” to run in the sense that Western cultures think of training for sports. Instead, running in the Tarahumara culture is practical (the Tarahumara have been said to run after deer until the animals simply collapse from exhaustion), cultural (the article notes that some long-distance running events are considered a form of dance), and spiritual (the culture views running in endurance races as a type of prayer).
> 
> Mcdougall notes that the Tarahumara are able to run incredibly long distances over their entire lives without sustaining common overuse injuries that plague most runners. This suggests a genetic predisposition to distance running. However, if running were not so integral to their culture, it is unlikely that so many Tarahumara people would run as much as they do.
> 
> The Tarahumara are also a counterpoint to Epstein’s discussion of globalization in sports. Epstein credits the incredible physiological diversity on the elite sports stage to the fact that modern sports have “drawn out” supremely gifted athletes from around the world. He suggests that part of the reason that athletic records are being broken at a slower rate in modern times is that much of the athletic potential from around the world has already been reached. However, the Tarahumara seem to represent an anomalous well of athletic talent that remains largely absent from the world sports stage.

##### A Note About Limb Proportions in Swimming vs. Running

Epstein notes that the different limb proportions between people with recent African ancestry and other athletes helps to explain a piece of why athletes of different races tend to be over or underrepresented in different sports.**Research shows that long limbs give athletes a 1.5% advantage in running and a 1.5% disadvantage in swimming**. In sports where races are often won by a fraction of a second, 1.5% is a big difference. Epstein notes that this says more about why African athletes and athletes with recent African ancestry dominate running events than it does about why there are far more white swimmers. There are significantly more barriers to entry into swimming, which prevents a true comparison.

> **Lack of Pool Access Led to Overrepresentation of White Swimmers**
> 
> The historic lack of minority access to public pools helps explain the overrepresentation of white athletes in swimming events. In the United States, black swimmers have been systematically excluded from recreational swimming, both by policy and by outright intimidation.
> 
> An article from NPR notes that in the 1920s and ‘30s, during the largest boom of public pool construction, black swimmers were either officially banned from swimming pools or were intimidated and physically assaulted by white swimmers when they tried to participate. When official discriminatory policies were lifted, white swimmers “abandoned” public pools in favor of private clubs where they could still discriminate against black swimmers, leaving public pools to struggle and close. Today there are even fewer public pools in the US than there were in the 1920s and ‘30s, especially in low-income areas. This lack of access has created a dangerous situation today in which roughly 60% of black children do not know how to swim, and they drown at a much higher rate than white children.

### Altitude and Aerobic Capacity

A Nilotic body type, combined with the narrow lower legs found in Kenyan runners (discussed In the Body Types and Success in Sports section), creates a definitive advantage when it comes to running long distances. As we will see, there are additional environmental and cultural factors that combine to help explain why Kenyan (and specifically Kalenjin) runners dominate the world of distance running.

**One way that athletes use their training environment to improve aerobic capacity is to train at altitude.** Epstein notes that many athletes in the United States travel to Mammoth Lakes, California, or Flagstaff, Arizona to train at altitude (both of these cities sit at between 7,000 and 8,000 feet in elevation). The goal of training at altitude is to force the body to generate more red blood cells in response to lower levels of oxygen in the air (more red blood cells means more hemoglobin, which is the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen). However, In another example of how our genes affect our response to training, **not everyone who trains at altitude will reap the same benefits.**

  * In one study highlighted by Epstein, researchers looked at athletes’ EPO hormone levels (the hormone that causes the body to make more red blood cells) in response to altitude. Results showed wide variation in EPO levels after one day at altitude. Some athletes’ levels increased by more than 400%, and the range extended downward to one athlete whose levels actually decreased.
  * In another study, runners trained at altitude for one month and then went back to sea level for a 5k race. Runners whose red blood cell count went up by 8% were able to improve their race time by almost 40 seconds. Athletes whose red blood cell count did not change actually ran slower than before the training trip. 



Based on these studies, it seems that training at altitude does not guarantee improvement. But **being born at altitude does seem to be an athletic advantage**. As Epstein explains, people who are born or grow up at altitude develop larger-than-average lungs. This is an advantage in endurance sports because larger lungs create a greater surface area for oxygen exchange. This adaptation happens even in children whose parents were not born at altitude, indicating that the trait does not need to be inherited. However, Epstein notes that this adaptation only occurs in children. (He notes that at the time of writing, the fastest male and female American marathoners were both born and/or raised at altitude.)

> **Training for Race-Specific Conditions: Heat Training**
> 
> While Epstein discusses the power of the environment on an athlete’s physiology, he does not discuss the importance of preparing for the environment athletes can expect on “game day.” As elite athletic competitions such as the Olympics happen all around the world, at varying altitudes and in varying temperatures, being physiologically prepared for environmental conditions can serve as a non-genetically based competitive advantage.
> 
> An article in the _International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism_ discusses how “heat training” can allow athletes to prepare for competitions in hot environments, and may even improve performance in cooler environments. Some of the highlighted benefits of training in heat include:
> 
>   * An increase in VO2 max (aerobic capacity)
> 
>   * An increased ability to tolerate heat via improved blood flow to the skin and increased sweating
> 
>   * A decrease in heart rate and core temperature while exercising
> 
>   * An increase in “thermal tolerance” (which we can assume would decrease discomfort during a race on a hot day)
> 
>   * A potential increase in the time it takes to reach “exhaustion” during exercise
> 
>   * A potential reduction in blood viscosity (allowing blood to circulate more easily during exercise)
> 
> 

> 
> The article notes that these adaptations are maximized with 10-14 days of heat training, but that the training should occur as close to race day as possible as the benefits “decay” at a rate of 2.5% per day upon completion of the training.
> 
> As evidence of the impact of race-day conditions, Epstein notes that in the 2004 Athens Olympics Paula Radcliffe, the world record holder in the women’s marathon at the time, was unable to finish the race because the temperature was 95 degrees. If an extremely hot day can cause the world record holder in an event to not finish her race, clearly race day conditions can have an enormous impact on performance; in extreme circumstances, enough to negate genetic talents.

#### Evolutionary Adaptations to Altitude

Studies of the three major human civilizations that have evolved at altitude show that **different populations have adapted to altitude differently** , and shed further light on why distance runners from Kenya in particular may have an extra athletic advantage.

  * Bolivian populations from the Andes live at 13,000 feet. They have adapted to their high-altitude environment (over many generations) by producing extra red blood cells. Since red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which carries oxygen, the adaptation seems to be to have a hemoglobin molecule ready to attach to any available oxygen molecule that makes its way into the bloodstream. However, this adaptation can be a disadvantage in sports because the additional red blood cells can thicken the blood, decreasing its ability to flow easily through blood vessels.



(Shortform note: Bolivia has regularly participated in the Olympic games since 1964, but has yet to take home a medal.)

  * Natives of Nepal and Tibet live at up to 18,000 feet. They have normal hemoglobin levels and seem to have adapted to high altitudes by having up to 240 times more nitric oxide in their blood than people who live at sea level. Nitric oxide causes dilation in the lungs, which increases blood flow. Epstein notes that they oxygenate this extra blood flow by breathing deeply and quickly, as though hyperventilating. Epstein cites a researcher who suggests that this is an energy-intensive adaptation to altitude.



From these studies Epstein shares the following preliminary findings about altitude and sports:

  * **The adaptation that seems to be most advantageous in sports involves producing extra oxygen-carrying hemoglobin**. However, as evidenced by Bolivian populations, too much hemoglobin can be disadvantageous, so the right balance is key.
  * An increase in hemoglobin levels seems to happen as an initial adaptation to altitude, as it appears in athletes who move to altitude to train and in populations that moved to altitude in recent evolutionary history.
  * **The prime altitude for increasing aerobic capacity seems to be between 6,000 and 9,000 feet**. (The Bolivian populations in the Andes live well above this ideal altitude, which may account for why they have produced so much extra hemoglobin that their blood has thickened.)



> **Sherpas as Superathletes**
> 
> Nepal has competed at the summer Olympics since 1964 but has yet to take home a medal. However, their lack of representation on the podium does not mean that Nepal does not produce some of the world’s toughest athletes. Natives of Nepal who work on Mount Everest as sherpas are widely regarded as superathletes. Not only have many of them made the ascent up Everest many times (a feat considered by many as a pinnacle of athletic achievement), but they do so while caring for groups of other climbers and carrying the extra weight of climbing gear on their backs.
> 
> If mountaineering were to become an Olympic sport, Nepal would surely be raking in the medals and sherpas would be highlighted as athletes with genes perfectly suited to their sport.

Epstein suggests that**an ideal scenario for an endurance athlete would be to have a genotype that evolved at sea level (at least until relatively recently), and to be born and train at an altitude of between 6,000 and 9,000 feet.** He notes that this is the exact scenario of the Kalenjin runners from Kenya and the Oromo runners from Ethiopia (he notes that Ethiopia often comes in second to Kenya in distance races), who both live in the Rift Valley.

### Malaria and Sprinting

The concept of the environment shaping the athlete over evolutionary history also adds a piece to the puzzle of why athletes with **West African heritage dominate sprint events in track and field.** Epstein notes that at the writing of _The Sports Gene_ , every finalist in the men’s (and all but one in the women’s) 100 meters at an Olympic games since 1980 has had recent West African ancestry. This phenomenon has not yet been explained, but genetic research suggests that populations in West Africa evolved certain traits in response to their environment that happen to confer an advantage in explosive sports.

Research has shown that **athletes with West African ancestors tend to have a high ratio of fast-twitch (type 2) muscle fibers**. Fast-twitch muscle fibers are used for short bursts of explosive movements, such as sprinting. One evidence-based theory suggests that this muscle fiber composition evolved in response to high rates of malaria in West Africa.

A high ratio of type-two muscle fibers co-occurs with low levels of hemoglobin. Data from nearly 750,000 people shows that**African American people** (many of whom have West African ancestry)**generally have lower hemoglobin levels than white Americans**. For reasons not well understood, having low hemoglobin levels seems to provide a degree of protection against malaria.

According to the theory presented by Epstein, **having low hemoglobin levels led to an evolutionary trade-off between endurance and speed.** Low hemoglobin levels mean less capacity to oxygenate muscles during endurance exercise (hemoglobin is the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen), and so is a disadvantage in endurance events. Type 2 muscles are able to produce energy without using oxygen, but can only do so in short bursts. Having more type 2 muscle fibers would allow people living in high-malaria areas to maintain lower hemoglobin levels with the side effect of making them more powerful sprinters.

(Shortform note: We often hear muscle fibers being referred to as “fast twitch” and “slow twitch” or “type 1” and “type 2.” This is how Epstein refers to muscles throughout _The Sports Gene_. But we actually have three types of muscle fibers: type 1, type 2A, and type 2B. Type 2A muscle fibers are an intermediate muscle type, with characteristics of both type 1 and type 2B. They are larger than type 1 fibers, can produce a greater amount of force more quickly than type 1 fibers, are quicker to fatigue than type 1 fibers, and can use both oxygen and ATP (an anaerobic energy pathway) to produce energy. Type 2B muscle fibers produce energy anaerobically, and are very quick to fatigue.)

**In addition to low hemoglobin, being a carrier of the sickle cell trait seems to have a protective effect against malaria.** As we discussed earlier, carriers of the sickle cell trait have red blood cells that adopt the sickle shape when infected with malaria, which prevents the cells from traveling as easily through their bodies. As discussed in the section on genetic mutations and sports, being a carrier of the trait is a disadvantage in endurance events, as low oxygen environments can cause red blood cells to “sickle.” Conversely, for reasons not well understood, Epstein explains that **this trait seems to be an advantage in explosive events that require low endurance but high power, such as sprinting and jumping.**

(Shortform note: It is not clear whether Epstein is making the argument that the sickle cell trait itself confers a sprinting advantage, or whether the sickle cell trait merely tends to be seen alongside the adaptation of low hemoglobin levels. As Epstein discusses, this is an area of research that is still not well understood, and so for now we can only note that these two traits seem to be correlated with speed.)

> **The Black Sprinting Stereotype**
> 
> In his discussion of the higher degree of genetic diversity between people with recent African ancestry and people with ancestors from other parts of the world, Epstein notes that two African or African-American athletes are likely to be more genetically different from each other than two athletes from a different population. This diversity is lost in the way that our culture often stereotypes black athletes as being universally fast.
> 
> An article from the BBC adds to Epstein's comment that every winner of the 100 meters in the history of the Olympics has been black. The article adds that every winner of the Athletic World Championships 100 meter dash has been black, as has every finalist (with one single exception) over the last 10 events. However, the article cautions against interpreting these results to mean that all African people, or all African-American people, are fast.
> 
> The article uses the example of Kalenjin running success to illustrate this point, noting that just because members of the Kalenjin tribe dominate the marathon, this does not mean that all African and African-American people are incredible distance runners. Rather, what both the marathon and 100-meter results can tell us is that there are two incredible pockets of talent —Kalenjin and a subset of runners with West-African heritage (largely Jamaican)—that dominate two running events. In fact, in _The Sports Gene_ Epstein makes the argument that the high degree of genetic diversity in Africa suggests that both the fastest and the slowest runners in the world may have recent African origins.
> 
> The purpose of the article is to highlight the flawed logic and societal risk of characterizing a group of people with broad generalizations. This discussion also highlights the value of the conversations started in _The Sports Gene_ , as a deeper understanding of genetic differences may lead to a more thoughtful society in general.
