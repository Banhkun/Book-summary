## Part 9: Genes and the Story of Human Migration

Elite athletes are a product of their heritage long before they are a product of their training. In exploring how genetic diversity impacts sports performance Epstein goes all the way back to the very beginnings of our species. **Looking at humans over evolutionary time can help us understand why the genetic diversity that we see on the playing field exists.**

### The Recent African Origin Model

Epstein notes that up until around the 1970s, many anthropologists believed that modern man had evolved independently in different populations around the world. However, extensive DNA sampling from populations all over the globe suggests otherwise.**DNA samples show a greater variety of traits represented in the collective genome of African populations than populations from other parts of the world.** For some traits the difference in diversity between DNA of African origin and DNA from the rest of the world is immense. For example, Epstein notes that for one set of genes, an African Pygmy population had more diversity than the rest of the world put together.

DNA sampling helped change the way anthropologists construct the story of modern man.**The fact that there is so much genetic diversity in Africa** **and comparatively little elsewhere (particularly in Europe) suggests that humans originated in sub-Saharan East Africa and migrated around the world from there.** This theory is called the “Recent African Origin Model.” (The term “recent” should be taken in evolutionary terms. Humans are estimated to have migrated out of Africa 90,000 years ago.)

The Recent African Origin Model also suggests that the reason genetic diversity in a population decreases the farther populations migrated from Africa (with Native Americans being the least diverse) is that only a relatively small group of people set off each time, taking a comparatively small amount of the gene pool with them.

> **Equity in Genetics Research Would Further Our Understanding of Genes and Sports**
> 
> Understanding how genes impact athletic performance or any other trait requires a well-rounded sample. A 2020 article in _Nature_ discusses the underrepresentation of people with African Ancestry in genetics research. Although African people represent the majority of the human population’s genetic diversity, the article notes that most research on genetics has focused on European populations. This lack of equity in research not only hinders scientific knowledge but further exacerbates inequities in medical research and health care.
> 
> The article notes that while there has been a recent push to increase equity in genetics research, people with European ancestry are overrepresented in research on polygenic risk scores (which can help identify an individual's risk of certain diseases) by a factor of 460%. This means that the results of research on diseases are not as applicable to non-European populations, leading to fewer reliable diagnostic tools for non-white patients.
> 
> The article also notes that insight into a population’s genes helps to predict how individuals in that group will respond to different medicines. If drug research is focused on people with European ancestry, then non-white patients may be more at risk of adverse side effects. For example, the article notes that individuals with African ancestry are more likely to experience dangerous bleeding when taking warfarin (a common blood thinner).
> 
> A sports-related example of how knowledge of genetic differences can lead to improved health care is the NCAA’s decision to test athletes for the sickle cell trait discussed in the section on genetic mutations. Epstein notes that white athletes can opt out of the screening, as they have a very low chance of being carriers of the trait. But the knowledge that the trait is relatively common in African-American athletes, and subsequent testing, has the potential to save young athletes’ lives.

### Clusters of Genes as Evidence of Human Migration

Having a specific variant of a gene can tell researchers about a person’s ancestry. **When small groups of people left the larger human population to colonize a new area they carried a small subset of the population’s genome with them. Their more narrow set of traits propagated through the new population as it grew.** Epstein illustrates the principle that certain traits cluster in populations with a few examples:

  * Tay-Sachs disease, which affects the nervous system and leads to a very early death, comes from having two mutation-carrying copies of the Hexa gene. It is uncommon around the world but relatively common in Jewish people with ancestors from Poland or Russia. In this population, one in 30 people carries the mutation.
  * Epstein notes that almost every human used to be lactose intolerant. When humans domesticated cattle, being able to digest milk became an advantage. Populations in Europe who faced cold winters with few food options needed cattle to survive, and, over generations, developed lactose tolerance. Today almost all people from Denmark and Sweden can drink milk. In contrast, in East and West Africa, most people are still lactose intolerant.



These findings relate to sports in that they shed light on the dominance of African athletes (and athletes with recent African ancestry) in many sports. Epstein notes that, **since there is so much more diversity in Africa than in other parts of the world, it makes sense that for a given athletic skill, there will be more individuals in and recently from Africa who will excel at that skill**.

> **Founder Mutations as Evidence for the Recent African Origins Model**
> 
> Founder mutations are a specific subset of gene clusters that can be used to help track human populations over time. (Skier Eero Antero Mäntyranta’s erythropoietin receptor gene mutation is a Founder Mutation.) Founder mutations are genetic mutations that arise in a single person, the “founder,” and are passed down unchanged from generation to generation.
> 
> As an article from Scientific American explains, founder mutations are especially useful for anthropologists because they are passed down as a section of a chromosome rather than as a single segment of DNA. This allows anthropologists to tell how long ago the mutation originated. The segment is shortened with each generation (as the chromosome with the mutation is recombined with the corresponding chromosome from the other parent). A longer stretch indicates a younger mutation and a very short segment can indicate an ancient one.
> 
> A particular founder mutation on the gene that codes for PTC tasting added important evidence to the Recent African Origins Model. PTC is a compound found in plants that most of us perceive as tasting very bitter. This serves as a warning so that we don’t eat plants that are poisonous. A mutation that stops people from tasting PTC arose in the human population roughly 100,000 years ago.
> 
> Researchers found seven versions of the gene in sub-Saharan Africa with four versions being endemic to Africa. One version is found on rare occasions outside of Africa but has not been found in the Americas, and the other two versions are found throughout the world (one of which is the “non-taster” gene). These results support the idea that humans originated in Africa, and that genetic diversity decreased as people migrated outward.
