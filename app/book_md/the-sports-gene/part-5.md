## Part 5: Specific Genes and Their Impact on the Field

**There is no single gene that can account for an athlete’s success.** Epstein notes that at our current level of understanding, investigating the effects of a single gene can tell us more about why someone is _not_ an elite athlete than about why they are. He notes that even given how far our knowledge of specific genes has come, the most powerful piece of technology in determining whether someone will be an Olympic runner is still a stopwatch. In making this point, Epstein conveys a message of optimism to the vast majority of us who are not elite athletes. **We should not let research on a single gene or trait discourage us.**

**It will be a long time before science unravels the genetic basis of even seemingly basic traits. For example,** Epstein explains that it took a study of nearly 4,000 people and nearly 300,000 gene variants to determine just 45% of the genetic basis for height! However, for some genes, scientists have developed a decent idea of their role and effect on our physiology. We will look at a few examples that Epstein highlights next.

### ACTN3 Gene

As discussed above, our ratio of fast- to slow-twitch muscle fibers can determine our success in certain sports. Alpha-actinin-3 is a protein found in fast-twitch muscle fibers. The code for making this protein is found in the ACTN3 gene. The “R variant” of the gene results in normal production of the protein, but the “X” variant prevents the protein from being synthesized. While scientists do not know how this happens, **there is a strong correlation between the R genotype and sprinting speed.** Tests on athletes from around the world have revealed that **the XX genotype is almost nowhere to be found in elite sprinters.**

  * Researchers following the ACTN3 gene found that almost all African people (and people with recent African heritage) have at least one “R” copy of the gene. In contrast, populations from other parts of the world have varying frequencies of X alleles (for example, 25% of people of East Asian ancestry had two X copies). One possible explanation is that having less muscle mass is more efficient for metabolism in cold climates. Another is that the shift from hunting and gathering to agriculture meant that people were less dependent on bursts of speed and worked less intensely for a longer period of time, which would favor slow-twitch muscle fibers. 



The lack of a scientific explanation for why the XX variant is virtually absent in elite sprinters has not stopped for-profit genetic testing companies from selling genetic tests for ACTN3 gene variants to interested athletes and parents. As Epstein points out, since we do not know why some athletes are naturally fast, these tests can only really serve to add further evidence to the fact that most people with the XX genotype will not become elite sprinters; a fact that most people can ascertain without genetic testing.

> **Heterozygosity: Getting Different Versions of a Gene From Our Parents**
> 
> It is possible for a parent who possesses an athletically advantageous version of a gene to not pass this advantage on to their children. Inherited genes from our parents are a product of chance. All of the cells in our body (except for sex cells) are called diploid cells. We inherit one of our father’s versions of a gene and one of our mother’s versions of the same gene.
> 
> Since we have two versions of each gene, two letters are often used to describe a person’s genotype when discussing a particular trait. The two letters (or an uppercase and lowercase letter) refer to the two versions of the gene we inherited from our parents. A person who inherits two different versions is said to be heterozygous for that trait. (In his discussion of the ACTN 3 gene, Epstein is discussing heterozygosity, though not by that name.) Two of the same letter indicates that the person is homozygous for that trait.
> 
> Versions of genes are generally thought of as dominant or recessive (although inheritance often does not break down as cleanly as this). This means that we can carry a recessive version of a gene that we do not express. In some cases, being heterozygous for a gene can have a protective effect. For example, cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene. The disease is recessive, which means that if a person inherits a normal copy of the CFTR gene from one parent and a mutated copy from the other, they will not have cystic fibrosis. Instead, they are said to be carriers of the disease. The child of two carriers of the mutation will have a 25% chance of having cystic fibrosis.

### CREB 1 Gene

Researchers have discovered that the CREB 1 gene (a gene that influences the pace of our heartbeat) can help determine how much a person’s resting heart rate may drop in response to fitness training. This can help explain why some athletes’ resting heart rates can drop into the 40 beats per minute range, while some very fit people’s resting heart rates will remain higher.

(Shortform note: An article from the American Heart Association explains that this gene has a strong impact on how our heart rate responds to exercise, but that there are also “at least five” other alleles that also contribute to this response.)

> **Resting Heart Rate as a Measure of Fitness**
> 
> Epstein does not go into detail about the relationship between resting heart rate and fitness. Generally speaking, **a lowerresting heart rate indicates a more efficient heart muscle. **Most adults have a resting heart rate between 60 and 100 beats per minute. Athletes with a high degree of cardiovascular fitness may have a much lower resting heart rate (down to around 40 beats per minute). A lower resting heart rate is an indicator that, with each beat, the heart muscle can provide oxygenated blood to the rest of the body efficiently. Our hearts, like any muscle, respond to exercise. Participating in cardiovascular fitness training can strengthen our heart and thus lower our resting heart rate.
> 
> While most of us are aware that our resting heart rate is a proxy for our fitness level, our heart rate variability (a heart’s ability to quickly vary its rhythm in response to changing demands) is also an important indicator of our overall heart health. Low heart rate variability has been associated with depression, anxiety, and increased mortality from cardiovascular disease. When we are relaxed, our heart rates are more variable, indicating a heart that is both fit and able to respond to the demands (on or off the field) that we place on it.

### FTO Gene

Being heftier can be an advantage in sports like football and shot put while having a slighter frame can be an advantage in sports such as distance running. **While athletes will intentionally put on or take off weight as part of their training strategy, our heft is, at least in part, determined by our genes**. Epstein cites a study called the GIANT (Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits) Consortium Study, which looked at the genetic makeup of 100,000 adults. They were able to identify six gene variants that affected individual heft. One of the genes identified was the FTO gene, which can cause a person to have a stronger or weaker preference for fatty foods.

(Shortform note: In 2007, the FTO gene became the first gene that research definitively linked to obesity. Several studies have shown a strong link between genes and obesity, with an estimated range of 40-90% of a person’s obesity being genetically determined.)

Other genetic factors, such as a person’s ratio of fast- to slow-twitch muscle fibers, can also make losing weight easier or more difficult. **Fat is largely burned in the slow-twitch muscle fibers.** Epstein notes that **this may explain, in part, why people who put on muscle easily can have a hard time losing fat**. It can also explain why athletes who excel in power sports often have a naturally “stockier” build than endurance athletes.

> **The Myth of the “Fat Burning Zone”**
> 
> While some athletes put on weight for the sake of their sport, many exercisers are looking to lose fat. Both fat and carbohydrates can fuel exercise. When we perform cardiovascular exercise at a low intensity, a greater percentage of our body’s fuel comes from fat than from carbohydrates. The ratio of fats to carbohydrates burned at low intensity has led to a persistent idea in the fitness industry that exercisers looking to lose fat should stay in the low-intensity “fat-burning zone” (think a fast walk or light jog) during cardio.
> 
> This idea is so ingrained in the fitness industry that many pieces of cardio equipment list low target heart rates as “fat-burning zones.'' However, while low-intensity exercise may mean a greater percentage of fat is used for fuel, this does not mean that “light” cardio is better for weight loss. When the intensity of exercise is increased over the same period of time, our bodies burn more calories overall. Shifting the intensity to a higher level may decrease the ratio of fat to carbohydrates used, but the overall increase in calories burned will still result in more fat being utilized. Exercisers who adhere to the “fat-burning zones'' listed on the treadmill or other pieces of equipment may be unintentionally burning fewer calories (and thus less fat) than they would if they were to increase their effort level.

### Apolipoprotein E (APOE)

The Apolipoprotein E gene influences inflammation in our brains following head trauma. This gene is of particular interest for athletes such as football players for whom head trauma is a constant possibility during play. As Epstein notes, the Apolipoprotein E gene has three variants: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. A person’s variant of the gene can influence how they recover from a brain injury. **People with the APOE4 variant can experience more complications during the healing process and seem to be more at risk for dementia and cognitive impairment years down the road**. (The APOE4 variant is also associated with Alzheimer’s disease.)

Studies on boxers and football players have shown that having the APOE4 variant and being hit in the head during play can result in cognitive impairment. Data shows that **of the athletes who suffered severe complications from head trauma, many more had two copies of APOE4 than occurs in the general population**. Epstein cites one researcher who compares the risk of getting dementia for someone with one copy of APOE4 to the risk of brain damage from playing in the NFL. Having two copies (one from each parent) increases the risks.

In a possible direction for future policies in sports, Epstein notes that the elevated risk for athletes in contact sports with one or more copies of the APOE4 variant may warrant genetic testing. This would give players more information about their personal risk.

> **CTE**
> 
> A 2017 article in _The New York Times looked at the rates of CTE in NFL football players_. CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is associated with confusion and memory loss, depression, and dementia. It is likely caused by the accumulated damage of multiple blows to the head over time. The article notes that it likely does not take repeated game-stopping/concussion-causing blows to cause CTE. The article cites a study from Stanford showing that one lineman received 62 blows to the head during a single game, and each one carried the equivalent force of driving a car into a wall at 30 mph. These smaller hits happen more frequently and do not cause players to take time out to heal, which may contribute to CTE.
> 
> The NYT article discusses research findings from postmortem brain studies of 111 NFL players. One hundred and ten of them had CTE. While the article acknowledges that the results are skewed toward finding CTE (because many of the brains were donated by family members who suspected that their loved ones had CTE), these findings are far too decisive to be explained by bias alone. The evidence of long-term damage from playing football has led to calls for major changes in the sport, including a shift toward flag football for children.

### Genes and Pain

Our genes influence our experience of pain. As Epstein notes, pain is inevitable in most sports, and managing pain is an important part of being an elite athlete. **Having a version of a gene that makes us better able to manage pain could give some athletes an advantage on the field and during training.** Research from a professor of psychology showed that collegiate student-athletes were less sensitive to pain than their peers.

Epstein cites a few genes that have been implicated in our response to pain:

  * The SCN9A gene **influences people’s perception of pain**. One mutation of this gene causes people to experience no pain at all. While this might seem like an advantage in sports at first, people with this mutation do not usually live very long. They are unable to process important feedback from their bodies (such as having an infection or responding to signals from our nerves to change positions or move away from a source of discomfort and so on), which causes them to die young. Another mutation in the same gene causes people to be hypersensitive to pain. More common versions of this gene cause most people to fall in the middle of these two extremes. That multiple versions of this gene exist in the population illustrates how people really do experience pain differently. 
  * A mutation in the MC1R gene, which gives many redheads their hair color, also seems to make redheads better able to tolerate some forms of pain than others. 
  * The COMPT gene has been called the **“worrier/warrior gene.”**
    * There are two versions of this gene, called Val and Met. Sixteen percent of people in the US have two Met versions of the gene. Forty-eight percent of people have one of each and 36% of people have two Val versions. 
    * The “worriers”: People with the Met version tend to be more sensitive to pain and to be more anxious. Studies have also found that they are able to perform cognitive and memory tasks with less mental effort. 
    * The “warriors”: People with the Val version generally do worse on tests of mental flexibility but are more tolerant of pain. 
    * Epstein cites the chief of a neurogenetics lab at the National Institute of Health, who suggests many professional football players likely have the “warrior” versions since they experience pain and discomfort daily. 



**While some athletes may have a genetic advantage when processing pain, intense athletic competition can make anyone less sensitive to pain.** Epstein notes that sports can activate our fight or flight response. Under stressful or dangerous conditions, our brains are able to block out pain signals so that we can run or fight. This explains how athletes can sometimes play through injuries or may not even notice injuries sustained during play until later.

> **Can Pain Tolerance Be Learned?**
> 
> Many athletes may be tougher than the average person when it comes to physical discomfort because of their genes. But it would also make sense for pain tolerance to be something that can be learned through practice, much like other sports-related skills.
> 
> A _Scandinavian Journal of Pain_ study asks whether athletes who play contact sports are more tolerant of pain at the outset of their sports season or whether their tolerance is acquired through play. Just over 100 athletes from rugby, American football, and martial arts were tested for their pain tolerance and coping strategies at the start, middle, and end of their seasons. The study found that athletes who participated through the entire season had higher pain tolerances through the season (including before it began) than “non-participating athletes.” Additionally, athletes who participated through the entire season became more tolerant of some types of pain.
> 
> The authors hypothesize that athletes who “stick with” contact sports may better manage pain because they are less emotionally bothered by it than other people. While they realize that part of the sports experience is painful, they “catastrophized less” when they were injured or in pain. Thus, the authors suggest that participating in sports can help build pain tolerance and pain management skills.
