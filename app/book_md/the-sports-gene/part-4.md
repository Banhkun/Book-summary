## Part 4: Different Genes and Different Training Responses

We have reviewed how both physiology and practice contribute to athletes’ success, and we know that our anatomy and physiology is a function of our genes. As we have seen, traits such as long legs and off-the-charts eyesight give some athletes a natural genetic advantage in their sport. **While we may know _that_ these traits are encoded for in our DNA, finding the exact genes that produce these characteristics remains elusive**. However, science has made great strides in finding specific genes that impact sports performance. This section will review Epstein’s research on how genetic differences determine people’s response to training.

> **Genes and the Central Dogma of Biology***
> 
> Before we dive into a discussion of genes and sports, we have included a basic refresher on genes.
> 
> DNA is housed within the nucleus of our cells. We inherit our DNA from our parents. When cells divide, our DNA is condensed into structures called chromosomes. Each of our cells (except sex cells) has 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total). One set of chromosomes comes from our mother, and one set comes from our father. **The two sets of each chromosome that we inherit from our parents make up our genome.**
> 
> **Certain sections of our DNA, called coding regions, contain instructions for building proteins. These sections are called genes.** (Interestingly, the coding sections total only about 1% of our entire genome. Scientists are still trying to figure out what the other 99% does!) Our genes contain the blueprints to make proteins, used to build, run, and protect our bodies. The flow of information from DNA to proteins (via RNA) is commonly referred to as the Central Dogma of Biology. **Basically, our genes contain the instructions necessary to build and run a human body** (or an onion, a bat, a bacteria, and so on).
> 
> *Molecular biology is moving at a rapid pace, and this idea is quickly being shown to be an oversimplification both of what constitutes a “gene” and of the flow of information from genes to proteins. Here is an article from Nature about how the very concept of a “gene” has become less fixed as knowledge advances.

### The Human Genome Project

Epstein notes that **most of our traits are not produced by a single gene but by the combination of many genes and our environment**. To unravel which talents in sports are a product of genes, training, or circumstances, is an impossible task. This is partly why scientists and sports researchers are often hesitant to share ideas and findings that place genes at the forefront of outcomes. To suggest that our potential for success in sports is predetermined runs counter to our cultural values of hard work and determination. It can also lead into socially and culturally problematic territory as certain genetic traits are often distributed along geographic and racial lines.

Since human beings are so complex and sports so diverse, **no single genetic trait can be said to determine outcomes in sports.** But in recent decades, science has made great progress in demystifying the human genome and identifying individual genes and their roles. In 2003, scientists from around the world completed **The Human Genome Project, a massive undertaking that mapped the over 20,000 genes encoded in our DNA.** Epstein emphasizes that completion of the project and the information that it has made available has huge implications for technology, medicine, sports, and society.

> **Epigenetics: Our Environment Acting on Our Genes**
> 
> Simply knowing the genetic code for a particular trait is just one piece of the puzzle in demystifying human genetics. Our internal and external environments impact the way our genetic code is expressed in the real world.
> 
> Chemical compounds and proteins within our cells attach to our genetic code and control how our DNA is read (and thus which proteins are produced). These ‘DNA attachments’ are referred to as our epigenome. Our environment and lifestyle can also change the expression of our genes. This is often called epigenetics. (The term “epigenome” falls under the epigenetics term.)
> 
> Epstein introduces epigenetics, though not by that name, in his discussion of height. He notes that 80% of height seems to have a genetic basis, while the remaining 20% is a product of our environment. If people grow up without proper nutrition, they are less likely to reach the full height their genes “allow.” He highlights rapid, population-wide increases in height following a country’s economic growth as an example of how greater access to nutritious food allows more individuals to reach their full height potential.
> 
> Another well-known example of epigenetics in daily life is the risk of skin cancer from our cells being damaged by UV radiation. Exposure to UV radiation can cause acute damage to our skin in the form of a sunburn, and can also damage a tumor suppressor gene in our skin cells, increasing the risk of cancer.
> 
> As an article from the National Library of Medicine notes, even if researchers can pin down the exact genes for certain athletic traits, unraveling which traits in sports have a purely genetic origin is an impossible task. Athletes will always be the product of genes and environment, or as Epstein calls it, nature _and_ nurture.

Scientists’ ability to analyze DNA samples from study participants has allowed researchers to better understand the role of our genes in our response to exercise programs. While we may not yet know the exact genes involved, Epstein cites **research showing that our genes play a determining role in how our cardiovascular and muscular systems respond to exercise.**

### Genes Influence Our Response to Aerobic Training

A 1992 collaborative study between universities in the US and Canada known as the HERITAGE study (HEalth, RIsk factors, exercise Training, and GEnetics) showed that **participants on the same training plan showed varying degrees of improvement in response to cardiovascular exercise.** The researchers were particularly interested in the effect of the training program on participants’ VO2 max values (which is a measure of how much oxygen our bodies can use while we are exercising). The study followed nearly 100 families (two generations of each family participated, for nearly 500 total participants) over a five-month period. Participants did a prescribed workout three times per week on a stationary bike. Epstein highlights the following results:

  * The aerobic capacity of 15% of participants did not improve at all, while the aerobic capacity of another 15% improved by 50% or more. The other 70% of participants fell somewhere between these values.
  * How much participants’ aerobic capacity improved did not seem to have any relationship to their fitness levels at the start of the study. 
  * Results were similar among family members. 
  * Half of the participants’ base level of fitness and their response to training could be statistically determined just by studying their parents. 



As Epstein explains, these results make it clear that there is a strong genetic component to how people’s bodies respond to cardiovascular training. **The researchers were able to find 21 alleles (alleles are versions of a gene) that accounted for the response to training that we inherit from our parents.**

> **High-Intensity Interval Training for VO2 Max**
> 
> HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) is a popular way to improve VO2 max. It involves performing repeated short bursts of intense exercise followed by short periods of rest. HIIT has been a popular fitness trend over the last several years. In the annual American College of Sports Medicine survey of over 2,000 fitness professionals, HIIT was ranked as the number one fitness trend in 2014 and 2018, number three in 2019, and number five in 2021.
> 
> HIIT gives both recreational and elite athletes a big ‘bang for their buck’.
> 
>   * Research suggests that, for the same amount of total work, HIIT training is more effective at improving VO2 max than cardiovascular training performed at lower intensities.
> 
>   * Research has also shown that gains can be made in VO2 max values from participating in HIIT workouts just twice a week (less than many workout programs using other modalities call for).
> 
>   * HIIT allows participants to burn more calories in a shorter amount of time than other forms of exercise and continue to burn extra calories for a few hours after the workout is over (although these effects are not necessarily as large as some proponents of HIIT advertise).
> 
>   * A small study showed that even though HIIT workouts are inherently difficult, participants enjoyed them more than moderate cardio training. While this study used a small number of participants and only compared two forms of training, the sustained popularity of HIIT supports these results.
> 
> 

> 
> A popular and research-backed form of HIIT is Tabata training. Tabata consists of performing 20-second intervals of all-out effort followed by 10 seconds of rest eight times, for a total of four minutes. After one minute of rest, the cycle can be repeated. This workout, in particular, has been shown to increase the VO2 max of exercisers on a stationary bicycle, but the results have been widely applied to other exercise modalities (sprinting, burpees, thrusters, and so on).

#### Corroborating Research

  * The HERITAGE study corroborated results from a previous study that looked at responses to cardiovascular training in sets of twins. The study showed that training responses were between six and nine times more similar within sets of twins than between sets of twins.
  * In another study, 24 men who did not exercise regularly participated in an exercise program on a bicycle. The scientists took DNA samples before and after the six-week program. Results found 29 genes with variations that could predict those participants who did and did not respond to aerobic training. These 29 genes were then correctly used to predict which individuals would respond to training in a subsequent study. 



Epstein cautions that we should not take these results to mean that exercise is futile for 15% of people. **Even the participants whose aerobic capacity remained unchanged saw improvements in other health parameters such as blood pressure and cholesterol.**(While most exercisers saw improvements in insulin sensitivity, the HERITAGE study did find that some people may be genetically predisposed to become more insensitive to insulin in response to exercise.)

> **The Benefits of Exercise Extend to Our Mental and Emotional Health**
> 
> There are plenty of reasons to exercise beyond gains in cardiovascular fitness. An article from the University of California, Berkely outlines several benefits of exercise that have less to do with performance on the field and more to do with overall well-being. The author cites the effects of exercise on our brains as the reason for these benefits. For example:
> 
>   * Exercise releases endocannabinoids (think: “runner’s high”-cannabis mimics this chemical). The increase in these chemicals in our bloodstream, and thus in our brains, make us feel less anxious, more optimistic, and more social (thus improving our relationships with other people).
> 
>   * Exercise leads to higher levels of dopamine (a neurotransmitter involved in our brain’s reward system) and prompts our bodies to create more dopamine receptors. This can increase our brain’s capacity to experience joy.
> 
>   * When we exercise, our muscles release lactate. Many people blame lactate for muscle soreness, though this article cites that this is not the case. Instead, lactate decreases feelings of anxiety and depression, to the point, according to the author, where regular exercise can help rebalance our brain’s “default” fight, flight, or fright state.
> 
>   * Group exercise can help people bond. Moving in sync with other people releases endorphins and can help forge a sense of connection to the people we are exercising with.
> 
>   * Exercise changes the way we perceive our bodies. When our nervous system registers that our body is performing in a “powerful” or “graceful” way, it can help us see ourselves as being powerful or graceful.
>

### Genes Influence Our Response to Strength Training

Similar to our cardiovascular system, our **muscles also respond to exercise to varying degrees.** Epstein highlights**** a study of 66 participants in a four-month program involving various strength training exercises that found similar results to the HERITAGE study.

  * 17 participants added up to 50% more muscle mass. 
  * 32 participants gained 25% more muscle mass
  * 17 participants had no muscle gains despite identical training



Also similar to the HERITAGE study was that those who responded the most to the training program had pre-existing genetic differences from those who did not. Epstein notes that the participants who gained 50% more muscle had more active IFG-IEa, MGF, and Myogenin genes than those who did not respond to exercise. Additionally, those who responded the most to exercise had more muscle satellite cells (stem cells that sit outside the muscle fibers and help muscles become bigger and stronger in response to training). While these results do not provide a clear reason why some people gain strength more readily than others, they show that genes play a determining role.

(Shortform note: It is important to keep in mind that all participants had the same genes. Differences did not result from which genes were present but from the degree that participants’ bodies used those genes to make proteins.)

#### Corroborating Research

Epstein highlights two other studies to support the idea that genes determine training responses.

  * A study of 442 participants in a strength-training program found that gains ranged from less than 50% to more than 200%. 
  * A study of 585 participants found that, after 12 weeks of training, some participants’ upper arm strength increased by 250%, while some did not increase at all. 



> **Increasing Strength With Steroids**
> 
> Some athletes use anabolic steroids to force greater muscle gains than can be accomplished with training alone. Our bodies naturally produce steroid hormones in the adrenal glands, the testes, and the ovaries. The male sex hormone testosterone is one of the main steroids produced by the testes (and the ovaries, but in much smaller amounts). **Testosterone stimulates muscle and red blood cell production**. Anabolic steroids are synthetic versions of testosterone developed for medical purposes but abused by some athletes looking to boost their performance. Beyond being banned in sports, misusing anabolic steroids can have serious health consequences, including high blood pressure, heart problems, liver disease, kidney damage, and many others.
> 
> Anabolic steroids are banned by the NCAA, IOC (International Olympic Committee), the NBA, NFL, and the NHL. They are also listed in the Controlled Substances Act and are illegal to possess without a prescription. Nevertheless, there is a long history of using substances to increase performance, dating back to the ancient Greeks and Egyptians, who used figs and mushrooms and ground-up mule hooves, respectively, to boost their athletic performance.
> 
> One of the most famous doping scandals in the Olympics came during the 1976 games when East German athletes ran away from the field and took home 40 medals. However, many athletes were stripped of their medals (and left with long-term health problems) when it was discovered that the East German government had given 9,000 athletes steroids. More recently, Russian athletes were banned from the Olympics for two years when evidence was uncovered of an elaborate state-run doping program. (Some athletes were able to compete in the 2021 Olympics but could not represent their country or use their national anthem.

Epstein uses the results of these studies to provide two important insights into how people respond to exercise and training.

  * **First, some people are simply naturally more fit than others.** He supports this conclusion with additional research:
    * In a survey of the cardiovascular fitness of 1,900 Toronto firefighter hopefuls, six had no training and led sedentary lifestyles, yet they had similar VO2 maxes to collegiate runners.
    * One study of 26 elite runners who stopped competing found that 15 years later, they still had high VO2 maxes (even if they were overweight and not training). 
  * **Second, the extent to which we respond to some types of training is genetically determined.**
    * This has important implications outside of sports. If doctors can use genetic testing to determine whether patients respond to exercise training, they can tailor interventions to best suit individual patients. For those deemed “non-responders” to exercise, doctors could save patients time and frustration and prescribe medication. 
    * Many people may self-select out of their sport when they feel frustrated after having hit a training plateau. These may be people who had some initial success due to their baseline fitness but simply do not respond to training to the degree of their competitors. 



**According to Epstein, many elite athletes likely fall into both the naturally fit and high response to exercise categories.**

> **Other Measures of Success in Training Programs**
> 
> Exercise can help us perform better in our daily lives. Epstein’s research highlights two ways that people can “respond” to exercise training programs. However, as noted in our comment on exercise and changes to our brain and mood, there are many other ways we can benefit from a training program beyond strength and VO2 max. According to the CDC, regular exercise can help reduce the risk of falls, especially in older adults. It can also reduce pain caused by conditions such as arthritis and joint problems and reduce mortality (from all causes) by 33% (based on 150 minutes of exercise per week).
> 
> We would all love to see impressive gains in fitness when we invest time and effort at the gym. But being able to walk up stairs, pick up a child, or even get dressed without pain or fear of falling are all ways that our bodies can “respond” to exercise that a single metric cannot measure.
