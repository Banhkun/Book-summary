## Writing and Revision

We’ve now covered the three main elements of a story: narration, characters, and dialogue. You also now know to write a story by putting the characters in a situation and then observing how they work themselves out of the situation. This core work of storytelling will culminate in your first draft.

After your first draft comes revision, where you polish the story you’ve created. After several rounds, you’ll end up with the final draft. We’ll cover the overall stages of writing.

### Write With the Door Closed, Rewrite With It Open

**When you write your first draft, King suggests that you close your door.** This is both literal and metaphorical. Literally, closing your door helps you focus and block out the outside world.

Metaphorically, write the first draft of your story just for you. By and large, don’t worry about what anyone else thinks. There is no outside world. The story belongs to you. (As we’ll cover soon, there’s one exception—your ideal reader.)

When you rewrite, you need to open your door. You’ll think about your readers and how to make at least some of them happy. You’ll take in feedback from people you trust and grapple with reconciling their feedback with your vision.

### The Writing Process

Here’s Stephen King’s writing process, from beginning to end.

  * **Write and finish the first draft with no help or advice from anyone else** —their well-meaning words can trigger self-doubt (if critical) or make you complacent (if positive). Write as quickly as you comfortably can—this keeps your enthusiasm high and limits self-doubt from creeping in.
  * When you finish the first draft, give the story to anyone who’s been dying to read your work, but demand that they _not_ discuss your writing with you until you’re ready to. You need a break from your writing.
  * Take a few days off from writing. Have fun and relax.
  * When you’re ready, go back to writing, but **write about something totally different from what you just finished drafting**. King suggests taking at least 6 weeks off from your draft, working on shorter pieces like novellas or short stories. 
    * During this time, resist the temptation to read your draft. The point is to **get distance from the draft** , so you can be a more objective critic when you revise. It’ll be easier to “kill your darlings.”
  * Finally, go back to your draft. By this point, it should feel oddly familiar yet unrecognizable, like the work of someone else who writes suspiciously like you. **Read the draft in one sitting, if possible.**
    * Note fixes for specific issues, like grammar and usage, deleting adverbs, plot holes, and character motivations.
    * Also ask yourself big-picture questions. What is the story _about_? Is there a theme? Are there recurring elements? Is the story coherent?
  * **Go back through and revise for your second draft.** Fix the small specific issues and polish your big picture ideas.
    * Once you define your theme, add scenes and shape the story to strengthen the theme.
  * After you finish, **give the second draft to a small group of readers you trust**. Listen to their feedback.
  * Incorporate the feedback as you like (more on this next). This can be your next draft, or even your final draft.
    * Use however many revision cycles you’re comfortable with. King’s standard process takes two drafts and a final polish.



### Dealing with Feedback

Each person’s reaction to writing is naturally subjective, so you’ll get feedback along a wide spectrum, and you’ll get feedback you disagree with. Here’s how to work through the feedback.

#### Dealing with Feedback Resistance

Some writers struggle with incorporating feedback healthily. Changing your masterpiece simply because your readers didn’t like it feels like a corruption of art.

But if you feel this way, why invite readers you respect to review your draft at all? If it’s simply because you want adulation for what a genius you are, then at least be honest about what you’re looking for.

**Think of reviewers as your own personal focus group to improve your writing.** Movie studios do this with early cuts of their films. While it might seem arbitrary to shape an auteur’s vision to the tastes of a crowd pulled off the street, focus groups seem to work in actually making films more successful.

As we covered, King recommends putting at least six weeks between completing your first draft and starting your revision. The purpose is to get enough distance from your work that you no longer treat it as sacrosanct. **Be willing to kill your darlings.**

#### How to Weigh Feedback

You’ll get feedback all along the spectrum, and you should weigh the feedback to see where it’s pointing.

If your reviewers are unanimous about one direction (whether something is great or terrible), they’re probably right.

Say there’s a tie—one person thinks Johnny is believable but Mary is ludicrous, and another thinks the opposite. Then the author wins. You shouldn’t feel compelled to change anything.

**You shouldn’t weigh feedback from each person equally.** It depends on how much you respect their opinion, and what area they’re particularly insightful about. Some people specialize in dialogue, others in character development, yet others in pacing, factual accuracy, and so on.

#### The Ideal Reader

There is usually one person whose opinion you trust above all: the Ideal Reader. For King, it’s his wife Tabitha.

**The Ideal Reader is the person you have in mind as you write.** You come to know your Ideal Reader’s tastes so well you can predict how he or she will feel about any particular thing you’re writing. Will she laugh at this scene? Will she get bored here if I explain too much? The Ideal Reader helps give you an audience as you write and is perhaps the only exception to writing with the door closed.

The Ideal Reader should also be a honest reviewer—eternally supportive but unrelenting. You might disagree with Ideal Reader’s feedback, but you know there’s truth to it.

Especially if you start getting attention for your work, the Ideal Reader should remain unimpressed and be the objective eye bringing you back down to earth. Hitchcock’s wife

King sneaks glances at Tabitha as she reads, hoping the scenes he’s designed to score that great big laugh succeed. She’s chided him for being needy this way. He admits that writers really are needy, but he loves when she loves his work.

From these generalities, King moves onto two items that are particularly worth noting on revision: pace and back story.

### Pace

Pace is how quickly you tell the story. (Shortform note: Pace increases with shorter scenes and frequent action. It decreases with description, narration, and introspection.)

The publishing world seems to believe that faster pace sells more books, given the minute attention span of modern audiences. King thinks this is hogwash, pointing to slow-paced books that still become bestsellers (to the shock of publishers).

**Each story should have the pace it needs.** Too fast and you might confuse or fatigue the reader. Too slow and the reader gets bored and might stop reading.

Tips on striking the right balance:

  * The ideal way to figure out pace is by getting feedback, particularly from your Ideal Reader. Where does she get bored? At which part does she feel comfortable stopping her reading?
  * Many writers tend to overwrite, indulging in their own language. **Force yourself to cut down your manuscript by at least 10% on your second draft.** King received this tip on a rejection slip in high school, and he still follows it, cutting 350,000 words down to 300,000 on the revision. Every work can usually be compressed without changing its nature. Follow Strunk and White’s timeless advice: **“Omit needless words.”**



### Back Story

Back story is everything that happened before your story starts. For a character who’s 30 years old, the character’s entire life history can theoretically all be back story (as well as the life histories of every other character).

Like pace, you can have too little or too much back story. Too little and your character’s situation and motivations are unclear. Too much and you bore the reader.

**Stick to the backstory that is relevant to your story.** Everyone has a life history; most of it is not interesting. Leave out all the boring parts.

  * In a draft for _Bag of Bones_ , the character Mike had 3 pages about his community service work the year after his wife died. King thought the back story illustrated how Mike had writer’s block and what he did with his time. Tabitha said, “who cares?”



You can weave in back story in a more graceful way than straight narration. To show that a character is divorced, don’t have him say, “Hi there, ex-wife.” Talk about the fading tan line on his ring finger.

King personally dislikes _in medias res_ , the starting of a story in the middle of the action with no back story. This requires flashbacks, which he finds clumsy. King prefers going in relatively straight chronology.

#### Research

Research concerns the details that make a story sound realistic. While writing about a field you know nothing about—say, the judicial procedures of rural Kentucky—you will need to research.

**Like back story, keep only the research that is relevant.** The readers aren’t reading your story to learn the intricate details of what you researched. Like a spice in a recipe, the research is an adornment, not the meat.

There are some writers who seem to make their novels practically all about the research. Arthur Hailey wrote novels that seemed like parables for industry dissections—banking, airports, automobile manufacturing. While King still finds these novels to be solid, he suspects they appeal to readers who find fiction a guilty pleasure, and the guise of learning from a novel absolves them of guilt.
