## Exercise: Examine Your Past Positions

People often underestimate the influence of luck on success. We very often attribute luck to skill and randomness to determinism.

* * *

Describe a time when you stuck to a position long after it was wise. What were the results? Did you experience any negative consequences because you didnâ€™t change your strategy?

What misunderstandings or biases did you hold that blinded you to the need to abandon that stance?

What steps might you take so that in the future, you are more willing to abandon an unwise strategy or position? (For example, could you think more thoroughly through the different possible worlds that might result if you either hold onto or let go of your position?)
