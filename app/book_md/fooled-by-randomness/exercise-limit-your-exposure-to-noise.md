## Exercise: Limit Your Exposure to Noise

Ignoring “noise,” or the endless minutiae detailing small changes, can help you see large, important trends more clearly, and can prevent you from getting caught up in—and reacting to—inconsequential triggers.

* * *

Describe a kind of “noise” that you frequently come across in your daily life. (It might be related to business, current events, or something else. For instance, do you find yourself bombarded with news about small changes or endless analysis?)

How does this noise affect how you feel or how you act?

How might you limit your exposure to this noise? For example, can you unsubscribe to certain news sites or limit how often you check the value of your investments?

How might limiting your exposure change your behavior and your emotions? (For example, would you decrease the number of trades you make each day? Would you feel less stressed? Or would you feel more anxious about missing out on information?)
