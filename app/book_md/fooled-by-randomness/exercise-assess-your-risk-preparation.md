## Exercise: Assess Your Risk Preparation

When people misunderstand past rare events, they misunderstand the likelihood of future rare events and consequently don’t plan for risk appropriately.

* * *

Describe a time when you were surprised by an event, either in business, the news, or your personal life.

If you had been able to predict it, how might you have prepared for this event?

Knowing that you can't predict the details of rare events, how can you generalize your plan of preparation for similar rare events in the future? For example, you couldn’t have predicted the events of September 11, 2001, but you could have had a pre-established escape plan from the city if you lived in New York.
