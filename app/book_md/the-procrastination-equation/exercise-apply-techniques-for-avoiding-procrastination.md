## Exercise: Apply Techniques for Avoiding Procrastination

Consider how procrastination affects your everyday life and how you could apply Steel’s techniques to your benefit.

* * *

Of Steel’s three primary reasons for procrastination, which do you think is most relevant to your habits and challenges? Why? (For example, maybe you always struggle to complete tasks you dislike, your lack of impulse control means you frequently delay important tasks in favor of immediate rewards, or you have trouble believing in your ability to complete important tasks.)

Describe one current situation where you’re struggling because of that type of procrastination. (For example, maybe you’re having trouble keeping your kitchen clean because you hate washing the dishes, you’re procrastinating on saving money because you keep making impulse purchases, or you’ve been avoiding an important work project because you feel like you’ll fail.)

Which of Steel’s techniques for avoiding procrastination might be the most effective for your situation? (For example, you might make a game out of washing dishes to make it more fun, you could set up an accountability system that creates negative consequences if you impulsively buy things, or you could break the project into small goals.)

How might reducing your procrastination in this situation benefit you long-term? (For example, doing the dishes more frequently would allow you to cook more, which will save you money. Saving money could allow you to someday fulfill your goal of buying a house. Completing the project efficiently and effectively could raise your status at work.)
