## Exercise: Practice Interpreting Body Language

Allan and Barbara Pease suggest that understanding body language helps you interpret how people feel when interacting with you. Let’s explore how you might interpret nonverbal cues in different scenarios.

* * *

During a job interview, your interviewer leans toward you, slowly nods her head, and maintains eye contact throughout the conversation. Write down at least one emotion her body language might convey.

At a party, the person you’re talking to bites his nails and taps his foot. Based on his body language, write down at least one emotion he might be feeling.

During a team meeting, one colleague crosses their arms, frowns, and avoids eye contact with you. Write down at least one emotion their body language might imply.

At a bus stop, the person you’re interacting with huddles in their coat and hops from foot to foot. Write down at least one way to interpret how they feel.
