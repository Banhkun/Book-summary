## Exercise: Spot Your Own Elephants

Simler and Hanson argue that many of our actions are driven by selfish motives hidden behind altruistic facades. They say these motives—and our tendency to hide them—are built into the human brain, which means none of us are immune. With that in mind, see if you can identify some of your own elephants.

* * *

Describe a time when you did or said something that you presented as selfless but was in fact selfish. Keep in mind that at the time, you __ may have genuinely thought your action _was_ selfless.

What was the _real_ motivation behind your action? Why wouldn’t you have wanted to admit this motivation to others or yourself?

If you face the same situation again, now armed with this awareness, do you think you will act differently? How so?
