## 1977-1979

### 1977

Nike continues its inexorable climb upward. They continue catching national attention. They sign dozens of college sports teams and legendary coaches. There’s a funny story about how in a press release they misspelled Iona as Iowa. Iowa’s head coach calls, angry that Nike had incorrectly claimed a partnership that didn't exist—but then asks to sign with Nike too.

Endorsements: In tennis, they don’t get star Nastase (who asks for $100,000/year), which Phil thinks is irresponsible. But at Wimbledon, they find a young hothead named John McEnroe, and Phil falls in love with him. They have Nikes showing up in Hollywood, with Farrah Fawcett wearing Seniorita Cortezes in _Charlie’s Angels_. Phil’s father even mentions how prominently Nikes are featured in a basketball game, and Phil feels that he’s finally earning his father’s respect and pride (a longstanding chip on Phil’s shoulder).

They continue their track record of shoe innovation. Bowerman designs the LD 1000, a shoe with a flared heel meant to reduce pressure on the knee. But it’s finicky and requires an exacting stride to avoid injury. Nike recalls and braces for backlash, but instead they receive plaudits – they’re seen as the major innovator in shoes, and their customers are grateful for experiments, failed or not.

And there is one major innovation on the horizon – air in the soles. An aerospace engineer approaches Nike and tells them he can inject air into running soles. Phil is skeptical of this pale lanky man with a “severe vitamin D deficiency,” but he tries a hastily assembled prototype of air soles in his running shoes. He thinks there might be something there.

Rising demand is always a manufacturing problem, but they continue building partnerships with factories in Taiwan, Korea, and Puerto Rico. Funnily, a Korean factory Nike doesn’t partner with sends him a perfect replica of a shoe. Phil writes back with an angry cease and desist and also an offer to partner. They start working together.

Nike launches memorable ad campaigns, centered around a slogan: “There is no finish line.” The ad read, **“Beating the competition is relatively easy. Beating yourself is a never-ending commitment.”** Despite the positive reception, Phil continues being skeptical about advertising – the product should speak for itself. And where’s the proof that the ads are increasing sales?

Sales reach $70 million. A trusted business adviser laughs at how precarious their float situation is, and he insists going public is mandatory to solve their cash flow problem. Otherwise, Phil might lose his company.

And then a bomb drops. US Customs wants $25 million for retroactive duties on shoes. This is based on an esoteric rule, the “American Selling Price.” In essence, the ASP required import duties on nylon shoes to be 20% of the manufacturing cost, _unless_ there’s a similar shoe on the marketplace – then it’s 20% of the selling price of the competitor’s shoe. A few American competitors like Converse and Keds declared their shoes similar and lobbied hard for this duty. They want to stifle Nike.

They have no ability to pay this fine, nor could they stomach hugely increased duties on a continuous basis. If they did, the company would go bankrupt. While contemplating this, Phil throws tantrums, destroying phones after disappointing phone calls. The phone repairman chastises him as “immature,” and Phil resolves to be less easy to rile up.

Outside of business, Phil’s disappointed that his sons aren’t interested in sports. Matthew is a constant contrarian, unable to obey authority, and stifling under sports rules. He’d go for other players’ shins on the soccer field and cause mayhem. This spread to Travis, who’s a gifted athlete but is turned off by Matthew.

Phil reflects, “of all the negotiations in my life, those with my sons have been the most difficult.” Phil’s life is about sports, his bond with his father was about sports, and both his sons don’t care about sports. This leaves a hole in Phil Knight.

### 1978

Sales double _again_ – on track for $140 million in 1979. Nike keeps growing. They change headquarters to a 40,000 square foot building in Beaverton, where his office is bigger than their entire first headquarters. They have factories in Taiwan, Korea, England, and Ireland. Industry analysts say that Nike is unstoppable.

Nike launches an apparel business, since this is where Adidas gets most of its sales, and it’s a way to offer more attractive endorsement deals to athletes. Phil starts by appointing a totally unstylish accountant who produces unfashionable, abhorrent clothing. (Phil justifies the appointment of so many accountants and lawyers with the idea that by qualifying for their trade, most were guaranteed to be somewhat competent). But this apparel designer with no fashion sense won’t do. Phil replaces this person with Woodell, who launches a great first clothing line.

This makes him start noticing that people around him dress terribly when they need to impress bankers and investors. Phil institutes a dress code, a move that contradicts the freewheeling Nike culture. His lieutenants rebel, flouting his dress code and requiring Phil to dock their pay for each dress code violation. (Shortform note: Again, to his credit, Phil continues being open about his management failures and doesn’t paint himself as a Napoleon with diehard unquestioning followers.)

Nike continues innovation. They release a shoe called the Tailwind, the first shoe with the mad scientist’s air soles. Nike hypes this shoe with splashy ads, and they fly off the shelves. But then customers start complaining that the shoe is falling apart. They find that tiny bits of metal in the silver paint are rubbing against the upper, slicing it apart. They learn not to put too many product innovations in a single shoe.

Phil starts feeling burnout. After a decade of fighting fires, he starts to see only problems, and he’s not thinking as sharply.

### 1979

Nike continues the fight against US Customs that started in 1977. Phil meets with the bureaucrat in the Treasury Department who wants Nike’s money. The man is unsympathetic to Phil’s claim that paying the $25 million fine would put Nike out of business, that bullying his “little” company is un-American.

They meet with Senator Hatfield from Oregon, who gladly helps defend one of Oregon’s own. He sends messages to the US Customs bureaucrat who is frustrated by being controlled by more powerful beings, to Phil’s delight.

Nike has once again grown. They open a 3,500 square foot retail space in Portland, which is swarmed with customers. They move to yet even bigger offices in a 46,000 square foot building to house 300 employees. But Phil is aware that all of it could be gone at any point.
