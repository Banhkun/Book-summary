## Exercise: Create a Treatment Plan

The process of treating ADHD can be long and difficult, but it’s easier if you approach treatment with a plan. Use the information in this guide to identify a potential treatment plan for your symptoms.

* * *

Which symptoms of ADHD do you want to target? To determine this, consider which ones have the greatest impact on your life. Note both primary and secondary symptoms. (For example, you might feel that disorganization and poor self-image affect your life the most.)

What techniques can you implement on your own to help reduce the negative impacts of these symptoms? What types of structure can you add to your life to make them easier to deal with? (For instance, to address the primary symptom of disorganization, you might establish a daily routine.)

List two or three people who could be your coaches. Write down some specific things you’d like your coaches to help you with. (For instance, one coach might be able to help you with self-image, and another coach might be able to assist with disorganization.)

Finally, consider whether you want to try medication. What symptoms would you want your medication to target? What concerns do you have about medication that you can ask your provider about?
