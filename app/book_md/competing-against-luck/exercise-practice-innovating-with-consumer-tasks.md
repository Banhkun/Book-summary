## Exercise: Practice Innovating With Consumer Tasks

 _Competing Against Luck_ offers a conceptual framework that explores what makes a product successful. Practice thinking in these terms by analyzing purchases you’ve made in the past, to help you identify innovative ways to solve similar tasks.

* * *

Think of one or two products or services you’ve purchased and brainstorm what consumer tasks they’re trying to solve. Remember that the tasks should be specific enough to inspire solutions, but vague enough to accommodate a wide range of solutions. (For example, perhaps you recently took a flight for a family vacation in another country. In this case, the task the airline solved for you may have been “get me to my destination with everything I need to enjoy time with my family.”)

Think back to the last time you bought each product or service. What encouraging factors and discouraging factors pushed you toward or away from making that purchase? (For example, you may have been drawn to the airline because of the low price, but you were hesitant because a friend recently told you that the airline lost her bags when she flew with them).

For each product or service, think of an innovative way it could resolve that task a little better. Consider physical and/or emotional factors in your solution. (For example, the airline could have displayed a sign boasting their high percentage of safely delivered baggage, which acknowledges an emotional factor of the task—the fear intrinsically involved in having strangers transport your luggage.)
