## Chapter 4: Discipline 3—Control Your Process

Your actions are what create your future, so if you want an idea of what your future looks like, examine your current actions. You can’t completely predict how your future will turn out, but you can determine how successful you’ll be while working toward it.

**At the beginning of each week, review the progress made the week before and your plan for building on that progress in the coming week.** Also, make a weekly plan, and check it daily to ensure you’re clear on what duties must be accomplished that day. Once you determine what those duties are, don’t stop your day’s work until they’re done.

You’ll also check in throughout the day to make sure you’re still focused on the right task and the timeline of your week still makes sense. If it does, keep moving forward. If not, review the plan to restructure the activities necessary to achieve the week’s goals.

### The Critical Aspects of Process Control

To ensure you don’t lose faith or momentum during your execution, you need progress measures to support your efforts. These supports are important because striving for a higher level of achievement means performing actions that are new and challenging. You can generate enough willpower in the beginning to push through the discomfort of these actions, but willpower wanes. **A solid system of support will help uplift you when your motivation is lacking.**

You can develop a good process control system by creating a positive weekly routine. Three elements are necessary for a successful weekly routine: a weekly plan, a weekly accountability meeting (WAM), and a weekly scoring system. The next chapter will cover the scoring system.

#### A Workable Weekly Plan

Your weekly plans should be clear breakdowns of your overall 12-week plan. The tasks and benchmarks you aim for each week are mere elaborations of those listed on your main schedule of tasks. Don’t add new tasks to the weekly plans based on new interests or a sense of urgency. **If you’re going to change the tasks for one week, change them on the main plan to keep the pacing of each priority action in order.** In this way, you make sure each week is strategically organized to develop the main goal.

Just like in your 12-week plan, write each goal at the top of your new week, and list the specific actions that will happen daily throughout the week. Check in with this plan every morning and a few times throughout the day to make sure you’re staying on track and meeting your deadlines.

##### Example Weekly Plan

#### Strong Peer Support

You shouldn’t be afraid to ask for help when starting a massive endeavor like striving to realize your vision. Studies show that you are seven times more likely to succeed in your efforts if you surround yourself with supportive individuals. Find two to four people you trust to meet with each week to review your progress. Ideally, these people will also be working through their own 12-week plans. If you’re in a business organization, finding these people will be easier. If not, make sure the people you invite to your WAM (Weekly Accountability Meeting) are aware of your vision, goals, and process so they can be useful sounding boards.

The purpose of the WAM is to promote ownership and consistency in your plan execution. This meeting should happen at the beginning of each week and last for approximately 20 to 30 minutes. Here’s a sample agenda:

  * Individual reports: Each person discusses three areas of execution:
    * Successful results thus far in their 12-week plan
    * Their weekly execution score
    * Goals and tasks for the week
  * Feedback on individual reports from other members
  * Strategies that work: The group should go over techniques and strategies that have proven useful and may benefit each individual’s efforts.
  * Encouragement: The meeting should end with supportive statements to promote successful execution throughout the rest of the week.



#### Common Errors

When creating a successful weekly routine, be sure to avoid these common errors:

  * **You don’t create a weekly plan.** Monday mornings are intense. If you don’t take a few minutes to create or go over your weekly plan, you won’t know how to make the most of your day and all the days to come.
  * **You don’t make time for planning or support.** Later never comes. If you don’t get in the habit of making time at the beginning of each week to plan and attend your WAM, your execution will suffer. 
  * **You don’t think you need a routine.** You may think you know what you need to do or that planning is for amateurs, but when you reach the end of the week, you’ll wonder where your time went and why you haven’t accomplished what you wanted to. 
  * **You put every task for the day on the weekly plan.** Only put the strategic tasks related to your 12-week plan on your schedule of tasks, not other mundane duties you're responsible for during the day.
  * **You use the same plan each week.** It’s unlikely that growth will require the same actions over the entire 12-week period. 
  * **You add extra tasks to the weekly plan.** If you get sidetracked by extra tasks, you’ll get off course quickly.
  * **You don’t check in with your plan.** Your plan is there to keep you on task, so check it frequently to ensure you are. 
  * **You don’t form a routine.** Your execution will never become ingrained behavior if you don’t form a routine.
