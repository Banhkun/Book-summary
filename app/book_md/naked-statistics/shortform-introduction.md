## Shortform Introduction

Wheelan explains that learning statistics can make us more critical consumers of information and help us make informed decisions. As statistics students, we can learn to evaluate the information presented to us in political and marketing campaigns, on the news, in scientific publications, and so on, and put that information into useful context. Learning statistics will also help us spot misleading or misguided uses of data and statistics rather than being fooled by them.

Thanks to Charles Wheelan, statistics don’t need to be intimidating. _Naked Statistics_ puts the math behind statistics into digestible terms and explains statistics concepts with relatable, relevant, and even humorous examples. Readers also benefit from additional socio-political insight from the book, as Wheelan uses real-world anecdotes to explore how statistics can inform collective decision-making.

### About the Author

Charles J. Wheelan is a faculty member at Dartmouth College and a former faculty member at the University of Chicago, specializing in public policy. He holds a B.A. from Dartmouth College, a Master’s in Public Affairs from Princeton University, and a Ph.D. in Public Policy from the University of Chicago.

In addition to _Naked Statistics_ , Wheelan is the author of _The Centrist Manifesto_ and _Naked Economics_, among other books in the non-fiction and fiction genres. He is also the founder of the political organization Unite America, which works to bridge partisan divides in pursuit of a “more representative and functional government.”

### The Book’s Publication

_Naked Statistics_ was published by W. W. Norton & Company in 2013, 11 years after _Naked Economics_ and shortly after Wheelan joined the faculty of Dartmouth College.

### The Book’s Context

Wheelan’s discussion of the dangers of misused and misunderstood statistics follows other books on the same topic, including Joel Best’s 2001 book _Damned Lies and Statistics_ and Darell Huff’s _How to Lie With Statistics_ (first published in 1954). Following _Naked Statistics_ in 2013, Daniel J. Levitin published _A Field Guide to Lies _in 2019, which also teaches readers how to spot misleading statistics and became an international bestseller.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

The mathematical concepts Wheelan introduces in _Naked Statistics_ are no different than those you’d find in any introductory statistics book. But Wheelan’s presentation of the math sets _Naked Statistics_ apart from other books on the subject. Wheelan’s ability to make statistics interesting and engaging turned _Naked Statistics_ into a New York Times best seller and led the _San Francisco Chronicle_ to call Wheelan “the best math teacher you never had.”

Wheelan’s approach in _Naked Statistics_ accomplishes three main things. First, he introduces some of the most fundamental statistics concepts and calculations at an introductory level, accessible even to those who have never taken a class on the subject. Second, Wheelan uses examples to show why the statistics he covers matter and how they are used. These examples offer readers new insight into medical and social sciences research and public policy. Third, Wheelan shows readers why we should care about statistics by highlighting how misused and misunderstood statistics can get us into trouble.

_Naked Statistics_ is an excellent choice for readers who are looking to study statistics on a conceptual level, and would like to be entertained and even amused while doing so. Wheelan’s skill as a teacher and storyteller makes the book an easy read, and his breadth of knowledge in the sociopolitical realm means that readers will likely pick up new knowledge about other subjects along the way. However, _Naked Statistics_ might not be the best choice for advanced statistics students or readers looking for help with statistics calculations, as Wheelan intentionally minimizes his discussion of calculations and keeps the statistics he covers at a beginner level.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Our guide to _Naked Statistics_ focuses on the basic statistics concepts that Wheelan introduces. We won’t delve into mathematical formulas in this guide (Wheelan notes that nearly all statistics calculations are done on computers anyway). Instead, we focus on what the statistics Wheelan covers _mean_ and why they’re relevant. Like Wheelan, this guide emphasizes how learning statistics can improve our judgment and help us avoid being misled. In alignment with the book, this guide is largely divided by statistics technique, with each section focusing on a particular statistic or set of calculations.
