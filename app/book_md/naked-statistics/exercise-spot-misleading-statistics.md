## Exercise: Spot Misleading Statistics

Wheelan explains that anyone with the will and a capable computer program can perform statistical analyses. This accessibility combined with the ease and speed of information sharing in our technology-oriented culture makes it easy for misleading statistics to make their way into our lives and inform our opinions or decisions.

* * *

Think about the last time you read or were told a statistic that grabbed your attention. What was your initial impression of the statisticâ€™s validity?

How did this particular statistic impact your opinions or decisions?

Why do you think this statistic was produced?

Does thinking about the origin of this statistic impact your impression of its validity? Why or why not?
