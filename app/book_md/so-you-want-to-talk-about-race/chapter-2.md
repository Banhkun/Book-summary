## Chapter 2: Privilege, Intersectionality, and the Model Minority Myth

In this chapter we’ll look at some commonly misunderstood terms that come up often in conversations about race: “privilege,” “intersectionality,” and the “model minority myth.”

### What Is Privilege?

The White Supremacist system is built on privilege. Privilege is **a situation in which one person or group has advantages that another doesn’t**. These advantages are unfairly distributed to begin with. As Oluo explains, if you have privilege, even if you worked very hard to get where you are, your successes are greater than those of someone who began without these privileges. (Shortform note: Scholar Peggy McIntosh likens privilege to an “invisible knapsack” of useful tools that privileged people carry through life.)

**Privilege and disadvantage are relative concepts, so they’re two sides of the same coin.** We can also talk about privilege as an **“opportunity gap.” **It doesn’t only apply to race—privilege is also relevant to disability, sexuality, neurotypicality, physical attractiveness, and family background.

(Shortform note: This animation, created by Kimberlé Crenshaw and Luke Harris, illustrates the effects of racial privilege and disadvantage metaphorically in the form of a running race. In this race, which has four competitors—two black and two white—the black athletes don’t even get to start until hundreds of years after the white athletes. When they finally do, they encounter a series of obstacles and complications that hinder their progress even further.)

> **What Exactly Do White People Believe About Privilege?**
> 
> One stumbling block on the path to a more equal society is the belief of many white people that _they_ are actually disadvantaged and that it’s minorities who have more privileges. A majority of white people (55%) now believe that whites face racial discrimination. White people as a whole see anti-white bias and “reverse racism” as a more pressing social problem than anti-black bias. With white people set to become a minority in the US over the next few decades, many white people also expect to increasingly be victims of racial discrimination in the future. These beliefs tend to fall along political and religious lines.

#### What Does “Check Your Privilege” Mean?

Oluo explains that if you’re told to “check your privilege,” **you’re being asked to think honestly about how your privilege has gotten you to this point.** What advantages have you had that other people haven’t? What struggles might you be unaware of in other people’s lives? How is this affecting your perspective?

“Check your privilege” has become something of a catchphrase: a cliché that provokes eye rolls and sarcastic jabs. (Shortform note: An interchange between two students at Princeton, published in _Time_ , exemplifies the debate over this phrase. One freshman, in a piece called “Why I’ll Never Apologize for My White Male Privilege,” explained that though he is white, his family’s story is one of courage, struggle, and sacrifice. A response by a black freshman pointed out that however real historical struggles may be, as a white man he is benefiting from privilege in the present. This means that asking him to “check his privilege” is still valid.)

All of us are blind to at least some of our privilege. That’s why it’s good to make a habit of checking it frequently. **Although checking our privilege can _feel_ bad, it opens up opportunities to _do_ good**, such as standing up for someone who lacks the same privilege.

> **How Can I Be a Good Ally?**
> 
> Oluo doesn’t go into much detail on the subtleties involved when a white person intervenes on behalf of a person of color. Allyship has been a key part of racial justice movements over the centuries. But as a white or otherwise privileged person, how do you know if you’re “speaking up for others” or “speaking over others”? Where’s the line between being an ally and developing a white savior complex?
> 
> A Code of Ethics for Antiracist White Allies, developed by JLove Calderon and Tim Wise, proposes ten concrete tasks for antiracist allies, including keeping yourself accountable by creating systems for regular feedback and, in conversations about racial issues, giving due credit to the people of color who have spoken about these issues before.
> 
> Similarly, Roxane Gay argues that white allies need to use their own common sense to find concrete ways to support people of color without needing excessive guidance. She notes that in times of racial crisis, well-meaning white people often ask people of color, “What can I do?” But she notes that this treats people of color “as if we have access to a secret trove of wisdom for overcoming oppression” and allows the person to dodge the practical and intellectual work that _they_ need to do to create change.
> 
> Finally, Ta-Nehisi Coates has the following advice for allies: First, listen and learn as much as possible about racism. Realize that much of what you learn will be painful and don’t shy away. Second, gradually stop thinking in terms of being an ally. You’re not here simply to “help” people of color: Demanding racial equality is your fight, too.

### What Is Intersectionality?

**Intersectionality is the recognition that multiple types of disadvantage intersect in complicated ways** , either offsetting or compounding one another in an individual’s life. The term was first used by race theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989. **There’s no specific formula for intersectionality** , because it depends on our individual configuration of privileges and disadvantages, as well as the environments in which we find ourselves from moment to moment.

Oluo argues that **social justice movementsneed to consider intersectionality** if they want to fight for justice for everyone. Neglecting intersectionality means that we’ll leave behind the less visible subcategories within a disadvantaged group. We can apply intersectionality to develop more inclusive practices in government, the education system, and other important institutions.

(Shortform note: Crenshaw first used the term “intersectionality” in this academic article about how the legal system treats women of color. She argued that black women are specifically disadvantaged in judicial decisions compared to groups that are disadvantaged along a single axis, such as white women and black men. She observed that black women also tend to be excluded from both feminist movements and antiracist political movements because their experiences complicate the picture. The term has since migrated from its original legal context into the social sciences more broadly, and from there into mainstream discourse.)

### What Is the Model Minority Myth?

**Themodel minority myth is the idea that Asian Americans are a “model” minority group**: an example that all other racial and ethnic minority groups should aspire to. As Oluo notes, the phrase “model minority” was first used by sociologist William Petersen. Petersen was describing his research on Japanese Americans, in particular how they had become financially and academically successful within a short period of time after migration. He praised this group for their work ethic, talent in math and science, strict parenting, social docility, and conformity, explicitly contrasting them with other “problem minorities.”

(Shortform note: When Petersen first used this term, he put the term “problem minorities” in inverted commas. He doesn’t blame these groups for their situation, stating that a vicious cycle of stereotypes, poor education, and low income is at fault.)

#### But Why Is the Model Minority Myth Harmful?

But what harm can a positive stereotype do? Isn’t there some truth to all this, anyway?

Oluo notes that the myth disguises economic disparities between different Asian American groups and renders those who don’t conform exactly to the stereotype invisible. The stereotype of docility and subservience leads Asian Americans to be judged as ill-suited to leadership positions or political office. At the time of writing the book (2017), for example, there was only one Asian American in the Senate and three Asian Americans serving in the House of Representatives. Only seven Asian American state governors have been elected in all of the country’s history. (Shortform note: As of 2021, these figures had increased to two senators and 15 representatives, alongside the historic election of half-black, half-Indian American Kamala Harris as vice president.)

As Oluo shows, the model minority myth also**separates Asian Americans from other minority groups, denying their common struggles**. (Shortform note: Some scholars argue that the US government deliberately perpetrated the myth during the Cold War as a way to appear less racist on the global stage. The success of Asian Americans became a way to deny the grievances of African Americans: If _they_ can do it, why can’t you? This attitude continues today, with a number of authors arguing that the success of Asian Americans shows that it’s possible to overcome structural racism, and therefore that black people are to blame for their own failures.)

Oluo notes that being Asian American and female carries specific intersectional dangers. The stereotype of docility and compliance is particularly corrosive for Asian American women, with their partners sometimes projecting it onto them with damaging results. Despite this, Asian American women are largely overlooked in mental health and domestic violence awareness initiatives.

(Shortform note: According to Project AWARE, one in four women in the United States experiences intimate partner violence. **In Asian American women, this proportion is substantially elevated, with 41 to 61 percent of Asian and Pacific Islander women reporting having suffered physical or sexual abuse at the hands of their partners**. Intimate partner violence toward Asian Americans increased further during the Covid-19 pandemic.)

> **The Sexual Objectification of Asian American Women**
> 
> Asian American women are not only stereotyped as submissive; they’re also commonly fetishized and targeted with aggressively sexual behavior (you’ll find some examples in this Twitter thread).
> 
> These twin perceptions of weakness and hypersexuality merge in particularly toxic ways. On March 16 2021, a 21-year-old white man opened fire in a spa in Atlanta and killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women. His actions were apparently motivated by “sex addiction” and a desire to “eliminate temptation.” As nonprofit leader Sung Yeon Choimorrow noted in an interview with NBC News, this motivation springs from a long history of sexual objectification of Asian women “as variations of the Asian temptress, the dragon ladies and the lotus blossoms, whose value is only in relation to men’s fantasies and desires.”
