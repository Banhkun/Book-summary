## Chapter 7: How to Have the Conversation

Now, with the foundations of racism clear and an understanding of the types of higher-level connections we need to look for, let’s look at how to have a conversation about race.

Oluo weaves advice for talking about race throughout the book. We’ve synthesized the key themes and elaborated on them to create a practical how-to guide for having these conversations. **Here are the practical nuts and bolts.**

### Before the Conversation

Before the conversation starts, **do your homework** :

  * If you’re a white person in conversation with a person of color, don’t rely on them to explain things you could easily find out for yourself. As Oluo comments, **the other person is not your human Google.**
  * If you’re a person of color, consider looking for some statistics to support your points. 



(Shortform note: If you’re a white person not sure where to start, there are various sites and articles that can help you educate yourself. They provide resources including:

  * Articles (such as Ta-Nehisi Coates’s “The Case for Reparations”)
  * Books (such as Michelle Alexander’s _The New Jim Crow_)
  * Films (such as Ava DuVernay’s _When They See Us_) 
  * Videos (such as Amanda Kemp’s “How to Have a Voice and Lean Into Conversations on Race”))



**Check your privilege**(Chapter 2). Being aware of your privilege in the area you’re going to talk about will help you avoid ignorant statements and microaggressions.

**Seek out different perspectives on the issue.** Keep intersectionality in mind. If you’ve already talked to an Asian American man, seek out someone with a different background.

**Check that the person wants to talk.** Conversations about race are exhausting for people of color, so do everything you can to make the other person feel comfortable. If the other person doesn’t want to talk, or doesn’t want to talk right now, respect that.

### During the Conversation

**1\. Clarify and share your intentions, and keep your priorities straight.**

  * Why are you having this particular conversation? Why does it matter?
  * State your intentions clearly and **allow your conversation partner to decide whether they want to proceed.**
  * Throughout the conversation, bring your intentions to mind. If something makes you feel defensive, remember that defending yourself isn’t the priority. Remember your intention.
  * Remember that everyone in the conversation is taking a risk, not just you.



**2\. Listen more than you talk.**

  * Don’t force the other person to make something more palatable just so you’ll be willing to listen, and **don’t tone police.**
  * If you’re a white person, **notice how much you’re talking about yourself.**
  * Pause frequently. 
  * Ask questions.



**3\. Be willing to feel uncomfortable.**

  * Listening to someone talk about their pain is painful. Don’t shy away. **If you refuse to feel this pain, you’re forcing people of color to suffer it alone.**



**4\. Talk to people of your own race too.**

  * If you’re white, talk about race in places where there are no people of color to speak for themselves. **Bring these conversations into corners of your life where people of color can’t yet reach** : within your family or in an all-white corporate boardroom. (Shortform note: Having conversations about white privilege with those closest to them is one of the most powerful ways white people can fight racism. Before you start, read Peggy McIntosh’s “White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack” (and send it to your family members to read as well).)
  * If you’re a person of color, talking to other people of color may help you to feel less alone in your experiences. It can help you to resist large-scale cultural gaslighting and remember that you’re not going insane, that your experiences are real. Compassionately bring to light your own internalized racist beliefs and any patterns of thinking and behavior that have made you unwittingly complicit in the system. (Shortform note: In _How to Be an Antiracist, _Black author Ibram X. Kendi writes about how his frequent conversations with Black friends in his African American studies program left him feeling both supported and ignorant, and eventually forced him to confront his own sexism, homophobia, and racism.)



**5\. Don’t substitute other prejudices for racism.**

  * It’s not helpful to make prejudicial remarks about other groups. You can’t fight racism with sexist, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted ideas. (Shortform note: Remember the impact of intersectionality, the idea that multiple types of disadvantage intersect in complicated ways. You can’t separate racism from other harmful biases.)



**6\. Do what’s right, not what feels good.**

  * The purpose of these conversations is not to prove you’re a good person or that you’re not racist. 
  * **Seek to find truth, not to be right.**



> **Approaching Conversations With the Right Mindset**
> 
> All of the practical advice above boils down to one thing: **Your attitude matters**. If you’re a white person entering these conversations, at some point you’ll probably feel torn between two conflicting goals—You want to learn more, but you also want to protect your ego and preserve aspects of your current way of thinking. You can analyze these conflicting goals in terms of the mindset that underlies them.
> 
> As Carol Dweck argues in _Mindset_ , you can approach tasks with one of two possible mindsets. In a **fixed mindset** , you believe that you and others are incapable of meaningful change. Because of this, you tend to expend effort in proving yourself and defending your views and capabilities, and you’re fearful of challenging activities that might reveal you to be less than perfect. In a **growth mindset** , you believe that you and others are growing, learning, and improving all the time. A growth mindset directs your efforts toward activities that will help you to learn. A growth mindset prompts you to seek out challenges and means that you don’t feel threatened by failure.
> 
> Looking again at the seven suggestions above, you can see that several of these are smart ways to trigger a growth mindset. Suggestions 1 and 6 (“Clarify and share your intentions,” “Keep your priorities straight,” and “Do what’s right, not what feels good”) keep you focused on the goal of the conversation and not on your own “performance” within it. Tip 2 (“Listen more than you talk”) encourages you to seek out new information rather than relying on the information and ideas you already have. And Tip 3 (“Be willing to feel uncomfortable”) acknowledges that growth usually happens when you step outside of your comfort zone.

### What to Do if You Make a Mistake

If you’re having a lot of these conversations, it’s almost certain that eventually you’ll make a mistake.

If things really start to go pear-shaped, Oluo suggests that you:

**1\. Apologize.**

  * Even if the conversation was months ago, consider contacting the person to apologize. Better late than never.



**2\. Decenter your own feelings and intentions.**

  * **Your intentions aren’t as important as your actions.** Even if you had good intentions while screwing up, you still screwed up. 



**3\. Know when to leave it alone.**

  * You may feel you need some kind of resolution. Don’t push it. Take a break, think about what went wrong, and try again later.



**4\. Don’t castigate yourself for all eternity.**

  * If you did something that hurt someone, feeling bad is an appropriate response. But remember that this has more to do with needing to work on your communication skills than being a horrible person. **Reflect, repair the damage if possible, and then drop the guilt and try again.**



**5\. Keep trying.**

  * Failure doesn’t feel good. But for real change to happen, we need to keep having these conversations. Your failed conversations are better than your silence, because your silence is your complicity.
  * These conversations are upsetting because the issues themselves are upsetting, not because we’re talking about them. **The more we talk about them, the more we can do, and the less upsetting the reality will become.**



> **Mistakes and Shame: The Work of Brené Brown**
> 
> As Oluo notes, if you do make a mistake during a conversation about race, you’ll almost certainly feel bad about it. You may feel angry at yourself for making a misstep—or, **you may feel ashamed of yourself for unwittingly participating in the racist system.**
> 
> If you become wrapped up in shame about your mistake, this may prevent you from being able to respond to the mistake in the healthy and productive ways that Oluo outlines above. As shame researcher Brené Brown notes in her book _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , when we feel ashamed, we often react in unhealthy ways—for instance, by lashing out at other people or distancing ourselves from the person we hurt.
> 
> In the context of making a mistake in a conversation about race, neither of these unhealthy approaches to shame is productive. If you lash out at the person of color you’ve already hurt with your mistake, you’re only deepening the wound caused by your racist behavior. Further, if you distance yourself from that person, you’re unlikely to follow Oluo’s recommendations of apologizing or trying to have a productive conversation in the future.
> 
> So, how can you stop yourself from reacting to shame unhealthily (and instead implement Oluo’s recommendations for moving past your mistake)? Brown recommends **developing shame resilience.** This means being able to identify shame as it occurs and move past it in a healthy way. You can develop shame resilience by:
> 
>   * Learning how shame manifests for you so that you can identify and address it
> 
>   * Identifying _why_ you’re feeling ashamed and considering if shame is the most productive response to your behavior
> 
>   * Talking to someone trustworthy about how you’re feeling
> 
>   * Actively resisting the urge to engage in unhealthy shame-triggered behaviors
>
