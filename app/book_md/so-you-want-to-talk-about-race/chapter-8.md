## Chapter 8: Beyond the Conversation

Oluo acknowledges that it’s easy to get hooked on the good feeling that comes with having successful conversations about race. But she recommends that you don’t get trapped in a feel-good cycle of saying the right things and doing nothing. **It’s what we do _after_ we have the conversations that matters.**

Oluo argues that there are many ways you can put your new understanding into action in the political, educational, economic, workplace, and personal spheres. Pick whichever of these suggestions resonate best with you:

### Political Actions

Oluo suggests that you:

**Vote.** And not just in big elections: Vote on school boards, local elections, and so on. Local politics is often where the real change happens.

  * Bother politicians before elections. Ask to see their policies on racial equality.
  * Vote for candidates of color.
  * Support racially inclusive and just policy platforms.
  * Become involved in the campaigns of candidates of color.



**Vocally** **support increasing the minimum wage**. Proportionately more people of color work in minimum-wage jobs, so increasing the minimum wage will benefit more people of color.

**Support affirmative action.** Ever since the 1960s, affirmative action has aimed to increase the representation of marginalized groups in higher education and the federal workforce. The people who criticize affirmative action as “unfair” simply don’t know the facts. There have never been any quotas, and the goal representation percentages are often far below actual parity. For example, a Supreme Court decision in 1980 upheld the reservation of ten percent of funds for minority businesses, when the actual minority population was 17 percent. As Oluo points out, affirmative action targets exist to redress a systemic opportunity gap. They’re not back doors or easy ways to get hired.

(Shortform note: If you’re against affirmative action, consider your motivations carefully. A series of studies on reactions to affirmative action—reviewed here—suggest that white people reap psychological benefits by blaming affirmative action for their struggles. For example, if you believe you didn’t get a job because you weren’t good enough, this might damage your ego. If you believe you didn’t get it because you’re white and they were only looking for candidates of color, your ego is protected.)

**Approach mayors and local governments about police reform.** Ask about policies regarding officer training, body cams, and complaints procedures. Demand reform wherever necessary. Keep applying pressure.

**Insist on justice for police shootings.** District prosecutors care about their jobs. If they risk losing their jobs because of publicity around their poor handling of police shootings, they’re more likely to follow due process.

> **Political Actions: Focus on Changing Policy**
> 
> For Ibram X. Kendi, author of _How to Be an Antiracist_ , political action (in the form of fighting racist policies) should be the main goal of antiracist efforts. Kendi is the founder of the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research, which assembles multidisciplinary teams to examine and improve racist policy: for example, policy relating to COVID-19.
> 
> Kendi advocates a framework that includes careful policy examination, public education that highlights the racist effects of policies and introduces possible antiracist alternatives, and ultimately the purposeful implementation and evaluation of antiracist policies.

### Economic Actions

Oluo suggests that you:

**Harness the power of your wallet.** Remember that economic inequalities are at the core of the White Supremacist system and do what you can to offset this.

Wherever possible, support businesses that are run by people of color. Boycott businesses that take advantage of people of color—steer clear of banks that employ racist lending practices and avoid businesses that rely on low-wage labor from people of color.

**Donate to grassroots organizations** that are working for change.

**Offer compensation when you book a speaker of color**. If you are trying to raise racial awareness in your workplace or community and want someone to come in and speak, don’t assume they’ll volunteer their time. Remember that we’re fighting against the economic exploitation of people of color, not participating in it.

> **Economic Actions: Racial Justice Isn’t a Zero-Sum Game**
> 
> On an individual level, your choices about how to allocate your money are an either-or proposition (you’re choosing whether to support a business run by a person of color rather than buying the same product from a white-run business, for example).
> 
> However, on a national level, it doesn’t work like that. When people of color suffer economically, white people don’t benefit, because the economy as a whole suffers. A 2020 study by Citigroup, for example, found that racist practices have cost the US economy a total of $16 trillion (almost the same amount as the current annual GDP). These losses were mainly due to discriminatory lending practices resulting in lost business revenue; wage shortfalls; insufficient housing loans; and unequal access to higher education.
> 
> These researchers estimate that if racist practices in certain key areas were targeted for improvement today, the resulting economic boost over the next five years would be on the order of $5 trillion.

### Educational Actions

Oluo suggests that you:

**Engage with schools.** Ask about the opportunity gap in your school district. Find out about the history curriculum. Are there any curricula and textbooks that erase people of color or teach a whitewashed version of history?

**Contact teachers and educational leaders** to tell them that racial issues are a priority.

If you’re at college, will soon be applying for college, or have a child in either of those situations, **contact colleges to find out their policies and track record on diversity and representation**.

> **Educational Actions: Resources for Teachers**
> 
> While we can’t expect teachers to bear full responsibility for antiracist education, they do have a crucial role. Expert teachers suggest integrating educational material on racism into the curriculum. An increasing number of resources for teachers are available online, often including lesson plans, text, posters, and media resources. Two examples of websites with high-quality resources are Learning for Justice __ and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History & Culture.

### Workplace Actions

Oluo suggests that you:

**Become active in your unions.** A racially aware union can do a lot for people of color. If you speak up enough in your union over time, people will eventually start listening.

**Call out tokenism.** If management tries to implement perfunctory, superficial measures that look good but don’t run deep—for instance, hiring one person of color but making no further efforts to diversify the workforce—let them know.

> **Workplace Actions: Tackling Workplace Racism From a Whole-Company Perspective**
> 
> In a 2020 article in the Harvard Business Review, Robert Livingston suggests that companies that are serious about tackling racism should engage in a systematic five-step process (acronym PRESS):
> 
>   * **Problem awareness.** This involves canvassing the staff to find out whether they believe there’s a problem (white employees may not, and may even believe there is anti-white racism—a belief that will jeopardize the success of any initiatives). Formalized diversity initiatives are not enough; these overt declarations can encourage complacency and mask discriminatory practices.
> 
>   * **Root-cause analysis.** Discerning the root causes of a problem usually involves moving away from band-aid solutions, such as workshops that try to change the behavior of individual employees, and toward addressing the systems and structures that are to blame.
> 
>   * **Empathy.** In Livingston’s experience, organizations build empathy best when employees have the opportunity to listen to their non-white co-workers’ stories of discrimination. This helps to dispel the myth that racism no longer exists.
> 
>   * **Strategy.** For maximum effectiveness, leaders need to focus on changing three things simultaneously: individual attitudes, informal workplace culture, and formal policies. These three aspects of company life affect one another, such that failure to move on one of them will cause the others to drag or even backfire.
> 
>   * **Sacrifice.** Sacrifice means ensuring that the company makes an adequate investment of time, energy, and resources in bringing its strategies to life. Livingston notes that the stumbling block in true organizational change isn’t usually the inability to come up with appropriate strategies; it’s whether the organization is ultimately willing to divert resources toward the change. The good news is, however, that diversity often costs less than people expect.

### Personal Actions

Oluo suggests that you:

**Diversify the art and music you engage with.** Mainstream television, film, music, and literature is white by default. Seek out work by people of color, films in which the majority of actors are not white, and books by people of diverse backgrounds.

Watching films and reading books is a great way to listen to people of color without demanding personalized emotional labor.

> **Personal Actions: Seek Out Books and Films by People of Color**
> 
> If you’d like to start reading more books by people of color, this Buzzfeed list has a broad range of recommended titles, including books by Toni Morrison, Jhumpa Lahiri, Alice Walker, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and Ta-Nahisi Coates. This list, by the Chicago Review of Books, showcases indigenous writers from Australia, New Zealand, and Canada as well as the United States. This list suggests 25 books by Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and this list recommends ten novels by or about Muslim Americans.
> 
> This list of 17 films is a good entry point into films about being black in the United States. This Vox article lists 11 antiracist films that tackle racism head-on. And on a more romantic note, this list introduces five films about people of color in love around the world, from India to Vanuatu.

### Final Words

**Thank you for joining this conversation.** Though it may be deeply challenging at times, know that you’re working to create a better future for all of us. (Shortform note: As James Baldwin famously observed: “Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”)

**Please continue to courageously talk, fail, learn, and talk some more.** It’s through these difficult conversations that we’ll gradually overcome our racist history, untangle and let go of our own racist assumptions, and put the future on a more just and equal track.
