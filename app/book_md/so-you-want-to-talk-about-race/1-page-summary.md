## 1-Page Summary

Self-described “writer, speaker and internet yeller” Ijeoma Oluo worked for many years in the tech industry, where she was often the only black person in the room. She wrote _So You Want to Talk About Race_ as a handbook for people who want to have productive conversations about race in the United States. _So You Want to Talk About Race_(2018) was Oluo’s first book, followed in 2020 by _Mediocre: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male America_.

A skilled public speaker, Oluo has appeared on _The Daily Show With Trevor Noah_ and _The Opposition With Jordan Klepper_. She’s also given a number of talks, including a 2018 presentation at Google (which has been coming to terms with its own race problem) and a conversation with Roxane Gay in which they both talk about their work.

### Why We Haven’t Been Talking About Race

As Oluo notes, one of the main problems in talking about race is that **people are afraid to do it**. People of color are nervous about having their experiences minimized or dismissed. They’re wary of knee-jerk defensiveness and exhausted from dredging up their trauma to explain the same things over and over again. White people are often afraid of hurting or offending their conversation partner. They’re fearful of being called racist, and they’re unaccustomed to the feelings of discomfort that arise when they confront the ways in which their own privilege comes at the expense of others.

It’s good to be cautious when approaching this topic, but **if we avoid talking about race entirely, we won’t get anywhere**. If we fail to talk about the system by which millions of people are disenfranchised, hurt, locked up, and even killed every day, we’re complicit in that system. (Shortform note: Derald Wing Sue refers to this as “the conspiracy of silence.”)

Words can bring unconscious patterns out of the dark so that we can examine them, understand them, and disentangle them. With clearer definitions, we can be more precise in describing the problems, making it easier to find solutions.

> **Difficult Conversations: Why They’re Difficult**
> 
> As Oluo notes, conversations about race are almost always difficult. In _Difficult Conversations_ , Douglas Stone suggests that this is because any difficult conversation contains three main sub-conversations, more than one of which is usually active at any given time.
> 
>   * **The What Happened Conversation** , in which we’re focused on trying to work out who’s right, who’s wrong, who’s the victim, and whose fault the problem is.
> 
>   * **The Feelings Conversation** , in which we either over-focus on our own feelings or manage them badly.
> 
>   * **The Identity Conversation** , in which protecting our own self-image as competent, moral, and worthy of love becomes our top priority.
> 
> 

> 
> It can be challenging to juggle all three sub-conversations at once.

### Key Terminology

The first thing we need to do is get our terms straight. If we don’t do that, we risk talking at cross purposes and getting nowhere.

#### What Is Racism?

Is race even real? No. As Oluo notes, **the concept of race has no scientific basis.** (Shortform note: As discussed in this Scientific American article, genes can __ be used in a limited way to identify people’s place of geographical origins, but they don’t map well onto the physical characteristics we associate with race.)

But race is very much a _social_ reality, in that our ideas about race have real social effects, and these social effects translate into material differences in how people in certain groups are allowed to live their lives. **Even though race is a fiction, it’s a fiction that shapes many, many people’s realities**. And it won’t magically go away if you suddenly decide you don’t believe in it.

(Shortform note: Consider national borders. They’re based on human invention, too—the land on one side of a border isn’t inherently different to the land on the other side. But, even so, the country you happen to be born in has a significant impact on how your life plays out. In this way, an imaginary line dictates the physical realities of our lives.)

When people talk about racism, they’re usually drawing on one of two definitions:

1\. Racism is bias against a person or group based on their race.

2\. Racism is bias against a person or group based on their race, **in the context of power structures that support this bias**.

(Shortform note: The Merriam-Webster dictionary makes the same distinction: It presents two definitions of the word “racism,” the first describing individual prejudices and the second describing systemic social oppression.)

If you’re working from the first definition, it makes sense to talk about “reverse racism” and prejudice against whites and to see affirmative action as unfair. If you’re working from the second definition, you understand that “reverse racism” can’t rationally exist and that affirmative action is designed to redress a historical imbalance. If you want to truly engage with issues of race and spark real progress, Oluo recommends that you use the second definition.

(Shortform note: Ibram X. Kendi, activist and author of _How to Be an Antiracist_ , disagrees with the idea that reverse racism doesn’t exist. He argues that certain ideas expounded by black writers—such as the theory that whites were created by an evil black scientist or that whiteness comes from recessive genes—are definitely classifiable as racist.)

#### What Is Systemic Racism?

If something is systemic, it’s built into the underlying structure of a system. That system is White Supremacy, and it steeps us in racist messaging all our lives.

In our individualist culture, we don’t like to think about ourselves as part of a system. We like to think that everyone has complete independence. But **these individualist tendencies obscure our view of the big picture.** Individualist assumptions trick us into thinking that racist cops are just “bad apples” and that every black man who goes to prison deserves it. We need to battle these tendencies and focus on the patterns, even—especially—if this means taking a good hard look at ourselves. (Shortform note: In _White Fragility, _author Robin DiAngelo __argues that the “myth of individualism” serves to protect the self-concept of most white people, and that black people experience the flip side of it: If they _aren’t_ successful, it must be because as individuals they’re somehow less deserving.)

The good news is that **seeing racism as a system gives us more entrance points if we want to dismantle it.**(Shortform note: Vanderbilt University Professor Tim Vogel offers ten suggestions for people wondering where to start**** in dismantling the system, including deliberately opening your social networks to more diversity and cultivating concern and respect in the way you engage with people of color.)

#### What Is Privilege?

Privilege is **a situation in which one person or group has advantages that another doesn’t**. These advantages are unfairly distributed to begin with. The White Supremacist system is built on privilege. (Shortform note: Scholar Peggy McIntosh likens this to an “invisible knapsack” of useful tools that privileged people carry through life.)

**Privilege and disadvantage are two sides of the same coin.** We’re all privileged in some ways and disadvantaged in others. When we look at how privileges and disadvantages combine (and in particular the effects of being in two or more disadvantaged categories, such as female and black), this is called **intersectionality**. The term “intersectionality” was first used by race theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989. (Shortform note: Crenshaw first used the term in this academic article about how the legal system treats women of color. The term has since migrated from its original legal context into the social sciences more broadly, and from there into mainstream discourse.)

#### What Is the Model Minority Myth?

**Themodel minority myth is the idea that Asian Americans are a “model” minority group**: an example that all other racial and ethnic minority groups should aspire to. Asian Americans are stereotyped as hardworking, talented in math and science, strict parents, socially docile, and conformist.

**As Oluo andother authors have noted, even though this myth seems positive, it does damage. **For instance, it fails to capture the pervasive challenges that Asian Americans experience in the workplace: Their careers often start promisingly but then stagnate as the white people around them are promoted to leadership positions. (Shortform note: Author Jane Hyun calls this the “bamboo ceiling.”) Very few political representatives are Asian American. (Shortform note: In 2021, there were two senators and 15 representatives, alongside the historic election of half-black, half-Indian American Kamala Harris as vice president.)

Furthermore, the stereotype of submissiveness means that Asian American women are twice as likely as the national average to suffer physical or sexual abuse at the hands of their partners. (Shortform note: Intimate partner violence toward Asian Americans increased even further during the Covid-19 pandemic.)

### Joining the Dots

To more deeply understand the mechanisms behind racism, we need to connect the dots—between the past and the present, between the present and the future, and between the small and the systemic.

#### The Past and the Present

As Oluo explains, we can trace the White Supremacist system back to its origins in slavery and genocide. The country’s recorded history begins with the theft of Native American land and the murder of the original inhabitants. Then, black bodies were brought to the United States to be possessed and exploited. To rationalize the theft, mass murder, and social and economic subjugation, there needed to be a widely held belief that people of color were subhuman.

(Shortform note: This view that black people are subhuman, rooted in a long history of scientific racism, hasn’t gone away. For example, a letter entitled “Are Negroes Closer to Apes Than to Humans?”, sent in 2012 to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia, argues that black people should be classified as a different species.)

**The economic disadvantage of today is built on the economic exploitation of the past.** Today, this pattern persists in the form of serious disparities in the economic opportunities available to black and white Americans. The net worth of an average white American, for example, is nine times more than that of an average black American. (Shortform note: The net worth gap has increased, rather than decreased, over time.)

For different historical reasons, **Hispanic Americans are also economically disadvantaged** today. Their net worth is on average ten times less than that of white Americans, and Hispanic men make 69 cents for every white man’s dollar and Hispanic women 58 cents. (Shortform note: In practice, this means that Hispanic women need to work for over 20 months to bring home the same amount of money that white men make in 12 months.)

##### The History of Policing

Oluo also **traces the systemic racism within today’s police forces back to** **the racist origins of our law enforcement agencies**. Contemporary US police forces began as slave patrols and Night Watches. Right from the start, their roles were to control Native American and black populations and hunt escaped slaves, and officers participated in Ku Klux Klan activities while off duty. Though the vast majority of police officers today no longer consciously see their job as disciplining and controlling populations of color,**old racist structures still show through as a pattern of attitudes and practices toward people of color.**(Shortform note: As late as the early 1990s, Californian police officers used the acronym NHI (“No Humans Involved”) to talk about cases relating to black men.)

As Oluo demonstrates, in the present day, black people are **more likely to be subject to unnecessary and humiliating disciplinary measures by police** , and **one in every three black men and one in every six Latino men go to jail at least once in their lives.** (Shortform note: The figure for whites is one in 23.)

Blacks and Native Americans are three and a half to four times more likely to be killed by police than white people. Police even perceive children playing with toy guns as threatening: Twelve-year-old Tamir Rice was shot by Cleveland police in 2014 for holding a toy gun, and when his 14-year-old sister ran over to help him, police tackled her and put her in handcuffs. A police chief later described the boy as “menacing.” (Shortform note: Police officers have been shown to judge black children as less innocent and more culpable for their actions than white children, also overestimating the ages of black children aged ten to 17 by approximately three years.)

##### The History of Language

We also need to understand history if we’re to understand **the power that some words have to do damage**. For example, you may see black people using the word “nigger” amongst themselves and wonder why you aren’t allowed to use it too. The reason is that “nigger” is **weighed down by centuries of slavery, dehumanization, oppression, abuse, and brutality.** Every time a white person uses it, they invoke all of that history, whether they mean to or not.

> **A College-Level Course on the N-Word**
> 
> Black university professor Neal Lester developed a whole college-level class at Arizona State University centered around the N-word. Lester notes that the point of having open discussions around the use of the N-word is not to forbid the word or make it taboo without explaining why. Instead, he says it’s to make us more sensitive and thoughtful about our language use.

#### The Present and the Future

We also need to connect the dots between the present and the future. As Oluo shows, **today’s kids of color are still experiencing disadvantages and opportunity gaps that will follow them for the rest of their lives.**

As well as being born into under-resourced families in areas with underfunded schools, children of color endure a number of systemic problems after they enter school. Many of these are related to discipline, overlapping with the systemic prejudices within law enforcement that we saw above. **Preschool and elementary school teachers are more likely tolook for aggressive behavior in black children, perceive black children as angrier, and suspend or expel black children for more trivial infractions than white children.** (Shortform note: This study tracked the eye gazes of teachers who had been told to look for problem behaviors in a video clip of a mixed-race, mixed-gender play group. The teachers gazed longer at black boys. In reality there were no problem behaviors in the video clip.)

Teachers also pathologize children of color at higher rates, often diagnosing them with learning disabilities when they’re simply hard to discipline. (Shortform note: This claim is contested, with some findings indicating that when you control for socioeconomic status and test scores, black children are in fact _less_ likely to be identified as needing special education.)

Around eighteen percent of the school population is black, but 31 percent of suspended students and 40 percent of expelled students are black. **Black students are suspended at more than three times the rate of white students** , and Native American students are more than twice as likely as white students to be suspended.

> **The Effect of Suspensions and Expulsions as Punishment**
> 
> Punishing children (of any race) by denying them education has long-lasting effects. Suspensions have marked effects on school performance, with suspended students often having to repeat the school year. Many of them decide to drop out of school completely instead, which brings further risk.

This is the start of an effect dubbed the **“school-to-prison pipeline.”** Increasingly strict (and broadly interpreted) weapons policies and a rising police presence in schools have led to the outsourcing of normal school-based disciplinary responsibilities to formal law enforcement. Students who are arrested at school are more likely to be arrested again as adults.

> **Criminalizing Children of Color at School**
> 
> Black parents’ fear for their children is completely rational: There are numerous cases of teachers being quick to involve the police. One school principal called the police on a black boy who was playing with a fluorescent green and orange toy gun. Another 12-year-old boy was suspended and formally written up for playing with a toy gun during a virtual class. The police also came to his house, terrifying him.
> 
> Even science projects aren’t immune. In 2013, black 16-year-old Kiera Wilmot was arrested and taken to a juvenile detention center for fingerprinting after bringing a homemade volcano to school. In 2015, Muslim 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was handcuffed and arrested for bringing in his homemade clock that teachers assumed was a bomb.

#### The Small and the Systemic

As we saw earlier, racism is systemic: Blatant acts of racist aggression spring from the same underlying belief system as more subtle or unintentional ones. Let’s look at that more closely.

**Microaggressions** are subtle acts of psychological violence against a person because they’re a member of a marginalized group. These can be verbal (racist jokes, comments, insults, backhanded compliments, minimizations) or nonverbal (hair touching, purse clutching, following someone around a store, airport security checks, taxis that don’t stop). They can be expressed as compliments (“Wow, your English is perfect!”) or as questions backed by genuine curiosity (“So where are you from?”). (Shortform note: As linguist Robin Lakoff notes, this makes these comments particularly difficult to parse: The surface layer seems to be positive, but the underlying assumption is negative.)

Microaggressive actions may seem innocuous. But they’re all **manifestations of deeply rooted belief systems that have genuinely damaging effects.** For example, touching a black woman’s hair without their permission is not only rude, it also invokes the legacy of slavery: your right to touch and manipulate her body however you want, regardless of her wishes. Small actions can be imbued with symbolic meaning, and the gradual accrual of microaggressions over a long period has serious mental health impacts. (Shortform note: Microaggressions have been shown to affect the mental and physical health of people of color, including Latino Americans, Native Americans, and Asian Americans.)

**Cultural appropriation** is another example of how seemingly small actions can have powerful symbolic effects. This occurs **when members of a dominant culture adopt selected aspects of another culture without respect, background knowledge, or proper attribution.**

Oluo gives the example of someone wearing a Native American war bonnet to a music festival. By doing this, he’s stripping it of its traditional symbolic meaning and using it for ego gratification. (Shortform note: Music festivals are slowly beginning to ban war bonnets after extended campaigns from Native American scholars and activists. Cherokee nation scholar Adrienne Keene has published a series of blog posts about this issue, arguing that war bonnet trends stereotype, homogenize, and disrespect indigenous cultures. Keene notes in an interview for this Guardian article that many white people believe that they’re “respecting” or “honoring” Native American culture in these situations. She suggests this cartoon as a pithy summary of that argument.)

If something has been practiced for years in a minority community but **only achieves legitimacy when it’s covered in a veneer of whiteness** , that’s cultural appropriation. If a white person can gain kudos for doing something that **people of color are still being discriminated against for doing** , that’s cultural appropriation. (Shortform note: in a short 2015 video titled “Don’t Cash Crop on My Cornrows,” actor Amandla Stenberg discusses the phenomenon of white people wearing black hairstyles such as cornrows and asks: “What would America be like if we loved black people as much as we loved black culture?”)

### Having the Conversation

Oluo weaves advice for talking about race throughout the book. We’ve pulled out and elaborated on the main threads to create a practical how-to guide for having these conversations. **Here are the practical nuts and bolts.**

#### Before the Conversation

Before the conversation starts, **do your homework**. If you’re going to be talking about economic disadvantage, learn some facts. Remember that the other person isn’t your own personal racial encyclopedia, and respect their time.

**Check your privilege**. Being aware of your privilege in the area you’re going to talk about will help you to avoid ignorant statements and microaggressions.

**Seek out different perspectives on the issue.** Keep intersectionality in mind. If you’ve already talked to an Asian American man, seek out someone with a different background.

**Check that the person wants to talk.** Conversations about race are exhausting and emotionally risky for people of color. If the other person doesn’t want to talk, or doesn’t want to talk right now, respect that. Do everything you can to make the other person feel comfortable.

#### During the Conversation

**1) Clarify and share your intentions.** This will help the other person decide whether they want to participate. It’ll also keep you focused on the goal of the conversation, decreasing the chance you’ll get distracted.

**2) Listen more than you talk.** Monitor how often you’re saying “I” and “me.” Decenter your own perspective and seek to broaden it, not explain it.

**3) Don’t tone police.** Tone policing is shifting the topic of conversation from what’s being said to the way it’s being said. Examples of tone policing are statements like “Well, nobody will listen to you if you use such inflammatory language,” or “Calm down,” or “Anger won’t get us anywhere.” Tone policing can feel like you’re just keeping the conversation on an even keel, when in fact you’re claiming the right to tell someone how to feel about their oppression.

**4) Keep your priorities straight.** If something you say or do gets called racist, don’t indulge in knee-jerk defensiveness. It’s your behavior or your words that are being criticized, not your very soul. Remember that enduring a lifetime of racism is worse than being called racist.

**5) Be willing to feel uncomfortable.** If you’re doing the conversation right, it’ll make you feel upset. It may make you feel ashamed, guilty, angry, or shocked. Stay with these feelings and see where they lead you.

**6) If you make a mistake,** apologize. Try to figure out what went wrong so you don’t do it again. Know when to leave it alone—if the person doesn’t want to engage again, that’s their choice. But don’t castigate yourself for all eternity. Reflect, learn from the mistake, and try again with someone else.

> **Approaching Conversations With the Right Mindset**
> 
> If you’re a white person entering these conversations, at some point you’ll probably feel torn between two conflicting goals—You want to learn more, but you also want to protect your ego and preserve aspects of your current way of thinking. As Carol Dweck argues in _Mindset_ , you can approach tasks with either a **fixed mindset** (in which you believe that you and others are incapable of meaningful change) or a **growth mindset** (in which you believe that you and others are growing, learning, and improving all the time). A growth mindset prompts you to seek out challenges and means that you don’t feel threatened by failure. Looking again at the seven suggestions above, you can see that suggestions 1, 2, 4, and 5 above are smart ways to trigger a growth mindset.

### Beyond the Conversation

Productive conversations are a good start, but they’re just a start. It’s easy to get hooked on the good feeling that comes with saying the right things and having the right conversations, but ultimately it’s what we do _after_ the conversations that matters. Here are some concrete things you can do to fight racial injustice, grouped into the spheres in which you can apply them: political, economic, educational, workplace, and personal.

#### Political Actions

**Vote.** And not just in big elections: Vote for school boards, in local elections, and so on. Local politics is often where you can spark real, tangible change. Support candidates of color and racially inclusive policies.

Vocally **support increasing the minimum wage**. Proportionately more people of color work in minimum-wage jobs, so increasing the minimum wage will benefit a large number of people of color.

**Support affirmative action.** People who criticize affirmative action as unfair simply don’t know the facts. There have never been “quotas,” and the goal percentages are often far below actual representational parity. Affirmative action targets exist to redress a systemic opportunity gap. They’re not back doors or easy ways to get hired.

**Approach mayors and local governments about police reform.** Ask about policies regarding officer training, body cams, and complaints procedures. Demand reform wherever necessary. Keep applying pressure until something changes**.** Insist on justice for police shootings.

(Shortform note: For Ibram X. Kendi, political action (in the form of fighting racist policies) should be the main goal of antiracist efforts. Kendi advocates a framework that includes public education that highlights the racist effects of policies and introduces possible alternatives, and ultimately the implementation and evaluation of antiracist policies.)

#### Economic Actions

**Harness the power of your wallet.** Wherever possible, support businesses owned by people of color. Boycott businesses that take advantage of people of color: Steer clear of banks that employ racist lending practices and avoid companies that rely on low-wage labor from people of color. **Donate to grassroots organizations** that are working for change. (Shortform note: When people of color suffer economically, white people don’t benefit, because the economy as a whole suffers. A 2020 study by Citigroup, for example, found that racist practices have cost the US economy a total of $16 trillion (almost the same amount as the current annual GDP).)

#### Educational Actions

**Engage with schools.** Ask about the opportunity gap in your school district. Find out about the history curriculum. Are there any curricula and textbooks that erase people of color or teach a whitewashed version of history? **Contact teachers and educational leaders** to tell them that racial issues are a priority.

If you’re at college, will soon be applying for college, or have a child in either of those situations, **contact colleges to find out their policies and track record on diversity and representation**.

(Shortform note: While we can’t expect teachers to bear full responsibility for antiracist education, they do have a crucial role. Expert teachers suggest integrating educational material on racism into the curriculum. A number of resources for teachers are available online.)

#### Workplace Actions

**Become active in your unions.** A racially aware union can do a lot for people of color. If you speak up enough in your union over time, people will eventually start listening.

**Call out tokenism.** If management tries to implement perfunctory, superficial measures that look good but don’t run deep, let them know. (Shortform note: In a 2020 article in the Harvard Business Review, Robert Livingston suggests other company-level actions to tackle racism, including addressing the systems and structures that are to blame and listening to people of color’s stories of workplace racism.)

#### Personal Actions

**Diversify the art and music you engage with.** Most mainstream television, film, music, and literature is white by default. Seek out work by people of color, films in which the majority of actors are not white, and books by people of diverse backgrounds. Watching films and reading books is also a great way to listen to people of color without demanding personalized emotional labor. (Shortform note: If you’d like to start reading more books by people of color, this Buzzfeed list has a broad range of recommended titles.)

> **103 More Things You Can Do to Fight for Social Justice**
> 
> In addition to Oluo’s suggestions above, this Medium article suggests a range of ways that white people can contribute to the struggle for racial justice. Possibilities include contacting federal and state legislators on specific issues related to criminal justice, moving your money to a black-owned bank, and attending local political meet-and-greets to ask questions about racial justice.

### Final Words

**Thank you for joining this conversation.** Though it may be deeply challenging at times, know that you’re working to create a better future for all of us. (Shortform note: As James Baldwin famously observed: “Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”)
