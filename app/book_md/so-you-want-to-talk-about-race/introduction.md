## Introduction: The Power of Words

As Oluo notes, if you’ve picked up her book, it’s because **you want to learn how to have more productive, more empathetic, more useful conversations about race**. You believe in the power of words to change things. But you may feel hesitant about having the conversation.

According to Oluo, one of the main problems in talking about race is that **people are afraid to do it**. It’s good to be cautious when approaching this topic. But, Oluo argues, **if we avoid talking about race entirely, we won’t get anywhere**. If we fail to talk about the system by which millions of people are disenfranchised, hurt, locked up, and killed every day, we are complicit in that system. (Shortform note: Psychology professor Derald Wing Sue refers to this avoidance as “the conspiracy of silence.”)

Conversations are powerful. Words can bring unconscious patterns out of the dark so that we can examine them, understand them, and disentangle them. Talking about things helps us to see them more clearly. And the more clearly we can see the problems, the easier it is to find solutions.

Oluo argues that because issues of race have been papered over for so long—because talking about race has always been something best avoided in a polite conversation—**people who want to start talking are finding that they don’t know how to have the conversation**.

People of color are often nervous about having their experiences minimized or dismissed. They’re wary of knee-jerk defensiveness, and they’re exhausted from dredging up their trauma to explain the same things over and over again.

Meanwhile, white people, Oluo notes, are often afraid of hurting or offending their conversation partner. They’re fearful of being called racist, and they’re unaccustomed to the feelings of discomfort that arise when they confront the ways in which their own privilege comes at the expense of others.

These conversations are usually upsetting for everyone involved. But, as Oluo reminds us, **the conversations are upsetting because _racism_ is upsetting, not because we’re suddenly talking about it**. We can’t let our fear win. Having these discussions is the beginning of profound, permanent social change. Welcome to the conversation.

> **Difficult Conversations: Why They’re Difficult and How to Tackle Them**
> 
> As Oluo notes, conversations about race are almost always difficult. But what makes these conversations so difficult—and how do we even define “difficult” in the context of conversation?
> 
> For Douglas Stone, author of _Difficult Conversations_ , “difficult conversations” are conversations that make you feel uncomfortable or nervous. He says that underlying any difficult conversation are three main sub-conversations. More than one of these sub-conversations is usually active at any given time, and especially thorny conversations typically involve all three:
> 
>   * **The What Happened Conversation** , in which we’re focused on trying to work out who’s right, who’s wrong, who’s the victim, and whose fault the problem is.
> 
>   * **The Feelings Conversation** , in which we either over-focus on our own feelings or manage them badly (for example, by being unaware of our true feelings on an issue and letting these feelings affect us unconsciously).
> 
>   * **The Identity Conversation** , in which protecting our own self-image as competent, moral, and worthy of love becomes the priority. This comes at the expense of attention to the issue that’s actually the topic of conversation.
> 
> 

> 
> Race-related conversations activate all three conversation types and at a high intensity. This is what makes them so challenging to approach and sustain for all parties involved.
> 
> Stone proposes the following remedies for these unproductive approaches. In the What Happened Conversation, try to focus on the ways that both people have contributed to creating the problem and make sure to take responsibility for your part. In the Feelings Conversation, make sure you’ve taken the time to understand your own feelings on the issue and where they come from. And in the Identity Conversation, acknowledge that your identity is complex by taking the “and” stance. For example, realize that you can be a good person _and_ say something insensitive, and that both of these things can be true simultaneously.
