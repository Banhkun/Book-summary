## Chapter 1: Foundations

To avoid misunderstandings, the first order of business is to make sure that we’re all talking about the same thing.

Sometimes we can reach an impasse just because **people are using the same word in different ways**. For example, what happens if you and the other person mean different things when you say the word “racism”? Or if **someone doesn’t know the meaning of a word** , such as “intersectionality,” and that gets in the way of their understanding of key issues? If we start without a good understanding of important terms, we’ll end up talking at cross purposes and getting frustrated.

(Shortform note: In _How to Be An Antiracist_ , Ibram X. Kendi adds that definitions are important not only to get everyone on the same page, but also because slippery definitions can be easily manipulated to make oneself appear virtuous or to silence conversational partners.)

So in this chapter, we’ll look more closely at the meaning of “racism” and “systemic racism.” In the next chapter, we’ll clarify the meanings of some other important terms you’ll need when talking about race: “privilege,” “intersectionality,” and the “model minority myth.”

### What Is Racism?

#### Is Race Even Real?

No. The concept of race has no scientific basis. (Shortform note: As discussed in this Scientific American article, genes can __ be used in a limited way to identify people’s place of geographical origins, but they don’t map well onto the physical characteristics we associate with race.)

However, as Oluo notes, race is very much a _social_ reality, in that our ideas about race have real social effects, and these social effects translate into material differences in how people in certain groups are allowed to live their lives. **Even though race is a fiction, it’s a fiction that shapes many, many people’s realities.** So when the word “race” appears throughout this guide, understand that it doesn’t refer to any objective physical or genetic reality, but rather to a social fiction that we create and sustain through our words and actions.

(Shortform note: Consider national borders. They’re based on human invention, too—the land on one side of a border isn’t inherently different to the land on the other side. But, even so, the country you happen to be born in has a significant impact on how your life plays out. In this way, an imaginary line dictates the physical realities of our lives.)

#### Racism: Two Definitions

When you use the word “racism,” what do you mean? As Oluo comments, chances are you’ll be referring to one of **two different (but superficially similar) definitions** :

  1. Racism is bias against a person based on their race.
  2. Racism is bias against a person based on their race, **in the context of power structures that support this bias**.



(Shortform note: The Merriam-Webster dictionary makes the same distinction: It presents two definitions of the word “racism,” the first describing individual prejudices and the second describing systemic social oppression.)

If you’re working from the first definition, racism is located in the minds of individuals. Working from this definition, it makes sense to talk about “reverse racism” and prejudice against whites, get horribly offended if someone calls you “white trash,” and see affirmative action as unfair. In this framework, **the goal of reducing racism is more atomized:** All we need to do is change the minds of individual people and we’re set.

If you’re working from the second definition, racism is located in social power structures as well as individual minds. Working from this definition, there’s no such thing as “reverse racism,” being called “white trash” may be unpleasant but it has little impact on your life, and affirmative action is redressing a historical imbalance. Using the second definition, you can see that **the goal of reducing racism is structural.** Changing individual people’s minds isn’t enough. We also have to dismantle the power structures that feed these individual opinions.

Throughout this guide we use the second definition. If you want to make real progress in your conversations about race, you should too.

(Shortform note: In _White Fragility_ , author Robin DiAngelo also argues that reverse racism cannot exist because the control of powerful institutions—control historically held by white rather than black people—is an integral part of true racism. However, Ibram X. Kendi has a different opinion: He calls the idea that black people can’t be racist because they lack power the “powerless defense.” Kendi argues that black people do have power, and that certain ideas expounded by black writers—such as the theory that whites were created by an evil black scientist or that whiteness comes from recessive genes—are definitely classifiable as racist.)

> **Should We Be Talking About Caste Instead of Race?**
> 
> If race is a fiction, does that mean we should be searching for alternative terminology to replace words like “racist” and “racism”? According to author and journalist Isabel Wilkerson, we should. In _Caste _(2020), Wilkerson makes a distinction between “race” (the visible differences between people that we use to group them, plus the meaning that we give to those differences) and “caste” (the system of social organization that springs from this bundle of differences and meanings). The link between race and caste is a particular set of beliefs, which is triggered by physical characteristics and then translated into systems of hierarchy and division.
> 
> Wilkerson argues that the systemic social inequalities between black and white people in the US are better described as a “casteist” system than a racist system. She also provides cross-cultural examples of similar phenomena. In India, for example, the caste system is complex and pervasive (though it’s currently undergoing significant change). The system divides Hindus into four main castes, from the Brahmins (priests) at the top to the Shudras (manual workers) at the bottom, as well as the Dalits (“Untouchables”). There are strict sanctions for intermarriage between castes. Though discrimination based on caste has technically been illegal since 1948, it continues today in various forms.

#### How Can I Tell What’s Racist and What’s Not?

What’s the threshold for something or someone to be called racist? For example, is it okay to call someone’s sweet elderly great-auntie racist? How can calling someone’s hair “wild” or complimenting someone’s English be racist?

As Oluo observes,**many white people have a knee-jerk response to the word “racist”** (more on this in Chapter 3). Almost everybody is willing to admit that lynchings, cross burnings, and Nazis were racist. But **we tend to minimize anything less blatant.** If you call it racist, you risk accusations that you’re alienating people with your “inflammatory language” or “identity politics.”

This makes it very difficult to talk about race-based economic disadvantage, for example, or actions that are racist in more subtle ways. Those are **easy to explain away as “nothing to do with race” or “all in your head.”** It’s this kind of gaslighting—whether it’s intentional or unintentional—that turns conversations about race into minefields for people of color.

(Shortform note: Racial gaslighting is subtle by definition. Political science professor Angela Davis offers three ways to figure out whether you’re being racially gaslighted: You feel that something’s not quite right; the person is blaming the victim; and the person is tone policing. For more on tone policing, see Chapter 6.)

#### How Do I Know if a Conversation Is About Race?

Most conversations about race stall before they’ve really begun, caught up in arguments about whether or not race is actually the issue. People might ask, “but isn’t it about class, not race?” or defend someone with “But he didn’t mean any harm!” Getting stuck on defining conversational boundaries is a wasted opportunity to make actual progress. (Shortform note: This is why British writer Reni Eddo-Lodge explained, first in a 2014 blog post and then in a 2017 book, why she was no longer talking to white people about race: She could no longer put herself through the “denials, awkward cartwheels and mental acrobatics” that characterized white people’s attempts to redirect the conversations.)

So let’s look at this more closely. Oluo offers **three criteria** to help you decide whether or not a conversation is about race.

Race is relevant if:

**1\. A person of color says race is relevant.**

  * This may seem subjective. That’s the point. Through the process of having these conversations, you’re learning to listen to and value the opinions of people of color. (Shortform note: You could think about it this way: People of color are experts in being people of color. If you’re white, you’re not an expert. It’s best to listen to the experts.)



**2\. The magnitude of its effect on people of color is different.**

  * Some people ask: How can poverty be related to race when there are lots of poor white people too? And what about the black billionaires? 
  * We’re not looking for evidence that something _only_ affects people of color; it’s that its impact on them is greater than it would be if there were true racial parity. The fact that you can think of a black musician who swept an awards night or a Native American artist who’s achieved widespread recognition doesn’t mean it’s the rule. 
  * (Shortform note: Consider Asian American actress Lucy Liu, who due to her work in _Ally McBeal_ and _Charlie’s Angels_ became the most widely known Asian American actress of her generation. Liu spoke to the Sydney Morning Herald __ about getting far fewer auditions than a white friend and being in audition rooms where she “looked like no other woman in the room.” Though Liu’s name may easily come to mind when you try to think of an Asian American actor, that doesn’t mean that the playing field is level.)



**3\. The issue is part of a larger pattern that implicates race.**

  * Racism is systemic. It takes many forms, from the subtlest to the most blatant. The fact that there are extreme forms of racism doesn’t make the subtler forms any less serious or any less racist. 
  * (Shortform note: Microaggressions—see Chapter 6—are a clear example of this interconnectedness. As we’ll discuss, microaggressions are subtle, racially-charged comments that often aren’t _intended_ to be racist—**but they’re still racist, and still just as unacceptable as more “overt” racism.**)



### What Is Systemic Racism?

Systemic racism is also called “institutional racism” or “structural racism.” If something is systemic, it’s built into the underlying structure of a system. It’s an integral part of how the system operates. We can visualize each instance of racist behavior as a thread in a vast fabric—so vast that we’re completely caught up in it and can’t see its boundaries or overall shape. Similarly, we’re surrounded by racist messaging, but much of this operates unconsciously.

(Shortform note: _Biased _by Jennifer Eberhardt goes into more detail about the mechanisms of these unconscious processes. Eberhardt shows that implicit racial bias is ubiquitous in the United States, and that this bias can have particularly devastating consequences in police encounters.)

Though it may seem controversial, Oluo characterizes this system as a White Supremacist system. Why?

In a White Supremacist system, whiteness is both (1) the default and (2) the superior position. The system was built for the benefit of white people and at the expense of people of color (more on the history of racism in the US in Chapter 3). This dynamic is still playing out in both obvious and subtle ways. Here’s how it works.

**1) Whiteness as the default.** This is where whiteness serves as the reference point for “normal.” The White Supremacist system normalizes its perspective as the default. This makes anyone who doesn’t match the default invisible.

> **Whiteness as the Default: The “Flesh-Colored” Band-Aid**
> 
> A clear example of white skin as the default is the story of the “flesh-colored” band-aid. This product, which first came onto the market in a pink color in 1920 and was advertised as being “almost invisible” in 1955, has been tailored to white skin for nearly 100 years. (There was a brief attempt to introduce new shades in 2005, but they didn’t sell, probably because many shopkeepers put them on shelves of “things for black people,” far away from the rest of the first aid supplies.)
> 
> In June 2020, Johnson & Johnson announced a new range of band-aids in different shades in support of the Black Lives Matter protests. A tweet in which 45-year-old black man Dominique Apollon shares his emotions on using a Tru-Colour bandage for the first time shows how meaningful this kind of product can be. (Medical anthropologist Duana Fullwiley notes that the fact that this attempt at racial equality is happening with a band-aid product is ironic, given the depth of the wounds that protesters are trying to heal. She suggests that a higher-impact response would be to manufacture only the dark-skinned version for the next 100 years.)

**2) Whiteness as holding a superior position.** Superior and inferior are always relative. If one person or group has a superior position, by definition there has to be another person or group that’s beneath them. And, as Oluo writes, this is the seduction of White Supremacy—it whispers: _“You will get more because they exist to get less.”_ Wherever there’s a finite amount of power or resources, **the social function of people of color in a White Supremacist system is to get a relatively smaller piece of the pie.** Even if they don’t realize this consciously, people may _feel_ that this is the natural order of things.

Oluo suggests that this is why the election of Barack Obama increased, rather than decreased, expressions of White Supremacy. Obama’s election to the most powerful office in the country disrupted this unconscious assumption. If a black person, whose entire purpose is to be “less than,” can assume the presidency, this feels fundamentally wrong to someone who’s been raised on a diet of White Supremacist beliefs—often in ways in which they can’t put into words.

Obama felt like a threat, because he was. But he wasn’t a threat to the country; he was a threat to the very structure of White Supremacist beliefs. After Obama was elected, many people were left feeling alienated from a country that they thought they understood. This alienation became the foundation of political movements that are still in force today. (Shortform note: In Caste, Isabel Wilkerson argues that the election of Obama caused many progressive white voters to switch their allegiances along caste lines to the Republican party, which presented itself as the party that would preserve racialized structures.)

#### Acknowledging Systemic Racism

The United States has a very strong individualist culture, and in individualist cultures we don’t like to think about ourselves as part of a system. We like to think that everyone has complete independence. But **these individualist tendencies obscure our view of the big picture.**

Individualist assumptions trick us into thinking that racist cops are just “bad apples” and that every black man who goes to prison deserves it. We need to battle these tendencies and focus on the patterns, even—especially—if this means taking a good hard look at ourselves.

(Shortform note: In _White Fragility,_ Robin DiAngelo discusses individualism extensively. She argues that while the “myth of individualism” serves to protect the self-concept of most white people, black people experience the flip side of it. If they _aren’t_ successful, it must be because as individuals they’re somehow less deserving.)

The good news is that **seeing racism as a system gives us many more ways to dismantle it.** Because different parts of the system are propping each other up, if we pull out enough of the foundations, the whole ugly thing will collapse.

> **Attacking the Foundations of Structural Racism**
> 
> There are a few different ways we can go about dismantling the foundations of the White Supremacist system. Vanderbilt University Professor Tim Vogel offers ten suggestions for people wondering where to start, grouped into cognitive, interpersonal, and organizational approaches. You can start with whichever of these seems most accessible.
> 
> Cognitive approaches include shifting from a fixed mindset (“I can’t change or grow”) to a growth mindset (“I _can_ change and grow”) in how you think about your own limitations when it comes to race. (Shortform note: We explore applying a growth mindset to these conversations more in Chapter 7 of this guide.) You can also deliberately open your social networks to more diversity and cultivate concern and respect in the way you engage with people of color. Interpersonal approaches include using your privilege wisely to address racism as you see it and monitoring your work meetings more closely for racial bias. Organizational approaches include increasing transparency in pay structures, revising central processes (such as how applicants are interviewed for a vacant role), and openly committing to diversity and representation at a company level.
