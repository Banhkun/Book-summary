## Shortform Introduction

_So You Want to Talk About Race_ is**a handbook for people who want to have productive conversations about race in the United States**. Author Ijeoma Oluo weaves together three conceptual strands: first, the important background information that people should know before embarking on a conversation about race; second, Oluo’s own experiences with the issues she describes; and third, practical advice about what to do in certain situations (for example, if the other person doesn’t want to talk, if you accidentally say something offensive, or if you get called racist).

The book is for anyone who wants to improve how they talk about race and includes advice for people of color as well as for white people.

### About the Author

Self-described “writer, speaker and internet yeller” Ijeoma Oluo is a Nigerian-American writer with a background in political science. She was born in the United States to**a white mother and a Nigerian father**. She married early and had two children, completed her college degree as a working single mother, and worked her way up the ladder in the white-dominated Seattle tech industry.

After some time writing for online magazines, she decided to write a book combining and extending her ideas about race and giving **useful, no-nonsense advice** based on the questions that people had been asking her on social media. That book was _So You Want to Talk About Race._ Oluo has also written a series of shorter articles on race, including a widely shared interview with “transracial” woman Rachel Dolezal in 2017 that explored Oluo’s reaction to this case of a white woman who had spent her life trying to pass as black.

A skilled public speaker, Oluo has appeared on _The Daily Show With Trevor Noah_ and _The Opposition With Jordan Klepper_. She’s also given a number of talks, including a 2018 presentation at Google (which has been coming to terms with its own race problem) and a conversation with Roxane Gay in which they both talk about their work.

Oluo was honored for her writing, editing, and activism in the Root 100 list of influential African Americans in 2017 and 2018. In 2021 she was featured on the Time100 Next List, a list that showcases future leaders across a range of fields.

### The Book’s Publication

**Publisher:**Seal Press

_So You Want to Talk About Race_(2018) was Oluo’s first book, followed in 2020 by _Mediocre: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male America_. _Mediocre_ expands on the themes in _So You Want to Talk About Race_ , discussing the negative effects of structural racism and sexism on everyone—including white men.

_So You Want to Talk About Race_ was first published in January 2018, then republished in 2019 with a new foreword by the author. (This guide is based on the 2019 publication.)

### The Book’s Context

#### Historical Context

In 2018 and 2019, around the time of _So You Want to Talk About Race’s_ publication, police shootings of black people were coming under increasing scrutiny. However, the situation hadn’t yet come to a head in the mass Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 that followed the death of George Floyd. Oluo wrote the book because she recognized that more and more people wanted to join the national conversation about race but didn’t know where to start.

_So You Want to Talk About Race_ was part of a wave of works on race published at around the same time, including:

  * Richard Rothstein’s _The Color of Law _(May 2017), on racial residential segregation
  * Robin DiAngelo’s _White Fragility_ (June 2019), on the psychological defenses of white people in conversations about race and how to manage them
  * Ibram X Kendi’s _How to Be an Antiracist_ (August 2019), on personal experiences of racism and how to dismantle racist policy
  * Jennifer Eberhardt’s _Biased_ (March 2019), on unconscious racial biases and how they affect our behavior
  * Isabel Wilkerson’s _Caste_ (August 2020), on the history of the social systems that keep structural racism in place



As a combination of personal stories and historical information to contextualize these stories, _So You Want to Talk About Race_ is similar in style to _How to Be an Antiracist_ , but is written from a queer black woman’s perspective rather than a straight black man’s. This enables Oluo to go into detail about her personal experiences of intersectionality.

In terms of the book’s content, there’s some overlap with _White Fragility_ , especially in terms of the motivations of white people for various psychological defenses. However, the author of _White Fragility_ is a white woman (a fact which has caused controversy, especially in relation to the money DiAngelo makes from speaking engagements, which some view as exploitation). This means that _White Fragility_ lacks the personal, experiential component of _So You Want to Talk About Race._

The personal approach in _So You Want to Talk About Race_ is complemented by the more objective, science-based approach of _Biased_ , the global historical context provided in _Caste_ , and the in-depth economic scholarship of _The Color of Law_.

#### The Book’s Impact

_So You Want to Talk About Race_ became a bestseller in its genre, though its peak success came several years after the initial publication. When it was first published in 2018, _So You Want to Talk About Race_ featured on the New York Times bestseller list for one week. It re-entered the bestseller list in 2020 at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, reaching #2 on June 21 and staying on the list for three months.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

The book was well received, with critics noting that Oluo’s direct writing style was a breath of fresh air. Bustle called it “a must-read primer on the politics of American racism” and Kirkus praised it as “feisty,” “sharp,” and “no-nonsense.” The _National Book Review_ called it a book “for anyone—white or black or any color in between,” praising Oluo for offering solutions as well as raising problems, though also commenting that the book has less of an edge than the author’s previous online writings.

The book did receive some criticism. Some readers felt that Oluo’s brief discussion of her sexuality didn’t belong in a book about race, while a few others found the tone condescending.

Oluo’s writing has made her a target for people with racist grievances. She regularly receives death threats (and suicide threats, predominantly from white men). In 2019, white supremacists “swatted” her house (a type of hoax in which the perpetrators report gunfire and call for a SWAT team to the victim’s address, in the hope that the team will enter the house and cause property damage or bodily harm).

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Oluo writes in a direct, personal, often humorous style, aiming to engage the reader as a friend and peer who’s straight talking to you about your flaws so you can change them.

The historical background that the book provides is specifically targeted to each of the sub-topics as they’re addressed. Readers looking for a more comprehensive history of racism in the United States may want to supplement their knowledge with other books, such as Douglas A. Blackmon’s _Slavery by Another Name _or Pero Gaglo Dagbovie’s _African American History Reconsidered_.

There are a number of gaps and inconsistencies in the content, many of which are acknowledged by Oluo herself in the preface to the 2019 version. First, because **the book is written from the perspective of a black woman** , it largely discusses the experiences of African Americans in the United States, though there are occasional statistics about Native Americans and Asian Americans. The terminology Oluo uses for indigenous peoples is occasionally inconsistent, and the section on Asian Americans isn’t integrated well into the rest of the book. Oluo also comments in the preface that she should have included more on the specifics of mixed-race experiences, especially as she herself falls into this category.

One issue that Oluo doesn’t discuss in the book is racial inequalities in healthcare and health outcomes. For example, people of color are prescribed less pain medication than white people, have less trust in doctors and in the health care system in general, and have worse health outcomes, even after controlling for socioeconomic status. These inequalities have become particularly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. An account of racial disparities in US health care that’s similar in style to _So You Want to Talk About Race_ is Damon Tweedy’s _Black Man in a White Coat: A Doctor’s Reflections on Race and Medicine_.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

_So You Want to Talk About Race_ has 17 chapters. Each of the chapters addresses one of 17 FAQs that people have in conversations on race, for example: “What if I talk about race wrong?”, “Why can’t I touch your hair?”, and “Is police brutality really about race?”

This organization provides bite-sized, targeted parcels of advice, but the content isn’t arranged thematically and it can therefore be difficult to pull out the book’s main ideas. The structure also means that there’s some repetition of material across chapters, with some issues (e.g. economic disparities and crime statistics) being revisited multiple times to highlight different points.

### Our Approach in This Guide

This guide reorganizes the book’s content thematically, beginning with basic principles and ending with the verbal and practical actions that we can take to fight for racial justice in concrete ways.

We’ll cover the material in three broad stages:

  * **Understand**(Chapters 1-3) will give you a solid grounding in the concepts you’ll need to have intelligent, informed, compassionate conversations about race.
  * **Connect** (Chapters 4-6) will unpack these key understandings further, making some higher-level connections between the different concepts and placing them in historical context. We’ll consider connections between the past, present, and future, as well as connections between overtly and covertly racist behavior.
  * **Act** (Chapters 7-8) will put all of the previous content into practice, first within conversations (Chapter 7) and then beyond them with concrete actions that you can take to fight for racial justice (Chapter 8).
