## Chapter 5: Connecting the Present and the Future

Today’s children of color are tomorrow’s adults of color. That means that **any race-based disadvantage they’re facing now will follow them all their lives.** This chapter looks at how children of color are affected by systemic racism.

### Disadvantage Throughout School

As Oluo points out, the opportunity gap between white students and students of color begins to open up even before they start school. On average, **children of color are born into households with fewer resources** (for food, internet, and books). They also live in areas with underfunded schools. (Shortform note: Children of color make up 73% of the 11.9 million children currently living in poverty, and The Century Institute calculates that the school funding deficit amounts to over $5,000 per student per year.)

There’s an intergenerational effect of incarceration: Five-year-old boys whose fathers went to jail for the first time when the child was between one and five are less likely to be judged emotionally and behaviorally ready to start school because of difficulties concentrating and controlling their emotions. At age nine, this same group is more likely to be in special education programs. (Shortform note: This study controlled for race, finding that young boys of all races are affected equally when their fathers are incarcerated. However, as we saw earlier, men of color are imprisoned at disproportionate rates, leading to a higher population-level impact on young black boys.)

#### Preschool

Preschool teachers are more likely to **perceive the play of children of color as aggressive and threatening** and to **look for challenging behaviors in black children.** (Shortform note: This study tracked the eye gazes of teachers who had been told to look for problem behaviors in a video clip of a mixed-race, mixed-gender play group. The teachers gazed longer at black boys. In reality there were no problem behaviors in the video clip.)

Teachers may also **lack empathy for children of different races to their own. **(This is significant because most preschool teachers are white women.) Inflated perceptions of aggression and relative lack of empathy lead to more suspensions and expulsions of black children, even at preschool level. (Shortform note: Teachers also need to beware of “false empathy,” which is when you assume you have more understanding of another person’s situation than you actually do. This can lead to paternalistic attitudes and is a subtle way of silencing oppressed others and appropriating their voices.)

Black preschool students are 3.6 times more likely to be suspended than white students. (Shortform note: Yale’s Walter Gilliam, who has been studying preschool expulsions for decades, found that black students are expelled at twice the rate of white students and says that the three biggest risk factors for expulsion—none of which have anything to do with actual behavior—are “big, black, and boy.”)

This disproportionate reaction is **what happens when the education system looks at children of color and sees violent, dangerous, unstable future criminals** and not normal children learning to regulate their emotions.

#### Elementary School

Asian American children are the minority kids held up as an example by the White Supremacist mainstream. But Asian American students can be disadvantaged when teachers believe that they don’t need as many academic resources as other kids to be successful. This belief is common among teachers, despite the fact that **one third of Asian American elementary school kids are behind their counterparts in reading, writing, and speaking** ,**** a delay that’s more common in kids that grow up in non-English-speaking households. (Shortform note: Asian American children were also disproportionately affected during the COVID-19 pandemic, both because of incidents of racial hate and because of the professions of their parents, who are more likely to be essential workers.)

Throughout elementary school, black children are 54 percent less likely to be selected for gifted programs than white children. Children of color are also pathologized at higher rates than white children. They’re **more likely to be placed in special education programs, even though they have the same rates of learning disabilities as white children.**(Shortform note: This claim is contested, with some findings indicating that when you control for socioeconomic status and test scores, black children are in fact _less_ likely to be identified as needing special education.)

The disproportionate suspensions and expulsions continue in elementary school. **Black students are also perceived as more threatening than white students.**(Shortform note: Teachers in training have been shown to misperceive anger more frequently in black children than in white children. For example, a 12-year-old black boy was suspended in 2015 for staring at a white girl during a staring contest, an outcome that was confusing to him because she was giggling throughout.)

From early on, parents of color have to prohibit their children from playing with toy guns in the street. Parents of white children don’t have to do this. On one occasion when Oluo’s son went to play at his father’s house, for example, the father had to explain to his son why his white stepbrother was allowed to play with guns outside but he wasn’t. (Shortform note: This conversation is so common in black families in the US that many parents and grandparents see it as a kind of rite of passage for black boys, and avoiding it is a dereliction of the duty of care they have toward their children. As the authors of this Nature article comment, this talk “situates parents as the instructors of an impossible lesson: explaining racism and its imminent dangers to children.”)

> **Criminalizing Children of Color at School**
> 
> Black parents’ fear for their children is completely rational: There are numerous cases of teachers being quick to involve the police. One school principal called the police on a black boy who was playing with a fluorescent green and orange toy gun. Another 12-year-old boy was suspended and formally written up for playing with a toy gun during a virtual class. The police also came to his house, terrifying him.
> 
> Even science projects aren’t immune. In 2013, black 16-year-old Kiera Wilmot was arrested and taken to a juvenile detention center for fingerprinting after bringing a homemade volcano to school. In 2015, Muslim 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was handcuffed and arrested for bringing in his homemade clock, which teachers assumed was a bomb.

#### Secondary School

These problems persist in the higher grades. In secondary school, math teachers are more likely to communicate with the parents of children of color (black and Latino) about problem behaviors. They’re also less likely to contact immigrant parents (parents of first-generation Asian and Latino students) about their children’s accomplishments in class. (Shortform note: The same study found that math and English teachers are _less_ likely to contact the parents of Asian students about behavioral and academic issues, potentially leaving serious problems neglected.)

Around eighteen percent of the school population is black, but 31 percent of suspended students and 40 percent of expelled students are black. **Black students are suspended at more than three times the rate of white students** and Native American students are more than twice as likely as white students to be suspended. Furthermore, black children tend to be suspended for subjective offenses (for example “defiance” or “disrespect”), while white children tend to be suspended for objectively provable reasons (for example truancy, drugs, or violence).

> **The Effect of Suspensions and Expulsions as Punishment**
> 
> Punishing children (of any race) by denying them education has long-lasting effects. Suspensions have marked effects on school performance, with suspended students often having to repeat the school year. Many of them decide to drop out of school completely instead, which brings further risk.
> 
> In the case of one participant in this study, one suspension had severe long-lasting consequences. Following the suspension, the student’s behavioral problems continued until he was permanently expelled from the school. While expelled, he got into legal difficulties, leaving him both without formal qualifications and with a criminal record. These factors led to the participant struggling to find a job.
> 
> **White Teachers Have Lower Expectations for Students of Color**
> 
> Oluo mentions in passing that teachers may have lower expectations for children of color. There’s a significant body of research that backs this up. One study, for example, found that teachers expected 58 percent of their white high school students to complete a bachelor’s degree or higher, but the corresponding figure was only 37 percent for their black students.
> 
> These researchers asked two teachers (one white and one black) to evaluate the same students. For the same black student, white teachers were nine percentage points less likely than black teachers to believe that the student would complete a four-year college degree. This effect was even stronger for black male students, where the difference was 11 percentage points. This gap is particularly concerning given that the majority of teachers in schools are white.
> 
> Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson talks about his experiences with low teacher expectations in this video, speculating about all the other potential black astrophysicists who might have been thwarted by racism. These lower expectations do have measurable effects: Positive teacher expectations have been shown to lead to better academic outcomes. Soft feedback may be partially to blame: White teachers have been shown to give less critical feedback to black and Latino students than to white students on the same poor-quality essay. (This is clearly a difficult balancing act for teachers, as they may risk appearing racist if their feedback is too negative.)

### What Is the “School-to-Prison Pipeline”?

The phrase “school-to-prison pipeline” describes the **continuity between the overdiscipline of children of color at school and the overpolicing of adults of color**. To a degree, the mechanism is obvious: For example, **seventy percent of the students arrested in school and referred to law enforcement are black or Latino. **This starts a chain of knock-on effects: Young black people who have their first encounter with police in their early teenage years are 11 times more likely to have been arrested by the time they turn 20. (Shortform note: This effect is absent for white teenagers.)

However, other factors that strengthen the school-to-prison pipeline are more subtle. As Oluo points out, children of color spend most of their waking lives in an education system that constantly punishes them, criminalizes them, and searches for ways to remove them. **Children’s trust in their teachers and schools is damaged from early on** by this unfair and overly severe discipline. (Shortform note: This loss of trust is measurable and is predictive of subsequent negative educational outcomes, including increased school-based discipline and lower college enrollment.)

For some kids, getting expelled isn’t even the worst consequence of being criminalized on the basis of your skin color. **On November 22, 2014, Cleveland police arrived at a playground and shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice within seconds after arrival for holding a toy gun.** When his 14-year-old sister ran over to help him, police tackled her and put her in handcuffs. Steve Loomis, President of the Cleveland Police Union, said later that the boy was oversized and “menacing.”

(Shortform note: Police officers have been shown to judge black children as less innocent and more culpable for their actions than white children, also overestimating the ages of black children aged ten to 17 by approximately three years. Participants in the latter study overestimated the ages of black felony suspects by 4.53 years, meaning that black boys aged only 13 and a half would be perceived as adults. This was even more pronounced in Tamir’s case, with an officer who arrived after the boy had been shot saying that he “looked to be 19 or 20 years old.” The investigation into the Tamir Rice case continued until December 2020, when the Department of Justice concluded that there was insufficient evidence to lay federal charges.)

### What Can We Do to Help Children of Color?

To end this cycle for the next generation of children of color, Oluo suggests that we can showcase their achievements instead of lamenting disciplinary difficulties. We can discourage racially charged language (“thugs” and “hoodlums”), increase the visibility of black and brown kids when we talk about childhood in general, and encourage schools to address the opportunity gap. (Shortform note: Retaining black teachers is crucial to making black students feel more comfortable at school. This article suggests two ways in which white teachers can support their black colleagues: Becoming aware of racial microaggressions and being willing to engage in emotional labor.)
