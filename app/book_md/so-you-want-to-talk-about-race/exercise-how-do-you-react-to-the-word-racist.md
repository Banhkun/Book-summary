## Exercise: How Do You React to the Word “Racist”?

Think about some reactions you’ve experienced to the word “racist.”

* * *

Think about a time when something you’ve done was called racist. (If you can’t think of one, think of a time when you’ve called someone else out for racist behavior or have seen this happen to someone else.) Describe what happened.

If it was you, how did you react? If it was someone else, how did they react?

What thoughts and feelings did you have at the time? (For example: “I thought the person was overreacting,” “I felt attacked,” “I felt ashamed.”)

Are there any ways that this situation could have been handled better?

If you haven’t been called racist, how do you think you personally will react if that happens in the future? (Will you become defensive? Apologize? Deny? Get offended?) What automatic tendencies will you have to overcome to stay focused on fighting racial injustice?
