## Exercise: Get Results

Get what you want from your negotiations.

* * *

Have you ever wanted to get information from someone, but didn’t know how to ask without seeming too forward? What happened? What open-ended questions could you have asked to get this information in a subtle way?

Has someone ever committed to do something for you, only for them to not follow through? Describe how that felt. What can you do in future situations to ensure that other people live up to their commitments?

What negotiating style best describes you? Explain your answer and identify the strengths and weaknesses of your style.

Have you ever completely changed your thinking about a project or a negotiation because new information came to light that you hadn’t considered? Detail what happened. To avoid being surprised next time, what techniques would you use to find these “black swans” or hidden pieces of information?
