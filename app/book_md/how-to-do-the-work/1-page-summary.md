## 1-Page Summary

According to Nicole LePera, bestselling author of _How to Do the Work_ , self-sabotaging patterns create recurring problems that prevent people from feeling happy. These patterns can include irrational emotional reactions and damaging behaviors such as chronic worrying, outbursts fueled by insecurities or anger, and self-destructive habits—for example, procrastinating or overeating.

Since these sorts of patterns create undesirable symptoms, it’s important to overcome them and adopt more positive patterns. However, many people fail to make the changes they want. As a result, they feel like they must accept their patterns as an unchangeable part of who they are.

(Shortform note: Psychologists add insight into what self-sabotaging patterns are and why people might fail to overcome them. You’re self-sabotaging when you engage in behaviors that thwart your goals—for example, wanting to be in a committed relationship but cheating on your partner. Every failed attempt to move toward your goal makes you believe that you can’t or shouldn’t achieve your goal. And this belief reinforces your self-defeating behaviors. For example, cheating on your partner makes you feel guilty. Your guilt convinces you that you don’t deserve to be in a relationship. Even though you _want_ a relationship, believing that you don’t _deserve_ to be in one discourages you from changing your behavior.)

LePera argues that **you can take control of patterns that don’t serve you and live a healthier, happier life**. According to her, self-sabotaging patterns stem from unresolved childhood traumatic experiences. Therefore, the key to adopting more positive patterns lies in identifying and healing painful childhood experiences.

This guide presents LePera’s ideas in three parts:

  * **Part 1** explains how your childhood experiences led you to subconsciously adopt self-sabotaging patterns. It also examines why it’s difficult to change unwanted patterns. 
  * **Part 2** explores how automatically engaging in childhood patterns negatively affects your emotions, your relationships, and your mental and physical health.
  * **Part 3** presents a five-step plan to help consciously address self-sabotaging patterns and replace them with healthier ones.



### Part 1: Self-Sabotaging Patterns Stem From Childhood Trauma

According to LePera, before you can overcome your self-sabotaging patterns, you first need to understand why you engage in them. This knowledge will empower you to take control of your unwanted behaviors.

(Shortform note: Like LePera, James Allen (_As A Man Thinketh_) argues that you must understand why you behave the way you do before you can change your behaviors. Without this understanding, you’re more likely to believe that you have no control over the way you act, and you won’t feel motivated to improve your behaviors.)

LePera argues that the reason it’s difficult to overcome self-sabotaging patterns is that **you never consciously chose to engage in these patterns**. Rather, you subconsciously adopted them as a way to cope with painful childhood experiences that made you feel unsafe or unloved.

In this part of the guide, we’ll first explain how your parents conditioned you to think, feel, and behave in specific ways. Then we’ll explore how painful childhood experiences led you to develop the defensive beliefs and behaviors that form the foundation of all your self-sabotaging patterns. We’ll conclude this part by clarifying how childhood beliefs and behaviors take root in your mind and continue to influence all your patterns.

#### Principle #1: Childhood Conditioning Creates Subconscious Beliefs and Behaviors

LePera argues that your emotional and behavioral patterns are a result of childhood conditioning. As a child, you subconsciously absorbed thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and beliefs from your parents and your environment. **You now automatically default to these conditioned beliefs and behaviors to interpret and respond to all your experiences**.

She explains that **you craved love and security above all else**. Because you were completely dependent on your parents to provide this emotional and physical security, you automatically adapted your behaviors to get what you craved:

  * If you acted according to their expectations, your parents rewarded you—for example, with positive attention and affection. This made you feel loved and secure.
  * If you acted against their expectations, your parents punished you—for example, with rejection or negative judgment. This made you feel unloved and insecure.



(Shortform note: Researchers add further insight into how childhood conditioning takes hold and continues to influence us as adults. Our inherent need to feel emotionally connected motivates us to internalize thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors that help us form cooperative relationships. As adults, **this need for connection encourages us to spend time with people who are similar to us** —because the feeling of sameness enhances our sense of belonging. However, being around like-minded people makes it difficult to break free of our conditioning—because it constantly reinforces our cognitive, emotional, and behavioral patterns.)

#### Principle #2: Painful Childhood Experiences Create Defensive Beliefs and Behaviors

LePera argues that, **whenever your parents made you feel unloved and insecure, you felt extreme pain and discomfort**. Since you couldn’t escape the situation and hadn’t yet developed the emotional skills to cope with your inner turmoil, you adopted defensive beliefs and behaviors to avoid feeling your pain and prevent similar painful situations from occurring.

Further, since you relied on your parents to teach you how to think, feel, and behave, **you adopted the same defensive beliefs and behaviors that _they_ used to cope with their pain. **

##### Example: How You Developed Defensive Beliefs and Behaviors

Every time your parents fought, your father would withdraw both emotionally and physically—by acting cold and distant or staying away from home. Meanwhile, your mother would stay at home and take her frustrations out on you and your siblings.

To avoid feeling the emotional discomfort this situation created, you might have:

  * **Withdrawn into yourself:** This mirrored your father’s defensive behavior—instead of resolving the situation with your mother, he chose to escape and hide from her. Adopting this behavior led you to believe something akin to: “I won’t feel pain if I avoid unnecessary interactions.”
  * **Started a fight with your siblings:** This mirrored your mother’s defensive behavior—because she couldn’t confront your father, she vented her anger out on you and your siblings. Adopting this behavior led you to believe something akin to: “I won’t feel pain if I turn it into anger.” 



> **Your Interpretation of Experiences Influences Your Beliefs and Behaviors**
> 
> In _Psycho-Cybernetics_ , Maxwell Maltz suggests that the conditioning process isn’t as simple as LePera makes it out to be. He argues that you didn’t _automatically_ adopt your parents' beliefs and behaviors. Rather,**the way you interpreted your experiences determined the beliefs and behaviors you adopted**.
> 
> For example, if your mother took her frustrations out on you, you could have interpreted this experience in multiple ways:
> 
>   * Though you experienced pain, you understood that her anger had nothing to do with you personally. As a result, you didn’t adopt any defensive beliefs or behaviors.
> 
>   * You assumed that you were the cause of her anger and felt shame or guilt. As a result, you adopted the defensive belief that you must act perfectly to appease others and avoid conflict.
> 
>   * You concluded that she was an abusive tyrant that you couldn’t appease. As a result, you adopted the belief that you were powerless to change the way she treated you and made no effort to avoid her anger.
> 
> 

> 
> According to Maltz, though your mother used anger to cope with her pain, you didn’t automatically mirror her anger as LePera suggests. Only the way you interpreted your mother’s treatment of you determined what defensive beliefs and behaviors you adopted.

#### Principle #3: Defensive Beliefs and Behaviors Evolve Into Self-Sabotaging Patterns

LePera argues that your reliance on defensive beliefs and behaviors to avoid feeling pain doesn’t end in childhood but, rather, follows you into adulthood. She clarifies why your childhood conditioning continues to influence you by exploring three aspects of your subconscious mind:

  1. Your subconscious mind relies on default patterns.
  2. Your subconscious mind’s primary role is to keep you safe.
  3. Your subconscious mind protects you by creating discomfort.



Let’s explore these three aspects in detail.

##### Aspect #1: Your Subconscious Mind Relies on Default Patterns

According to LePera, your subconscious mind regulates your physiological functions and manages how you perceive, interpret, and respond to all your experiences.

(Shortform note: There is still much to be learned about how the subconscious mind works, but neuroscientists confirm that 95% of your brain activity takes place beyond your conscious awareness, _in your subconscious mind_. Further, your subconscious mind is always alert—because it controls your physiological functions, it stays awake even while you’re asleep.)

It’s able to carry out all these tasks autonomously because it creates default patterns based on what you think, feel, and do most often. These patterns allow you to engage in your routines without having to relearn every single thing you do every time you do it.

Once your subconscious mind creates a default pattern, it stores the pattern in your brain, categorizes it as a part of your internal makeup, and relies upon it as an instruction manual. (Think of these patterns as analogous to the internal programming that controls how your smartphone functions.) LePera argues that **these default patterns compel you to function on autopilot, engaging in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors without consciously thinking about them**.

The following examples illustrate how these default patterns show up in your life:

**Example #1:** Each time you brush your teeth, you automatically pick up your toothbrush with one hand and apply toothpaste with the other. This is because your subconscious mind paid attention to your actions and created a default routine for brushing your teeth. Without this default routine, you would have to relearn how to brush your teeth every single time.

**Example #2:** Each time you see a cookie, you automatically think about eating it and feel the urge to put it in your mouth. This is because your subconscious mind paid attention to how you responded to seeing cookies. It then created a default pattern that results in you automatically wanting a cookie each time you see one. Without this pattern, you would have to consciously decide how to feel about cookies each time you saw them. .

(Shortform note: James Clear (_Atomic Habits_) validates LePera’s claim that you’re compelled to act on autopilot. According to him, your default patterns drive more than 50% of your daily behaviors.)

According to LePera, **the default patterns your subconscious mind relies on were created during your childhood.** This means that your conditioning, as well as your defensive beliefs and behaviors, contribute to many of your automatic patterns.

> **Why Your Subconscious Mind Relies on Default Patterns**
> 
> Neuroscientists offer additional insights on _why_ your subconscious mind relies on default patterns: **It prevents information overload and helps you make quick decisions.**
> 
> Your subconscious mind is an unlimited memory bank that permanently stores your every life experience, even those you’re not consciously aware of: Everything you experience is imprinted in this area of your brain. This memory bank processes four million bits (a measure of data transfer) per second and includes both significant and insignificant experiences, such as how you felt the first time you fell in love _and_ the many hours you’ve spent watching Netflix.
> 
> **Your conscious mind relies on this memory bank to access the information you need** to function on a moment-by-moment basis. Since this memory bank is so full of information, your subconscious mind needs to create shortcuts (default patterns) that it can use to quickly sift through everything it has stored, retrieve the information you need, and act accordingly.
> 
> For example, when you meet your best friend, you instinctively give her a hug. The process that led to this hug played out as follows: You saw your best friend. Your subconscious mind sifted through its memory bank, retrieved memories of your previous interactions, _decided_ on an appropriate response, and _compelled_ you to give her a hug. **What felt like an instinctual response to you was actually a pre-programmed response based on how you habitually think and behave**.

##### Aspect #2: Your Subconscious Mind’s Primary Role Is to Keep You Safe

Now that you understand why your subconscious mind creates default patterns, let’s explore how it relies on these patterns to keep you safe. LePera argues that your subconscious mind’s primary role is to keep you mentally and physically safe. It achieves this by scanning the environment for threats to protect you from.

(Shortform note: Neil Pasricha (_The Happiness Equation_) explains that your subconscious mind’s perpetual vigilance is a result of evolution. To ensure survival, your ancestors had to constantly stay alert to danger and think about food and shelter. Letting their guard down made them vulnerable to predators and competitors. Though you don’t face the same risks now, your instinct to avoid danger hasn’t evolved.)

How does your subconscious mind know how to recognize a threat? LePera explains that it learned this from your childhood emotions. According to her, your subconscious mind records and stores your every experience. This means that it remembers every single thing that’s ever happened to you, including experiences you’ve consciously forgotten. It then uses the information it stores to create your default patterns. Further, **as well as recording all your experiences, it also categorizes the emotions you felt during these experiences** —it does this so that it can predict what types of situations might pose a threat.

If you felt positive emotions during an experience, your subconscious mind categorized that type of experience as safe. If you felt negative emotions during an experience, your subconscious mind categorized that type of experience as a threat. According to LePera, it now uses this information to interpret and categorize threats in your environment. And, **each time it perceives a threat, it influences you to automatically engage in your defensive behaviors**.

For example, you were bitten by a dog when you were a child. The experience terrified you. By default, your subconscious mind now interprets dogs in your environment as possible threats and influences you to feel fear and flee.

(Shortform note: In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins expands on how your subconscious mind identifies threats by arguing that it relies upon neuro-associations—the way your brain links certain experiences with pain and others with pleasure—to categorize your experiences. According to him, your brain relies on these neuro-associations to direct your behavior toward feeling pleasure (safety) and away from feeling pain (threats), and you have to reprogram these associations to create new default patterns. For example, programming your mind to associate dogs with pleasurable feelings convinces your subconscious mind that dogs are safe and helps you overcome your automatic fear response.)

##### Aspect #3: Your Subconscious Mind Protects You by Creating Discomfort

**Since your subconscious mind _believes_ that your default patterns keep you safe, it resists any attempts to change them**. This resistance takes the form of mental and physical discomfort that you experience each time you attempt to deviate from your default patterns. For example, you might experience anxious or negative thoughts, uncomfortable cravings, tension headaches, or stomach cramps. LePera claims that your subconscious mind creates this discomfort to convince you to revert to your default patterns—even those that cause you emotional or physical harm.

For example, your classmates hurt your feelings by excluding you from group activities. You adopted the defensive belief that avoiding social interactions prevents the pain of rejection. As a result, your subconscious mind _associated_ social interactions with pain and rejection and created a default pattern that influences you to automatically withdraw into yourself when you’re around others. Any time you attempt to break free of this pattern and engage with others, you become overly self-conscious, sweat profusely, and feel nauseous. To relieve this discomfort, you withdraw into yourself and avoid engaging in unnecessary interactions—thus preserving your default pattern.

> **Your Subconscious Mind Protects Your Self-Perception**
> 
> Psychologist Prescott Lecky’s _self-consistency theory_ sheds light on why your subconscious mind resists changing your default patterns. He argues that **your subconscious mind is programmed to protect your beliefs about yourself and to align your behaviors with these beliefs**. This means that:
> 
>   * Your automatic patterns _always_ reflect what you believe about yourself.
> 
>   * Your subconscious mind resists adopting patterns that contradict your beliefs about yourself.
> 
> 

> 
> Further, your subconscious mind creates resistance even when you attempt to make a positive change, such as quitting smoking. This is because your subconscious mind doesn’t judge whether your beliefs are “good” or “bad”—it only seeks to protect them.
> 
> **The bigger the change you attempt to make to your beliefs, the more your subconscious mind feels threatened** —and the more psychological and physical discomfort it creates to resist this change.

### Part 2: Engaging in Childhood Patterns Creates Negative Effects

Now that we’ve examined how self-sabotaging patterns form and why they’re so difficult to change, let’s explore how continuing to engage in defensive childhood patterns negatively affects you. This knowledge will help clarify why it’s so important to become conscious of and replace the childhood patterns that don’t serve you.

According to LePera, automatically engaging in defensive childhood patterns creates three negative effects:

  1. You don’t know how to recognize and fulfill your needs. 
  2. You unintentionally replicate childhood relationships.
  3. You suffer from elevated stress levels that damage your health. 



Let’s explore these three negative effects in detail.

#### Negative Effect #1: You Don’t Know How to Recognize and Fulfill Your Needs

According to LePera, conforming to your parents’ expectations as a child caused you to lose touch with who _you_ really are and _your_ true needs. This makes it difficult for you to feel at peace with yourself.

She explains that your current beliefs and behaviors have nothing to do with who you really are—they only reflect how you adapted yourself to achieve feelings of love and security. However, because you’re not conscious of how your childhood conditioning has influenced you, **you assume that your conditioned beliefs and behaviors are inherent and unchangeable parts of your identity**.

This makes it difficult for you to recognize your true needs—what you need to feel happy. And since you don’t know what your true needs are, you’re unable to express them to yourself or others, which makes it impossible to fulfill them. Failing to meet your true needs makes you feel like something important is missing from your life, and this triggers negative feelings ranging from dissatisfaction to resentment.

> **Satisfaction and Happiness Come From Determining _Your Own_ Values**
> 
> Jay Shetty (_Think Like a Monk_) expands on how childhood conditioning prevents you from recognizing and fulfilling your needs. He argues that **the degree to which you live in alignment with your values determines how satisfying your life experiences feel to you**.
> 
> According to Shetty, who you really are and what you need to be happy can be summed up by your values. Your values are core beliefs that you choose to live by—they determine who you _want_ to be and how you treat yourself and others.
> 
> However, **childhood conditioning influences you to adopt values that conform to other people’s expectations to make _them_ happy**. Since other people are nicer to you when you make them happy, you unconsciously conclude that your happiness depends on pleasing them. This leads you to accumulate other people’s values and pursue things that you _think_ will make you happy without considering if these values align with your own. As a result, you’re unable to understand or appreciate the meaning behind what you do, or to gain any real satisfaction once you get the things you’ve been chasing.

#### Negative Effect #2: You Unintentionally Replicate Dysfunctional Childhood Relationships

LePera argues that because you’re not conscious of your defensive childhood patterns, **you automatically seek out and experience relationships that mirror the relationship you had with your parents**.

She explains that your reliance on others to feel loved and secure doesn’t end in childhood but, rather, remains with you throughout your adult life. And the way you now encourage others to make you feel loved and secure echoes the way you learned to elicit these feelings from your parents. This inevitably re-creates the same relationship dynamics you experienced as a child.

For example, your mother was overbearing and difficult to live with. To elicit affection, you submitted to her demands and ignored your own needs. Because you learned this pattern as a child, you now automatically submit to other people’s demands in an attempt to win over friends and romantic partners. Your submissive behavior inevitably attracts people who _want_ you to be submissive—thus creating the same relationship dynamics you shared with your mother.

> **Attachment Theory: You Unconsciously Replicate Child-Parent Interactions**
> 
> Psychological research validates LePera’s argument that adults tend to replicate the childhood relationships they had with their parents. According to attachment theory, children form a specific “attachment style” largely based on parent-child interactions. The theory asserts that children carry these attachment styles into their adult relationships.
> 
> In _Attached_ , Amir Levine and Rachel S. F. Heller note that this theory assumes children who were raised by supportive caregivers tend to develop a “secure” attachment style, while those who were raised by unsupportive caregivers develop “insecure” attachment styles. They describe two insecure styles: “anxious attachment,” defined by a constant need for reassurance from your partner; and “avoidant attachment,” defined by a desire to keep your partner at arm’s length.
> 
> However, Levine and Heller acknowledge that _many_ factors in addition to the child-parent relationship play into the development of attachment styles. Additionally, they assert that attachment styles are not written in stone: While 70 to 75% of adults remain in the same attachment style category throughout their lives, 25 to 30% of adults shift attachment styles at some point in their lives.
> 
> This means that even if you were raised by unsupportive parents, you’re not _predestined_ to become an insecure attacher. Likewise, if you were raised by supportive parents, there’s no guarantee that you’ll become a secure attacher.

#### Negative Effect #3: You Suffer From Elevated Stress Levels That Damage Your Health

**Automatically engaging in defensive childhood patterns risks increasing your stress levels and damaging your health**. LePera claims that feeling emotional distress as a child trained your subconscious mind to categorize many safe situations as threatening and misinterpret your environment. As a result, it now perceives threats where there are none and keeps your body in a heightened state of stress that damages your health.

She explains that each time your subconscious mind perceives a threat, it reacts as if you’re in physical danger and allocates resources to help return you to safety—by releasing stress hormones that provide a burst of energy and prepare your body to fight, take flight, or freeze. Reacting to _real_ physical danger burns through these stress hormones and leaves no trace of them in your body. However, since the threats your subconscious mind prepares you for rarely put you in physical danger, these stress hormones _don’t_ get used up—instead, they linger in your body.

(Shortform note: We’ve already established how your subconscious mind relied on your childhood emotions to identify what types of situations pose a threat. Further, research reveals that your subconscious mind makes decisions about how you choose to feel or act before your conscious mind even perceives the need to make a decision. This means that **your subconscious mind reacts to threats before you get a chance to consciously assess them**. For example, your fear of dogs as a child made your subconscious mind categorize all dogs as threats. Even if you’ve consciously decided that most dogs are safe, you’ll still feel the rush of stress hormones each time you see one.)

The more often your subconscious mind perceives threats, the more **these stress hormones accumulate in your system and interfere with your body’s ability to regulate itself and maintain a state of balance**. LePera argues that this imbalance contributes to a number of emotional, psychological, and physical symptoms:

  * **Emotional:** Mood swings; feelings of anxiety, rage, or panic
  * **Psychological:** Confused or overwhelming thoughts that make it difficult to think rationally or engage with others
  * **Physical:** Digestion issues, autoimmune disorders, chronic fatigue, muscle tension or aches, insomnia or nightmares, and migraines



> **How Stress Hormones Damage Your Mental and Physical Health**
> 
> Research validates LePera’s claim that chronic stress creates an accumulation of stress hormones that contribute to numerous mental and physical symptoms. Chronic stress affects your:
> 
>   * **Hormones** : Leads to increased heart rate and high blood pressure
> 
>   * **Immune system** : Makes you more vulnerable to illnesses and infections
> 
>   * **Sleep** : Prevents your mind from relaxing
> 
>   * **Brain** : Increases cognitive decline
> 
>   * **Digestion** : Damages your gut (indigestion, vomiting, constipation)
> 
> 

> 
> Additionally, **stress compels you to act irrationally** : When you feel stress, _your amygdala acts as if you’re in danger_ —it ensures that you respond automatically to threats by inhibiting the thinking part of your brain (the hippocampus). This makes it difficult for you to think objectively about what you’re experiencing—thus leading to irrational responses.
> 
> Continuing with the preceding example, while you _consciously know_ that most dogs are safe, you’re unable to access the part of your brain that holds this knowledge. As a result, you give in to your instinctive fear and automatically carry out your “irrational” defensive pattern. This behavior is irrational because you consciously know that there’s nothing to fear.

> **Use the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) to Calm Your Automatic Stress Response**
> 
> If you’re concerned about your stress levels, there are steps you can take to alleviate them and improve your health. Many self-help practitioners argue that **you can overcome your automatic stress response if you find ways to deal with “threats” _before_ you’re faced with them**. EFT—otherwise known as “tapping” is an effective way to calm your response to stressful situations. The process involves:
> 
>   * **Accepting** that you feel negative emotions and calming your body’s response to them
> 
>   * **Understanding** why certain things feel threatening
> 
>   * **Releasing** your fear and negative emotions
> 
>   * **Replacing** your unwanted emotions with calm or positive emotions
>

### Part 3: Replace Unwanted Childhood Patterns With Healthier Patterns

Now that you’re aware of how automatically engaging in defensive childhood patterns impacts your ability to feel satisfied with yourself, your relationships, and your overall well-being, let’s work on replacing these patterns with healthier ones.

LePera argues that the most effective way to overcome defensive childhood patterns is to consciously address the childhood experiences that caused you pain. According to her, **the reason your defensive patterns hold so much sway over you is that you’re still using them to avoid feeling your childhood pain**. And, because you didn’t consciously feel and process these painful emotions, they continue to live within your subconscious mind and influence all your behaviors.

Therefore, she suggests that you revisit the childhood beliefs and experiences that instigated your defensive patterns, acknowledge how they impact your current patterns, and create new beliefs that support healthier patterns.

(Shortform note: Tony Robbins (_Awaken the Giant Within_) expands on what LePera says here by claiming that **the more you attempt to avoid painful emotions, the more likely you are to engage in behaviors that exacerbate your emotional pain**. These behaviors include shunning situations that might trigger painful emotions—which means you miss out on experiencing positive emotions that these situations might elicit, and pretending not to feel your emotions—which means painful emotions become increasingly intense and eventually lead to irrational outbursts. Like LePera, he suggests that you can process your painful emotions and relieve your discomfort by acknowledging and accepting where these feelings came from.)

We’ll explore her advice for replacing defensive childhood patterns with healthier patterns in five steps.

#### Step #1: Establish a Daily Routine to Retrain Your Subconscious Mind

The first step toward creating healthier patterns involves **establishing a daily routine to retrain your subconscious mind**. According to LePera, committing to a daily ritual to consciously address defensive childhood patterns will improve your overall well-being and help you retrain your subconscious mind to adopt healthier, more positive patterns.

Though changing your beliefs and behaviors will create discomfort (Recall: your subconscious mind subverts attempts to change default patterns by creating mental and physical discomfort), LePera argues that this **discomfort is a necessary part of overcoming defensive childhood patterns**.

She claims that taking small steps each day to consciously address your beliefs and behaviors will provide two benefits:

1\. Small daily changes will add up and eventually lessen your subconscious mind’s resistance to change.

(Shortform note: Rober Maurer (_The Kaizen Way_) confirms that small daily changes are more likely to bypass your subconscious mind’s resistance to change. Each time you introduce a new change, **you’ll demonstrate to your subconscious mind that you are safe** , and you’ll eventually train it to expect and adapt to these changes.)

2\. Practicing daily conscious awareness will help you break free from the tendency to act on autopilot—thus, making it easier for you to _choose_ your behaviors.

(Shortform note: Neuroscientists confirm that, while you can’t delete default patterns from your mind, practicing conscious awareness will help you weaken these patterns so that your brain no longer relies on them. The more you weaken these patterns, the easier you’ll find it to override them with new automatic patterns that align with your chosen behaviors.)

Additionally, incorporating a self-care ritual into your daily routine will help you tolerate any discomfort. LePera suggests methods such as:

  1. Practicing mindfulness 
  2. Using positive visualizations and affirmations
  3. Improving your diet
  4. Exercising regularly
  5. Sleeping well 



> **Each Positive Change Sets Into Motion a Series of Subsequent Positive Changes**
> 
> Scientific evidence confirms that each of LePera’s five methods offers a number of benefits that improve your mental and physical health:
> 
>   * **Practicing mindfulness:** Mental health practitioners confirm that practicing mindfulness increases self-awareness, encourages positive thoughts about yourself, your circumstances, and others, and improves your mental well-being.
> 
>   * **Using positive visualizations and affirmations:** Studies reveal that _imagining a positive event impacts your brain in the same way that experiencing a positive event does_ —it creates pleasurable feelings that enhance your mood. Likewise, affirmations stimulate reward circuits in your brain that help you maintain a positive state of mind.
> 
> 

>   * **Improving your diet:** Research indicates that in addition to improving your physical health, eating nutrient-dense foods regulates serotonin levels in your body. This in turn improves your mood, enhances your cognitive abilities, and increases your energy levels. 
> 

>   * **Exercising regularly:** Neurobiology research shows that in addition to improving your physical health, regular exercise releases the neurochemicals GABA, serotonin, BDNF, and endocannabinoids. These chemicals help maintain a positive state of mind by stimulating cognition, regulating emotions, and enhancing self-esteem. 
> 

>   * **Sleeping well:** Regular sleep promotes healthy brain chemistry by flushing out toxins that impair the flow of information between neurons. While you’re awake, your brain and body burn sources of energy such as oxygen and glucose. This process creates metabolic waste that accumulates in your system and leads to feelings of fatigue, stress, and irritability. **Sleep allows your body to flush this waste out of your system and restore your energy sources** —thus improving both your mental and physical health. 
> 


#### Step #2: Define the Patterns You Want to Change

Once you’ve established a daily routine to retrain your subconscious mind, define the self-sabotaging patterns you want to change. To achieve this, you need to reflect on the unwanted circumstances in your life and identify how they make you think, feel, and behave.

LePera suggests that you reflect on the unwanted situations in your life. Then, write down what types of thoughts and emotions these situations trigger and how they influence your behavior. For example, each time your partner neglects you, you think about how worthless you are and feel pain. You attempt to suppress this pain by binge-watching TV. Thus, you identify two self-sabotaging patterns:

  1. Thinking negatively—because it makes you _feel_ more worthless and intensifies your pain. 
  2. Binge-watching TV—because it prevents you from taking action to change the way you feel. 



(Shortform note: James Clear (_Atomic Habits_) suggests a complementary exercise to help you complete LePera’s exercise: **Track your actions and emotions**. This will take you beyond simple reflection to develop real-time awareness of your unconscious behaviors and their effect on you. As a result, you’ll find it easier to recognize all the ways self-sabotaging patterns show up in your life.)

> **Advice on Defining Your Self-Sabotaging Patterns**
> 
> Psychologists expand on this step with practical advice for identifying your self-sabotaging patterns. They suggest that you should reflect on times when you:
> 
>   * **Blame others for your feelings or circumstances:** You don’t explore how you’ve contributed to your issues. As a result, you don’t take responsibility for or learn from your experiences.
> 
>   * **Abandon your goals:** Instead of making an effort to fulfill your needs, you allow setbacks and difficulties to convince you to walk away from what you want.
> 
>   * **Procrastinate:** You lack the motivation to do what you need to do, are easily distracted, and suffer from self-doubt or feelings of overwhelm.
> 
>   * **Antagonize others:** You undermine your relationships by provoking arguments, acting inconsiderately, or using passive-aggressive techniques.
> 
> 

> 
> If acknowledging your self-sabotaging patterns inspires self-critical thoughts, remember that the goal of reflecting on unwanted circumstances isn’t to judge or berate yourself for engaging in unwanted patterns, but to increase your awareness of what’s holding you back from the life you want. To overcome any self-critical thoughts, focus on self-compassion during this step. For example, acknowledge that you’ve been doing the best that you can, or consciously forgive yourself for any mistakes that you’ve made. By shifting your focus from criticism to kindness, you’ll be better able to understand your self-sabotaging patterns without falling into the trap of self-defeating thoughts.

#### Step #3: Reflect on Painful Moments From Your Childhood

Now that you’ve identified the self-sabotaging patterns you want to change, reflect on painful moments from your childhood. This will help determine the origin of the thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that underlie your self-sabotaging patterns.

LePera argues that parents trigger childhood pain by practicing at least one of six different behaviors. Therefore, you can identify the experiences that lie at the root of your self-sabotaging patterns by reflecting on how you felt and reacted if they engaged in any of the following behaviors:

  1. **Invalidated your feelings:** For example, you told them your worries about something and they told you to get over it. This made you feel as if your feelings didn’t matter. As a result, you began dismissing your feelings and stopped expressing them to others.
  2. **Ignored you and made you work for their attention:** For example, your mother was too focused on her to-do list to acknowledge your presence. You felt unwanted, and you forced her to give you attention by behaving in ways that provoked her anger. 
  3. **Pushed you into being who they wanted you to be:** For example, your parents frequently berated you for not being as good a student as your sibling. You felt like they didn’t care about your interests and you resented having to try so hard to please them.
  4. **Violated your personal space or privacy:** For example, your father listened in on your conversations with friends. You resented him for invading your privacy, felt stifled, and found it difficult to trust others. 
  5. **Fixated on how you appeared to others:** For example, your parents criticized you for being overweight and restricted your diet. You felt ashamed of your appearance, resented your parents for not loving you as you were, and sought comfort in binge-eating.
  6. **Failed to express their emotions in a healthy way:** For example, your mother flew into a violent rage each time you disappointed her. After each outburst, she would refuse to talk to you for a few days. You felt unsafe, unloved, and didn’t know what you could do to appease her. You withdrew into yourself and avoided any unnecessary interactions with her.



> **Three Negative Parenting Styles Trigger Childhood Pain**
> 
> How exactly do these behaviors create emotional pain that carries through into adulthood?
> 
> Psychologists explain that psychological trauma results from situations that threaten your sense of emotional or physical safety. They argue that **your subjective emotional experience of a situation determined whether you found it traumatic** —the more powerless you felt, the more likely you were to feel traumatized by it. And, since you _already felt powerless_ —because you were entirely dependent on your parents for emotional and physical security—even seemingly-innocent behaviors threatened your sense of safety.
> 
> Further, psychologists claim that there are three negative parenting styles that trigger childhood pain: authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful. While they don’t identify LePera’s list of six parental behaviors as the _sole_ cause of childhood pain, they do acknowledge these behaviors within their descriptions of negative parenting styles. Therefore, you might find it easier to identify relevant childhood experiences if you consider these three parenting styles in addition to LePera’s list of parental behaviors.
> 
>   * **Authoritarian parents** enforce strict rules, are emotionally unavailable or insensitive, engage in one-way communication, and demand unrealistic expectations. For example, if your parents invalidated your feelings or fixated on how you appeared to others.
> 
>   * **Permissive parents** offer minimal guidance, avoid conflict by appeasing demands, and are inconsistent with rules and expectations. For example, if your parents' behaviors fluctuated—sometimes they pushed you into being who they wanted you to be, and other times they expected you to make your own decisions.
> 
>   * **Neglectful parents** are emotionally unavailable, don’t provide emotional support or guidance, and take minimal responsibility for their children’s welfare. For example, if your parents ignored you and made you work for their attention.
> 
> 


#### Step #4: Categorize Your Defensive Behaviors and Pinpoint Your Beliefs

Once you’re aware of the experiences that triggered your pain, categorize the defensive behaviors you developed. This will help you pinpoint the specific beliefs that prevent you from changing your patterns.

LePera claims that defensive childhood patterns fall into one of seven categories. She suggests that you can discover the root cause of your self-sabotaging patterns by first identifying which category your behaviors fall into and then figuring out the belief that fuels these behaviors.

  1. **Neglecting your own needs in favor of pleasing others:** Your belief might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must please others.”
  2. **Achieving success to earn approval and affection:** Your belief might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must overachieve.”
  3. **Avoiding attention from others to prevent criticism:** Your belief might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must remain invisible to avoid failure or rejection.” 
  4. **Solving other people’s problems instead of facing your own:** Your belief might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must help and protect others.”
  5. **Appearing happy and never revealing your pain or weakness to others:** Your belief might be: “To feel safe and loved, I mustn’t reveal my vulnerable side.”
  6. **Acting “good” and engaging in self-sacrificing behaviors to prove your value:** Your belief might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must appear faultless.”
  7. **Submitting to others’ opinions instead of trusting your own instincts:** Your belief might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must follow others.”



> **Other Approaches to Identify Defensive Beliefs and Patterns**
> 
> As yet, there’s no consensus on what defensive patterns children develop in response to painful experiences. We’ll therefore explore two approaches that other psychologists use to categorize defensive patterns. Reviewing this information in addition to LePera’s category list might make it easier to pinpoint your own defensive patterns.
> 
> According to Jungian psychologists, all defensive patterns fall into one of five archetypes of childhood trauma:
> 
>   * **The necessary hero:** This refers to children who assumed an adult’s role and took over responsibilities beyond their age. A belief here might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must strive to be the savior for everyone except myself.”
> 
>   * **The jester:** This refers to children who acted immaturely or used humor to camouflage their emotional wounds. A belief here might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must mask my true feelings.”
> 
>   * **The substitute:** This refers to children who adopted a protective role in an attempt to create the security that their parents failed to provide. A belief here might be: To feel safe and loved, I must take responsibility for other people’s failures.”
> 
>   * **The wild child:** This refers to children that resorted to impulsive or provocative behaviors to get the attention they craved. A belief here might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must make others see me.”
> 
>   * **The aimless wanderer:** This refers to children who withdrew into themselves and attempted to become invisible. A belief here might be: “To feel safe and loved, I must isolate myself.”
> 
> 

> 
> Meanwhile, transformational psychologists argue that specific childhood experiences triggered corresponding defensive patterns. They categorize painful childhood experiences and the patterns they create into four broad themes:
> 
> **Harming: Your parents attacked, judged, shamed, or violated you.** These parental behaviors made you fear other people’s anger and influenced you to believe that you’re inadequate and have reasons to feel ashamed of yourself.
> 
> **Manipulating: Your parents dominated, exploited, or betrayed you.** These parental behaviors influenced you to act submissively, made it difficult for you to trust others, and compelled you to remain focused on your flaws.
> 
> **Rejecting: Your parents neglected, abandoned, or ignored you.** These parental behaviors made you feel unwanted and unloved, and they convinced you that other people would always reject you.
> 
> **Undermining: Your parents degraded you and withheld affection.** These parental behaviors made you believe that you were fundamentally flawed and unlovable.

#### Step #5: Create New Beliefs

Now that you’re aware of the specific beliefs that fuel your unwanted patterns, **create new beliefs to support the patterns you want to adopt**. Since behaviors are a natural extension of beliefs, it follows that new beliefs will inevitably lead to new behaviors (Recall: Your behaviors always reflect your beliefs about yourself). Therefore, LePera argues that **acknowledging and changing your _beliefs_ will train your subconscious mind to practice healthier _behaviors_**.

She suggests that you follow a three-step process to create your new beliefs:

  1. Choose a belief you identified in Step #4 that’s holding you back from the life you want to live. For example, “To feel safe and loved, I must appear perfect at all times.” 
  2. Write down what you _want_ to believe. For example, your new belief might be. “I am lovable even when I make mistakes.”
  3. Turn your new belief into a mantra and repeat it multiple times a day. 



(Shortform note: In addition to improving your beliefs, mantras also help you think more positively. A recent study into the effect of mantras confirms that repeating a single word or short phrase quiets your internal critic. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the brain blood flow patterns of people who silently repeated a mantra. The imaging showed a reduction of activity across the brain, primarily in the area of the brain that gives rise to internal thoughts—this is the area that generates self-critical and negative thoughts.)

> **How to Change Your Beliefs**
> 
> According to LePera, adopting new beliefs will naturally lead to more positive behaviors.
> 
> Similarly, lots of self-help authors claim that you just need to improve your thoughts to improve your life.
> 
> For example, Louise Hay (_You Can Heal Your Life_) argues that you just need to “affirm” what you want to make it come true: Change the statement “ _I must be perfect_ ” to “ _I’m perfect as I am_ ” and repeat this multiple times a day. Eventually, you’ll come to believe this thought and your behavior will align with your new beliefs.
> 
> However, Maxwell Maltz (_Psycho-Cybernetics_) argues that affirmations are not enough to change your default patterns—he believes that **your mind will automatically reject thoughts that don’t align with your established beliefs**.
> 
> He claims that the only way to change your beliefs is to regularly use your imagination to visualize and feel yourself behaving the way you want—this is because _your nervous system operates according to how you feel, not how you think_. According to Maltz, this practice will train your mind to become more comfortable with the feeling of who you want to be, and it’s the only way to overcome old and unproductive beliefs. Therefore, as you repeat your mantra, imagine yourself as someone who _already_ practices your chosen pattern, and attempt to feel what it’s like to live the life you want.
