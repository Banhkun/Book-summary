## Chapter 1: What Is Radical Candor?

As a boss, your main job is dealing with the personal and professional problems of the people that report to you. While this may feel irrelevant to your work, it’s important to realize that relationship maintenance _is_ a boss’s work. Kim Scott, through professional experience as a leader of high-profile teams at Google and Apple University, has found that relationship maintenance should be a _top priority_ when you move into a leadership position.

However, relationship maintenance can be difficult because you need to walk a fine line between being too friendly and nice and being too harsh and managerial— _many_ bosses struggle with figuring out the best way to keep this balance. This is where radical candor can give you clear-cut guidelines.

**Management based in radical candor is straightforward and humanizing, guided by two main principles: “caring personally” and “challenging directly.”** With these two principles to guide your management style, you can accomplish the overarching goal of radical candor: creating a team that accomplishes more than you could possibly accomplish yourself.

#### Principle 1: Caring Personally

Caring personally means caring about people for more than just the work they put out. You have to care about them on a personal level. This involves getting to know more about them as a person—their interests, motivations, and ambitions—and learning more about their “whole selves”—who they are outside of work, and understanding how their personal life might affect their needs at work.

Showing that you care personally about your employees naturally builds their trust in you. This has far-reaching effects—when your reports trust you and feel that you have their best interests in mind, they’re more honest with you, more receptive to your feedback, and more trusting of your decisions. Likewise, you’ll find that you can be more honest with them and more trusting of _their_ decisions.

#### Principle 2: Challenging Directly

Challenging directly means having tough, necessary conversations with your reports—such as conversations in which you need to give criticism or disagree with decisions they’ve made. These conversations might feel too difficult to take on, especially if you haven’t yet gotten the chance to build a caring, trusting relationship with the person—but you have to let the _challenge directly_ principle push you into these discussions, for several important reasons.

First, these conversations offer an opportunity for the feedback recipient to improve themselves and avoid more problems and difficult conversations down the line. Second, just by being direct, you show that you _do_ care about them and their improvement, enough to push through the discomfort of a tough conversation. This demonstration of care naturally contributes to your efforts to build a trusting relationship with them.

On the other hand, if you were to act outside the principles of radical candor, avoiding the conversation, your employee would continue falling short—and they’d probably know it. Continually reassuring them that everything is “fine” reveals that you won’t be honest with them when necessary, which destroys the potential for a trusting relationship

#### Be Careful Not to Misuse Radical Candor

Before you can start practicing radical candor in your workplace, you need to have a clear idea of what behaviors are _not_ aligned with radical candor—this is important to think about, because concepts can be easily manipulated in practice.

  * **Radical candor isn’t** an excuse for rude or aggressive challenging, without any show of personal care
  * **Radical candor isn’t** to be abused in small matters where you want to make nitpicking or micromanaging more effective. It’s important for bigger cases such as decision-making, system changes, or high-pressure situations.
  * **Radical candor isn’t** a top-down system—radical candor should be practiced with the people above you, the colleagues on the same level as you, and the people who report to you. 
  * **Radical candor isn’t** an invitation to constantly socialize with the people on your team, which will likely become an exhausting, time-consuming chore for both parties. 



**Bringing radically candid leadership to your workplace enhances four vital components to building a motivated team and achieving great results:**

  * Building trusting relationships with your team members
  * Improving the guidance you give and receive 
  * Managing your team members’ ambitions and growth more effectively
  * Creating an efficient and effective collaboration system
