## Exercise: Help “Stuck” Employees Find the Way Forward

If you have someone on your team who’s struggling, you have to help uncover the source of their problems and help them find the way forward.

* * *

Think of someone on your team who _should_ be a superstar, but isn’t performing well. Describe this person—the type of projects they work on, when they started, and how you know they should be excelling.

What are some of the obstacles that could be getting in the way of doing great work? (For example, you’ve given them too many projects right away, they have personal matters holding them back, or their training wasn’t thorough.)

As their boss, what can you do to help “unstick” them and allow them to thrive? (For example, fill in training and knowledge gaps, transfer them to a different team with projects better suited to their skills, or give them space to sort out a personal matter.)
