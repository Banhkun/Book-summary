## Chapter 4: How to Get and Give Radically Candid Feedback

It’s likely that you can’t jump straight into giving radically candid feedback—sincere criticism and praise can be off-putting if you’ve built a culture that relies on too-nice, dishonest feedback. **You can get your team used to the concept of radical candor by first _asking_ for radically candid guidance and modeling an appropriate response. Once you’ve built up trust in this way, you can move on to _giving_ radically candid feedback. **

### How to Ask for Radically Candid Feedback

When you become a boss, you’ll likely find that people are more distrusting of your intent, or you may find that your new authority brings out a new side of you. Subsequently, your team won’t begin trusting you until you’re actively working on reasons that they should. At this stage, many bosses get caught up in trying to earn their team’s _respect_ , but if you’re too interested in respect, you’re likely to feel defensive and reactive when you’re criticized. Instead, focus on learning how to accept criticism—**seeing you react well to criticism will naturally build your team’s trust _and_ their respect.**

You can jumpstart this trust-building process by asking your team to provide you with radically candid guidance and responding in a trustworthy manner. There are five steps to effectively soliciting and responding to criticism and pushing your conversations in a productive direction.

#### Step #1: Request Public Criticism

Criticism of your employees should _always_ happen in private, but as the boss, you need to be willing to be publicly criticized. This accomplishes several goals. First, you demonstrate to your team that there’s value in criticism, and that its intent is to make everyone better at their jobs— _not_ to be hurtful. Second, responding well to criticism establishes you as a strong leader who isn’t afraid to make mistakes and is open to learning. And third, public criticism allows you to get everyone’s feedback as efficiently as possible—if you have a big team, you’d miss out on hearing many of your employees’ voices because it’s impossible to schedule everyone for a meeting. Furthermore, you’ll save time by hearing each criticism _once_ , instead of over and over again across multiple meetings.

Your employees will likely be hesitant to jump into this conversation, so you should find a team member who seems comfortable giving you feedback. Ask them to offer some criticism or disagreement at the next staff meeting. They might be uncomfortable with the request, but don’t back down on it—explain why it’s important to you to get feedback that everyone can see.

#### Step #2: Kick Things Off With a Question

It’s often uncomfortable for employees to criticize their boss, so keep a close eye on the balance of praise and criticism you’re receiving in public feedback sessions. If you find you’re getting mostly praise, _directly_ ask for criticism. Asking questions can provide a jumping-off point for coming up with issues that need addressing, and helps cut through the discomfort of offering criticism. Helpful questions include, “How can I better support you?” or, “What is something I’m doing that you find frustrating?”

#### Step #3: Push Through Discomfort to Get Answers

Even with a prompt, your employees may still be hesitant to offer criticism. _Don’t_ let their discomfort make you uncomfortable enough to wrap up the conversation quickly, or take their silence to mean there are no problems. **Hesitation and silence don’t indicate an absence of issues—they indicate that you’ll have to keep pushing to get sincere feedback from your employees.** There are several ways to accomplish this:

  * **Create silence:** Count to six after asking for criticism. Your employee may be more uncomfortable with silence than with criticizing you, and will say what’s on their mind to fill the space. 
  * **Keep asking:** Keep insisting that they come up with _something_. You could say, “You’re usually great at pinpointing improvements that need to be made, so I’m sure you have valuable feedback on how _I_ can improve.” 
  * **Notice body language:** If someone says they have no criticism, but their body language clearly says otherwise, bring it to their attention. You could say, “You’re agreeing with me, but your face is tense and your arms are crossed. Tell me what’s really on your mind!”



Don’t be a bully about pushing for answers, however. If your employees _really_ can’t think of any criticism, ask them to think about it and schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss. It’s vitally important that you stick to this follow-up meeting, so your employees understand that you truly care about getting their feedback.

#### Step #4: Manage Your Response

When someone offers you criticism, it’s crucial that you respond in a way that shows that their criticism is welcome and well-received— _this_ is where trust is built. Don’t __ tell them how their criticism is wrong or not radically candid. Doing so will make them hesitant to share feedback again. Instead, try to listen for valuable parts of the criticism that you can act on or respond to. Additionally, be careful not to become angry or defensive in response to what they’re saying. Instead, listen with the intent to clarify and fully understand the criticism. You can do this by repeating what’s been said and checking that your interpretation is correct.

Consciously managing your response is especially important if you’re the type of person who’s uncomfortable with criticism and isn’t used to welcoming it—if you’re not in control of your response, you’re likely to become defensive and destroy trust instead of demonstrating the value of criticism.

#### Step #5: Demonstrate Your Gratitude

Showing your gratitude for criticism encourages people to keep giving it. **The best way to show gratitude for criticism is responding with demonstrated change.** If it’s a change that can be done right away, do so. If it’s a change that can’t be accomplished right away, make a _perceptible effort_ toward the change. Imagine that you’re told that you tend to use a condescending tone when employees are talking about setbacks or obstacles they bump into. This isn’t a problem you can correct overnight—you often don’t even realize you’re doing it. You ask your employees to help you correct this behavior over the long term by simply saying “tone” as soon as they hear you being condescending.

It’s important to express gratitude for criticism even when you think it’s unfair, or don’t agree. Arguing with or dismissing criticism you disagree with will only serve to undermine the trust you’re trying to build, so instead focus on ways to work through it. First, find something in the criticism that you _can_ agree with—this demonstrates your openness to guidance and that you’re not shutting down completely. Then, make sure you fully understand what the other person is expressing—repeat the criticism back to make sure you’re both on the same page. Finally, tell them you’d like to think about it and get back to them. In your follow-up, explain clearly why you disagree, or why making a change won’t be possible—the other person might end up agreeing with you, seeing a hole in your logic you hadn’t considered, or they’ll stand by their comments. In any case, they’ll see that you took the time to engage with their criticism instead of writing it off.

### How to Give Radically Candid Feedback

Once you get the ball rolling and your employees are gaining confidence in giving you guidance, you need to start giving them guidance in return. This exchange sets the tone for your workplace—a culture where people can freely challenge and be challenged, and understand that it comes from a place of personal care and the desire to make everyone’s work better.

Again, if your employees are not well-versed in receiving sincere criticism and praise, radical candor might seem daunting. Here are some guiding principles you should focus on to help you commit to radical candor and to best set up your employees for sincere feedback.

#### Focus #1: Humility

Humility is important to giving both criticism and praise. Criticism without humility can make people feel defensive, and praise without humility can sound insincere or arrogant. There are three concepts that humble guidance should rely on: precise framing of your feedback, an effective filter, and separation of reality and experience.

**Precise framing of your feedback:** When you’re giving feedback, frame it around three things—the _situation_ , the _person’s behavior_ , and the _outcome_. This helps you avoid arrogant generalizations about the person, both in criticism and praise. Criticism, instead of, “You’re bad at time management,” should sound more like, “I asked you yesterday to get a proposal together for the new client (situation). You chose to work on less urgent projects until one hour before the deadline today, and threw together a proposal riddled with typos (behavior). It’s likely that we’ve lost that client’s trust (outcome).” Instead of generic praise such as, “You’re doing great,” try, “At this morning’s meeting (situation), I noticed that you took charge in making sure that everyone got a chance to share suggestions (behavior). I love that your encouragement makes your team so open to sharing ideas (outcome).”

**An effective filter:** After feedback that didn’t go well, write down what was actually _said_ in the conversation and what you were _thinking_ during the conversation. Examine your two lists to figure out where the conversation went wrong—was there a point where you started saying what you were thinking, without a filter?

For example, you might find that while talking to one of your reports about her time management, you were thinking that she’s not committed enough to her work. You see that after you had this thought, your conversation became accusatory and you spent the rest of the time questioning her commitment, instead of coming up with solutions together.

**Separation of reality and experience:** Remember that your experience or subjective observation of a situation is not necessarily the objective truth—this will help you _invite_ challenge as much as you hand it out. For example, your subjective observation might tell you that your report has time management issues. You suggest this to her, and invite her response. This gives her the opportunity to tell you about her reality—she’s involved in another project that’s disorganized and therefore taking up a huge amount of her time.

#### Focus #2: Helpfulness

Don’t get bogged down with the idea that in order to be helpful, you need to hold your employee’s hand through their work. Radically candid feedback does the heavy lifting by clarifying what the problem is, so your employee can find the solution more quickly—this is accomplished through three helpful actions:

  * **Making your intentions clear.** Criticism usually prompts defensive reactions. When you state that your intent is to help, not to be hurtful, your employees become more receptive to your feedback. 
  * **Being as precise as possible.** It’s tempting to give vague criticism so you don’t have to dive into the discomfort of fully discussing a tough situation—but being vague, a symptom of ruinous empathy, doesn’t give actionable ideas for improvement. Precision about what’s good or bad about someone’s behavior clearly demonstrates what they should do more or less of. 
  * **Outsourcing help when possible.** Helping each of your team members personally with their issues would be impossibly time-consuming. Instead, look for external help to offer to your employees when appropriate and available, such as speech coaches or therapists. 



#### Focus #3: Immediacy

**Feedback is most effective when it comes immediately on the heels of a situation that merits attention.** Saving up feedback for meetings is unhelpful, for several reasons. First, you risk forgetting exactly what you wanted to talk about, or the specifics of a situation—your employee will become frustrated when you give criticism, but can’t think of any examples to illustrate your point. Second, when you wait to give feedback, you’ll often find that problems are too far in the past to be fixed, or successes are too far in the past to be built on. Your job is to offer constant feedback, and your big meetings—such as yearly performance reviews or one-on-one time—should just be formalized echoes of your regular work.

Immediate feedback is especially important when it comes to criticism. Putting off criticism—and subsequently, worrying about it—is mentally exhausting. Additionally, if you hold onto things that anger or frustrate you about an employee for too long, you risk suddenly losing your temper with them, diminishing your credibility and destroying the trust you’ve built.

Consistent feedback also lets the people working for you understand and contextualize how their work is being received or used. Without the context that comes with praise or criticism, people feel that their work goes unnoticed or unappreciated and become disengaged and bored with their work. If their work is being used by someone other than you, try to include them in the meetings or events where their work will be presented, so they can experience the reactions in real time.

To ensure that your feedback is as immediate as possible, always try to deliver it in the few minutes between meetings or following a presentation. This saves you both time, as there’s no long meeting to schedule, and the feedback is more effective because you both have the specific points of praise or criticism fresh in your memory. Make sure your schedule allows for post-meeting feedback by stopping meetings 5 minutes before schedule, or by scheduling meetings a minimum of 15 minutes apart. **Good feedback doesn’t need to take a long time—the best feedback is consistent and specific.**

There _are_ two situations in which you should second-guess the need for immediacy. First, if you or the other person is angry, tired, or hungry (in short, cranky), wait and deliver criticism when you’re both in a better mindset. Second, if your criticism isn’t important or feels nitpicky, don’t say it right away. Take some time to consider if it even needs to be said at all.

#### Focus #4: In-Person

It’s best to deliver your feedback in person—you can see how your feedback is being received by the other person, and you avoid misunderstandings that can come from the nuances of written communication. Many bosses like to deliver criticism by email because it lets them avoid negative emotional reactions, but being present for negative emotions helps you demonstrate radical candor. If your employee is upset, you can lean toward caring personally to help them. If they’re not taking you seriously, you can lean toward challenging directly to show them that your feedback should be important to them.

Sometimes, the importance of speaking in-person will directly conflict with immediacy, such as when your employee is in another city. In these cases, **prioritize immediacy over in-person delivery** unless you’re talking about something very important such as promoting or firing someone. When choosing immediacy over in-person delivery, your mode of communication matters. Video chat is your best option, followed by a phone call. Emails or texts should be avoided at all costs unless _absolutely necessary_ —written communication tends to be misinterpreted at a much higher rate than vocal.

#### Focus #5: Public Praise, Private Criticism

As a general rule of thumb, you should always default to giving praise in public and criticism in private—public praise tends to be more meaningful for the recipient and demonstrates what your team should do more of. On the other hand, public criticism tends to trigger defensiveness.

When giving praise, pay attention to what kind of attention your employees appreciate. Some of them will love public acknowledgment of their accomplishments, and others will find it unbearably embarrassing. Figure out what kind of praise will make them feel best. Keep in mind that this practice will become easier over time, as you practice “caring personally” and get to know your employees better.

When it comes to criticism, make sure your team understands the difference between criticism and debate and disagreements, which are important parts of decision-making and discussion. For example, saying “I disagree with this idea” is fair game for a public conversation. On the other hand, “You’ve been handing in a lot of reports full of typos lately, and I’m starting to question your commitment to this project. Can you explain what’s going on?” needs to be privately discussed.

**Think before you Reply All:** when it comes to praise, replying all to give a quick shoutout is a simple, unembarrassing way to give praise and show recognition for efforts. However, _never_ reply all with criticism—even if there’s an error in something sent out, contact the sender directly and ask _them_ to send out the correction.

#### Focus #6: Caring Personally Does Not Mean Personalizing

When giving criticism, make sure that you are criticizing the problem or the idea, rather than the person. Attributing a character trait to someone as an explanation for their behavior doesn’t get to the root of the problem. “You’re careless” doesn’t specify areas to improve. On the other hand, “There are too many typos in your reports” illustrates a clear problem that can have solutions. **If your criticism starts with “you’re,” rethink it.**

In a similar vein, when in a disagreement, be careful that you’re arguing against the idea, not the person. Saying, “You’re wrong” will usually prompt a defensive reaction, while “I think this is wrong” will usually prompt a discussion.

It’s likely that you’ll eventually come across an issue that _is_ very personal—even in these cases, don’t personalize the criticism. Instead, find an external problem/issue to criticize. For example, Scott once had an employee with very bad body odor, to the point that it actually started to diminish her credibility. Instead of saying, “You have bad body odor” to her employee, Scott talked about the American obsession with hygiene and personal smell and suggested that this employee would be better received by colleagues if she worked within the American status quo. Instead of becoming defensive, her employee was receptive and took care of the issue quickly.

### How Is Your Feedback Landing?

Remember that your commitment to radical candor may change depending on pressures at work, or things taking your energy at home.**It’s important to check in regularly to make sure that you’re acting in line with radical candor, and that what _you_ think is caring personally and challenging directly is landing the right way with your recipients.**

One effective way to keep tabs on how your feedback is landing is to ask your employees and colleagues to rate your feedback. This can easily be done by putting up a paper, split into the four guidance types, near your office and having your employees mark where they thought your feedback landed over the course of the week. Keeping a visual tracker like this accomplishes several goals. First, it highlights which factors of your guidance need work, and in what direction. For example, if your criticism is too ruinously empathetic, you know you need to work on being more sincere and direct when challenging. If your praise is too manipulatively insincere, you know you need to give more specific praise, or back it up with a challenge.

Second, it exposes your team to the principles of radical candor and guidance types, which helps them better understand your objectives and develops a _shared language_ for talking about praise and criticism. Finally, if your team doesn’t add to the visual tracker, but submits complaints anonymously via another platform, you get an idea of how your team thinks you’ll react to criticism. This tells you if you need to dedicate more time to demonstrating a genuine interest in receiving feedback.

### Encourage Healthy Guidance Between Colleagues

Making sure your employees learn how to effectively give guidance to one another—even when you’re not there to mediate—is essential to building a radically candid workplace. There are two spaces where it might be especially helpful to teach radical candor: conflict resolutions and public acknowledgment of accomplishments and mistakes.

  * **Conflict resolution:** Commit your team members to challenging directly and caring personally by never allowing an employee to talk about one of their colleagues while they’re not present. Instead, ask that they speak to one another to find a solution to their problem. If they can’t come to an agreement, invite them to have a conversation with you, together. Your job in this conversation is to support them in talking sincerely about their disagreement and to help them find a solution that is at least tolerable for both of them.
  * **Public acknowledgment of accomplishments and mistakes** : Create valuable learning opportunities by asking team members to get comfortable sharing their experiences. This practice lends guidance by revealing what behaviors and actions should be emulated, and raises awareness of avoidable mistakes or problems, which makes them more avoidable. One simple way to accomplish this is having two awards—such as stuffed toys or trophies—at weekly staff meetings. Any employee can nominate _another_ to receive the accomplishment award, citing an achievement or excellent work they saw from their peer over the course of the week. Any employee can nominate _themselves_ for the mistake award, citing a mistake or a failure they experienced during the week.



#### Gender and Radical Candor

Guidance can feel especially difficult when it goes across group boundaries—this difficulty comes both in giving and receiving guidance. For example, sometimes men are afraid to criticize women because they think women will become emotional. Or, a woman is labeled “abrasive” for challenging one of her colleagues. **Your team needs to navigate these issues because radical candor should be practiced with all people on your team equally.** Here are some suggestions for getting around common situations:

  * **If you’re afraid to criticize a female colleague,** rely on your commitment to personal care and simply ask how your guidance is working for her. If necessary, make changes.
  * I**f your male colleagues are afraid to criticize you,** rely on your commitment to direct challenge and explicitly ask for criticism. Keep pushing for sincere guidance, either by repeating your request or leaving space in the conversation for input.
  * **If you think your female colleague is too abrasive,** think carefully about how you’d feel if your colleague were male—would you still use the word “abrasive”? Commit to being more specific with your guidance. Instead of simply calling her abrasive, point to her specific behaviors and actions that reflect this. If you can’t pick out specific behaviors, rethink your bias. 
  * **If your colleagues think that you’re abrasive,** don’t be tempted to shrink back—continue challenging directly. Do keep in mind, however, that you might be in the wrong. Check in with yourself occasionally to make sure that your guidance is radically candid, and not slipping into obnoxious aggression.
