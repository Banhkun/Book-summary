## Exercise: Recognize Your Influence

As the boss, it’s important to recognize how you may be unconsciously influencing the culture you’re attempting to build.

* * *

Think about a recent behavior of yours that was _not_ aligned with radical candor (such as interrupting an employee, or ignoring a colleague who was clearly upset). Describe the behavior.

What message do you think your behavior sent to your team? (For example, the message that interrupting and not listening is okay, or that they should avoid the discomfort of negative emotions.)

How can you recommit yourself to the culture you’re trying to build, and demonstrate correct behavior to your team members? (For example, at your next staff meeting you say, “I apologize for interrupting last week. That wasn’t a good example of the respectful listening I expect to see. Please feel free to call me out if I do it again.”)
