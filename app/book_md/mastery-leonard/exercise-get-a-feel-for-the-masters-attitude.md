## Exercise: Get a Feel for the Master’s Attitude

In this short exercise, practice approaching some mundane aspect of your life as a master would approach his craft.

* * *

To begin, think back to Leonard’s argument that you can treat even the most mundane activities as opportunities to practice mastery. What part of your life could this apply to? (For instance, making your bed or getting ready for work.)

Next, recall that Leonard recommends you begin practicing as a master would—from a relaxed state of mind and body. List a few things you could do to get into that state before you begin your task?

Having found the appropriate state to begin from, immerse yourself in the task at hand. As you perform this activity, what steps could you take to focus on the nuances of the task rather than the end result? For example, if you’re making your bed, you might pay close attention to the textures of the bed linens or concentrate on the quality and precision of your hospital corners.

Now that you’ve practiced a simple activity as a master would, reflect on what you experienced. Briefly, what did this practice clarify for you about how a master approaches his skill and his life at large?
