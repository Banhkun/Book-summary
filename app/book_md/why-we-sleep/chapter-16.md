## Chapter 16: Improving Sleep in Society

We’ve seen chronic sleep deprivation caused by a variety of factors, from the individual scaling up to the societal. Walker finishes with ways to improve sleep quality systemically:

#### Individual

  * Automated “internet of things” household that can automatically sense your circadian rhythm and personalize the temperature and lighting to maximize sleep. Furthermore, if you have an upcoming disruption to your sleep schedule (like a flight), it can adjust your circadian rhythm to smoothen the transition. (Shortform note: There are many gadgets in the market that claim to address various sleep issues from snoring to temperature, like a cooling pillow pad that helps those who suffer from night sweats and hot flashes.)
  * Sophisticated body trackers that record a host of factors—sleep, physical activity, light exposure, temperature, heart rate, mood, happiness, social performance, productivity—and shows how your sleep correlates with better performance on all dimensions. (Shortform note: Tools like this are now within your reach. Smartwatches can track sleep, activity, heart rate, water intake, and more, while some apps can help you track less quantifiable aspects like mood, habits, and goals.) 
  * Cars that sense sleepy driving through facial recognition and driving behavior. The car can shut down in dangerous situations. Walker suggests that drivers with good sleep habits ought to get lower insurance rates. (Shortform note: Self-driving cars have an autopilot feature, which can steer, accelerate, and brake automatically, but the feature still needs driver supervision. The autopilot can sense when a driver has fallen asleep, eventually slowing down and stopping, but this process can take as long as 60 seconds.)



#### Educational

  * Walker argues that sleep should be a mandatory subject in physical education (like drugs and diet).
  * Have predictive tools that show the costs to health and income if you continue your poor sleep habits.
  * Instruct the populace on sleepy driving as much as drunk driving.



(Shortform note: In _Switch_ , the authors cite an example of how the general public learned about the concept of designated drivers: A Harvard professor got more than 160 TV programs to work the topic into their shows—as part of the script or as a poster in the background, for example. Within three years, 90% of Americans knew about designated driving, and there was also a decrease in alcohol-related crashes. A similar tactic might make the public more aware of drowsy driving.)

#### Organizational

  * Companies should be more flexible about work hours, allow naps, and de-emphasize hours worked in favor of real productivity. (Shortform note: While a flexible work arrangement leads to happier and more productive employees, some people are still hesitant to make use of it, fearing a negative consequence on their careers. It’s thus important for companies who offer flexibility to also address this stigma.) 
  * Employers and insurance companies can incentivize sleep. For example, for a certain number of days of over seven hours of sleep (as tracked by a sleep monitor), an employee might get extra vacation days, more pay, or reductions in health insurance premiums. (Shortform note: A Japanese company awards points to employees who get a minimum of six hours of sleep a night, at least five days a week. Employees can then use the points to redeem food from the company’s cafeteria.)
  * Hospitals should promote sleep hygiene for patients, especially in the ICU and NICU—better sleep is shown to reduce sensitivity to pain, and increase weight gain and O2 sat levels in neonates. Walker suggests changing the harsh white lighting, dispensing earplugs and eye masks, reducing alarms and beeps, and scheduling lab tests to align better with patient sleep schedules. (Shortform note: One study notes other nonpharmacological ways to improve sleep quality in the ICU, such as massages, foot baths, and music.)



(Shortform note: The sleep landscape continues to change with technological advancements that we can use to improve our sleep. In 2021, the FDA approved SleepCogni for medical use. Clinical trials have shown that SleepCogni, a data-supported device, can reduce insomnia in just seven days. In the hospitality industry, where sleep is an essential part of a hotel guest’s stay, a scientist predicts some ways in which the experience of sleep will change. These include bed covers and sheets made of high-tech fabrics that have thermal regulation and aromatherapy capabilities, and pillows that can detect sleep activity, massage the head and neck, and produce soothing sounds to encourage sleep.)
