## Chapter 14: How to Get Better Sleep

Now that you know how sleep works and are more aware of the main sleep disruptors, you can implement practices to help you improve your sleep. Walker suggests the following actions:

  * Keep the same waking and sleeping time each day. Erratic sleep schedules disrupt sleep quality.
  * Practice sleep hygiene—lower bedroom temperature, reduce noise, reduce light.
  * No alcohol, caffeine, exercise, or long naps before sleep.
  * Get some exercise, which may increase total sleep time and increase quality of sleep. Exercising has more of a chronic effect, meaning it helps in the long run and doesn’t take effect on a day-to-day scale—exercise on one day doesn’t necessarily lead to better sleep that night. But worse sleep on one night does lead to worse exercise the following day.
  * Eat a normal diet (not severe caloric restriction of below 800 calories per day). Avoid very high carb diets (>70% of calories) since this decreases NREM and increases awakenings.



(Shortform note: In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear writes that your environment shapes your behavior. You can thus form better habits by making sure that every object or space is only associated with one context; otherwise, your brain will have to decide between different actions associated with that environment. This means using your bed only for sleep—and not for other things like working on your laptop, watching TV, or scrolling through social media—will help create an association in your brain and you’ll naturally learn to become sleepy when you get in bed.)

### Sleeping Pills Are Bad

Sleeping pills are typically sedatives that put the body into a state that doesn’t fully resemble sleep (similar to alcohol). Sleep looks different electrophysiologically—you don’t get the deepest brain waves, meaning you don’t get enough restorative deep sleep.

According to Walker, sleeping pills are no better than placebo when it’s time to fall asleep (even though self-reported satisfaction is higher). The lower quality of sleep causes daytime sleepiness.

Additionally, sleeping pills can kick off a heavily medicated vicious cycle:

  * Poor sleep practices or stress reduces sleep.
  * Taking sleeping pills causes next-day drowsiness.
  * Caffeine use and naps reduce drowsiness, but also reduce ability to sleep at night, causing more sleeping pill usage.
  * Tolerance of sleeping pills causes withdrawal insomnia when stopped, thus maintaining the habit.



Walker cites population studies that show that sleeping pills increase mortality in a dose-dependent way. Suggestive causes:

  * Increased risk of car accidents—possibly from grogginess, a side effect of some sleeping pills
  * Increased risk of cancer—though there is only evidence of correlation, not causation, between pill use and cancer.
  * Increased infection risk (especially prevalent in elderly subjects)—pill-induced sleep may not provide the immunity benefits of natural sleep.



(Shortform note: We can’t rule out that upstream circumstances that disrupt sleeping and thus make people take sleeping pills are also causing all these other disease risks.)

> **Natural Alternatives to Sleeping Pills**
> 
> Some people forgo sleeping pills in favor of a more natural remedy, like adaptogens—substances made of herbs and roots used in traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic treatments. They purportedly help regulate hormones and the body’s response to stress. Due to their stress-management properties, adaptogens may also help improve sleep. A review found that the following adaptogens may be the most effective sleep aids:
> 
>   * American ginseng
> 
>   * Ashwagandha
> 
>   * Magnolia berry
> 
>   * Jiaogulan
> 
>   * Rhodiola rosea
> 
> 

> 
> There’s little evidence that adaptogens can cause side effects like those that come from sleeping pills, but be cautious if you’re allergic to or intolerant of certain plants. Also talk to your doctor before trying adaptogenic supplements to rule out contraindications.

### CBT for Insomnia

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common non-pharmacological method for changing behavior, shown to be more effective than sleeping pills. Walker explains that it’s commonly applied to depression, but there are variants for insomnia.

A big part of alleviating insomnia is redeveloping confidence around the ability to sleep. Thus, some practices force insomniacs to restrict their time in bed, maybe even to six hours or less. This builds up stronger sleep pressure, and so patients fall asleep faster and regain psychological confidence.

(Shortform note: According to _Cognitive Behavior Therapy: Basics and Beyond_ , CBT begins with recognizing dysfunctional thoughts that negatively affect behavior. In the case of insomnia patients, these may be thoughts like, “I won’t be able to sleep,” which then keeps them from falling asleep. CBT for insomnia takes around six to eight sessions and may include cognitive and psychoeducational interventions to help patients reframe their thoughts about sleep, as well as a behavioral component like helping them improve sleep hygiene.)

### Other Prescriptions for Sleep Issues

Walker mentions several other prescriptions that CBT therapists give their patients with sleep issues:

  * Don’t have a clock nearby or you’ll watch the clock and become anxious that you’re not falling asleep.
  * If unable to sleep, get out of bed and go back when sleepy. Don’t lie in bed awake.
  * Go to bed only when you’re sleepy. 
  * Avoid daytime napping.
  * Reduce anxiety-provoking thoughts before bed.



> **More Tips to Help You Sleep**
> 
> In _The Sleep Revolution: Transforming Your Life, One Night at a Time_ , Arianna Huffington devotes a chapter to sleep tips, tools, and techniques. While there are many overlaps with _While We Sleep_(such as limiting blue light, avoiding alcohol, and getting the temperature right), she offers some additional tips that Walker doesn’t mention:
> 
>   * **Try acupuncture.** According to a study, this centuries-old practice had a positive effect on 93% of insomnia patients.
> 
>   * **Sip (or sniff) some lavender.** Studies suggest that the herb has a relaxing effect, which can set the stage for a good night’s sleep. Huffington writes that in Germany, lavender tea is an approved treatment for insomnia. You can also try spritzing some lavender onto your pajamas or sheets.
> 
>   * **Empty your mind.** To help you reduce anxiety-producing thoughts, try doing a “mind dump” before bed: Write down your to-do list for the next day so that your thoughts won’t keep you up at night.
