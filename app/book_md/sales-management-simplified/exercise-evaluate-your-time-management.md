## Exercise: Evaluate Your Time Management

To Weinberg, the most important thing a sales manager can do is use their time wisely. Consider how you currently manage your time and how you might focus more time on high-impact activities.

* * *

Weinberg argues that managers should spend most of their time focusing on important tasks such as coaching team members, tweaking their sales strategy, or holding team meetings. How much time do you currently spend each week on such tasks? (If you’re uncertain, give a rough estimate.)

Next, write down how many total hours you work each week (on average), and calculate the proportion of that time spent on high-impact tasks (as estimated above). What did you discover about how much time you devote to low-impact vs high-impact tasks? Were you surprised by the results? Explain your answer.

If you think you’re not spending enough time on high-impact activities, brainstorm three or four low-impact activities (for instance, routine administrative tasks or “work socials”) that you might cut or delegate to make time for your more important work.

Weinberg believes that time blocking can be a valuable tool in preventing others from assigning you low-impact tasks. Below, create a rough time-blocked plan for one day’s work: Write down which high-impact task you’ll focus on each hour. (Your blocks can be longer or shorter than an hour if you need them to be.)
