## Exercise: Identifying Your Temperament

It’s useful to know what your default temperament is so that you can appreciate it or work against it when necessary. Use this exercise to explore your default mood and how it affects your life.

* * *

Reviewing the four basic temperaments (timid, bold, upbeat, melancholy), which one would you say you fall into?

As we know, no emotion is wrong--so all 4 moods have benefits. What’s one benefit you receive from this default temperament? For example, melancholy might seem like a negative temperament--but being attuned to sad things in life might mean you process them more readily than others.

And all 4 moods come with tendencies you might like to change. What’s one aspect of this temperament you could afford to improve on? For example, if you’re a bold person, you might seek out new things--but perhaps sometimes you ignore valid warning signs in pursuit of something exciting.
