## Conclusion

The issues discussed here are not simple issues and can’t be written off as having a single source that causes them. They’re complex, stemming from biological characteristics, family status, parental nurturing, class, location, and many other factors. **Emotional intelligence won’t solve all these problems by itself--but alongside other solutions, emotional intelligence is a necessary component and should be more widely taught.**

Research psychologists also can’t make the change on their own: **we need better emotional intelligence training in our school systems, our homes, and our hospitals.** Information isn’t enough. Handing out a pamphlet on emotional intelligence won’t help anyone solve their emotional issues. **Practice and dedication are the only way to learn these skills.**

Learning emotional intelligence can of course help us improve later in our lives, since emotional learning is lifelong learning. **But many of our major societal problems could be positively offset by training children in emotional intelligence early in their lives, so that they have the skills they need to be resilient and bounce back later in life.**

  * Schools experienced the best results when they put long-term programming into place at different ages corresponding to the issues those ages face the most, and enlisted parents to reinforce the lessons at home through discussion and practice.



No one realm can do it alone. **The more all parts of our society work in tandem, the better the results will be.** Imagine what the world would look like if every individual worked on their own emotional intelligence, and couples practice emotional intelligence between themselves, and parents raised their kids with emotional intelligence, and workplaces made it a priority, and schools taught it in their classrooms, and hospitals practiced it in their halls.
