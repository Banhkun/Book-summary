## Chapter 6-1: Applying Emotional Intelligence in Love

Freud said, “To love and to work are the twin capacities that mark full maturity.” Goleman would most likely add “to learn” and “to take care of yourself and others” to that list, and **emotional intelligence is the key to loving, working, learning, and taking care of yourself and others to the best of your abilities.**

We’ll go through each of these categories—love (romantic and familial), work, school, and health—exploring their difficulties and some ways emotional intelligence can help overcome those difficulties. Similar to the last chapters, these chapters will be numbered 6-1, 6-2, and so on to denote their relationship to the major subject of using emotional intelligence.

* * *

Since social pressures are no longer the main catalyst for marriage, much more importance is placed on the emotional bond between two people. The current trend in divorce rates suggests we need a little more emotional intelligence in our marriages.

  * In 1890, about 10% of all American marriages ended in divorce. In 1920, the rate went up to 20%. It went up to 30% in 1950, and 50% in 1970. By 1990, it shot up to 67%.



**One primary factor in the dissolution of marriage is differing expectations, and it all starts with how we raise children to approach emotions based on their sex.**

### Differing Expectations

In couples experiencing marital distress, typically the woman wants to engage with her husband, and the man routinely withdraws from his wife. This stems from the two different emotional realities in a heterosexual couple, his and hers.

#### Learning to Be or Not to Be Emotional

Emotional differences may be partially biological, but they are undeniably social. **Boys and girls are taught different lessons about how to handle their emotions.**

  * Generally, **parents discuss emotions more with daughters than sons, excepting anger.** Parents display a wider array of emotions to daughters. When parents make up stories for preschool-aged children, they typically use more emotion words for daughters than sons. Mothers discuss emotions with daughters, and discuss them in greater detail than with sons.
  * **Girls are also typically faster to develop language skills than boys** , which gives them more experience articulating their feelings and using words instead of physical methods of resolving conflicts or communicating feelings.
  * **Boys are not encouraged to verbalize their feelings, and they’re not usually taught how** —this can cause them to develop a blindness to their own emotional states and others’.
  * **Sons are more likely to receive detailed stories and instructions on anger.** This is perhaps because boys and girls drift into different ways of handling anger at the onset of puberty.
    * At 10, approximately the same percentage of boys and girls are described as overtly aggressive and prone to open confrontation. By 13, girls have learned to use different tactics to express anger, tactics like gossiping, ostracizing, and indirect confrontation. Boys at the same age still deal with anger through open confrontation. 



**And there are differences in how girls and boys form relationships with others, even in childhood.**

  * Girls typically play together in small groups, emphasizing minimal hostility and maximum cooperation. Boys generally play in larger groups, emphasizing competition.
  * If a girl gets hurt while playing a game, the game ceases and all the other girls convene around the injured girl and try to help. If a boy gets hurt during a game, he’s expected to remove himself and let the game continue.
  * Girls consider themselves a part of a group, and feel threatened by any rift in their relationships; boys are encouraged to be autonomous, strong-minded individuals—loners who sometimes hang out with other loners—and are threatened by any challenge to that autonomy.



#### When the Kids Grow Up

These lessons result in different expectations and abilities in adulthood:

  * **Women seek emotional connection in conversation, while men prefer to talk about “things.”** In one study, the most important thing for a woman’s marriage satisfaction was good communication between her and her husband.
  * Women are better at picking up verbal and nonverbal cues, and at expressing and articulating their feelings. Men are adept at minimizing “weak” emotions such as hurt, fear, guilt, or vulnerability.
  * In terms of marriage, this means **women come prepared to be the “emotional managers,” while men lack an understanding of how fundamental emotions are to the survival of a relationship.**



One researcher found that in the dating phase men are much more likely to participate in the emotionally connected talking that women crave—but as the relationship goes on, men spend less time talking this way and want to connect through activities.

Because men have less capability with registering and interpreting others’ emotional cues, husbands don’t notice their wives’ emotional states until they’re more intense—a woman has to be that much sadder to get her husband to notice, let alone ask what’s making her sad. Women, as the emotional manager of a relationship, can get burnt out not only by trying to manage their male partner’s emotions, but by having to manage their own stronger and more neglect emotions by themselves.

Ironically, because men generally have a more shallow understanding of emotions, husbands also generally see their relationships in a rosier hue than their wives—everything from sex to family relationships to finances seem on average better to men than to women. Women generally complain more vocally about their marriage than men, especially in less satisfied couples. This is precisely because they are trying to work out emotional issues and resolve grievances in their role as emotional manager.

### Expressing Complaints

Marital success isn’t determined by how often a couple sleeps together, or opinions on how to raise children, or how each person handles finances—it’s determined by the skill with which a couple discusses disagreements in those categories. **Agreeing on how to disagree is the key to a successful marriage.**

#### Criticism and Contempt

John Gottman, one of the foremost American scholars on marriage, found that **harsh criticism is an early warning sign of a marriage in danger**. When either party complains in a destructive manner, such as personal attacks on their spouse’s character, it’s a telltale sign that all is not well.

  * **In a healthy marriage, both parties are comfortable expressing complaints about _actions_ the other person has taken. They identify the action and describe how it made them feel.** “When you forgot to put gas in my car, it made me feel like you didn’t care about me.” They try to view a partner’s mistake as one made due to circumstances that can be changed—an action separate from their personhood.
  * **In an unhealthy marriage, one or both parties attack the personhood of the other, not the actions they take.** The turn single actions into black and white statements on the other person’s character. “You forgot to put gas in my car. You always do that, you’re so selfish, you don’t care about anyone but yourself. Why do I ask you to do anything at all?” This makes the other person feel like _they’re the problem_ , not that they made a mistake.



**Repeated incidents of anger in a marriage often lead to contempt, which is one of the most detrimental feelings that can enter into a marriage.**

  * In one of Gottman’s studies, if one spouse exhibited a facial expression of contempt, the other spouse’s heart rate immediately increased. 
  * Continual contempt takes different tolls depending on who shows it:
    * When husbands frequently show contempt, their wives are more likely to experience health problems -- they’re prone to more frequent colds and flus, bladder and yeast infections, and gastrointestinal distress.
    * When wives frequently show contempt, the marriage is likely to end within 4 years.



Criticism and contempt reflect that one spouse has made a negative mental judgment about their partner. The contemptuous spouse attacks, which causes their partner to become defensive or counterattack.

**One defining factor of the toxic thoughts that lead to repeated displays of contempt is that they are absolutes: when a mistake is made, it isn’t merely a mistake that can be corrected next time, it’s proof that the person is horrible and that things won’t change.** These toxic thoughts are often reflections of the spouse’s deepest emotional attitudes, and they are self-confirming and non-negotiable. Someone functioning in this way reads negative intent into every action their partner takes.

  * For example, husbands who physically abuse their wives interpret even their wives’ most neutral actions as hostile, and use this misinterpretation to justify their violence.



#### Stonewalling and Flooding

The fight or flight response comes into play when partners attack each other: the attacked partner can choose to either fight the criticisms, usually leading to a shouting match, or they can choose to flee the emotional situation, retreat emotionally, and respond with a stony, silent withdrawal. This withdrawal is called _stonewalling_. On the other end of the spectrum is _flooding_ , which is an emotional hijacking of the brain.

In Gottman’s research, **stonewalling showed up in marriages that were headed towards failure**. Where yelling might be an indicator that both parties care about something and are trying to work it out between them, stonewalling is a sign that there’s less chance of working out differences or disagreements, since one party refuses to participate emotionally at all. 85% of the time stonewalling showed up in a relationship, it was husbands and not wives who used stonewalling as a response to criticism.

**Contempt, accusations, and toxic thoughts create a constant state of crisis in a relationship** , routinely triggering emotional hijacks and making it more difficult to bounce back from these negative emotional states. Gottman uses the term _flooding_ for this state of affairs.

  * Someone in a flooded state is overwhelmed by negativity. They feel swamped by volatile feelings outside of their control. They regress to more primitive reactions, and can’t take in information or organize their own thoughts effectively. The more a person is flooded, the harder it becomes to resurface.
  * First, the heart rate increases, then hormones such as adrenaline flood the brain, then muscles tense, and a sea of toxic thoughts comes crashing down on the flooded person.



Men react to spousal criticism with flooding more often than women, and enter into a flooded state at lower levels of negativity than women. Men also release more adrenaline into their bloodstream when flooded, meaning it takes them longer to recover from flooding.**** This is why men are more likely to stonewall their wives: to avoid flooding.

  * However, upon being stonewalled by their husbands, wives’ heart rate will shoot up, and they become flooded. 



Perhaps because women are generally more comfortable with emotions, they also on average will get into a marital argument more readily than men will. One study found that **women didn’t mind getting upset during a disagreement, where men were uniformly averse to it.**

  * Wives seek out confrontation to achieve emotional connection, which is why stonewalling sends them into a flooded state. But men avoid confrontation to avoid emotional distress, which is why criticism activates their flooded state. This can turn into a vicious cycle.



### Improving Your Relationship

Broadly speaking, men and women need different advice to help improve their marriages.

**For men:**

  * **Try not to avoid conflict.** When issues are left unacknowledged, the emotions around them intensify, the pressure builds, and the situation could explode. 
  * Remind yourself that **if your wife brings up a complaint or disagreement, it might be her way of trying to improve the relationship** —it might be an act of love. Anger or discontent with one of your actions is not necessarily a personal attack, it just means your wife has strong feelings about the issue. 
  * And if you do enter into a disagreement, **be wary of offering up a solution too soon.** Women, in general, are looking for their feelings to be heard and understood first—if you jump into a solution too soon, it suggests that her feelings don’t matter and aren’t important.



**For women:**

  * **Avoid criticizing your husband’s character.** You can raise issues with an action they took or something they did, but don’t turn it into a black or white statement on their personhood. Identify the action and why it’s emotionally distressing to you, and it helps to **put any complaints into a larger context of love for your husband and desire to improve the relationship.**



Goleman offers some great general advice for couples looking to improve their relationship in the way they handle disagreements:

**Stick to one topic.** Sometimes, arguments about one thing turn into screaming matches about all the wrongs anyone has ever committed. Keep the discussion focused—this will help avoid personal attacks and resolve concrete issues.

**Use the XYZ formula.** X is the action, Y is how it made you feel, Z is what you’d prefer they did next time. “When you forgot to put gas in my car, it made me feel like you didn’t care about me. Next time you could do it first thing when you take my car, or at least let me know before I get home that you forgot.”

**Give each person a chance to explain their perspective at the forefront.** This will help resolve any fundamental misunderstandings right away before the argument has a chance to take hold. At the very least, it will give each person a chance to understand the other person’s point of view, which will make it more productive to continue discussing the issue.

**Show your partner you’re listening.** Most people in the throes of any emotional distress just want to be heard and understood. Empathy is an excellent reducer of tension. You can repeat the other person’s feelings back to them in your own words to confirm you understand them correctly. If you’ve misunderstood their feelings, you can try again until you get it right.

**Learn how to soothe yourself first.** If you can learn how to handle your own emotional hijackings and recover from them quickly, you’ll be able to listen to and handle your partner’s emotional hijackings with more ease. Remember, the stronger our own emotions, the less we can hear, understand, or care about someone else’s. It’s crucial to be able to calm yourself down first.

**Challenge toxic thoughts.__** When we’re upset, it’s easy to get swept away by those black and white absolutes that keep us angry—”he doesn’t care about anyone else but himself, he’s always so selfish”. If you find yourself thinking these thoughts, try challenging them directly -- for example, intentionally remind yourself of all the thoughtful things he’s done for you. This can help balance your emotional response and bring your focus back to the _action_ that’s upset you, instead of being upset at the _person_.

**Try not to get defensive.** When we feel attacked, we go on the defensive. In arguments, this often looks like making excuses, refusing to take responsibility, or attacking with our own criticisms. If you find yourself getting defensive, remind yourself that what feels like an attack to you is really just your partner having strong feelings about this issue—they want you to pay attention to it, though they may not be asking for that in the healthiest way.

**Validate your partner.** Articulate to your partner that you can see things from their point of view and that their perspective is valid—even if you don’t agree with it yourself. You can even simply acknowledge their emotions if you don’t necessarily agree with their argument: “I see I hurt your feelings.”

**Take responsibility or apologize if you’re in the wrong**. If you have the self-awareness to admit that you did do something wrong, admit it to your partner. A simple and honest apology can go a long way to smoothing over the worst disputes.

**Agree on a time-out.** If nothing else, both partners should be able to call a time-out and cool off if they need to, but this needs to be discussed when emotions aren’t high so it can be used in times of need. Agree on a phrase or method of calling the time-out that both partners will recognize, and then actually use the cooling off time to cool off. Refer back to the previous chapter to find tips for cooling off.

**Couples who can increase their shared emotional intelligence will have a more successful marriage.** Again, specific issues may be the things that get our emotions going, but it’s how we approach solving those issues together that will make or break the relationship. It’s not easy to change destructive emotional habits or improve on the pillars of emotional intelligence—it takes time and work. Our ability to make changes runs directly in proportion to our motivation to try. **To improve these things, you and your partner need to practice them in moments when you _aren’t fighting_.** Without practice, you won’t be able to call on these tools in the heat of the moment. Rehearse them with each other in small, day-to-day moments.
