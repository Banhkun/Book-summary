## Chapter 5-2: Managing Anger, Anxiety and Sadness

**Once we are aware of our emotional responses as we’re having them, we can start to regulate them** , working past emotions when they’re not appropriate to the situation, soothing ourselves when we’re experiencing negative emotions, and bouncing back quickly from setbacks. People who cannot manage their emotions expend a lot of energy fighting their emotional reactions.

**There are 3 main emotions that are difficult to manage: anger, anxiety, and sadness.**

Here are general rules for managing any negative emotion:

  1. **Don’t dwell on the emotion and keep mulling it over.** Ruminating on an emotion doesn’t manage it—it actually extends the emotional reaction and can even increase the emotional distress.
  2. Self-awareness helps you **catch a negative emotional response early** and identify it correctly.
  3. Most negative emotional responses are built on thoughts or assumptions that confirm the response—so you can manage almost any negative emotional response by **challenging the thoughts and assumptions** that made you feel it in the first place.



.

### Anger

#### What It Is

**We get angry when we feel attacked**. It could be someone actively threatening our physical safety, dangerously cutting us off on the road, insulting us with words, or it could be something frustrating us in our pursuit of a goal. All these are perceived forms of attack, and anger is our brain preparing us to fight.

We’re also more prone to get angry when we’re more stressed. It’s much easier to shrug things off when your day is going well; if your day is going poorly, little things that might not even get to you on a good day can easily set off your temper.

#### How Not to Manage Anger

The quickest way to continue feeling angry is to dwell on what’s making you angry. The longer we think about our anger, the more our brain comes up with self-justifications and good reasons that we should feel angry. Anger builds on anger.

Say someone dangerously cuts you off while driving and you get angry. “What was that person thinking? They could have killed me. What would happen to my kids if I died? That person could have ruined my life and the lives of the people I care about! And for what? Probably for nothing. Where they’re going isn’t important enough to kill people for it. Jeez, no one pays attention to anyone but themselves anymore…”

Every subsequent angry thought after the initial one fans the flames, keeping you angry and sometimes even increasing how angry you are.

#### How to Manage Anger

The quickest way to undermine anger is to **undermine the assumptions that are making you angry** in the first place, usually by reframing the situation in a more positive light.

  * For example, someone cuts you off in your car: the anger-inducing assumption might be that that person cares more about where they’re going than your safety, or that they chose you specifically to cut off, or even that they’re trying to anger you. You could try reframing your assumptions to curb your anger: maybe they didn’t see you, maybe there’s an emergency and they need to get somewhere.



**Another way to manage anger is to physically cool off.** This is particularly useful in arguments: if you find yourself getting too angry with someone, get away from them to let your brain calm itself down before you do or say something you’ll regret. Removing yourself from the source of anger lets your body and brain wait out the surge of adrenaline that hits us when we get angry without having the target of the anger there in front of you.

  * **Active exercise** helps release anger. Go for a long walk, a run, or a hike.
  * **Relaxation techniques** like deep breathing and muscle relaxation help the body transition from the high arousal state of anger into a low arousal state.
  * **Distract yourself,** as long as the distraction is pleasant (Shortform note: There are examples of pleasant distractions in last section on sadness).



You could also try **writing down cynical, hostile, or angry thoughts as they arise**. This will help increase your self-awareness and give you an opportunity to challenge those thoughts, thus decreasing the anger. Once you’ve written them down, you’re forced to look at them and assess them, and you have a better chance of reappraising the situation—but only if it’s in the earlier stages of anger. If you’re in a fit of rage, an exercise like this will probably fan the flames.

#### Managing Angry People

Someone at the peak of their rage is the most difficult person to manage. Data suggests a strategy to deal with someone in a fit of rage:

  * Distract them.
  * Empathize with their emotions and viewpoint.
  * Draw them into a different, more positive focus.



> Example: On a train one night, a drunk man started yelling at everyone, threatening them, and trying to destroy parts of the train car. Nothing seemed to work to stop him until an old man distracted him by greeting him as a friend and asking what he had to drink. The man had sake, and the old man talked about how much he and his wife love sake and how they drink it every night in their garden. Then the drunk man broke down: his wife had died recently, and he’d lost his job and his home because of his grief. Goleman calls this an act of emotional brilliance on the part of the old man.

### Anxiety

#### What It is

**Anxiety is a form of worrying, a kind of rehearsal of what could go wrong and potential ways we might deal with it.**

**The goal of worrying is to come up with solutions by anticipating danger before it occurs.** Too often it turns into a chronic, repetitive thought process, one that goes on and on but never actually gets to a positive solution because it keeps picking up new worries.

Chronic anxiety is an emotional hijacking beyond our control: worries seem to come from nowhere or be inspired by nothing, they’re impervious to reason, and cause the worrier to fixate on one or many anxiety-inducing topics.

There are generally two forms of anxiety:

  * **Cognitive anxiety is worrisome thoughts,** usually triggered by language.
  * **Somatic anxiety is physiological symptoms of anxiety,** triggered by images.



For example, insomniacs usually suffer from cognitive anxiety and not somatic anxiety, whereas those who have panic attacks usually suffer from somatic anxiety.

There are three different types of chronic anxiety:

  * Fear-based anxiety fixates on a triggering situation.
  * Obsession-based anxiety fixates on preventing a specific situation.
  * Panic attacks usually fixate on a fear of dying or on the panic attack itself.



#### How Not to Manage Anxiety

**Worry, when allowed to continue, almost always blows itself out of proportion.** In one study, participants were asked to intentionally worry for one minute out loud. Within just a few seconds, the worries had spiralled out into epic statements like “I’ll never be happy.”

Worry could easily be controlled by shifting your attention away from the worries. However, **the rational brain actually gets in the way here, and makes it harder to stop worrying** : we _could_ get a payoff from worrying by coming up with potential solutions to problems, and that would be a good thing. But anxiety actually doesn’t usually come up with positive solutions.

Because worrying is negative, it doesn’t function like a creative breakthrough, viewing the problem from different angles, thinking laterally to come up with new solutions, or feeling energized at the prospect of solving the problem. Instead, it’s a form of rigid thought that deals in generalities and follows a fixed, linear path—this is why anxiety rarely leads to a useful solution and usually turns into a rut.

#### How to Manage Anxiety

**Relaxation methods work** to physically calm the body and take the mind off the worrisome thoughts -- but it’s best to practice relaxation methods daily, during totally normal moments, so at the time of crisis you can actually use the relaxation methods.

But relaxation isn’t usually enough—anxiety needs to be actively challenged. **Here’s a list of questions you can ask to actively challenge anxious thoughts:**

  * Is the dreaded event probable?
  * Is there really only one way this situation can play out? Are there no alternatives?
  * What constructive steps can I take to deal with this problem?
  * Does it actually help to go through these thoughts over and over again?



### Sadness

#### What It Is

We experience sadness when we feel lonely or when we’ve lost something or someone that’s important to us. For example, even if you feel sad when you see a happy couple because you’ve never been in a relationship, you’re still mourning the perceived loss or lack of something you feel is important: companionship.

#### How Not to Manage Sadness

**People are most inventive when trying to change feelings of sadness, and it’s generally the mood people put the most energy into changing.** But, of course, a lot of our coping methods don’t actually positively deal with the sadness, they negatively reinforce it.

Isolating ourselves when we feel sad actually usually doesn’t make us feel better. It adds to our feelings of loneliness and distance.

A lot of us fixate on the sadness to try to figure out what’s wrong or to understand ourselves better. But this is rumination, which, as we already know, **actually increases and prolongs the feelings we’re ruminating on**. It’s useful to analyze your sadness if it actually leads to concrete actions or insights that will result in positive change—but if you find yourself passively ruminating on why you’re so sad, you’re probably just reinforcing how sad you are.

  * We usually end up _worrying_ about some aspect of our sadness -- how little we’re getting done because of it, or how tired we are, or how unmotivated we feel. This usually doesn’t come with any actionable improvements.
  * Women are more likely to ruminate when they’re depressed than men, which might account for the higher rate of depression in women—women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression than men. But this may also be attributed to the fact that women are generally more open to admitting their distress (men may be more likely to deal with their depression through alcohol -- they’re about twice as likely to be alcoholics).
  * Many people think “having a good cry” is an easy way to exorcize sadness, but again, it depends on the kind of crying: some cry sessions can break the feelings of sadness, but often, crying about something means we’re thinking about it, and the longer and harder we cry, the more we’re thinking about it—this is ruminating in the form of crying.



#### How to Manage Sadness

**Here are 2 methods of combating sadness or rumination on sadness:**

1) **Intentionally schedule pleasant distractions.**

Sad thoughts are automatic and often enter our minds unbidden. So scheduling pleasant distractions actively breaks up these automatic thoughts and prevents them from intruding.

It’s important that the distractions actually be pleasant. In one study, depressed people were given a list of distractions and asked to choose one, and they ended up choosing the more depressing distractions.

Here are some good distractions, as long as they’re pleasant:

  * Read, watch TV or movies, or play video games that result in positive feelings.
  * Do puzzles.
  * Take a nap.
  * Let yourself daydream! Plan a fantasy vacation. Where would you go? For how long? What would you do?
  * Watch an exciting sporting event.
  * Get yourself a treat or indulge in some sensual pleasures: aromatherapy, a massage, a hot bath, good music, or even sex.
  * Help other people.
  * Pray to a higher power or practice gratitude.
  * Exercise is also useful for sadness. It releases endorphins and changes your physical state in the opposite way of anger: when angry, you’re in a high arousal state and exercise can put you into a low arousal state once you finish—but when you’re sad, you’re in a low arousal state already, and the goal is to get you into a higher arousal state, which exercise does.



There are some commonly used distractions that have pitfalls, and might be worse for you in the long run. Exercise these with caution.

  * Eating is one method people use to deal with sadness, and this can spin out of control: most eating disorders originate as an attempt to deal with feelings by controlling or indulging in food.
  * Alcohol and drug dependencies also usually emerge as coping methods for negative feelings, so this is also a dangerous distraction or indulgence to get your mind off feeling sad, and should be used with caution.



**2)** **Engineer a small, easy success or triumph.** This will boost your mood and give you something positive to focus on.

  * Pick a chore you’ve been meaning to do or some other errand or task.
  * Get dressed up or put on makeup.
  * Volunteer or help others in need. In one study, this was one of the most powerful mood changers, but also the rarest.



### Repressing Emotions

Repressors are people who repress their emotions routinely and automatically erase emotional disturbances from their minds and their awareness.

This can be positive or negative. When it’s positive, it might be more appropriate to call these people **_unflappables_**. They’re actually deft experts at handling their own emotions, capable of pushing emotional responses out of their brains without much struggle and going on about their business. They’ve gotten so good at it, in fact, that they aren’t even aware of their negative feelings. They’ve silenced them completely.

Of course, on the negative side, **this can also mean the person is completely out of touch with their emotions** , still experiencing primarily physiological symptoms of emotions but being totally oblivious to the emotional cause of these symptoms.

  * This can often be the result of surviving a troubling situation early in life, such as having an alcoholic parent or suffering abuse. Parents who are repressors in this negative way also pass it on to their children as the appropriate way to deal with emotions, whether through nature in their DNA or through nurture in the family dynamic.



Neurologically, people who are genuine repressors are not feigning this obliviousness to emotional strife: their brains are essentially keeping this emotional information from them. People who exhibit repeated emotional repression have been found to have more brain activity in their left prefrontal lobe than their right—the left prefrontal lobe is the center of good feelings, while the right is the center for negative feelings.
