## Exercise: Focus on What You Want

According to Murphy, when you focus only on what you want to experience, you give your subconscious mind clear instructions to follow. In this exercise, we’ll determine what you want and how you can focus on it.

* * *

What one thing that you want would immediately improve your life experience and make you happy? For example, your life might improve drastically if you find a satisfying job that pays well.

What are your current thoughts about this thing? Do you expect it to happen or do you have doubts?

What specific thoughts do you think will help your subconscious mind to create this experience? For example, it might be thoughts that encourage confidence in your abilities and the value you have to offer.

What single word could you repeat to remind yourself to have positive expectations about this experience? For example, you could repeat the words “success” or “satisfaction” when you think about the job that you want.
