## Part 2: Negative Thoughts Create Failure and Disease

In the first part of this guide, we explored how your subconscious mind learns from your habitual conscious thoughts to influence your behavior. We also explored Murphy’s belief that you’re _designed to be happy_ because your subconscious mind has a connection to Universal Consciousness—the benevolent force that created and continues to manage the universe.

According to Murphy, life is very simple: You’re supposed to be healthy and happy because you’re connected to a powerful and positive force of energy. But, life isn’t that simple for most of us: We don’t always get what we want and, sometimes, happiness and bliss can seem like far-off dreams.

Therefore, in this second part of the guide, we’ll explore the reason why life isn’t always as easy and perfect as Murphy claims it should be. We’ll explain how the interaction between your subconscious mind with _both_ your conscious mind and Universal Consciousness can either _work with_ the positive flow of Universal Consciousness or _against_ it to create your life experiences.

### Your Negative Thoughts Block the Flow of Universal Consciousness

According to Murphy, the impressions your conscious thoughts leave on your subconscious mind influence the way it interacts with the positive flow of Universal Consciousness. If you’re not entirely happy with your life experiences, it’s because you're thinking **“false” negative thoughts** that contradict the positive force of Universal Consciousness. Let’s explore this idea in detail.

#### Why Your Negative Thoughts Are “False”

Recall: Murphy believes that, because you’re connected to Universal Consciousness, _you’re designed_ to think thoughts and live in a way that aligns with this positive force. Consequently, **your natural state is one of health, vitality, bliss, and forward motion** because these are natural byproducts of this positive force.

Murphy argues that negative thought patterns arise due to your _lack of faith_ in this benevolent higher power. If you trusted it to work on your behalf, you’d have nothing to fear and no need to struggle because you’d know that this higher power is working to help you. But, your lack of faith leads you to the **false conclusion** that you _have to_ struggle by yourself and force things into place if you want to achieve any sort of success or happiness in your life. As a result, you feel alone and unsupported, and, when things don’t go the way you want them to, you suffer from low self-confidence and poor expectations. Your subconscious mind then fulfills these expectations by creating difficult and uncomfortable experiences.

Recall the stream made up of this positive force of energy: Each time you think a thought in opposition to this force, you throw a boulder into the stream. This boulder blocks the flow of the stream, slows down your progress, and leads you through long and uncomfortable diversions. The more boulders you throw into the stream, the harder it gets to make your way across the stream. In other words, the more you think negatively, the more blocks you place between yourself and what you want (good health, relationships, wealth, and so on).

For example, imagine you’re trying to make a major decision that will impact the course of your life. Your lack of faith in a higher power leads you to rely solely on your conscious mind to analyze the pros and cons of this decision. Because you don’t trust this higher power to work on your behalf, you magnify the weight of this decision and all of the disastrous consequences that could happen if you make the wrong choice—these consequences feel catastrophic because you believe that you’ll have to deal with them on your own. As a result, you feel blocked and anxious about choosing a direction. Your state of mind then delays any progress you make toward creating the life you want.

> **Faith in God Leads to Inner Peace and Fulfilment**
> 
> Murphy’s claim that lack of faith leads to difficult life experiences lies at the heart of many dominant religions. For example, Pastor Rick Warren, author of _The Purpose Driven Life_ , explains that God created you to fulfill a specific purpose that he planned for you. This purpose underlies the meaning of every aspect of your life.
> 
> According to Warren, when you don’t trust that God has assigned you a specific purpose, you fail to understand the meaning of your life. This is because you allow yourself to be driven by a variety of external (materialism), emotional (fear), and moral (false beliefs) factors to motivate your thoughts and behaviors. Warren argues that these motivations destroy the possibility of peace in your life because you always feel anxious and unsure about why you’re on this earth. Consequently, your anxiety makes you feel like you always have to struggle through difficult life experiences.
> 
> On the other hand, when you believe that God has a purpose for you, you understand the meaning of your life and feel at peace. Warren claims that this is because, instead of relying on different motivations, you feel as if you’re being guided by a single clear motivation: to fulfill God’s purpose for you. As a result, you understand the meaning of your life because you're able to appreciate the significance of your every life experience. This allows you to focus your thoughts and behaviors in a way that aligns with God’s purpose and leads to inner peace and fulfillment.

#### How Your Negative Thoughts Create Self-Fulfilling Prophecies

Murphy argues that every time you think negative thoughts, you block your subconscious mind from accessing both the useful information you have stored in your mind (this information is part of everything your subconscious mind has absorbed throughout your life) and the positive energy flowing from Universal Consciousness that creates positive experiences. As a result, your subconscious mind creates _negative_ experiences that align with your fears and worries.

(Shortform note: While Murphy argues that your negative thoughts create negative experiences by blocking the positive flow of a higher power, Wallace D. Wattles (_The Science of Getting Rich_) claims that these thoughts create negative experiences by _communicating directly with this power_. According to Wattles, this power’s job is to manifest thoughts into tangible forms—every time you think a thought, it responds by manifesting into something that reflects the nature of your thought. Therefore, when it senses negative thoughts, it manifests something negative.)

According to Murphy, these negative experiences can manifest in several ways:

##### Negative Thoughts Impact Your Mental Health and Your Ability to Experience Success

When you allow your negative thoughts to dominate your positive thoughts, you develop unhealthy mental patterns that lead to low self-esteem and psychological problems such as anxiety, addictions, and phobias. Murphy argues that these mental patterns prevent you from seeing the best in yourself and others, and they encourage you to develop negative expectations about everyone and everything around you. As a result, your subconscious mind creates failure instead of success and happiness.

For example, your habitual negative thoughts make you feel insecure about your relationship with your partner. The more you focus on the negative things that could happen (he’ll leave, he’ll cheat, he’ll get bored), the less able you are to notice what’s working well in your relationship. Instead, you constantly feel threatened and your insecurities make you act in ways that push your partner away (jealous, overbearing, critical). According to Murphy, your fear of abandonment turns into a negative expectation. Your subconscious mind believes this negative expectation and ensures its manifestation by creating circumstances that both align with and fuel your insecurities.

> **Cognitive Distortions Perpetuate Irrational Behavior**
> 
> Research on the topic of cognitive distortions supports Murphy’s argument that negative thoughts contribute to low self-esteem and psychological problems. Cognitive distortions are irrational thought patterns that manifest as negative emotions, increased anxiety, depression, and mental illness. They’re more likely to occur when you habitually think negative thoughts. This is because your subconscious mind gets used to processing everything it perceives in a negative light so much so that **you wire your brain to _always_ respond negatively to your experiences**.
> 
> According to this research, negative thinking _causes_ negative mental states and emotions. **These negative emotions lead people to act irrationally**. But, due to a lack of self-awareness, many people find it difficult to recognize when they’re engaged in negative or irrational thinking. As a result of their failure to recognize their negative thoughts, they mistakenly assume that external causes are to blame both for their emotional states and their resulting actions. The following examples illustrate the association between an external cause and a resulting action:
> 
>   * Work is stressful. This drives you to drink too much.
> 
>   * Your kids are loud. This drives you to lash out at them.
> 
>   * Spiders are creepy. This drives you to panic when you see one.
> 
> 

> 
> However, once you recognize the impact that your thoughts have on your emotions, you’re able to view the causes of your actions in a different light:
> 
>   * Your thoughts about work make you feel stressed. These stressful thoughts drive you to drink too much.
> 
>   * Your thoughts about how irritating your kids are, make you feel angry. Your anger drives you to lash out at them.
> 
>   * Your focus on how revolting spiders are makes you feel afraid. Your fear fuels your phobia and drives you to panic when you see one.
> 
> 

> 
> Once you understand _how_ your thoughts impact your emotions and behaviors, you can learn to manage them in a more positive way. To achieve this, you first need to become aware of how you choose to think about your experiences and how these thoughts make you feel. Next, you need to make the effort to change your thoughts so that you can improve the way that you feel. Once you improve your feelings, you’ll naturally engage in more positive behaviors.
> 
> For example, you catch yourself feeling stressed out about work. You realize that these stressful thoughts are not helping you to act positively or rationally so you decide to take a break and go for a walk. As a result, you feel refreshed and calm. This gives you the mental space to prioritize your workload and to get things done more positively. As you reduce your stressful thoughts, you also reduce your urge to escape into drink.

##### Negative Thoughts Inhibit Your Subconscious Mind From Accessing Information

Murphy argues that when you struggle to come up with new ideas and solutions, it’s because you’ve blocked your subconscious mind from accessing both the information you have stored in your mind as well as relevant inspiration from Universal Consciousness. For example, when you’re anxious about an exam, your negative focus _blocks_ your subconscious mind from recalling the information you need to ace the exam. As a result, you feel uninspired and this inhibits your ability to respond to the challenge in front of you.

(Shortform note: Research backs up Murphy’s claim that negative thoughts impact your ability to recall information. According to these researchers, negative thinking leads to cognitive decline and problems with memory, and it increases your risk of developing dementia. This is because negative thoughts leave a high number of harmful protein (tau and amyloid) deposits in your brain. Prior research reveals that the accumulation of tau and amyloid deposits in the brain are the cause of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as a number of other cognitive disorders.)

##### Negative Thoughts Harm Your Body

According to Murphy, your subconscious mind uses its connection to Universal Consciousness as a “positive power source” to regulate your bodily functions and keep you in optimum health. When your conscious thoughts align with this force, the positive energy moves freely around your body to heal and rejuvenate you. On the other hand, when your conscious thoughts are out of alignment with this force, you disrupt the flow of energy and prevent your subconscious mind from maintaining your body. As a result, your body suffers from health issues, and it degrades and ages faster than it’s meant to.

(Shortform note: Murphy argues that all physical ailments are a result of thinking out of alignment with Universal Consciousness. While research confirms that negative thought patterns are bad for your health (for example, stress impacts your digestion and sleeping patterns), various scholars and scientists have raised concerns over the view that your mental state is the _sole_ determinant of your health. These critics assert that illnesses and diseases have a wide range of **physical causes that must be addressed by modern medical therapies** in conjunction with any holistic methods you choose to incorporate.)
