## Exercise: What Does Happiness Look Like to You?

According to Murphy, you need to imprint positive thoughts upon your subconscious mind to improve your life experiences. Letâ€™s define what kind of thoughts feel positive to you.

* * *

Think of something positive that you want to experience. Create a detailed picture of this experience. What does it look like and why does the idea of it make you feel happy?

What in your life already makes you feel happy? For example, cuddles from your kids or enjoying a good book.

What thoughts do you think about the things that already make you feel happy? For example, do you feel grateful and lucky when you think about them? Do you generally expect to experience these things?

How can you apply these thoughts to the happy experience you want to create? For example, you could feel gratitude in advance which will boost your positive expectation of it happening.
