## Part 4: Methods to Realign Your Thoughts

Now that we’ve discussed the two general steps for retraining your subconscious mind, we’ll explore specific methods you can use to align your conscious thoughts with the positive flow of Universal Consciousness. According to Murphy, this will retrain your subconscious mind to create the positive experiences that you want, such as perfect health, satisfying relationships, wealth, and success.

Murphy suggests five methods you can use to take control of your conscious thoughts and train your subconscious mind to create positive experiences in your life:

  1. Choose thoughts that make you feel happy.
  2. Identify with what you want.
  3. Create automatic behavior using conscious repetition.
  4. Visualize what you want.
  5. Relax your mind to reduce interference from your conscious mind.



### Method 1: Choose Thoughts That Make You Feel Happy

Murphy believes that you need to focus on thinking only positive thoughts if you want your subconscious mind to create positive experiences. But how can you know whether your habitual conscious thoughts are positive or not? According to Murphy, you just need to judge how you feel. If you feel happy and you have positive expectations about your life, you’re thinking positive thoughts. On the other hand, if you don’t feel good about your life experiences, you’re thinking negative thoughts.

(Shortform note: Research backs up Murphy’s claim that your thoughts and emotions are inextricably linked and confirms that positive thoughts make you feel happy. However, sometimes, it’s not so easy to force yourself to think happy thoughts. Fortunately, there is a way to trick your brain into believing that you’re happy: smiling. Neuroscience research reveals that smiling spurs a chemical reaction in the brain that releases specific hormones including dopamine and serotonin. These hormones increase your happiness and reduce your stress levels. In short, smiling makes you feel happy. When you feel happy, you’re more inclined to think positive thoughts that continue to make you feel happy.)

### Method 2: Identify With What You Want

To develop positive expectations, Murphy suggests that you think only about what you _want_ to experience. Instead of worrying about how you’ll achieve something, focus on the end results and imagine the gratitude you’ll feel once you have it. This process will set a clear direction for your subconscious mind to move towards.

(Shortform note: Like Murphy, Wattles (_The Science of Getting Rich_), argues that you shouldn’t worry about _how_ to achieve what you want. Instead, just expect everything to work out in your favor. Wattles suggests that imagining your desired end result and practicing gratitude in advance of receiving what you want not only sends a clear message to the universe, but it also keeps you from becoming dissatisfied with your current life experiences. This is because, when you imagine feeling grateful for something you don’t yet have, you _feel positive_ regardless of what’s actually happening in your life. The more positive you feel, the more likely you are to adopt behaviors that move you closer to what you want.)

Murphy suggests that you use this method to improve your thinking about any area of your life:

#### Addictions

Imagine the freedom you’ll feel and all of the opportunities you’ll embrace once you’re free from your addiction. According to Murphy, the more you focus on the benefits of releasing your addiction, the less likely you’ll be to give in to your urges.

(Shortform note: According to James Clear (_Atomic Habits_), as well as focusing on the outcome of what you want (how good you’ll feel to be free from your addiction), you also need to **define the beliefs that will support your disassociation from this bad habit**. This is because your habits are inextricably linked to what you believe about yourself. Your beliefs about who you are encourage your habits and your habits encourage what you believe about yourself: for example, “I smoke, therefore, I believe that I need cigarettes to be happy.” So, in addition to imagining how you’ll feel, consider replacing your current beliefs with healthier ones that support the changes you seek to make: for example, “I am healthy and enjoy taking care of my body.”)

#### Love

Focus on your partner’s best qualities and take the time to offer praise. If you’re looking for a partner, Murphy suggests that you think about what type of person you want to be with, how you’ll spend your time together, and how this person will make you feel.

(Shortform note: According to psychologists, your internal dialogue determines your ability to focus on the positive aspects of your relationships and reflects in the way you interact with others. When your internal dialogue is positive, you’re more likely to practice self-compassion, have an awareness of your best qualities, and accept yourself as you are. Because you see the best in yourself, you’re able to recognize the unique strengths and values in others. On the other hand, when your internal dialogue is negative, you’re more likely to engage in self-critical dialogue that focuses more on what you dislike about yourself and where you’re going wrong. Because you’re unable to recognize your own value, you’re less able to see the value in others.)

#### Problems

Trust that every problem comes with a solution and imagine how you’ll feel once you’ve figured it out. According to Murphy, Universal Consciousness has access to all of the answers—your positive expectation gives you access to these answers.

(Shortform note: While there’s no empirical evidence to suggest that Universal Consciousness can provide solutions to your problems, research shows that **positive expectations do increase your ability to solve problems**. According to _The Happiness Advantage_ , when you choose to cultivate the habit of thinking positive thoughts, you **train your brain to create solutions**. This helps you to find opportunities in adversity and more easily overcome challenges and setbacks.)

#### Relationships

Consider how you’d like other people to think about you. Now think about them in this way regardless of how they behave. For example, if you’d like people to treat you with more respect, then you need to think respectful thoughts about others. Murphy argues that people will intuitively pick up on your positive thoughts and, as a result, their behaviors toward you will improve.

(Shortform note: While Murphy argues that your thoughts about others should mirror how you want them to think about you, Louise Hay (_You Can Heal Your Life_) argues that **you need to think about _yourself_ the way you want others to think about you**. Hay claims that every experience in your life reflects your opinion of yourself: If you don’t love yourself, you send out emotional signals that make other people _not want_ to love you. According to Hay, practicing self-love affirmations will change the way you view yourself and the emotional signals that you send out. Other people will then reflect these emotional signals back to you. So, if you want others to respect you, affirm to yourself, “I love and respect myself” multiple times a day.)

#### Wealth

Decide on how you’ll enjoy spending the wealth you want. Murphy claims that imagining how comfortable you’ll feel with more money will prime your subconscious to create wealth.

(Shortform note: Murphy’s suggestion here seems to encourage you to focus on what you want and then passively wait for your subconscious mind to create what you want. While this may be the case, focusing on the benefits you expect to feel from creating more wealth will also motivate you to **take actions** that support this goal. Many self-improvement practitioners agree that you need to feel emotionally invested in your goals in order to achieve them—in other words, the more benefits you anticipate from creating wealth, the more inspired and motivated you’ll feel to take actions that increase your wealth.)

### Method 3: Create Automatic Behavior Using Conscious Repetition

Recall: Murphy argues that your subconscious mind learns from repetition. When you first try to change your habitual conscious thoughts, you’ll need to apply conscious effort to think positively. But, with repetition, your positive thoughts will eventually imprint upon your subconscious mind to form positive beliefs and outweigh any negative and outdated beliefs. As a result, **your subconscious mind will influence you to think and behave in positive ways without conscious effort**.

For example, if you have social anxiety, improve your self-confidence by repeatedly thinking kinder thoughts about yourself. Over time, you’ll replace your anxious thoughts with more compassionate thoughts. This will increase your self-confidence and allow you to enjoy socializing with others.

(Shortform note: While it’s true that repetition leads to automatic behavior, opinions vary on exactly how long it takes for your subconscious mind to become accustomed to your new thoughts. Research studies reveal that it can take between 18 and 254 days, or an average of 66 days, for habits to become automatic. The timeline depends on how consistently you practice your new habits—the more often you consciously practice thinking your chosen thoughts, the quicker your subconscious mind will align with these new thoughts.)

### Method 4: Visualize What You Want

According to Murphy, when you visualize an image, you add weight to the impression your conscious thoughts form in your subconscious mind. This is because your subconscious mind can’t tell the difference between imagination and reality—it only _knows_ that you’re thinking about something often enough to create a detailed picture in your mind. The more you dwell on this image, the more likely your subconscious is to accept this image as an instruction about what it should create.

> **When Visualization Makes You Lose Interest in Your Goals**
> 
> While Murphy argues that visualization is an effective way to get Universal Consciousness to _create_ your life experiences, research shows that visualization may **negatively impact** your subconscious mind when you apply it to your goals. In _Ego Is the Enemy_ , Ryan Holiday claims that visualization can confuse your subconscious mind and create the opposite effect of what you want to achieve: When your mind _believes_ that you’ve already achieved something, **you feel that you’ve made progress** despite not having taken any measurable steps toward achieving your goal.
> 
> This feeling of progress feels good, but it’s based on a **false sense of achievement** that may cause you to lose sight of the actions you need to take to move forward. In fact, researchers examining the effects of visualization on goal achievement found that participants often lost the energy required to fulfill their goal because once they convinced themselves they’d already achieved the goal, they lost interest in trying to progress toward it.

### Method 5: Relax Your Mind to Reduce Interference From Your Conscious Mind

Murphy believes that your subconscious mind is more effective when you’re relaxed or asleep because you're unable to use your conscious mind to think _unproductive_ thoughts that contradict what you want.

When you're awake and alert, you can’t help but think about and judge everything around you. According to Murphy, this is what your conscious mind is _designed_ to do. Unfortunately, this creates problems for you when you’re trying to retrain your subconscious mind. This is because **you can’t just change your habitual conscious thoughts and beliefs instantaneously** —your mind needs time to get used to your new way of thinking. During this time, your conscious mind questions and contradicts the beliefs you want to change. This conflict between what you _want_ to believe and what you _do_ believe creates confusion for your subconscious mind because it’s not receiving clear instructions from your conscious mind.

For example, you want your subconscious to believe and expect that you’re confident about something. But, your conscious mind is so used to thinking of you as unconfident, that it questions your new belief and offers counterproductive thoughts and memories to rationalize why you should feel unconfident: “How can you feel confident when you failed so miserably the last time?”

> **Why Your Conscious Mind Sabotages Your Self-Improvement Efforts**
> 
> Research backs up Murphy’s claim that your conscious mind interferes with the changes you seek to make. This is due to two reasons:
> 
>   * Your subconscious mind includes negative experiences that you internalized, such as embarrassing events from your childhood, or memories of when you felt emotionally or physically threatened.
> 
>   * Your subconscious mind influences the way your conscious mind perceives and responds to your environment. Part of this influence includes protecting you from reliving painful experiences that it has recorded. It achieves this by inhibiting you from engaging in situations that may bring you pain.
> 
> 

> 
> The way you originally internalized these negative experiences determines how far your subconscious mind will sway your conscious thoughts in order to avoid repeat experiences.
> 
> Let’s examine how this plays out in the following example: When you were young, you were told to recite a poem in front of your class. You stumbled and made a few mistakes. Other children laughed at you. You could’ve internalized this in a few ways, including:
> 
>   * “I got more right than I got wrong. It’s okay, I’ll do better next time.”
> 
>   * “I was so terrible and they all know it. That’s why they’re laughing at me. I hate being in the limelight and never want to do it again.”
> 
> 

> 
> The first response instructed your subconscious mind that this situation presents a minor challenge that you can overcome—it isn’t anything to fear. In contrast, the second response instructed your subconscious mind to stay away from similar situations that may cause you discomfort. As a result, it now encourages your conscious mind to engage in self-sabotaging thoughts such as, “How can I feel confident about this considering what happened last time?”
> 
> Moving forward, be patient with yourself when attempting to change your thought patterns. Your conscious mind will offer resistance but, with time and practice, your subconscious mind will become accustomed to your new thoughts and beliefs. As a result, it will encourage your conscious mind to work with you instead of against you.

#### Relax In Order to Directly Access Your Subconscious Mind

Murphy argues that when you practice relaxation, you lull your conscious mind to sleep and have direct access to your subconscious mind. To illustrate how this works, Murphy touches upon how hypnotists induce their subjects into a relaxed state before they make suggestions—by preventing their subjects’ conscious minds from interfering, they ensure that their subjects will follow through with their suggestions.

For example, a hypnotist can make someone believe that a carrot is a chili pepper. When the person eats the carrot, she’ll react in the same way that she would if she had actually taken a bite out of a chili pepper—she’ll turn red in the face and desperately seek water to relieve the burning sensation in her mouth. She believes that the carrot is a chili pepper because her conscious mind isn’t interfering and arguing against the hypnotist’s suggestion.

> **Hypnotism Encourages Your Conscious Mind to Detach From Your Experience**
> 
> In _Psycho-Cybernetics_ , Maxwell Maltz also draws on the practice of hypnotism to argue that relaxation encourages your subconscious mind to accept new ideas. According to Maltz, **your subconscious mind doesn’t know the difference between imagination and reality** —it can only react (by creating changes in your nervous system) to what _you imagine_ to be true.
> 
> When your conscious mind is alert, your thoughts help your subconscious mind distinguish fact from fiction. For instance, in the example above, your conscious mind would step in and tell you that you’re eating a carrot. As a result, your subconscious mind would not cause your nervous system to heat up. But, by inducing your conscious mind into a state of complete relaxation, hypnotists take advantage of your subconscious mind’s inability to distinguish between imagination and reality.
> 
> However, hypnotists don’t have complete control over you when you’re in this relaxed state. According to studies, the relaxation method hypnotists employ doesn’t cause your conscious mind to fall asleep. Instead, it encourages you to feel detached from your experiences. As a result of this detachment, your conscious mind disassociates from any problems or concerns and serves merely as a witness to the events that take place. In other words, your conscious mind is aware of what’s going on but doesn’t feel involved in the experience. Consequently, it doesn’t feel the need to interfere with thoughts that disrupt the experience.

##### Set Intentions Before You Sleep

Since your subconscious mind is more receptive to your thoughts when your conscious mind is relaxed, Murphy recommends that you make the habit of thinking about what you want before you go to sleep. In addition, if you have problems that need solving, instruct your subconscious mind to come up with solutions while you sleep. According to Murphy, your subconscious mind will provide these solutions to you in the form of urges and inspiration when you awake.

(Shortform note: In _Deep Work_ , Cal Newport backs up Murphy’s idea that sleep and relaxation help you to find solutions. Newport discusses the benefits of “productive meditation”—using your relaxation time as a constructive way to solve problems. He suggests that you’re more likely to do your best work when you alternate between periods of intense focus and relaxation. While you’re relaxing, your mind will work through the problems you’ve lined up for it and, _without your conscious interference_ , can more quickly or creatively arrive at a solution.)

##### Pray for What You Want

Murphy claims that prayer is also an effective way to bypass your conscious mind to communicate your new thoughts directly to your subconscious mind. This is because he views prayer as a form of relaxation—he believes that your focus on what you’re praying for induces you into a relaxed state and silences your conscious mind.

Murphy suggests a simple prayer: Say specific words to generate the feeling of what you want. For example, you might talk about wealth, love, success, or health. These words allow you to avoid conflict in your conscious mind because you’re not giving it anything to question or contradict—instead of affirming that _you are wealthy or healthy_ , you’re simply saying words that allow you to focus on what you want.

(Shortform note: A recent study into the effect of mantras confirms that repeating a single word stops your mind from wandering. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the brain blood flow patterns of people who silently repeated a single word. The imaging showed **a reduction of activity across the brain** , primarily in the area of the brain that gives rise to internal thoughts—this is the area that generates your self-critical thoughts. So, while there isn’t any evidence to support the argument that repeating the word “wealth” will make you wealthy, there is proof that it will calm down your internal dialogue which _will_ benefit you.)

> **The Psychological Benefits of Prayer**
> 
> Research studies confirm that prayer is an effective way to relax. These studies reveal that **prayer and meditation share similar benefits** : They both calm your nervous system and make you less reactive to negative emotions. Further, some scientists argue that people who pray benefit more than those who meditate. According to them, praying fosters a sense of connection (with a higher power, the environment, and other people), allows people to feel emotionally supported, and encourages them to let go of their worries for a time.
> 
> If the idea of praying to a higher power makes you feel uncomfortable, this process may spur your conscious mind to interfere more than usual—this will inevitably make you feel more tense than relaxed. To combat this, some researchers recommend that, instead of picturing a higher power, imagine yourself having a heart-to-heart conversation with someone you trust. This will allow you to benefit from the positive effects of prayer without giving your conscious mind something to resist.
