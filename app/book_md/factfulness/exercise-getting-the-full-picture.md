## Exercise: Getting the Full Picture

Work through these exercises to help you see whatâ€™s _really_ going on.

* * *

Can you think of a recent phenomenon or trend in the news that generated a lot of unnecessary fear? Describe the situation and how you can avoid succumbing to panic in future situations.

Have you ever made a wrong decision because you only had incomplete data? How can you make better decisions after reading this summary?

Can you think of a stereotype that you once believed? What caused you to accept this generalization, and how can you adjust your thinking to avoid this going forward?
