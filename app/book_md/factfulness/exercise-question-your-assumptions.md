## Exercise: Question Your Assumptions

Work through these questions to see how the instincts might be misleading you.

* * *

Have you ever been surprised by learning how much you have in common with someone from another culture? Describe the experience.

Can you think of a negative misconception you once held that turned out not to be true? How can you change your thinking in the future to avoid this?

Can you describe a real-world example of a statistical trend that didnâ€™t follow a straight line? Explain why you think it followed this course.
