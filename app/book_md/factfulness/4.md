## 4: The Fear Instinct

The Fear Instinct is the tendency toward overblown and misplaced fear. It manifests most commonly with fears of physical harm (like murder, natural disasters, plane crashes) or contamination (from either poisoning or disease).

Living in our world, you’d certainly be forgiven if you lived in a state of perpetual fear. Stories about plane crashes, terrorist attacks, mass shootings, and deadly outbreaks of disease dominate news coverage.

(Shortform note: The drumbeat of fear isn’t just in your head. Data scientist Kalev Leetaru used sentiment mining of every _New York Times_ article published between 1945 and 2005 to determine that news coverage really _has_ gotten more gloomy and negative since the 1970s.)

**People consistently overestimate the incidence and likelihood of danger**. But the data shows that such fears have little rational basis (and are less likely to happen to you now than they’ve ever been in history).

For example, even at Level 1, disasters kill less than half the number of people than they did in 1990. In fact, deaths-per million from disasters were over 450 during the 1930s: that number was 4 in 2016).

#### The World is (Not) Terrifying

Some quick statistics show that **the world is _not_ the scary place we imagine it to be**. Better international cooperation combined with stronger rulemaking and regulatory bodies have alleviated a great deal of human suffering. Let’s take a look at a few examples to see how safe the world has actually become.

During the 1940s, Bangladesh was a poverty-stricken Level 1 country that suffered catastrophic droughts, flooding, and famine, resulting in **2 million deaths in that decade**. But because of economic development, the country is now at Level 2. This has enabled it to invest in better government, civil institutions, and infrastructure. When the 2015 cyclone hit, the government had an efficient system to evacuate refugees from the flood zone and provide over 30,000 people with food (with an assist from the World Food Programme).

Plane crashes are a recurrent source of fear (and receive wall-to-wall media attention when they do happen). There were 2,100 deaths per billion passenger miles at the dawn of the Aviation Era in 1929-1933. Today, that figure is virtually zero: **99.999975 percent of commercial flights landed safely in 2016 (in other words, only 10 crashes out of 40 million flights)**. This is partially a result of better international cooperation: the 1944 Chicago Convention created rules around aviation safety and a common accident report so pilots, airlines, and governments could learn from crashes.

We all know war is terrible and the media often portrays a world engulfed in conflict. It’s true that warfare has been a constant since the dawn of human history (there’s never been a time where there wasn’t some armed conflict going on somewhere). But some historical context brings things into perspective. **65 _million_ people died in World War Two**. Contrast that with the Syrian Civil War, the bloodiest conflict going on today, whose death tolls pale in comparison with those from earlier conflicts. Even if its death toll reaches 200,000, that is a shadow of the figures from conflicts as recent as the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s. Remember this: there were 2,013 combat deaths per million people in 1942, against 12 in 2016.

### Causes of the Fear Instinct

Why are we so fearful about the world?

#### Tendency to Drama

Fear was a useful thing for our ancestors, whose primitive circumstances really _did_ make the world a scary and dangerous place (you could easily be killed by wild animals, suffer one bad harvest and starve, or be captured and imprisoned by warlike neighbors).

Like so many evolutionary instincts, this one is obsolete and leads us to form misconceptions about the world.

#### Media Bias

**Stories that provoke fear are an easy way for media outlets to capture viewer attention**.

This is especially true in a 24-hour news cycle where consumers can instantaneously choose between a wide variety of media outlets and hyping fear and drama become the main bases for competition. Hence the attention on sudden, dramatic, and scary events like earthquakes, building collapses, terrorist attacks, and plane crashes.

### Problems Arising from the Fear Instinct

The Fear Instinct is highly damaging, causing irrationality and paranoia. **There is no room for facts and cool analysis when our minds are overwhelmed by fear**.

As a result, we overestimate dramatic events that are highly unlikely. For example, terrorism deaths are almost non-existent in rich Level 4 countries, under 1,500 from 2007 to 2016. Compare that with the 69000 people per year killed by alcohol during that same period in the United States alone.

The risks we fear the _most_ are actually those that cause the _least_ harm. Our overreactions often cause more harm than the things that generate them. Consider how anti-vaccination movements lead to outbreaks of long-eradicated diseases. Or how anti-DDT campaigns (born of chemophobia, an irrational fear of chemicals) hurts efforts to combat malaria.

### Overcoming the Fear Instinct

Always remember to **calculate the risks and incorporate facts into your worldview to avoid falling into the fear trap** :

#### Fear Is A Formula

Fear = risk x exposure. You should always think about the _likelihood_ of something happening to you before being afraid of it. Yes, terrorism and earthquakes are scary and it would be terrible to fall victim to either: **you also have an _incredibly_ low chance** of dying from them. They are _frightening,_ but not _dangerous_.

#### Take A Breath

You’ll never make wise decisions in a state of panic. Assess the data _before_ committing to a fearful and dramatic worldview (and a fear-based solution). Ask yourself, “Is this thing I fear likely to happen? Has it gotten more or less likely over time?”

#### Take the Media With A (Large) Grain of Salt

Remember that both our brains and our media ecosystem gravitate toward dramatic and scary stories about the world. As we’ve seen, these are usually based in inflated risk calculations and/or outdated information about the prevalence or likelihood of some disastrous event. **Apply a skeptical filter to the doom-and-gloom stories in the news.**
