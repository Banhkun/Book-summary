## 6: The Generalization Instinct

The Generalization Instinct is the tendency to sort our information about the world into categories.

**Wrong generalizations can lead us to form an inaccurate worldview**. This can either be grouping things together that _don’t_ belong or ignoring differences _within_ groups by assuming that every item within a category is identical.

(Shortform example: We all have our preconceived notions about groups of people that we perceive as being different from ourselves. When most Westerners think of Iran, for example, we think of a backwards, traditionalistic society dominated by patriarchal fundamentalist Islamic values. We also believe that they reflexively hate the West and the United States in particular.

But this is simply a sweeping generalization. According to _Business Insider_ :

  * Iran has the world’s second-highest number of sex changes, with the government subsidizing half the cost.
  * 60 percent of university students in Iran are women.
  * Iranian women have the right to vote, drive, and travel alone.
  * Iranians have the second-most favorable view of Americans of any country in the Middle East (second only to Israel in this category).



All of this is totally at odds with the generalized view we have of Iran. Our misconceptions come from lumping the entire country into one category through the Generalization Instinct.)

#### “Us” and “Them”? It’s a Bit More Complicated

People in Level 4 countries tend to lump Level 1, 2, and 3 countries together, ignoring the vast differences both _between_ and _within_ those categories. Take a look at some of these generalizations that well-educated people at Level 4 have about the other levels.

85 percent of managers from the world’s largest banks believe that most children worldwide were unvaccinated. As we’ve learned, the real vaccination rate is close to 90. The bank managers believe this because they have formed an inaccurate and outdated categorization of the world outside of Level 4.

As another example, Level 4 business leaders do not realize that family sizes are decreasing all across the world as people move out of extreme Level 1 poverty into the more comfortable Levels 2 and 3. This means that women are menstruating more (since menstruation pauses for about two years during each pregnancy), creating a growing market for menstrual pads and other products in these countries. But with a distorted worldview caused by the Generalization Instinct, businesses will fail to capitalize on this opportunity.

### Causes of the Generalization Instinct

Why do we group the world into simplified categories?

#### Organize Information

The world is complicated and messy, with lots of information. We need categories to help us process the information we are faced with every day: we would simply not be able to function if we saw every item and scenario as unique.

#### Survival Instinct

There is also an evolutionary basis: our ancestors did not have time to take a nuanced view of the world. They had to make quick decisions for basic survival, for which generalizations were extremely useful (don’t eat plants of that color because they’re poisonous, avoid going in the tall grass where the dangerous animals are).

### Problems Arising From the Generalization Instinct

The Generalization Instinct distorts our view of the world and causes real damage.

#### Missed Opportunities

By making wrong generalizations about the world based on outdated stereotypes, we lose sight of how much things have changed. A division of the world into “the West and the rest” blinds us as to how much difference there is _within_ “the rest” and how similar much of “the rest” is to “the West.”

We mentioned above the lost opportunities to sell feminine hygiene products in Level 1 and 2 countries. This comes from a blend of the Generalization and Negativity Instincts. Business managers are unaware of just how different these societies are from what they imagine them to be.

#### Prejudice and Discrimination

**All major forms of prejudice (such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia) are products of the Generalization Instinct**. When we generalize and see people as an undifferentiated mass, it’s a short step to denying them the basic respect that everyone deserves.

### Overcoming the Generalization Instinct

To avoid falling into the generalization trap, **reexamine and question your existing categories**.

#### Re-think Your Categories

Photos of material living standards at different income levels across the world show that our categories (like nationality, race, and religion) lead us to wrong assumptions. _Income_ is the main differentiating factor in determining how people live. People at the same income level _across_ cultures and national borders share broadly similar material standards of living. Check out the Dollar Street tool at gapminder.org to see over 30,000 photos from over 250 families from 50 countries around the world, sorted by income.

**Look for differences _within_ groups** (like the different _individual_ income levels within a Level 4 country, or the vastly different income levels within the general category of “African countries”). Also, **look for similarities _across_ groups** (like the shared living standards of people at the same income level in different countries).

#### Avoid the “Majority” Misconception

“Majority” is a very broad term—it could mean anywhere from 51 percent to 99 percent.

For example, in every country, a _majority_ of women report that their contraceptive needs are being met. But there’s a wide variety in the size of this majority ranging from 63 percent (Angola) to France (96 percent). Always ask for the actual percentage.

#### Watch Out For Extreme Examples

As with the Size Instinct above, it can be dangerous to draw broad conclusions about a population based on extreme or vivid examples. There have certainly been cases of artificial chemicals causing harm. This doesn’t mean that there’s any rational basis for chemophobia

A good test to see if you’re succumbing to a bias is to ask yourself if you’d draw the same generalization from an extreme example that pointed in the _other_ direction (i.e., concluding that _all_ chemicals were safe because a few of them had positive effects?) If the answer is “no,” then you’re probably making an unreasonable generalization.

#### Don’t Think You’re “Normal”

Don’t think that your Level 4 standards and values are universal. When you encounter differences in other cultures or at other income levels, there is often a good reason for them.

The book gives an example showing photos of half-built houses in Tunisia. To our Level 4 standards, this looks confusing and decrepit - why wouldn’t you just finish the house? Are Tunisians just bad planners or irresponsible? But this isn’t the case. Without access to banking services, it is _rational_ for Tunisians to invest their savings in bricks (which won’t lose their value) and build their houses piecemeal as they acquire more capital.

#### What’s True For One Group May Not Be Universal

The practice of putting unconscious adults on their stomachs helped save millions of lives by keeping their airways open. But the same practice proved lethal when it was applied to infants (hence the modern campaign to put infants to sleep on their backs). The lesson: don’t generalize from one group to another.
