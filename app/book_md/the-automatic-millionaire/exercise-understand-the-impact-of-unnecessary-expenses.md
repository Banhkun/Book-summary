## Exercise: Understand the Impact of Unnecessary Expenses

Identifying where you can cut your spending will help you to build more wealth in the long term. This exercise will help you understand _just how much_ wealth your small expenses can add up to.

* * *

What have you spent your money on during the past five days? Remember to include in-store purchases (no matter how small), bills, and automatic subscriptions.

Which of these purchases could you categorize as non-essential and cut from your expenses?

If you cut this expense, how much would you save over the course of a year?

What’s an action you can take to work toward eliminating this expense? For example, if you want to cut down on how much you’re spending on fast food, you might plan to start preparing your meals in advance.
