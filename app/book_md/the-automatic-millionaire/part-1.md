## Part 1: Introduction I Chapter 1: You Can Save More Than You Think

_The Automatic Millionaire_ provides a simple but powerful action plan for you to quickly automate your finances, build your wealth, and achieve financial freedom. Author David Bach argues that financial freedom doesn’t come from _how much you earn_ , but _how you manage your earnings_ —if you’re not saving your money with your current income, you’re unlikely to save it in the future. This is because people often increase their spending in line with their income and always have an excuse to avoid saving for the future. The result is that many people miss out on a huge opportunity to enjoy financial freedom.

> **Why Do We Often Avoid Saving for the Future?**
> 
> Bach believes we struggle to save money simply because we’re tempted to spend all of our money before we get a chance to save. But, according to Ramit Sethi, author of _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_ , there’s a more complicated psychological reason underlying this tendency. Sethi argues that people tend to avoid planning their future finances due to:
> 
>   * **Decision paralysis:** When someone is presented with too many options for how to save, they feel too overwhelmed to make a decision.
> 
>   * **Blaming the system:** They choose to focus on economic disadvantages that they can’t control. For example, they believe that those born into privilege have more financial advantages than they do and develop a “what’s the point” mentality.
> 
> 

> 
> Sethi advises you to switch your focus away from information-gathering or your disadvantages and start taking small proactive steps towards financial success.

Bach’s Automatic Millionaire process, which we’ll call the “automated path to wealth,” will teach you how to make smart financial decisions, automate your finances, and build your wealth using only a few dollars a day.

In Part 1 of this guide, we’ll focus on how you can save more money than you think, and explain why you should **automate your finances** and invest in your savings _before_ you pay for anything else. We’ll also discuss how you can use the power of compound interest to grow your money.

In Part 2, we’ll explain the specific steps you need to take to automate your savings and investments so that you can:

  * Retire rich
  * Build savings accounts to cover unexpected expenses 
  * Clear your debts
  * Own your home outright
  * Contribute to a better world



If you’re wondering if you can spare a few dollars every day, the first step of the process, which we explore in this chapter, will help you to examine and understand how much money you’re currently wasting and the savings you’re missing out on.

We’ll first focus on how you’re spending your money and what unnecessary expenses you can redirect towards your savings accounts. Next, we’ll explain why you need to prioritize paying for your financial security before you pay for anything else, and how much of your income you should aim to contribute towards that goal. Finally, we’ll explore how compound interest helps to grow your money and why you’re better off investing sooner rather than later.

### Stop Wasting Your Money

Bach explains that the first step to saving millions over the course of your life is focusing on how much you _spend_ —specifically, where you’re currently wasting your money.

(Shortform note: Bach understands that it’s not easy for everyone to increase their income, which is why he encourages you to focus on saving money _regardless of_ your current income. If you do increase your earnings, Bach suggests that you funnel this extra money into your savings accounts instead of spending it. In contrast, Sethi advises that you maximize your earning potential so that you can spend more money on what you want while you increase your savings.)

Bach claims that we all waste money on small expenses that add up over time, such as the snacks you buy on your way to work, the unnecessary items you pick up when you go shopping, or the subscriptions you pay for but don’t need. For example, a Netflix subscription might seem like a small expense because you’re only paying $8.99 a month, but it adds up to $107.88 per year.

The sooner you identify your unnecessary expenses, the sooner you can eliminate them and put the money you save towards building long-term wealth. Bach suggests the following exercise: Track all of your expenses over the next few days and identify where you’re spending your money. If you tend to use your bank card more than cash, examine your bank statements.

Once you’ve collated all of your expenses, consider if there are any expenses that you can cut out or reduce. For example:

  * If you’re buying coffee on the way to work, consider making coffee and putting it in a flask.
  * If you’re eating out every day, consider preparing and packing your lunches.
  * If you’re buying bottles of water, consider filling a bottle with filtered water before you leave the house.



> **Choosing the Right Expense-Tracking Practice for Your Needs**
> 
> In his book, Bach suggests you track your expenses for a few days to figure out where you're wasting your money. However, this isn’t going to give you a _complete_ picture of how you spend your money month by month, especially if you have irregular spending habits. To track all of your expenses over the long term, he recommends the Mint app.
> 
> Sethi also recommends that you use similar apps to track your spending. However, in contrast to Bach’s argument that you should track with the goal of eliminating _all_ unnecessary expenses, Sethi suggests that you track with a focus on **spending mindfully**. Split your expenses into four areas, decide in advance how much you want to spend in each area, then allocate a portion of your income to each:
> 
>   * Fixed costs (rent, living expenses)
> 
>   * Investments (savings and retirement)
> 
>   * Savings goals (vacations and large expenses)
> 
>   * Guilt-free spending (anything that makes you happy)
> 
> 

> 
> He argues that this process is more effective than budgeting or eliminating expenses because you don’t waste time tracking where each dollar goes. In addition, you give yourself permission to spend a portion of your income in any way you wish, even if that includes unnecessary expenses. While this goes against common financial advice, **you’re more likely to stick to your financial goals if you don’t feel like you’re constantly depriving yourself.**

### Invest in Your Future First

Before you continue reading, you should have a clear idea of how you’re currently spending your money, a plan to eliminate unnecessary expenses, and have decided on a specific amount you’re willing to redirect towards your savings accounts. Now, we’ll explore _why_ you should prioritize paying towards your savings before you pay for anything else.

According to statistics, the average American saves less than 5% of her earnings and one in five Americans don’t save at all. Why is it so difficult to save money? Many people add to their savings accounts as and when they have unspent money in their checking accounts. Bach argues that this doesn’t work because no matter how well-intentioned you are, more often than not you’ll find reasons to spend your money and won’t have anything left to put into your savings accounts.

(Shortform note: Furthermore, and perhaps even more worryingly, people tend to increase their spending the more they earn due to a phenomenon called “lifestyle creep.” The more they earn, the more entitled they feel to spend their money on things they formerly viewed as treats or luxuries. This increase in spending happens incrementally, so it’s often difficult for people to realize that they’re spending more and more on things they once found unnecessary. This is why Bach insists you should start saving regardless of your income.)

**Bach explains that the only way to improve your financial security is to** **arrange to automatically save a portion of your income _before_ you even have a chance to spend it**. He claims that you’ll quickly get used to living without this money, and you won’t need to rely on sticking to a budget to build your financial security.

(Shortform note: Dan Ariely, behavioral economist and author of _Predictably Irrational_ , offers clarity on _why_ you’re more likely to achieve financial security by automating your finances. His research reveals that **your emotions impact your spending decisions**. You’re more likely to make _irrational spending decisions_ when you feel emotional—in other words, when you see something you really want and feel an emotional urge to possess it. Your emotional side overpowers your rational side, and you’re less able to think about the consequences of your decisions. Automating your finances eliminates this possibility: You predetermine how your money is “spent.” so your rational side doesn’t have to fight with your emotional side about it.)

Bach suggests that you should aim to save at least 10-15% of your gross (before tax) income. For example, if you earn $20,000 a year, you should aim to save at least $2,000 a year which works out to $5.48 a day.

(Shortform note: In contrast to Bach, many experts agree that you should aim to save at least 20% of your gross income. So, if you earn $20,000 a year, you should aim to save at least $4,000 a year which works out to $10.96 a day.)

### How Compound Interest Grows Your Money

Bach argues that putting a few dollars aside every day by itself won’t make you a millionaire, but investing those dollars in the right type of account will. When you save your money in a checking account, you accumulate money for future use, but the amount doesn’t grow beyond what you put in. However, when you _invest_ your money in an account that pays compound interest, you _leverage your money_ —that is, you use it to generate further income in the form of interest payments. For example, if you invest your money in an account that pays you **10% annual interest, this means that you’ll receive an extra 10% of what you invested after one year** : Invest $100 and after a year, your money will be worth $110.

Bach also notes that thanks to compound interest, **the interest you earn also earns interest** —the $110 after another year will be worth $121 ($110 + 10%). After another year, it will be worth $133.10. In addition, **the more money you continue to add to this account, the more interest you’ll earn**. This is how compound interest transforms small, consistent amounts of money into free money over the course of time.

To understand how compound interest could be earning money for you at your current income level, reexamine the expenses you chose to cut earlier in this chapter. For example, let’s assume that you’ve been spending $1.45 each day on bottled water, which amounts to $529.25 a year, and $15,877.50 over the course of 30 years. So, over the course of 30 years, you could save almost $16,000 if you eliminated this expense.

Now, if instead of simply saving your bottled water money, say you invested this money for an annual return of 10% and continued to invest $1.45 per day ($44 a month), your money would **grow** as follows:

| **Your Investment**  
---|---  
**After 10 years** | $8,437.85   
**After 20 years** | $30,319.68   
**After 30 years** | $87,075.54   
  
This means that in an account that pays compound interest, the money you’re spending on bottled water could actually create over $87,000 for you over the course of 30 years.

(Shortform note: Calculating compound interest as Bach suggests can seem daunting if you’re not mathematically-minded. Use a compound calculator to figure out how much money you could earn from the small, wasteful expenses you chose to cut earlier in this chapter.)

> **What Is _Wealth_?**
> 
> Bach’s advice here isn’t revolutionary: The majority of finance books, including _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_ and _The Barefoot Investor_ , also discuss the benefits of applying compound interest to grow your savings. The general consensus is: If you want to create wealth, take advantage of compound interest to grow your money.
> 
> But what exactly is _wealth_ and how do you differentiate it from having a high income? According to the authors of _The Millionaire Next Door_ , wealth is defined by what you _accumulate_. So even if you earn millions, you’re not considered wealthy if you spend it all and don’t invest any of your money. On the other hand, if you earn a modest income but invest a portion of your income, you can accumulate great wealth.
> 
> Another way to define if you’re wealthy is to figure out how much you need to work to survive and maintain your lifestyle. Do you need to work every day just to keep up with all of your expenses, or do you have breathing room in the form of savings and _passive income_? **Compound interest is a form of passive income** because it earns money for you even when you’re not actively working.
> 
> **Creating wealth is a choice** —it often involves having to make sacrifices _now_ to earn more later. But, it’s worth the payoff if you can set yourself up to become financially independent.

#### Invest Early to Earn More

Bach claims that **the sooner you start investing, the more compound interest will earn for you and the more likely you'll be to achieve financial security**. The following chart illustrates how much you can earn based on what age you start. It’s based on an investment of $3,600 a year (less than $10 a day) and an annual return of 10%.

**Investment Earnings** | **Start investing at age 25** | **Start investing at age 35** | **Start investing at age 45**  
---|---|---|---  
**Age 35** | $66,712.20  | $0  | $0   
**Age 45** | $230,409.00  | $66,712.20  | $0   
**Age 55** | $654,996.33  | $230,409.00  | $66,712.20   
**Age 65** | **$1,756,266.52** | **$654,996.33** | **$230,409.00**  
  
The chart clearly illustrates the benefits of investing early—in the example above, the 25-year-old investor ended up with over $1.5 million more than the 45-year-old investor. Further, even if your investments earn less than 10% a year, your money will still grow more than it can if it remains static in your checking account.

> **If You’re Feeling Behind, You’re Not Alone**
> 
> If you haven’t yet started to invest your money, this section may make you feel a little uncomfortable about the thousands of dollars you’ve lost in potential investment gains. You’re not alone—according to polls, many Americans feel guilty about financial decisions they’ve made (or not made):
> 
>   * 31% of Americans regret not saving for their retirements earlier.
> 
>   * 24% of Americans regret not investing in stocks earlier.
> 
> 

> 
> This sentiment holds true regardless of age: 77% of millennials and 76% of baby boomers wish they’d started to invest earlier. Surprisingly, even 69% of respondents aged between 18-22 share this regret.
> 
> Bach provides helpful advice to overcome these feelings and dive into investment, no matter your age, in _Start Late, Finish Rich_. His suggestions include exploiting your earning potential to maximize your earnings and increasing your savings goals to 25% of your income so you can make up for the lost time.
