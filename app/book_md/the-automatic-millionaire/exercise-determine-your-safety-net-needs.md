## Exercise: Determine Your Safety Net Needs

Figuring out how much you need to save to cover your living expenses will help you decide how much money to set aside each month to build a safety net.

* * *

What are your essential monthly expenses? Include your rent or mortgage payments, insurance, food, travel, and so on.

How many months’ worth of savings (to cover your expenses) would make you feel financially secure?

What’s your savings goal? To find the amount, multiply your monthly expenses by the number of months you chose above.
