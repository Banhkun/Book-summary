## Part 2: Automate Your Finances I Chapter 2: Decide On Your Retirement Plan

You should now have a clear idea of how much of your income you should aim to save and how you can benefit from investing your money. We’ll now explain what specific steps you need to take to automate your investments and build your wealth.

The core principle of the automated path to wealth is that you must automate your savings and investments to ensure financial success—the more you automate your finances, the more likely you are to grow your wealth and create millions _without relying on willpower and discipline_. Over the remaining chapters, we’ll explain the specific steps you need to take to automate your savings and investments so that you can:

  * Retire rich
  * Build savings accounts to cover unexpected expenses 
  * Clear your debts
  * Own your home outright
  * Contribute to a better world



(Shortform note: Sethi also recommends that you automate all of your finances to make it as easy as possible to meet your financial goals. In addition to Bach’s goals outlined above, he also suggests that you invest in a Health Savings Account (HSA) to receive the following benefits: tax-free health spending—you can spend this money without ever paying taxes on it— and tax-free retirement investing—you can invest this money to create more income.)

In this chapter, we’ll focus on your retirement plan, as Bach argues that this is where you’ll benefit most from compound interest—**the earlier you invest, the more your money will grow, and the better off you’ll be once you stop working**. We’ll first discuss why you need to invest in your retirement _before_ you pay your taxes. Next, we’ll focus on the specific steps you need to take to automate your retirement plan so that you can relax knowing that you’ve prepared yourself for a prosperous future.

### How Paying Taxes Impacts Your Savings

Bach argues that you need to contribute to your retirement account **before** you pay your taxes to make the most out of your income. This is because the government takes approximately 30 cents per dollar of your salary as tax before the money is even sent to your checking account. To illustrate how this impacts you, the following chart lists what you earn both before and after-tax (assuming you pay 30% tax):

| **Your Salary**  
---|---  
**Earnings before tax** | $20,000  | $30,000  | $40,000   
**Earnings after tax** | $14,000  | $21,000  | $28,000   
  
This means that**** if you intend to contribute 10% of your income towards your retirement,**the amount you end up contributing _after_ you pay your taxes is considerably lower than the amount you’d contribute _before_ you pay your taxes. **

  * For example, if you earn $20,000 and you intend to contribute 10% to your retirement account, you can contribute $2,000 before you pay tax, compared to $1,400 after you’ve paid your tax.



Bach argues that you need to legally bypass the government’s taxation to maximize the earning potential of your retirement fund and get the most out of your earned dollars. You can achieve this by using a**tax-deferred retirement plan** —a plan that allows you to send money to your retirement account without having to pay tax on it. The following table demonstrates how much you can save and then earn per dollar (based on an annual return of 10%) by choosing to contribute to your retirement before you pay your taxes:

| **Pre Tax Retirement Contributions** | **After-Tax Retirement Contributions**  
---|---|---  
**Gross Income** | $10  | $10   
**Minus taxes =** | $10 - 0% = **$10** | $10 - 30% = **$7**  
**\+ 10% annual return** | $10 + 10% =**$11** | $7 + 10% = **$7.70**  
**Is the investment taxable?** | No  | Yes   
  
> **The Disadvantages of Tax-Deferred Retirement Plans**
> 
> While using a tax-deferred retirement plan does offer the immediate advantage of paying less tax now so that you can save more money, it may end up _costing you more once you retire_.
> 
> When you withdraw money from a tax-deferred account, it’s taxed as income for the year in which you make the withdrawal—the tax you pay depends on how much you withdraw, the same way that the amount of tax you pay depends on your income. The following list, based on the tax brackets for 2021, shows the amount of tax you’ll pay for withdrawals from your tax-deferred account:
> 
>   * 10%: up to $9,950
> 
>   * 12%: up to $40,525
> 
>   * 22%: up to $86,375
> 
>   * 24%: up to $164,925
> 
>   * 32%: up to $209,425
> 
>   * 35%: up to $523,600
> 
>   * 37%: over $523,600
> 
> 

> 
> This means that the more money you withdraw from your tax-deferred account, the more tax you pay after you retire. If you intend to withdraw large amounts of money to fund a dream vacation, pay for a family wedding, or cover unexpected expenses, you may end up paying more tax than you would’ve when you originally earned the money.
> 
> If you expect to have high expenses after you retire, there are other options to avoid paying taxes on your withdrawals—we’ll cover these later on in this chapter.

### If Your Employer Offers Self-Directed Retirement Accounts

Now that you understand the benefits of contributing to your retirement fund before you pay your taxes, we'll look at the various options available to you depending on whether you’re employed or self-employed. We’ll start with employer-offered, self-directed retirement accounts.

There are two types of self-directed retirement accounts your employer might offer: 401(k) and 403(b). Both plans offer the following benefits:

  * Your payroll department can arrange automatic contributions to your retirement account.
    * (Shortform note: While it’s convenient that your payroll department can manage this for you, Bach doesn’t mention the high fees you’ll end up paying in this type of system (and may not be aware of). You’ll end up paying numerous administration, investment, and service fees every time you contribute.)
  * Your employer may offer to contribute towards your retirement plan. Many employers agree to top up your contributions based on a percentage amount of what you’re already contributing. So, if your employer agrees to pay 25% of your contribution, they’ll top up your account with 25 cents for each dollar you contribute.
    * (Shortform note: The more your employer contributes, the more you pay to take advantage of the plan. This is because **the fees you pay to use the plan are calculated as a percentage of your total contribution**. So if you contribute $100, and your employer tops up your contribution with $50, your fee will be based on a percentage amount of $150.)
  * You don’t pay tax on the money you contribute to your retirement plan or on any of the compound interest that you earn over the course of your plan—you only pay taxes once you start taking the money out of your retirement account.
    * (Shortform note: While you’ll benefit from the immediate advantages of paying less tax now so that you can save more for the future, this plan may end up costing you more if you plan to withdraw large amounts after you retire. This is because your withdrawals will count as taxable income—the more you withdraw, the more tax you’ll pay.)
  * You can contribute up to $18,000 a year if you’re under the age of 50, and $24,000 a year if you’re over the age of 50.
    * (Shortform note: **Your employer’s contributions to your plan do not count towards these limits**. You can contribute $18,000 towards your plan (if you’re under the age of 50) regardless of whether or not your employer matches your contribution.)



One out of every four American workers don't sign up for their retirement accounts—Bach claims that most people just assume that they’re automatically signed up to benefit from their company’s retirement plan. While some companies do offer automatic enrollment, you still need to check what percentage of pay you’re contributing towards your retirement plan. Bach explains that the companies that offer automatic enrollment tend to set your contributions at a very low rate, between 1-4%.

(Shortform note: Bach mentions that people often don’t enroll in their company’s retirement plans, but he doesn’t offer in-depth explanations for _why_ this reluctance exists. According to some psychologists, one reason we avoid planning for our retirement is that we find it difficult to imagine ourselves getting older—while we understand that old age is inevitable, the concept doesn’t feel real. As a result, we’re more inclined to seek gratification here and now than save for our future needs.)

##### Automate It

If you’re not enrolled in your company’s retirement plan:

  * Ask your company for the retirement account sign up forms.
  * Decide how much you’re going to contribute to your pension every time you get paid—choose a percentage of your pay rather than a specific dollar amount as this will ensure your contributions increase whenever you get a pay rise. Contribute what you can but aim for at least 10% of your pay.



If you’re already enrolled in your company’s retirement plan:

  * Check your plan to see how much you’re contributing.
  * Increase your contributions as much as possible—aim to reach the maximum amount that your company allows.



> **Factors That Impact Your Retirement Plan**
> 
> Bach instructs you to implement these steps to set up and automate your retirement accounts _before_ you work on automating the rest of your finances. However, it may be worth walking through the rest of Bach’s ideas before you finalize your decisions about your retirement plan for the following reasons:
> 
>   * You may decide to opt for an IRA to avoid paying taxes on your withdrawals (we cover IRA accounts in the next section).
> 
>   * You need to set up investment options so that your retirement fund can grow (chapter 3).
> 
>   * You may decide to change the percentage of your retirement contributions if you have debts (chapter 5).
> 
> 

> 
> Reading through the entire guide will ensure that you make informed decisions about your retirement plan.

### If You Need to Open an Individual Retirement Account

If your employer doesn’t offer self-directed retirement accounts, you’ll need to open an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). You can choose from one of three options: the Traditional IRA, the Roth IRA, or the Roth 401(k), which is similar to the Roth IRA but allows you to contribute more each year. The difference between the Traditional IRA and the Roth IRAs is _when_ you pay tax on your retirement money: when you withdraw money in the case of the Traditional IRA, and when you contribute in the case of the Roth IRAs. This means that the Traditional IRA has the benefit of allowing you to contribute more money upfront, as it won’t be taxed; meanwhile, the Roth IRAs provide tax-free income after you retire.

Bach suggests that if you’re at least 15 years away from your retirement, the Roth IRA is the most beneficial option for you—you’ll pay your tax for your contributions during these 15 years but benefit from tax-free withdrawals for the rest of your life.

> **Additional Retirement Account Options**
> 
> The three IRA accounts Bach mentions are standard options for people who need to open up their own retirement accounts. They’re recommended in a number of financial books including _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_ and _The Simple Path to Wealth_. However, Bach doesn’t mention additional options you may want to consider.
> 
> In _The Simple Path to Wealth_ , J.L. Collins suggests Thrift Saving Plans as an option. These plans have extremely low fees and are aimed at federal employees, including members of the military.
> 
> In addition, if you’re on a low to moderate income, you may be able to take advantage of the Saver’s Credit. This option offers additional benefits beyond tax-deferred savings because it offers tax deductions based on your income and circumstances. If you qualify, you’ll receive a tax credit for the first $2,000 you contribute each year.

#### How to Open an IRA Account

You can choose to open your IRA account through a bank, a brokerage firm, a mutual fund company, or an online investment firm. To set this up quickly and efficiently, Bach recommends you choose from one of the following online investor firms:

  * Betterment
  * Charles Schwab
  * Fidelity Investments
  * TD Ameritrade
  * Vanguard
  * Wealthfront



If you’d prefer to speak to a financial advisor face to face, Bach provides information for full-service brokerage firms and banks that are more likely to have local branches near you:

  * Ameriprise Financial
  * Citi Personal Wealth Management
  * Edward Jones
  * Lincoln Financial
  * Merrill Lynch
  * Morgan Stanley
  * Raymond James
  * T. Rowe Price
  * UBS
  * Wells Fargo Advisors



> **The Difference Between Free and Paid IRA Accounts**
> 
> Both Bach’s and Sethi’s recommendations for banks and brokerage firms hinge on the discounts or perks you receive—for example, free accounts and small minimum investment fees. Like Bach, Sethi also recommends that you use Vanguard, Charles Schwab, or Fidelity—established firms with a good reputation.
> 
> However, keep in mind that these accounts tend to be free because they require more of a do-it-yourself approach: You need to do the research about what options are available and decide what suits your lifestyle before you sign up with them. If you require a more personalized service—one that’s tailored to your specific needs—you’ll need to pay management fees that will eat into your contributions.
> 
> So, before making a choice, consider realistically how involved you want to be with your plan and shop around for the bank or brokerage firm that best suits your needs.

##### Automate It

Once you’ve chosen your IRA plan, make sure you set up a _systematic investment plan_ so that your money is automatically transferred into your IRA account. You can ask your employer if they can transfer the money automatically to your IRA, or you can arrange a direct debit from your checking account(you’ll need to fill out an ACH debit authorization form to authorize this). You can also use an online bill payment service, such as PayTrust, to manage these payments for you, but you will need to pay fees for this service.

(Shortform note: While systematic investment plans do offer many advantages—most notably, that automated payments require zero discipline—there are disadvantages for those who have unpredictable earnings, such as freelancers or small business owners. It’s difficult to automate your payments if you don’t know how much you’ll be earning from month to month. If you instruct your bank to send money that you don’t have, you could end up with extra overdraft fees. So, if you intend to use this plan, ensure that you always have the funds available to make your payments—it’s notoriously difficult to amend the payment dates once the plan’s in motion.)

### If You’re Self-Employed

Business owners can take advantage of many different types of retirement accounts and benefit from many tax breaks. Bach claims that the simplest options to choose from are the Simplified Employee Pension (SEP-IRA) and the One-Person 401(k) Profit Sharing Account, otherwise known as the “Solo 401(k)”.

| **SEP IRA** | **One-Person 401(k)**  
---|---|---  
**How much you can contribute** | Up to 25% of your gross income or $53,000  | -100% of your first $18,000  -An additional 25% of your gross income if you use the profit-sharing plan  -A combined total of $53,000   
**Example of tax-deductible savings for an annual income of $100,000 (tax-deferred until you take the money out)** | Total of $25,000  | -$18,000 into 401(k) plan  -$25,000 into a profit-sharing plan  -Total of $43,000   
**Best for you if:** | You don’t have employees  | Your employees are family members   
  
> **What You Need To Know About SEP IRAs and One-Person 401(k)s**
> 
> Bach briefly explains the benefits of both plans but doesn’t elaborate on specific details you should be aware of to make an informed decision about which to choose. Here’s some additional information about each type of plan:
> 
> SEP IRA:
> 
>   * You’ll reach the 25% or $53,000 limit if your income is more than $212,000 a year. In this case, you may want to look at multiple retirement accounts so that you can contribute more.
> 
>   * All of your employees must be included in the plan if they are eligible.
> 
>   * Bach claims this plan is best if you don’t have employees because, if you intend to match employee contributions, you must pay the same percentage for each. For example, if you intend to contribute 10% of one employee’s retirement contribution, you need to contribute 10% of every employee’s contribution. The percentage you decide to contribute will impact your expenses.
> 
>   * There are no catch-up contributions—employees aged over 50 cannot make additional contributions.
> 
> 

> 
> One-Person 401(k)
> 
>   * Bach claims that you can qualify for this plan if you only have family members working for you. However, that’s not the case. You can qualify for this plan if you don’t have employees or**if your spouse is your only employee.**
> 
>   * While you can contribute a larger percentage of your income than you can for the SEP IRA, this does come with disadvantages. If your retirement funds total more than $250,000, you’ll have to submit more paperwork to the IRS to justify these additional contributions.
> 
>   * You need to contribute regularly for your plan to stay active—if the IRS considers your contributions too low, they will discontinue your plan.
> 
> 

> 
> Despite these caveats, both tax plans are often worth it—Bach’s right that there are huge tax-deductible savings, even if you don’t make $100,000 a year. The average annual income of a self-employed person is $62,300 a year: This means that the majority of self-employed people could max out their pensions using either of these plans.

##### Automate It

Once you’ve chosen a plan, Bach suggests that you decide upon a salary amount that you will allocate for yourself and set up an automated system—through your payroll company or checking account— to transfer contributions directly to your plan.

If you have additional questions about retirement accounts, Bach recommends that you download the following pamphlets from the Internal Revenue Service:

  * For a guide to free tax services: #910
  * For individual retirement plans: #590-A and #590-B
  * For small businesses retirement plans: #560



(Shortform note: This step can be a bit tricky, even if you download the pamphlets Bach recommends, because self-employed people often find it difficult to know how much of a salary to pay themselves. Unfortunately, there isn’t an easy answer to this question. There’s no “best” way to define the amount—you can either determine your living expenses and take the same amount every month to cover them (this could hurt your business if your profits vary month to month), or decide upon what percentage of your income you’ll take as salary (this could impact the amount you take home each month).)
