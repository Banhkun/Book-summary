## Exercise: Reflect on Jimmy Carter’s Life

Alter’s biography of Carter asks the reader to reevaluate the traditional narrative about Carter’s presidency—namely that he was a weak, ineffectual president who found redemption later in life as a global humanitarian. Taking into consideration the complexity of Carter’s life and times, think about how you might reappraise Carter’s legacy or that of any other well-known figure.

Alter says that Carter presented a conservative facade in order to win his earliest elections, which went against his stated value of integrity. Do you feel that Carter acted unethically, or do you believe his campaign tactics were justified? What current political leaders do you believe may employ a similar strategy?

As president, Carter came into office at a time when a demoralized US faced rampant inflation, an energy crisis, and tensions in various parts of the world. Do you think Carter should have approached these problems differently, and if so, how?

During the hostage crisis in Iran, Carter prioritized working toward a peaceful solution over his own re-election campaign. Do you believe the situation could have been handled differently? If so, how? What might have been the outcome?

Given the disparity between the traditional view of President Carter and Alter’s portrayal of him in this biography, are there any other political figures whom you think might have been misjudged by history, and if so, who?
