## Self-Emancipation, Part Two

Tara would finally be forced to choose between her new life and her old. She had to, at last, reconcile her obligations to her family with her commitments to society and—most importantly—to herself.

### Distorted Reality

Amid all this turmoil, **Tara won a visiting fellowship at Harvard**. But the weight of her recent family trauma hung over this accomplishment like a dark cloud. Never had she felt so gloomy and indifferent about a piece of good news.

Tara fell into a deep crisis of reality. If her entire family had branded her as a liar, how could she truly trust her own reality? **She needed evidence of her own sanity,** proof that the things she could see and touch were actually there, and not just figments of her imagination.

She wrote to a woman named Erin, whom Shawn had dated when Tara was a teenager. She asked Erin if _she_ had also suffered abuse from Shawn. Tara needed to hear the truth from another source, to learn to trust her own reality once more. Erin shared a story about how **Shawn had bashed her head against a brick wall** , with such force that she thought he would kill her. To Tara, the story was a lifeline to reality, something tangible she could grasp at a time when her whole world seemed subjective.

She later met a young man who told Tara that he and his grandfather had caught Shawn bashing his cousin’s head into a brick wall. This testimony meant even more to Tara, because it had come from an eyewitness, not a fellow survivor. It was impartial enough for her to vindicate her own memories and experiences.

Tara was once again able to pour herself into her doctoral studies at Harvard. She became interested in the writings of Hume, Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, and Mill. She was especially drawn to their ideas that one ought to balance obligations to family with obligations to society.

This had obvious personal resonance for her. She loved her family, but she also knew **she had a moral and social duty to stand against their racist, conspiratorial beliefs and their violent, abusive practices.**

#### An Unexpected Visit

While she was in Harvard, Gene and Faye abruptly declared that they would be visiting Tara in Boston. She now believes that **they were coming to save her, to offer her one final chance at redemption** before they would have no choice but to cast her out forever.

While they were in the Northeast, Gene insisted that Tara accompany them on a visit to Palmyra, New York, where, according to the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith, the Angel Moroni first appeared and commanded him to found the true church. It is among the holiest sites in the Mormon faith. Gene believed that touching the cross on the temple grounds would cleanse and heal Tara’s troubled soul.

Tara recalls the feeling of _wanting_ to believe, _wanting_ to be cleansed, _wanting_ to be accepted back into the arms of the family she’d once known. But she simply couldn’t do it. When she put her hand on the cross, **she felt nothing but cold, lifeless rock.**

Later, when they returned to Boston, Gene and Faye oddly and uncomfortably camped out for a week in Tara’s dorm room. It was here that Gene offered to perform a priesthood blessing on Tara. In Mormonism, male heads of the household are given God’s power to act on earth. This gives them the power to cure sickness and cast out demons. With this power, Gene offered to lay his hands on Tara’s head and cast out the demons he believed had strayed her from the true and righteous path.

In a crucial act of defiance, **Tara refused the blessing**. She remembers her father staring at her in disbelief. He tried to explain to her that the family had been chosen by the Lord and that all the trials they had gone through had been part of His divine plan to test their resolve and reveal to them their true powers.

Faye eagerly affirmed this belief, claiming to Tara that **she could now cure strokes and heart attacks through the power of energy.** She even claimed that she had cured her own breast cancer (a self-diagnosis of which Tara was completely unaware). Her parents told her that she was a lost cause and had given up all chance of salvation. They left her in Boston.

### Final Break

Her defiance of her father and refusal of his blessing was a watershed moment for Tara. She saw that all of her study, hard work, and intellectual development had led to this moment.

**She had to have the positive liberty to experience truths that had been denied her by her father**. She needed to use those truths, those observable facts, to form her own thoughts and shape her view of the world. To surrender to her father now, to even _pretend_ to believe in her parents’ healing powers, **would be to lose custody of her own mind.** She would be giving up her sense of self.

Still, Tara yearned to be part of her family. The heartache of being separated from them was destroying her. She decided to return to Buck’s Peak for one last chance to reconcile. She showed up for a surprise visit. Faye was ecstatic when Tara came through the door. For a moment, Tara felt as though she was still loved, still accepted for who she was.

That was, until she went to the family computer to send an email. She happened to see a previously sent email open in the browser, from Faye to Erin, one of Shawn’s ex-girlfriends. In the email, Faye sang Shawn’s praises as being a changed man who had been reborn and spiritually cleansed. Later in the message, **Faye castigated Tara as a liar and a danger to the rest of the family.** She said that Tara was lost and without faith.

The message was clear: Faye would _never_ defend Tara and truly believed that the latter was the source of the family’s problems. It was now clear that this was no longer Tara’s home, and hadn’t been for a long time. **There was nothing left on Buck’s Peak for Tara** , nothing for her to cherish or hold on to.

She made an excuse that she was going to her car to take a drive. As she left, she saw her father, who hugged her and said, “I love you, you know that?” Tara replied, “That has never been the issue.” These were the last words she spoke to her father. **She got in her car and drove away—away from Buck’s Peak, and away from her former life**.

### Dr. Westover

Tara sank into a prolonged state of deep depression and lethargy. She neglected her studies and took to binge watching hours, days, weeks, and months worth of television shows. She had stopped writing her dissertation and **was in genuine danger of failing out of her PhD program**. The irony of sacrificing her family for her education only to lose both was not lost on Tara, but she was too mentally broken to continue on.

Eventually, a year passed without Tara having submitted any work to her supervisor. He became concerned and told her that the PhD program was exceptionally demanding and that perhaps she should admit defeat and leave the program.

She was in the depths of true despair. But she was pulled out from it by the person who had been her original inspiration, her first guide into the world of intellectual exploration: her older brother Tyler.

Tyler had come under pressure from Gene, Faye, and Shawn to denounce and excommunicate Tara. He was threatened with ostracism himself if he didn’t fall in line. But, to Tara’s gratitude, Tyler refused. He confronted his father with the litany of Shawn’s abuse and _demanded_ that Gene take action. When Gene did nothing and continued to defend Shawn, Tyler took Tara’s side.

He sent Tara a letter saying that **their parents were caught in an endless cycle of abuse, manipulation, and control** from which they would never escape. He told Tara that he loved her and that she must remain true to herself. Tyler had refused to forsake his sister.

This was the boost she needed to resume her studies and fulfill her potential. She reinvigorated her PhD research, exploring four intellectual movements from the nineteenth century and how they tackled the problem of family obligation. One of those four intellectual movements was Mormonism.

The day she turned 27, Tara submitted her thesis, “The Family, Morality, and Social Science in Anglo-American Cooperative Thought, 1813-1890.” She successfully defended her thesis, and nearly 10 years to the day after she stepped into a classroom at BYU not even knowing what the Holocaust was, she became Dr. Westover.

She was no longer the child that her father had raised. **She had liberated herself, emancipated herself from the mental slavery of her youth.** In a word, she was educated.
