## Shortform Introduction

_Educated_ is an autobiographical journey. It takes us through **Tara Westover’s struggles growing up in a survivalist household on a remote mountain in Idaho** , and her eventual liberation from her family’s extreme ideology, religious fanaticism, and cycle of physical and emotional abuse. Eventually, Tara manages to matriculate at Brigham Young University, where she excels and goes on to a prestigious academic career that takes her to Cambridge and Harvard.

Her story exposes us to a community with which most readers wouldn’t be familiar: the world of extreme, anti-government, American survivalists among whom Tara grew up. Her childhood was marked by:

  * **A total lack of formal education** , stemming from her father’s paranoia that “socialist” government agents were using the school system to “brainwash” the population.
  * **Near-total isolation from the world outside her family** and the small mountain community where they lived—Tara didn’t even have a birth certificate until she was nine years old. On paper, she didn’t even _exist_.
  * **Religious fundamentalism, misogyny, and messianic prophesying from her father** , who believed that God had ordered the world such that wives should obediently serve their husbands, and daughters their fathers.
  * **A paranoia surrounding doctors and medicine** , another core tenet of her father’s anti-government and anti-establishment ideology. As a result, injuries and illnesses were treated with her mother’s (almost always ineffective) herbal remedies and essential oils. Even severe car accidents and gruesome household injuries did not merit visits to medical professionals.
  * **Exposure to dangerous conditions in her father’s junkyard** , where she and her siblings were forced to work. Through it all, her father was indifferent to the severe risks to which he was exposing his children, even when they would sustain life-threatening cuts, burns, and falls.
  * **Physical and emotional abuse** at the hands of her older brother, Shawn—and her parents’ refusal to intervene to protect her.



Tara’s ultimate escape from this world and her intellectual awakening as a scholar are to be celebrated. But _Educated_ is far more than a story about overcoming adversity or rising up from poverty (though it is certainly those things too).

**It is a story about learning how to think for oneself**. For most of her life, Tara was told what to believe, mostly by her father. There was little room for dissent or debate. These commands were given extra weight because her father imbued them with the awesome power of religious authority: he was speaking for _God_.

**Tara’s ultimate defiance of her family was a revolutionary act of self-liberation**. Not just because she went to college, not just because she accepted the legitimacy of going to the doctor, and not just because she came to reject the lies and propaganda that had informed her view of history and society.

Fundamentally, her revolutionary act was to use her _own_ sense and intellect to illuminate her view of the world, **to accept herself as an autonomous human being with the right to make her own decisions about her life.** Before this self-awakening, Tara had been told to disregard obvious truths that she could plainly see right in front of her. Now, she had learned to trust her own senses, know that she wasn’t crazy, and make independent judgments about reality.
