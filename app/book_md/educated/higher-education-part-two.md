## Higher Education, Part Two

Tara’s academic career was about to take her to new heights of intellectual and personal discovery, taking her to places she’d never dreamed she would go. But the chaos and extremism of Buck’s Peak would continue to exert a powerful hold.

### Tara’s Wish is Granted

Even back at BYU, the spectre of Shawn’s abuse hung over Tara. It became clear to the bishop at the university that Tara was experiencing severe emotional trauma. She was also suffering from an infected tooth, for which she could not afford to seek treatment. Over the course of several meetings with him, she told him the truth about everything her brother had been doing to her over the years.

The bishop told her not to return home and assured her that the church would help her pay her rent and get the necessary funds together to remain in school and earn her degree. His only condition was that she **honor her promise to never again work for her father.** Tara was incredulous. How could she afford tuition and housing without working in the junkyard during the summer and on holiday breaks?

**The bishop’s solution was simple: a government grant.** This, he explained, was different than a student loan. Tara wouldn’t have to pay it back. She wouldn’t be in debt, but would instead have the financial freedom to pursue her studies. Gene had, of course, railed against the evils of government grants back on Buck’s Peak. To accept one, he cautioned, was to strike a deal with the devil:**“They give you free money, then the next thing you know, they own you.”**

As much as Tara was beginning to divorce herself from her father’s beliefs, they still influenced her decisions. She initially refused to pursue the grant and even turned down an offer of financial assistance from the bishop’s own discretionary fund.

Tara scraped by for the next few months, with her infected tooth, working multiple jobs to keep herself afloat. She even received an unlikely gift of $100 from Shawn. Through it all, she maintained her opposition to accepting help from the government. But eventually, **she saw the irrationality of her opposition and agreed to file the paperwork**. She even briefly returned to Buck’s Peak to steal copies of her parents’ tax returns in order to complete it properly.

She only needed $1,400 for the dental operation. She instead received a check for $4,000. The money had the _opposite_ effect of what Gene had said. **The money didn’t control her. It _liberated_ her, **giving her convictions actual weight. Now she really _could_ honor her promise to herself to never again work for her father.

### Bipolar Disorder

With her financial situation more secure, Tara was able to pour herself more vigorously into academics. She had a revelation in a psychology course while listening to a professor list the symptoms of bipolar disorder: depression, mania, paranoia, euphoria, delusions of grandeur, and persecution complexes. **The professor was describing her father.**

Later, the class discussed the role that mental illness had played in separatist movements and anti-government conflicts, as had happened in Ruby Ridge, Idaho. Tara had never heard of Ruby Ridge, but when she looked it up, she saw that it was the site of the standoff between Randy Weaver and the federal government in 1992. These were the same Weavers whom Gene had labeled as fellow “freedom fighters” to Tara, the Weavers of the supposed massacre at the hands of ruthless government agents.

As Tara now learned, the real story was quite different. The Weavers’ cabin wasn’t laid under siege because of the family’s refusal to submit to government brainwashing, as Gene had said. Randy Weaver had, in fact, **been selling illegal firearms and was deeply embedded in the white supremacist movement** in that part of rural Idaho. The situation had devolved into a deadly standoff because Weaver (who was heavily armed and had children inside the cabin) refused to surrender peacefully. **He was a criminal and would-be terrorist,_not_ a patriotic defender of freedom.**

Tara became deeply interested in bipolar disorder and wrote her term paper on the effects that bipolar parents have on their children. Her research showed her that such children are more prone to develop mood disorders themselves, and that they suffer from **the stressful environment that their mentally ill parents create**.

She forcefully confronted her father the next time she saw him when she visited Buck’s Peak, demanding to know why he had subjected the family to so many terrifying stories that turned out to be completely untrue. He had no answer. This was the beginning of a long process of Tara separating herself from contact with her family: for the first time since starting college, **she did not return to Buck’s Peak that summer.**

### Gene’s Accident

That next spring, however, Tara would once again be exposed to the mayhem of Buck’s Peak. One morning at BYU, she awoke to a phone call from her sister Audrey, who told her that**Gene had suffered a catastrophic burn injury in a gas tank explosion** and wasn’t likely to survive. She urged Tara to return home to say goodbye.

When she got back to Buck’s Peak, Tara was horrified by her father’s condition, as well as the gruesome scene around him. Much of his skin had simply melted away or was fusing to other parts of his body. Faye and some other women were using butter knives to pry Gene’s ears from his skull, which had fused together in the course of the burn.

Faye was treating him with Rescue Remedy, the over-the-counter homeopathic that was supposedly effective for shock, as well with lobelia and skullcap—the same remedies that had been ineffective in treating minor scrapes and bruises for the children. Gene could barely ingest the medicine, since his throat had been entirely scarred from the burn. Still, **he insisted that he’d rather die than go to the hospital.**

Because he couldn’t take liquid, he was also succumbing to dehydration. The hospital offered to send a chopper to airlift him, but again Faye and Gene refused the treatment. **He insisted on feeling what he described as “the Lord’s pain.”**

Yet, somehow, against all odds, he survived. This survival would only serve to strengthen his fanatical beliefs. It was the ultimate vindication:**he had endured a fiery trial by the Lord’s hand and come out the other side**. It also solidified Faye’s belief (and the faith of those around her) in the power of her homeopathy. In her mind, her herbal remedies had seen her husband through a horrific third-degree burn. To Gene and Faye, **their faith had now been rewarded and affirmed by the Almighty.**

Sure enough, word spread of the supposedly miraculous healing powers of Faye’s homeopathy. Her business started booming, bringing the Westover family more cash than they’d ever had before. They began adding new rooms to the house and soon commanded a homeopathic business empire, with rooms full of employees and orders from all across the country. As Tara was to recall, her parents were now **“the best-funded lunatics in the Mountain West.”**

### Off to Cambridge

When Tara returned to school, **she committed herself to studying history and politics**. She realized that this was where her true intellectual passions lay. Her strong performance in a Jewish history course deeply impressed one of her professors. He became more intrigued by Tara when he discovered that she had only become aware of the Holocaust during her freshman year of college.

To have learned so much in such a short time, with no background knowledge, was nothing short of remarkable. He recommended that **she apply to a study-abroad program at the University of Cambridge in England** (which she’d never heard of before). Although her application was initially rejected, this professor made sure that Tara was accepted, once he shared with the admissions council the story of her upbringing.

Cambridge was unlike anything Tara had ever seen before. She was awed by the beautiful medieval architecture and the aura of ancient learning that seemed to pervade every corner of the campus. She thought she was dreaming when she set foot there, never believing that her imagination could produce anything quite so grand.

Her supervisor was the esteemed Professor Jonathan Steinberg, a global authority on the history of 20th-century Germany and the Holocaust. After speaking with him, she realized she wanted to study historiography, the study of _how_ history is written.

She wanted to study how the gatekeepers of history had overcome their own ignorance, just as she had, and come to understand the past. As history was a constantly evolving field of study, with new intellectual frameworks and new pieces of evidence rewriting the story, even the great historians like Thomas Carlyle and Edward Gibbon could now be shown to have been wrong about key events. By studying them, **Tara could hope to come to terms with her own distorted understanding of history.**

Professor Steinberg was a masterful intellectual guide. He pointed her toward the key works that she needed to study and also helped refine her style as a writer. He was as strict about grammar and sentence construction as he was about content, even questioning the specific placement of commas in Tara’s work. Tara flowered as a scholar under his tutelage. When she handed in her essay comparing the works of the 18th-century Anglo-Irish philosopher Edmund Burke with the _Federalist Papers,_ Steinberg was stunned by the quality of her work. He told her that **it was one of the best essays he’d read in his 30 years at Cambridge.** He told her that he would make sure she was accepted into whatever graduate program she chose to attend—and that _he_ would take care of the fees.

Tara had earned her place. For the first time in her life, she believed that **she had as much of a right to a fulfilling and intellectually enriched life as anyone else**. Her strengths were innate—they had _always_ been a part of who she was. It was only now that they were being given the chance to flourish.

Steinberg made good on his promise, sending Tara the paperwork to apply for the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, which would provide for her room, board, and tuition for her graduate studies in England. She was accepted into the program after her first interview.
