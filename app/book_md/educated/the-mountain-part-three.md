## The Mountain, Part Three

Tara’s final years living full-time under her parents’ roof brought new challenges. As she matured into her teenage years, she saw that there would be new attempts by the highly patriarchal men in her life to control her body and sexuality. She also experienced a painful lesson in how crucial a role violence played in her family dynamic.

### Song and Dance

By the time Tara was 11, she knew she wanted to get away from the junkyard. Following her older sister Audrey’s lead, Tara decided to get a job in town.

She went to the local gas station and posted a card advertising her services as a babysitter. Soon, she had her calendar filled with babysitting jobs. Of course, **she was available at all times since she didn’t go to school herself.** These jobs gave Tara a strong feeling of accomplishment and some real autonomy. She had some money of her own, where she’d had _none_ before.

Through another babysitting contact, Tara learned of a dance class that took place in the back of the local gas station/convenience store. When she showed up to participate, she saw that this new activity would clash with **her father’s stern, paternalistic morals regarding women and sexuality**. She would have to wear an “immodest” leotard and dance shoes, clothing that would reveal her legs above the ankles.

Faye actually supported her daughter in this endeavor, taking her to the mall to buy the necessary clothes—under strict orders, however, not to show Gene. **She was learning how to lie to her father** , to conceal parts of her life and her identity that she knew would run afoul of his religious ideals.

Eventually, however, Gene found out the truth about the dance class and stopped Tara from going, telling her that the only things she was learning were promiscuity and immodesty. **His censoring of her female identity and self-expression** was a grim portend for what his attitude would be toward her as she entered puberty and womanhood.

In a sequence that would come to be repeated many times over the years,**Faye ultimately yielded to Gene** and took his side in the dispute, where she had previously been supportive of Tara.

But Faye still sought another outlet for her youngest daughter. She subsequently enrolled Tara in voice classes, which she paid for with her earnings from her homeopathy practice. Tara did well and eventually became good enough to start singing in church. Her performance met with praise from many of the Westovers’ friends and acquaintances in the congregation.

Gene, surprisingly, was beaming with pride, telling everyone how blessed the family was to have someone with talent like Tara’s. Looking back, Tara notes that her father seemed to let go of his paranoia and anger when he heard her sing. For those brief moments, he was transported—and transformed.

Tara landed the leading role in a local production of _Annie_ when she was 13. Going to the auditions and rehearsals**** opened Tara’s eyes to a new world and a new community of people who were different—**people who weren’t preparing for the end of the world.**

This contrast appeared especially stark as the year 2000 approached, and Gene became fixated by a new source of paranoia: Y2K.

### Y2K

**Gene was a Y2K conspiracy theorist** , believing that all computers would shut down when the clock struck midnight on January 1, 2000. According to this theory, this would cause the world’s electrical, water, and nuclear systems to melt down, bringing about widespread looting, panic, death, and destruction.

Gene took steps to prepare his family for what he saw as an inevitable result of man’s foolish and heretical faith in modern technology.

  * The family set to work preparing canned food and even stockpiled a thousand-gallon tank of gas on the property to be ready for the day when they would have to take to the road.
  * Disturbingly, **Gene somehow acquired a fifty-caliber anti-aircraft rifle, allegedly for the family’s protection and safety.**



In many ways, Gene looked _forward_ to the end of civilization at Y2K with a strange sort of glee. He saw it as a vindication of his beliefs and had made a point of reminding everyone at church how well-prepared his family was for the chaos that would soon descend.

The failure of the world to end, then, sent Gene into a deep emotional tailspin. Tara recalls his disappointment as the clock turned from 12:00 to 12:10 to 1:30 AM, with no signs of electricity failing or civilization collapsing. **His prophecy had been a false one.**

Even as an adolescent, Tara saw her father as being smaller and more frail in that moment. His disappointment made him oddly childlike. She even wondered what sort of cruel God could deny him what he’d been preparing his whole life for. His spirit was broken.

### Shawn

The next sequence of events in Tara’s life was all-too-familiar. Her father sank into a deep depression over the failure of Y2K to materialize, which necessitated another trip to Arizona to revive his spirits.

During the trip, of course, he harried Tara’s grandmother over her use of modern medicine (a recurring source of conflict between the two) and touted the effectiveness of Faye’s herbal remedies.

Much as the Arizona trip of a few years ago had ended, one day Gene abruptly announced that the family would be heading back to Idaho, once again in the middle of the night. As the family raced through a blinding Utah snowstorm, they experienced yet _another_ violent car crash, in which Tara severely injured her neck.

In the weeks following _this_ crash, Tara experienced great difficulty moving her neck. Her mother’s by-now-standard**homeopathic treatments and energy healing did nothing to alleviate her pain.**

It was at this time that a figure with whom she’d had little previous contact entered her life: her older brother Shawn. Being the youngest, Tara had a minimal relationship with Shawn up to this point, as he had left the family home at 17 to pursue work in trucking and welding. He had now returned home after many years of being away. **Shawn had an unsavory reputation in the community** , being well-known as a bully, brawler, and all-around provocateur.

Tara soon had her own firsthand experience with Shawn’s volatility when **he, without warning, put his hands around her head and violently twisted it** —to help pop her neck back into place following the accident, or so he claimed. This harsh “treatment” actually _did_ help: Tara could once again pivot her neck. But his non-consensual laying of hands on Tara foreshadowed what was to come between the two siblings. Tara would spend much of the rest of her time on Buck’s Peak subject to **Shawn’s displays of kindness, which were all too often followed by displays of terrifying cruelty and violence.**

Other warning signs of Shawn’s unstable and combative personality soon emerged. When he would drive her to rehearsals at the theater, Shawn would bait and bully Tara’s friends there. He would flick off their hats or knock soda out of their hands, to dominate and humiliate them.

#### Long-Haul Trucking Trip

Shortly after Shawn came back home, he invited Tara to come along with him on a long-haul trucking job down the West Coast. Tara agreed, excited by the possibility of travel and the opportunity to spend time with this mysterious older brother about whom she knew so little.

The trip was hazardous from the start: Shawn was operating on little sleep and even faked the reports at inspection points to make it look like he was getting more rest than he actually was. The more menacing side of his personality also presented itself to Tara. One night, he decided to teach her martial arts, **explaining to her how to inflict maximum damage and pain** on one’s opponent with only two fingers. He also showed her techniques like how to throw her full body weight behind a punch and crush someone’s windpipe. Clearly, **Shawn had an appetite for violence**.

But Tara was still enjoying the time with her brother. She recalls passing the time with him by playing elaborate word games, learning trucker lingo, eating junk food, and playing video games—all new experiences for her. The undercurrent of violence was there, but had not yet fully surfaced.

#### Sadie

Tara was also learning that**Shawn could be _emotionally_ abusive, especially to women and girls. **He’d become acquainted with a girl named Sadie who was involved in the same theater as Tara. Sadie had a crush on Shawn, and he used that leverage to manipulate and psychologically torture this girl every chance he got.

If he saw her speaking with another boy, Shawn would give Sadie the cold shoulder and refuse to speak to her. Other times, he would force her to buy items for him, only to change his mind and chastise her for bringing him the wrong thing. He would repeat this exercise with her several times over the course of a given night.

Eventually, **Sadie began altering her behavior to appease Shawn’s volatile personality**. She even demanded that boys at school stop walking next to her, lest Shawn see them when he picked her up after school.

#### The First Attack

Eventually, it would be Tara’s turn to be a direct recipient of Shawn’s wrath. One day, Shawn ordered her to fetch him a glass of water, and threatened not to drive her into town the next day if she didn’t comply. Perhaps tired of his bossiness, Tara dumped the glass on his head. Shawn’s reaction was swift and brutal.

He chased Tara down the hallway and demanded she apologize. When she refused,**he lifted her off the ground by her hair, dragged her into the bathroom, and pushed her head into the toilet**.

He then used on her one of the same torture techniques he had taught her on their recent road trip: twisting her wrist and pushing it in a spiral against her inner forearm, causing excruciating pain.

### Indecency

Tara turned 15 in September 2001—the same month as the 9/11 attacks. While this major geopolitical event sparked the predictable doomsday proclamations from Gene, his predictions of a struggle for the Holy Land were second on Tara’s mind. She was now fully in puberty, which brought increased attention to her body and**new efforts by the men in her life to control her sexuality**.

She recalls her body changing at this time as she reached sexual maturity. Most of all, the full weight of **her family’s highly patriarchal and often misogynistic views on women, marriage, and sexuality** soon began to press upon Tara. Gene became obsessed with the alleged indecency of women in the community, with family dinners marked by his denunciations of short hemlines and low-cut blouses. Tara recalls **not wanting to be seen as one of _these_ women **at this stage of her life.

Gene was hardly the only source of sexual repression in the household, however. **Shawn also began to shame Tara for her alleged acts of impropriety.** He harshly chastised her for her friendship with Charles, a young man she met at the theatre, telling Tara that she was developing a reputation for being “ _that_ kind of girl.” He also started calling her a “whore” for wearing makeup and lip gloss. One night, as punishment, Shawn forced his youngest sister to walk home for 12 miles in the sub-zero conditions of an Idaho winter.

The abuse only continued as Tara got deeper into her teen years. One morning, she woke up to a blinding pain of what felt like needles in her brain and throat. It dawned on her that**Shawn was astride her, choking her with both hands, while screaming “Slut!” and “Whore!** ” It was only through the intervention of her mother and Tyler that Tara survived the assault.

Yet Shawn could also be fiercely protective of Tara. This protectiveness, too, may have been rooted in Shawn’s need for dominance and control (and his patriarchal notions about needing to “guard” women), but it was certainly a part of his overall behavior toward his sister.

For example, Tara recalls Shawn standing up to Gene and physically threatening him when he saw that Gene had tried to force Tara to operate a dangerous hydraulic metal-cutting tool at the junkyard. Indeed, Shawn was the _only_ one who could stand up to Gene on a consistent basis—and win.

**Tara’s feelings toward Shawn were complicated**. On the one hand, he was a violent abuser who seemed to have little regard for the physical and emotional safety of others. On the other hand, however, she did enjoy a special bond with him.

Around this time, Shawn was severely injured when he hit a cow with his motorcycle while driving home in the dark. Tara recalls her horror at witnessing the scene of the accident and her fear that Shawn would die. She even made the decision to take him to the hospital, where she’d never been before.

### Preparing to Leave

Shawn’s assault and his _own_ injury shortly thereafter were defining moments for Tara. She knew she had to leave the instability and volatility of the Westover home. In this, she received encouragement from Tyler. He told her that she was reaching a point where **if she did not get out soon, she would _never_ get out.**

He suggested to her that she try to enroll at Brigham Young University in Utah. He pointed out that the school had a history of accepting homeschooled students and that all she would need to do was pass the ACT, a standardized test for college admissions in the United States.

Even as a teenager, Tara could see the life she was destined for if she stayed on Buck’s Peak. **She would be married off at 18 or 19** , and she and her husband would be given some remote corner of the family property on which to build a house and start their own family. She would likely have a life which replicated that of her own mother: **learning homeopathy, bearing children, and acting as a midwife.**

Tara was now determined to get out, to seek a different life off of Buck’s Peak, just as Tyler had done. She drove 40 miles to the nearest bookstore and purchased an ACT study guide. But after being confounded by the algebraic notations in the math section, she realized just how deep her ignorance ran. It wasn’t simply that she didn’t know how to solve the problems—she didn’t even recognize the _symbols_. **She was mathematically illiterate**.

The next day, she drove the same distance to purchase an algebra textbook: she now knew that **she would need to cram years worth of learning into a few short months.** Tara set to work teaching herself the most basic mathematical operations like multiplying fractions and decimals—things she would have mastered _years_ before, had she had the benefit of a proper education.

But slowly, painstakingly, she made progress. She even began to understand the abstraction of trigonometry, thanks to some key help from Tyler in deciphering what had once been an unintelligible mathematical language.

She also received encouragement from her mother. In unguarded moments, away from her husband’s denunciations of liberalism and secularism, **Faye was occasionally capable of being quite supportive of Tara’s ambitions.** When Tara expressed some hesitation about her decision to go to college, Faye was steadfast. **“Of all my children, you were the one I thought would burst out of here in a blaze. Don’t let anything stop you from going.”**

#### ACT

Tara was nervous about her chances when the time came to take the test. While she’d made progress, her math skills were still substandard. She also lacked a basic understanding of grammar, and the only science book she’d ever read had detachable pages for coloring.

Because she would be applying to BYU at 16 (two years before most kids go to college), she needed to earn a high score of 27 on the test to be admitted. Thus, she not only needed to make up for a lifetime of missed education,**she needed to do _better_ than her peers.**

When she showed up on test day, everything was unfamiliar. She’d never taken a test (this wasn’t part of Faye’s “doing school”), so she was unfamiliar with how a scantron worked or where to mark down her answers. She was at a total disadvantage.

Tara scored a 22 on her first attempt, short of what she needed for BYU. But she was heartened nonetheless: she wasn’t _that_ far off the mark and she had scored better than she thought she could, given how much was stacked against her. On her next attempt, she scored a 28.

#### Acceptance

Elated by this achievement, Tara applied to BYU the following week and told her father that she would no longer work for him in the junkyard. Tyler helped her write her application, telling the admissions board that she’d been educated according to a strict curriculum designed by her mother (though this was an obvious falsehood).

She was still troubled by pangs of guilt that she was somehow betraying her family, but she also knew that going to college was the right decision for her. Sure enough, she was accepted for the January semester. While disapproving of Tara’s decision to go to college, Gene saw her achievement as a vindication of his way of life, remarking, **“It proves our home school is as good as any public education.”**
