## Exercise: Move Away From a Positional Mindset

Whether you are a new leader or have identified yourself as a long-time positional leader, you can work your way up to the next level.

* * *

Decide what kind of leader you want to be by answering three questions: First, ask, "Who am I?" (Think about your strengths and weaknesses, temperament, work habits, and the kind of people you get along with.)

Next, ask “What values are important to me?” (Think about acceptable and desirable behaviors beyond just following the rules, your method of gaining trust and respect, and your most important goals.)

Lastly, ask “What habits and systems do I want to practice?” (Think about what you’ll do when you get to work each morning, how you’ll stay organized, how you’ll relate with people.)

If you’ve been thinking of your career goals as specific positions, change your focus and rewrite your goals with a non-positional mindset. What kind of positive impact do you want to make on your team and your organization?

Who could you ask to be your mentor? What do you like about their leadership style, and what questions would you like to ask them?
