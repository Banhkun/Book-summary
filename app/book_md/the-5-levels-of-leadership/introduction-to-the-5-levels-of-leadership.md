## Introduction to the 5 Levels of Leadership

To Maxwell, leadership equals influence; therefore, the more influence you have, the more you’re able to contribute to an organization and get other people to become more productive, and the higher up the leadership ladder you can go. The 5 Levels of Leadership show how your influence progresses as you grow:

  * **Level 1: Position.** Title-based—people follow you because of your role.
  * **Level 2: Permission.** Relationship-based—people follow you because of your influence and their trust in you. 
  * **Level 3: Production.** Results-based—people follow you because you get things done.
  * **Level 4: People Development.** Empowerment-based—people follow you because you’ve invested in them and helped them become leaders themselves. 
  * **Level 5: Pinnacle.** Legacy-based—people follow you because you have a reputation for developing strong leaders and strong organizations. 



Maxwell states that knowing these 5 Levels of Leadership has several benefits: It gives you a clear idea of what leadership looks like, breaks down the process of becoming the best leader into practical steps, encourages you to continuously grow and work toward the next level, and shapes your principles and values.

(Shortform note: Maxwell’s leadership model seems to be inspired by a mix of theories. While he seems to subscribe to **behavioral theory** , in that he believes that anyone can learn practical tools to become a leader, he also seems to believe in **trait theory**. He writes that only naturally gifted leaders ever make it to Level 5. Overall, Maxwell seems to lean toward **transformational leadership** , which is about interacting with followers to inspire them to grow: He writes that good leadership is ultimately about putting your personal advancement aside and focusing on advancing your team.)

> **Can Social Media Influencers Be Considered Leaders?**
> 
> If we were to take Maxwell’s original definition of leadership—that it’s nothing more than influence and that you can only be a leader if you have followers—then social media influencers may be considered today’s leaders: They influence people’s buying behavior and have followers numbering in the thousands or even millions. It’s safe to assume that getting people to buy a particular brand of makeup isn’t what Maxwell would consider leadership. This again highlights the limitations of his definition because it doesn’t take into consideration the purpose of the influence wielded.
> 
> The expanded definitions of influence and leadership from Maxwell’s team, Burkus, and Kruse —discussed in the Shortform introduction—effectively delineate between influencers and leaders. Influencers do not share a common vision or goal as their followers. They’re primarily driven by personal financial gain, while followers are mainly driven by their desire to become more like the influencer. Their goals are chiefly for their own self-interest. Some experts also make the distinction between influencers and leaders by stressing that while influence is necessary for leadership, it’s not the only component.

### What to Expect When You’re Moving Up

Maxwell offers these insights to help you as you work your way up:

**1\. Each level is a building block for the next.** You can’t move up to the next level without having first laid the foundation with the previous one.

(Shortform note: Unlike Maxwell, Collins doesn’t think it’s necessary to gain mastery over one level before moving on to the next. He states that development doesn’t have to be linear and that you can gain traits and characteristics from other levels later on—for example, you can be great at rallying the troops without necessarily being productive yourself. But he believes that Level 5 leaders possess all the traits and characteristics of those in other levels.)

**2\. Your level of leadership varies from person to person and from place to place.** When you hire a new team member, he might see you as a Level 1 leader, while a long-standing team member may look to you as a Level 4 leader. Similarly, even if you’ve built yourself up to Level 3, you might have to start from scratch once you move to a new organization—you seldom take your leadership level with you when working with a new group of people.

(Shortform note: If you’re a new team leader, you need to establish team dynamics right from the start. Some of the ways you can do this: Get to know your team members before diving right into work, clarify your priorities and expectations, brief onboarding team members instead of assuming their co-workers will get them up to speed, and communicate as much as you can through meetings, e-mail, and reports.)

**3\. The climb takes much longer than the fall.** Working your way up can be long and arduous, but one mistake can easily send you back down to a lower level of leadership. However, if you’ve built a solid foundation, you can take comfort in the fact that a lower level can serve as a safety net. For example, a productivity-damaging decision in Level 3 won’t necessarily be catastrophic as the relationships you built in Level 2 can cushion your fall.

(Shortform note: A mistake doesn’t mean the end of your career. Minimize the damage from a career misstep by staying calm and finding a solution as quickly as possible, being accountable, then learning from the experience.)

**4\. Your growth is intrinsically tied to the growth of your people.** Your relationship with your people is symbiotic. Those you lead can only go as far as you take them, so by working to become a better leader, you are also helping them reach their potential. At the same time, you can only move up as far as they are willing to follow you. When you help them reach their potential, you increase their trust in you and your influence, which will help buoy you to the next levels of leadership.

(Shortform note: When dealing with employees who are resistant to change and growth, try these tips: Ask them to change their behavior, not their personality; come up with incentives that lean into their motivation; and reflect on your own behavior to see if your actions are aligned with your words—you may be sending your direct reports mixed signals.)

> **How Collins’s Leadership Hierarchy Compares**
> 
> In _Good to Great_ , Jim Collins devotes a chapter to Level 5 Leadership. His hierarchy differs from Maxwell’s in that it focuses on individual contributions at Levels 1 and 2. You become a manager at Level 3 and only become a leader at Level 4:
> 
>   * Level 1: A capable contributor
> 
>   * Level 2: A productive team member
> 
>   * Level 3: An effective manager
> 
>   * Level 4: A leader who can inspire subordinates and achieve higher performance
> 
>   * Level 5: A leader who funnels personal ambition into company success
> 
> 

> 
> While Maxwell views higher levels of leadership as an indication of greater influence, Collins makes no mention of influence in his discussion of Level 5 leadership. The main theme running through Collins’s model is not the growth of influence but the growth in a person’s abilities and contributions.
