## Exercise: Earn Your People’s Permission to Lead Them

Start building relationships and start earning your team’s trust, confidence, and permission to lead.

* * *

Be your team’s No. 1 encourager. List the names of all your team members below and put something positive beside each name (is always willing to help teammates, makes excellent presentations, and so on). In the next week, find a way to tell each member his or her positive points.

Evaluate your relationships. Answer the following questions about each team member:

  * What are three non-work-related things I know about this person?
  * What is important to this person?
  * What are this person’s current concerns?
  * What is this person’s biggest dream?



If you can’t answer these questions, schedule one-on-one time with your team members to get to know them.
