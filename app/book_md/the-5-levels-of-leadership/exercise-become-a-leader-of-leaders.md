## Exercise: Become a Leader of Leaders

Go from being a producer to being a developer of people.

* * *

Level 4 leaders need to overcome their insecurities to be effective. To find out if you need to work on this area, answer yes or no to the following questions:

  * Do you happily listen to other people’s ideas?
  * Do you accept when their ideas are better than yours?
  * Do you give credit to others when your team experiences success?
  * Do you take accountability for your team’s failings?
  * Do you entrust them with their tasks instead of micromanaging?



If you answered no to any of the questions, reflect on why that is. What can you do to overcome this?

As a Level 4 leader, you need to spend half your time mentoring your top leadership candidates. List your team members and determine the top 20% based on their strengths and the organization’s needs.

How can you use your strengths to mentor the top 20% of your team members?

Developing people also means helping them improve outside of work. For each team member, answer the following questions to see if there’s anyone who needs your guidance:

  * Are there any holes in this person’s life skills?
  * Are there negative influences in this person’s life?
  * In what areas does this person seem to need help?
