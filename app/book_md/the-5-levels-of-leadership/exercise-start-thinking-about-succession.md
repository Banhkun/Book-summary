## Exercise: Start Thinking About Succession

The only way you can leave a legacy is if you develop other people to carry on the work.

* * *

Crucible moments can be powerful teaching tools. Think back on your own crucible moments. Reflect on one or two of them. What did they teach you?

Identify people in your organization who have the potential to be Level 4 or Level 5 leaders. Group them into categories: leaders on the inside track, leaders with potential, long shots.

Take the time to mentor the people on your list each week. Answer the following questions to guide you as you mentor them:

  * What are the leadership lessons they need to learn?
  * How can I teach each of these lessons?
  * Which of my crucible moments can I use to demonstrate each lesson?
  * What are their own crucible moments?
  * Who among my circle can give them additional lessons?
