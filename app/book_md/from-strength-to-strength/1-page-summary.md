## 1-Page Summary

In _From Strength to Strength_ , management expert Arthur Brooks says that as we get older, our professional skills decline, and we can no longer succeed in our current jobs. However, he explains, this isn’t something to fear—with the right mindset, the second half of your life can be even happier and more meaningful than the first. If you find a job that suits your changing skill set, and if you change your idea of “success” from career achievement and material wealth to happiness and fulfillment, you can continue to thrive even as your professional skills decline.

Brooks is a bestselling author, a public speaker, and a Harvard Professor of Management Practice. He’s also a corporate coach specializing in leadership and workplace happiness. His own declining professional skills inspired him to seek out ways to find happiness and fulfillment in his later years. He used what he learned to write _From Strength to Strength_ , which became a #1 New York Times Bestseller immediately upon release. Brooks has also written several other books exploring themes of personal happiness, societal unity, and social progress, and he’s co-authored a self-help book with Oprah Winfrey. He holds a PhD in public policy analysis, as well as honorary doctorates from numerous universities.

In this guide, we’ll start by explaining how and why you lose your job skills as you get older—and why it might happen much sooner than you think. We’ll then discuss two possible solutions to this problem:

  * Finding work that better suits your changing skills
  * Rethinking your ideas about success: specifically, pursuing “life success”—living a well-rounded life full of contentment and love—instead of professional success 



In our commentary, we’ll discuss whether this professional decline really is inevitable and explore some methods to keep your mind sharp. We’ll also offer some concrete, actionable strategies for making the most of your life as you age.

### The Problem: Professional Decline

Brooks begins by saying that for people working in practically any skilled job, **professional decline sets in sometime between their late 30s and early 50s.** This means that they start losing their job skills—they can’t think as quickly and solving problems becomes more difficult. Further, if the job is physically demanding, they find themselves becoming physically weaker and more prone to injury.

For example, statistically speaking, scientists and inventors are most likely to make significant breakthroughs before age 40; doing so after age 70 is practically unheard of. Creative professionals like authors and artists tend to succeed for a bit longer, but they still most commonly win awards in their 40s or 50s and then experience sharp declines in their later years.

This decline happens in large part because the prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain that controls higher-order thought processes like reasoning and creativity—starts to shrink around this time. You can’t prevent this from happening, no matter how well you take care of yourself; you also can’t overcome its effects, no matter how hard you work.

> **Counterpoint: Professional and Cognitive Decline Aren’t Certain**
> 
> Brooks backs up his claim with significant evidence, ranging from statistics about who won awards and when to biological facts about how the brain ages. That said, he appears to be the sole major proponent of this theory of professional decline—for instance, a Google search for “professional decline” mostly turns up articles by Brooks himself, or people quoting him.
> 
> On the other hand, there are many stories of people who began highly successful careers when, according to Brooks, they should have already been well into this decline. Further, one group of researchers found that physicists don’t peak in their 20s or 30s, as is commonly believed, but rather at 48 years old. And, at least one study shows that cognitive decline doesn’t affect everyone; some people can go their entire lives without losing their creativity and drive.
> 
> Nonetheless, it may still be valuable to make plans for your later years in case you _do_ experience such a decline. In fact, “recareering”—changing professions in your 40s or later—has become very common, while holding a single job for your entire life is rare.

### Solution #1: Find Work That Suits Your Changing Brain

While professional decline sounds disheartening, Brooks says you can turn this potential deterioration into an opportunity to find new types of success in the second half of your life.

To clarify how a mental decline can lead you to new kinds of success, Brooks first explains that you’re not really getting less intelligent as you age; rather, you’re becoming weaker in some areas but stronger in others. Therefore, to continue being successful in your career, you just need to start relying on a different _type_ of intelligence and find work that suits this different skill set.

In this section, we’ll first discuss the two types of intelligence and how they change as we age. Then, we’ll discuss the career shift that Brooks recommends making due to this change.

#### The Two Types of Intelligence

According to Brooks, British psychologist Raymond Cattell believes there are two different types of intelligence: one that relies on creativity and quick thinking, and one that relies on knowledge and experience.****

(Shortform note: It’s a common misconception that “intelligence” refers to a single ability; as Jim Kwik explains in _Limitless_ , many people think they’re not intelligent because they don’t do well on IQ tests. However, IQ—the commonly accepted measurement of intelligence—only measures your ability to solve specific types of problems using logic. Kwik says there are numerous other types of intelligence, and everyone is exceptionally smart in at least one way. For example, one person might be extremely good at understanding big ideas, while another is detail-oriented. Both people could be geniuses in their own ways, but if they try to take on each others’ roles, they’d struggle and end up feeling unintelligent.)

The first type of intelligence is what Cattell calls _fluid intelligence_. This is your ability to reason, innovate, discover new things, and devise creative solutions to problems. This type of intelligence peaks in early adulthood, and then starts to decline in your 30s or 40s. **Unfortunately, this is the type of intelligence that many skilled jobs rely on,** which is why Brooks says your professional skills will also begin to deteriorate around that time.

(Shortform note: While an eventual decline may be inevitable, there are numerous ways to “exercise” your brain and boost your fluid intelligence. Anything that pushes your mental limits, such as learning new skills or playing strategic games like Chess or Go, will strengthen your brain. Taking good care of yourself is also crucial to keeping your skills sharp: a healthy diet, good sleep habits, and regular exercise will all help boost your creativity and focus regardless of your age.)

The second type of intelligence is what Cattell calls _crystallized intelligence_. This is the sum total of what you’ve learned in your life, which means it just keeps increasing (barring an injury or disease that affects your brain). In other words, as the creativity of youth fades, the wisdom and experience of age grow stronger and take its place.

(Shortform note: There are also ways to boost your crystallized intelligence. Learning any kind of new information will strengthen your memory, along with your ability to solve problems using established knowledge rather than innovation. For example, learning a new language, taking a class, and reading will all boost this kind of intelligence.)

#### Find a Job That Uses Your Crystallized Intelligence

Brooks says that leaning into your crystallized intelligence will allow you to be successful in your later years. He suggests **switching to a career path that relies on your accrued knowledge and experience** (rather than your waning reasoning and creativity). This usually means a position in which you’re guiding other people, such as a counselor, an advisor, or a coach.

In short, **instead of despairing over the abilities you’ll lose as you age, take pride and joy in the knowledge you’ll continue to gain** —and think about how you can use your wisdom to help others.

> **Radical Acceptance of Your Professional Decline**
> 
> Changing your mindset about losing your skills is much easier said than done. A large part of making that shift is being able to _accept_ what’s happening to you rather than trying to fight it or deny that it’s happening. In _Radical Acceptance_ , Tara Brach provides a strategy derived from Buddhist teachings that can help you accept difficult things, such as the decline of your fluid intelligence.
> 
> This strategy first involves asking yourself friendly questions about what you’re experiencing. You’re seeking only to _understand_ , not to judge, those experiences; Brach suggests imagining that you’re talking to a good friend, someone whom you’d listen to without berating or offering unwanted advice to.
> 
> So, if you find yourself struggling with a task that used to come easily to you, you might ask yourself what you’re feeling at the moment—frustration, embarrassment, or confusion might be common answers in this situation. You could also ask yourself why you’re having trouble; perhaps because you’re struggling to come up with a solution to some problem you’ve encountered or because you’re finding it difficult to stay focused.
> 
> Once you understand what you’re experiencing in that moment, the second aspect of _r_ adical acceptance is compassion: feeling love and care for yourself and what you’re experiencing. In other words, don’t criticize yourself for your declining skills or rage against the aging process. Again, you could imagine that you’re talking to a good friend and hold yourself with the same care and sympathy you’d extend to that other person. Only after you’ve achieved understanding _and_ compassion can you start to truly accept your situation.
> 
> The secret of this technique is to **not make an enemy where no enemy exists.** The decline of your professional skills isn’t something to be fought: It’s simply your reality at that moment. By accepting and embracing your reality for what it is—rather than trying to force reality to be what you want it to be—you leave yourself free to do as Brooks suggests: look for ways to make the most of the abilities you _do_ have.

### Solution #2: Redefine “Success”

Finding a career where you can keep excelling as you get older is important, but it’s only one part of a successful later life. Brooks says that **to feel truly happy and fulfilled at this time, you also need to rethink your goals.** Chasing career achievements, wealth, and prestige won’t be satisfying forever. That’s why, instead of continuing to focus on professional success, you should dedicate yourself to _life success_ —in other words, living a well-rounded life full of contentment and love.

**Achieving life success is all about finding a healthy work-life balance.** In other words, don’t give up on work, but don’t neglect other areas of your life either: Spending time with your family and friends and practicing your faith (if any) contributes to your life success. You’ll know you’ve found life success when your happiness doesn’t rely on the dopamine burst you get from a personal achievement; instead, contentment will be your normal state of being.

(Shortform note: In _Eat That Frog!_ , Brian Tracy gives some specific advice on establishing a better work-life balance, which may help you to achieve life success. First, he says to determine the three most important things you do at work—you’ll probably find that a relatively small number of your duties produce the majority of your value to the company. Do those three things first each day, so instead of getting bogged down in countless smaller tasks, you’ll have time and energy after work to do what makes you happy. Also, set personal goals in three areas: financial/career, relationship/family, and health/fitness. Pursuing those goals, instead of devoting all your time to work, will help you build a balanced and satisfying life.)

> **Is Happiness a Choice?**
> 
> Brooks discusses numerous choices you can make to become happier in your later years, such as choosing different life goals and career paths. However, some research shows contentment may simply come from choosing to pay attention to things that make you happy.
> 
> Some surveys and studies have shown that seniors tend to be happier than younger adults, which goes against the common assumption that people must become less happy as their abilities decline and the end of life draws closer. Further research into why seniors seem happier than their younger counterparts showed that they often focus on positive things and disregard negative things. For example, one study showed that older people tended to look away from unpleasant images, and they paid more attention to pleasant images than younger people who were shown those same images.
> 
> Researchers found the same trend among young people with terminal illnesses and, in some cases, among people who witnessed tragedies like the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center. This suggests that people tend to focus on things that bring happiness when they come to understand that their lives could end at any time—a realization that’s often a result of aging but can also come from other sources. In other words, when people realize that their time is limited, they often shift their goals to maximizing their happiness in whatever time they have left.
> 
> In short, it’s possible that by making conscious decisions about where you direct your attention, you can make yourself happier.

Let’s discuss three specific ways Brooks says you can find life success: by prioritizing your eulogy values, nurturing your connections with other people, and finding (or practicing) a system of beliefs that’s meaningful to you.

#### Strategy #1: Find Life Success Through Your Eulogy Values

One way to pursue life success is to **start prioritizing what Brooks calls _eulogy virtues_ —so-called because they’re qualities that people might talk about at your funeral.**

Eulogy values might include always helping people who need it, standing by your loved ones during difficult times, or lighting up a room with your unique sense of humor. Note that, rather than one-time achievements, these tend to be character traits and lifestyle choices; in other words, things that you do continuously throughout your life. These are things that will bring you lasting happiness and fulfillment.

(Shortform note: Robin Sharma’s book _Who Will Cry When You Die? _offers one possible method for prioritizing your eulogy virtues: View every single day as if it were a micro-version of your whole life. If the way you live today reflected the way you live your entire life, what would you do with your 24 hours? Would you mindlessly chase after success or devote time to cultivating your eulogy values—to improving the lives of those around you?)

In contrast, many people (especially young people) tend to focus on their _résumé virtues_. **These are accomplishments that you might use to impress others** —for example, holding a prestigious job title, winning a world-class competition, or earning a degree from a highly selective school.

Brooks says that these kinds of accomplishments only bring you fleeting, worldly rewards like money or fame. Furthermore, those rewards fade quickly unless you keep accomplishing more and more—which, remember, will become more difficult as you age. Anything that requires you to compete against or compare yourself to others probably falls into this category.

> **Why Are We Driven to Compete With Others?**
> 
> If competing with others only brings fleeting rewards, why are we so driven to do it? One possible explanation is that it’s an evolutionary holdover—in other words, competitiveness may be coded into our genes because our ancestors _had_ to compete with each other for food, shelter, and mates.
> 
> However, as biologist Richard Dawkins says in _The Selfish Gene_ , humans aren’t slaves to their genetic programming; we’re unusual (possibly unique) in our ability to consciously choose to go against our biological drives. For example, our genes should compel us to have as many children as possible, but many people choose not to have children at all. Therefore, we can still follow Brooks’s advice and choose to pursue eulogy values over competition-based rewards.

#### Strategy #2: Find Life Success Through Your Connections

Another key theme in Brooks’s suggestions for pursuing life success is that **competing against others brings professional success while connecting with others brings life success.**

Brooks believes that nobody can live purely as an individual. People naturally support one another emotionally, intellectually, and even materially. The more you embrace that interconnectedness—the more you decide to love and support the people around you and accept their love in return—the happier you’ll be.

Conversely, trying to go against that natural order by isolating yourself or selfishly chasing professional success your whole life will leave you stressed, lonely, and unhappy.

(Shortform note: Scientific data backs up Brooks’s argument here: Loneliness is extremely harmful to both mental and physical health, especially for older people. Loneliness and isolation are linked to an increased risk of health conditions ranging from anxiety and depression to heart disease and strokes. In fact, some experts say that loneliness is almost as bad for you as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day.)

According to Brooks, some research suggests healthy relationships are the single most important factor in maintaining your physical, mental, and emotional health as you age. While other factors, like body weight and alcohol consumption, did affect people’s overall well-being, **the healthiest and happiest people—almost without fail—were the ones who were most satisfied with their relationships.**

> **How to Cultivate Your Connections**
> 
> Brooks stresses the importance of interpersonal connections, but he doesn’t offer much advice on how to cultivate them. Furthermore, it’s notoriously hard for adults to make friends. So, here are a few tips to help.
> 
> One of the easiest ways to make new friends is to join a group that interests you, where you’ll naturally meet other people who share that interest. It also helps to be bold—to make friends you wouldn’t make otherwise, you may have to accept invitations you’d normally turn down or try making the first move to start a new friendship.
> 
> Also, don’t overlook the importance of casual acquaintances: people whom you see frequently but don’t consider close friends, such as your coworkers or the bartender at your favorite bar. Some studies have shown the positive impact that such relationships have on people’s happiness: The more acquaintances you have, and the more frequently you interact with them, the more likely you are to be happy. Therefore, it’s arguably worthwhile to say hi and make small talk with your acquaintances whenever you get the chance.

#### Strategy #3: Find Life Success Through Your Beliefs

Finally, Brooks says faith is crucial to happiness later in life, citing **numerous studies suggesting that religious and spiritual people tend to be happier and healthier than their atheist counterparts.** He thinks this is because faith and spirituality help to put your life into perspective. They take your focus off yourself and your problems; instead, you start thinking about the nature of the universe, the purpose of life, and your part in making the world a better place for everyone.

(Shortform note: While there may be a connection between religion and happiness, correlation doesn’t always mean causation. For instance, one group of researchers found that religion only boosts people’s health and happiness in cultures where religion is highly valued—in more secular cultures, such as those found in Scandinavian countries or Japan, those benefits disappear almost entirely. Those researchers concluded that the benefits religious people were finding weren’t from religion itself, but rather from the social connections people experienced while practicing their religion.)

Brooks adds that religious leaders have known about the path to life success for millennia. As an example, he relates an ancient Hindu teaching that says there are four stages of life, each with a particular goal. At around 50 years old, you enter the third stage of life, called _vanaprastha_. The literal translation of this stage is “retiring into the forest,” but vanaprastha really means that you**begin to leave behind your pursuit of wealth and professional success in favor of developing your spirituality.** This is meant to be preparation for the last stage of life called _sannyasa_ , when you fully renounce worldly concerns like wealth and spend the final years of your life pursuing enlightenment.

(Shortform note: While Brooks says that “retiring into the forest” doesn’t have to be taken literally, the yogi Sadhguru says that leaving your home (at least temporarily) is a crucial part of vanaprastha. Sadhguru explains that the purpose of vanaprastha is to truly, deeply understand that you’re mortal and your time is limited; this understanding, in turn, mentally prepares you to leave behind worldly concerns and embrace spirituality. However, your home gives you an illusion of safety and immortality. Therefore, leaving your home to live in nature for a while helps you to understand that death can come at any time and in any form—for example, in the form of a lightning bolt or a wild animal.)

However, belief in the divine isn’t the only way to achieve life success. **Brooks says that people who reject religion and spirituality can often find meaning in philosophy** —it has many of the same benefits, such as pulling your attention away from selfish pursuits, instead encouraging you to seek happiness by living well and making the world better.

> **Finding Purpose Through Philosophy**
> 
> Philosophers from many different schools of thought agree with Brooks that connecting with and helping other people is the best way to live a happy and fulfilling life. In _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ , Robin Sharma offers one possible explanation for why that is: You’re part of the world, not just an isolated individual living in it. Therefore, by improving the world around you, you’re also improving yourself and your own circumstances.
> 
> As another example, Marcus Aurelius’s _Meditations_ —one of the definitive texts on Stoic philosophy—says that working for the common good is the only way to live a happy and fulfilling life. Aurelius’s reasoning is that to feel fulfilled, you must have a consistent goal (what Sharma would call your purpose) and spend your life working toward that goal. However, people are naturally _inconsistent_ ; your personal desires and goals will change frequently. Therefore, any fulfilling goal must be selfless rather than oriented around your ever-changing personal preferences.
