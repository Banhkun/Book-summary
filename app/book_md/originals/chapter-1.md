## Chapter 1: Creative Destruction

The first necessary quality for originals is to question the status quo, and generate concepts that are both novel and useful. Much of modern life is built around conformity - the structure and rules of schooling, uniform career tracks, the social recognition of status and accomplishment. However, this can be suppressive, pushing people into guaranteed success instead of venturing into the unknown, dreading failure instead of aiming for innovation. Possibly for this reason, child prodigies who show mastery at an early age tend not to become agents of massive change - they are very good at learning established rules, but not at breaking them or designing a totally new game.

(Unfortunately, studies suggest that the poor tend to accept the status quo more readily. This might be a defense mechanism termed “system justification” - if the system exists for a good reason and people deserve their fate, then life becomes a bit more bearable and sensical.)

And so the reason that many innovative companies aren’t started earlier is that **many people simply don’t take the time to question why the status quo exists, and how it could be better**. (Shortform note: This is one antidote to the common criticism, “if it’s such a good idea, why doesn’t it exist already?)

There are a few things originals are not, contrary to popular belief. **Originals do NOT take extreme, uncontrolled risks. Rather, they hedge their risks** \- often keeping a source of stability (like their fulltime job) while working on their idea on the side.

  * Sara Blakely, Steve Wozniak, Phil Knight (of Nike), and Larry Page/Sergey Brin all kept up their day jobs while starting the companies for which they’re famed. 
  * One study found that entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs had 33% lower odds of failure than those who quit.



This doesn’t mean they take moderate risks in all dimensions - instead, having one foot in stability allows more radical risks in the other, creating a balanced risk portfolio. The stability prevents the pressure of desperately launching half-baked ideas and publishing manuscripts that aren’t ready. In general, entrepreneurs prefer calculated, managed risks, rather than wild, dangerous, reckless risks.

**Originals do NOT fearlessly go forward** , as much as the media (and they) want you to believe. They face fear of failure and anxiety. Martin Luther King, Jr and Copernicus alike felt concern over taking on the duties expected of them.

**Originals are NOT natural non-conformists who ignore social approval.** Studies of entrepreneurs suggest concern for pleasing others wasn’t a predictor of success.

**To start being an Original, consider why the world exists as it does, and how you might improve it with a new idea.**
