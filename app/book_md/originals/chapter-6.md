## Chapter 6: Rebel with a Cause - How Siblings, Parents, and Mentors Nurture Originality

Here Originals takes a turn away from how to execute as an original, to how originality is cultivated. **How do our childhood environments affect our tendency for rebelliousness and risk-seeking?**

Birth order has a very strong effect - firstborn children tend to be conscientious and dominant, showing achievement along classical lines - income, academic achievement, Nobel Prize winning (but apparently only until age 30, when the differences even out). **Lastborn children are more likely to be risk-seeking, rebellious, and unconventional**. (Middle children tend to be more diplomatic, having to negotiate between the extreme members of the sibling group.) This tends to be true regardless of child gender.

Suggestive observational studies:

  * In baseball, stealing bases is a very risky, not necessarily optimal play. Younger brothers are 10.6x more likely than older siblings to steal a base.
  * Laterborn children are more likely to adopt revolutionary scientific ideas like Copernican astronomy and Darwinian evolution, even controlling for the mentally calcifying effects of age.
  * Rebels were twice as likely to be lastborn as firstborn.
  * Of a list of the top 100 comedians, 83% were more likely to be lastborn than chance would predict. (Why is this relevant? Not only is comedy an unconventional career, it requires humor, explained below.)
  * Riskier jobs tend to be taken up by lastborn.



A few models try to explain this pattern. First is **niche picking**. Like animal species in ecology, children try to find a niche to thrive in, avoiding direct competition with their siblings when there’s little hope of outshining them. Free of competition, the firstborn child models after the parents, based on rules and authority. This child performs well in school and traditional structure. When a new child arrives, the older child, risking being dethroned, emulate their parents, enforcing rules and authority over the younger sibling. **The younger child, seeking an identity, finds it difficult to compete with the firstborn child and attract commensurate attention.** Thus the younger child seeks niches like humor and rebellion to attract attention, and this becomes ingrained in identity.

(The effect seems to be strongest in a middle range of age distance. If separated by just a year, the younger child can hold her own; if separated by 10 years, the firstborn’s niche is open again.)

Another explanation comes from **caretaker effects**. The firstborn is usually cared for strongly by parents, who have the anxiety of firsttime parents as well as the energy of youth. As the parents have more children, they relax due to more experience and declining energy with age. The older children also then take up a greater share of the care, but they enforce fewer rules than parents would. Finally, older children become more responsible and capable of handling chores, leaving the youngest kids free to roam. For all these reasons, **the lastborn thus experiences relatively more freedom.**

These are _general_ trends, because most parents probably react to birth order predictably in the ways stated above. But some unique situations may contravene this trend - for instance, if the parents exert even more pressure on laterborn children.

  * Andre Agassi was the last of 4 children of a father who wished to raise a tennis superstar. When the first 3 children failed to show promise, the father exerted considerable pressure on Andre. In response, Andre became rebellious, but also obviously fulfilled his father’s desires.



**Parenting Style**

(Shortform note: It feels like Adam Grant shoehorned this section in, since it doesn’t directly relate to originality. He connects it to birth order by asking, “if the younger kids are rebellious, how do you avoid them from straying?” but it feels more like he wants to discuss parenting style research.)

When teaching moral behavior to children, your style of feedback seems to make a difference in how successfully the morals are upheld. **Integrating morality as part of the child’s _identity_ is more successful than rewarding the _behavior_. **

  * For example, if the child shares a toy, rather than saying, “sharing is really good,” say “you’re a really good sharer.” 
  * Rather than saying, “don’t cheat,” say “you’re not a cheater.” 
  * Rather than saying, “Sharing was a nice thing to do,” say “You’re the kind of person who helps others when you can. You’re a generous person.”
  * Say “be a helper” rather than “please help.”



Focusing on identity gives the child an ideal to live up to, which seems to be better ingrained than a behavior that isn’t explicitly justified.

This distinguishes the **logic of consequences** from the **logic of appropriateness**. The former weighs courses of action and tries to find the best outcome. The latter asks, “what does a person like me do in a situation like this?” which theoretically causes action that’s the right thing to do.

Regarding cheating, the former tempts a calculus of the risks of getting caught and the benefits of cheating. The latter evokes a sense of self: “am I the type of person who cheats? Who do I want to be?”

As it relates to originality, the former logic finds it difficult to take risks. The latter frees us up - “I am the type of person to do what I believe in, even if I can’t justify the outcome right now.” (Shortform note: **One might instill this identity by praising children for being noncomformists** and the type of person to do what they believe in.)

Furthermore, **justify both positive and negative feedback with the underlying principles**. Rational explanations of why (good behavior is good) and (bad behavior is bad) seem to be more effective than merely setting unexplained rules. If it affects other people, explain the impact on other people.

  * For instance, rather than saying “stop making noise in the store,” say “making noise in the store bothers other people, and we’re not people who like bothering other people, and we don’t like being bothered ourselves.” 
  * The explanations need to be simple at younger ages, then involving more subtle emotions with age.
    * Action: “If you push him again, he’ll fall down and cry.”
    * To “It hurts him when you push him.”
    * To “He feels like you’re not being a good friend and feels betrayed.”



This helps children understand why what they did was wrong and instills empathy, instead of provoking rebellion against seemingly arbitrary rules.

(In one study, doctors were shown one of two signs related to hand washing. One said “hand hygiene prevents you from catching diseases”; the other said “hand hygiene prevents patients from catching diseases.” The latter caused a 10% increase in hand washing with 45% more soap use. Adam Grant suggests this arises from invoking the identity of being a caretaker responsible for others’ well-being, rather than the ineffectual calculus of one’s own sickness.)

**More creative children tend to grow up with fewer rules, and emphasize moral values rather than specific rules.** Furthermore, they were encouraged to choose their own values, instead of adopting their parents’.

Finally, **find role models for the children other than the parents.** Parents are limited in what they can represent for their children, due to limitations in their achievement and misalignment of what parents have achieved and what children want. Instead, introduce children to a range of role models, non-parental mentors who represent ideals beyond what the parents have achieved.

These role models can also come from books or media. There are great originals throughout history to be followed. For originality, fiction seems to be helpful here, since they push the bounds of possibility (e.g. Star Trek might inspire original technology better than reports of current technology can).
