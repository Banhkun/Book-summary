## Chapter 5: Goldilocks and the Trojan Horse - Creating and Maintaining Coalitions

When you try to gather support for your new idea, you need to strike a Goldilocks zone in radicalism - radical enough to stand for something and not be tepid, but conservative enough to avoid alienating a mainstream audience. People external to the movement tend to identify it with its most radical position, not its median. As the originator of a movement, you’ll tend to be on the radical side, and you may need to temper the cause, or at least how you present it to the outside world.

Occupy Wall Street largely faded out, partly because its insistence on the disruptive,radical behavior in its name alienated many who otherwise would have aligned with the cause. Not many people want to camp out to effect change, nor might they think it the most effective method. Instead, if they had instead rallied around the “we are the 99%” theme, it would unify groups of people using their own preferred tactics, and the movement might still be ongoing.

Being just right in radicalism can be a difficult balance. The more radical people within the group tend to accuse the more moderate ones of selling out or not doing enough. Counter-intuitively, the radicals dislike moderates (who largely agree on the fundamentals) more than they dislike people on the other side of the spectrum. To wit, members of the black community sometimes pull down others for not being black enough, radical environmental activists decry Greenpeace for being too corporate, vegans dislike vegetarians more than meat-eaters. In the extreme, this can splinter your group into separate factions.

When trying to find allies for your cause, find overlap between your desired outcomes. Instead of trying to change someone’s ideals, present your values as a means of pursuing their goals. The women’s suffrage movement found an unlikely ally among the temperance movement, who were mostly female but socially conservative and preferring traditional gender roles. The overlap was this: women’s suffrage would allow temperance voters to be a greater advocate for alcohol abuse. Achieving suffrage would allow temperance supporters to better achieve their own aims.

Furthermore, as you try to build partnerships with other causes, don’t overlook shared tactics, even if your missions are orthogonal. Coalitions who can learn methods from each other band together, perhaps with one teaching fundraising and the other political advocacy.

If at the end your cause is too radical, try focusing on the how instead of the why. The why may clash with deep-seated convictions and cause automatic defensiveness. Consider uBeam founder Meredith Perry, who recruited engineers to build a wireless battery charger. When leading with the desired outcome of wireless charging, engineers rejected it as implausible. Instead, she had much better success when she focused on the specifications - “build a transducer with these performance characteristics.” When the purpose was hidden from sight, the engineers had less bias about its chance of success.

(Shortform note: The inverse might also work if the means are what is controversial. Here, talk about the why first - entice the listener with a vision of the future they can get behind, then describe what it’ll take to get there. In Carmen Medina’s case, she could have tried first describing the benefits of instantaneous information sharing in the CIA; with their curiosity piqued, the managers might have become less hostile to the Internet, to which they had heavy preconceptions.)

Largely unrelated point - turning your enemies into followers is especially helpful. They tend to be more loyal and genuine in their support, since they had to overwrite their prior beliefs to follow your ideals. They are also more persuasive to non-followers, since they have been in the position of skepticism before and can relate their experience of conversion.

Msc: an interesting experiment where participants were asked to develop a new tool that would help people interviewing for a job. One group was shown a binder and told to use that as a starting place for something novel. They came up with banal ideas. Another group was asked to first think of a rollerblade, then brainstorm ideas. This group was deemed more more creative. The starting parameters of brainstorming and solution finding can therefore have a huge difference. This suggests a brainstorming method of using very orthogonal inspirations to come up with new solution concepts.
