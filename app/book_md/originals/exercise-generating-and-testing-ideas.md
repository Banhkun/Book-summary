## Exercise: Generating and Testing Ideas

Use this exercise to create more novel ideas and validate them.

* * *

Generating more ideas is important to finding the few good ones. What are some ways you can generate more ideas in your daily life?

Optional: spend 5 minutes writing any ideas that come to mind, in an area that you care about. Get used to the practice of writing down lots of ideas, rather than worrying about having them perfect.

Who are 2-3 credible people you can test your ideas with? Remember that they should 1) have domain expertise in what you’re doing (either as a professional or as a user), and 2) lack a personal stake in your success, so they’ll be honest.
