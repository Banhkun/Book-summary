## Exercise: Presenting Ideas

Use this exercise to learn how to present ideas that might be controversial.

* * *

In the near future, are you going to present something where you expect skepticism from your audience? How could you specifically try powerless communication? Tips: express doubt, highlight weaknesses.

(If applicable) Within your organization, who are people at the top of the totem pole who might be receptive to your more unconventional ideas? Who’s at the bottom who would be receptive, because they have nothing to lose? Who’s in the middle whom you should avoid, because they have too much at stake?

Do you have an idea that you need people to support in the long-term? How could you introduce the idea in bits today, repeatedly, to get them used to the idea?
