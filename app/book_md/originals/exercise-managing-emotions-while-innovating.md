## Exercise: Managing Emotions While Innovating

Innovation is hard. Here’s an exercise on how to manage your emotions as you try to innovate.

* * *

Strategic optimists reinforce the belief that things will work out; defensive pessimists predict the worst that could happen in excruciating detail. Do you consider yourself naturally a strategic optimist or a defensive pessimist?

Grant suggests both are helpful, but the ideal combination is optimism before you’ve committed to an action (so you don’t shoot down ideas prematurely), then defensive pessimism when you’ve committed (so you spot weak points and don’t get overconfident).

Do you agree? How would you combine optimism and pessimism to best suit your own personality?

How can you “outsource inspiration” by showcasing the lives affected by what you’re working on? How will this help people understand the impact of what you’re trying to do?
