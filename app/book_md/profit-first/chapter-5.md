## Chapter 5: Finding Your Business’s Ideal Allocation Percentages

While the percentages Michalowicz gave in the previous section are a good general example of where a healthy business allocates its income, he also recommends that you use your business’s financials to find ideal allocation percentages _specific to your business_. In this chapter, we’ll cover Michalowicz’s steps for finding an ideal profit, salary, tax, and expense percentage **specific to your business, industry, and circumstances.**

(Shortform note: Once you determine these ideal percentages, think of them as good _initial_ goals for your business. They shouldn’t remain fixed forever—Michalowicz acknowledges that you’ll likely make adjustments over time to your ideal percentages based on your business’s needs and circumstances.)

### Finding Your Ideal Profit Percentage

To find your business’s ideal profit percentage, Michalowicz advises you use any combination of the following three methods.

#### Check Similar Companies’ Records

Using your financial website of choice, look up the records of successful public companies in your industry that are similar to your business’s size. Check their income statements, and optionally their cash flow statements and balance sheets from the last three to five years. Divide their profit by their revenue for each year, then find the average of your results. This average gives a good idea of an ideal profit percentage.

#### Check Your Best Year

Look at your taxes for the last three to five years and find your most profitable year. Calculate the profit percentage for that year, and use it as your ideal. If your business has consistently struggled to be profitable or had one complete outlier of a year, try one of the other methods instead.

#### Check Your Projected Income

Check your projected income for this year, and pick a profit percentage that would give you a dollar amount that you consider your ideal yearly profit.

> **Profiting Versus Breaking Even**
> 
> Michalowicz claims that when determining your profit percentage, you shouldn’t be thinking about how much of it might go back into expenses—instead, he says, your profit should go to you. This contrasts with author and entrepreneur Greg Crabtree’s book _Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!_ , which argues that a financially healthy business needs a minimum profit percentage of 10 percent (before taxes) reinvested into expenses.
> 
> This is because of three extra costs which Crabtree says are often ignored in business accounting: amortization (or consistent debt payments), interest on your debts, and depreciation (the reduction of value in an asset over time, like from equipment slowly wearing down or breaking). All of these things require your business to have money available that isn’t already tied up in other expenses, and so Crabtree argues that only by reinvesting a 10 percent profit can help your business cover these additional costs and break even.

### Finding Your Ideal Salary Percentage

When finding your ideal salary percentage, Michalowicz says it’s important to find an appropriate amount and not to go below it. Many entrepreneurs, when faced with expenses too high for their income, end up taking the difference out of their own paychecks.

Michalowicz stresses that you should _not_ do this, because the goal of running a business is to gain financial _freedom_ , not financial _obligation_. To determine an appropriate salary for yourself, Michalowicz recommends you use one (or all) of the following three guidelines.

#### Consider the Work You Do

Pay yourself the same amount you would pay an employee to do your work. Your paycheck should reflect the work you’re doing, and can occasionally include a bonus for your efforts.

#### Use the Healthy Percentage Table

Alternatively, you can determine your salary by using the healthy percentage recommended in Michalowicz’s table multiplied by your business’s yearly income.

#### Employee Versus Entrepreneur

The larger your business grows, the less you’ll focus on day-to-day operations and the more you’ll spend time organizing, directing, and teaching your employees. Your pay should reflect this as well: You do less employee work, and so you earn a smaller salary. However, your increased entrepreneurial work will be compensated by your higher profit percentage.

> **The Benefits of a Lower Salary**
> 
> You might be wondering why Michalowicz's methods to determine an “appropriate” salary percentage encourage you to allocate yourself a salary appropriate for an employee, rather than the elevated salary more typical of a CEO. Paypal founder Peter Thiel offers an explanation in his book _Zero to One_. He outlines three reasons why a CEO should have a lower pay than is standard for their position.
> 
>   * Giving a CEO a high salary encourages them to coast, or maintain the status quo. Since they are getting a large amount of money just by showing up, they’ll be less motivated to work hard and improve the company.
> 
>   * Instead of a salary, a CEO should instead make most of their money through profit or equity. That way, the CEO will have a personal stake in the company’s success, which will help motivate them.
> 
>   * Thiel asserts that paying a CEO a lower salary will also motivate their employees to work harder. This is because they’ll see that the CEO isn’t just in it for the money, but has a genuine belief in the company and its ability to succeed—and employees will follow that example.

### Finding Your Ideal Tax Percentage

Michalowicz emphasizes that your ideal tax percentage should be enough to cover **both your business’s taxes and your personal income taxes.** Paying your personal taxes with your business’s money, he says, is part of the financial freedom that all business owners want. Michalowicz provides three methods for determining your ideal tax percentage, all of which are relatively simple.

#### Use Past Tax Records

Add the amount paid on your business and personal taxes together, then divide that number by your adjusted revenue. Do this using documents from the last three years to get an idea of your ideal tax allocation percentage.

#### Use Current Tax Liability

Alternatively, an accountant can calculate your year-to-date personal and business tax liability, which you can add together then divide by your year-to-date adjusted revenue.

#### Use Your Taxable Income

Finally, you can also add your personal income and your business’s profits together, then multiply that number by the tax rate of someone in your income bracket. Then, divide that number by your adjusted revenue to get a rough estimate of your ideal tax allocation percentage.

> **Knowing What Taxes You Pay**
> 
> When Michalowicz refers to “your business’s taxes,” he can be referring to a number of possible taxes depending on what your business does and where it’s located. The IRS provides a list of taxes a small business might have to pay. Here’s a brief explanation of what these taxes (besides income tax) are, as well as which businesses might have to pay them:
> 
>   * **Self-employment tax:** This is a Medicare and social security tax for the self-employed, and all small business owners not subject to exemptions have to pay it.
> 
>   * **Employee tax:** A tax on the money you pay your employees, if you have any.
> 
>   * **Sales tax:** Depending on where you live and which products or services you provide, you may have to pay sales tax on each sale you make.
> 
>   * **Excise tax:** This is a group of many different taxes on different kinds of products, businesses, or equipment. Examples include taxes on motor fuel, coal, or indoor tanning. Check with your accountant to see which of these taxes you may or may not owe.
> 
> 


### Finding Your Ideal Expense Percentage

Last of all, you can calculate your ideal expense percentage quite easily—just subtract your profit, salary, and tax percentages from 100 percent. This is because, as Michalowicz stresses, his**** method uses _leftover money_ for expenses, following the second Profit First tenet to deemphasize their importance.

(Shortform note: This ideal percentage is probably going to be a lot lower than your current one. David Goggins (_Can’t Hurt Me_) recommends that you visualize your success to ensure you continue towards this large goal and don’t get too discouraged. He says that when you visualize what succeeding will look like, you remind yourself what you’re working towards, and that it’s a worthy goal. Goggins also recommends you visualize struggles you might face while pursuing your goal and make a plan of how you’ll overcome them. This way, if you do face these obstacles, you won’t be caught off guard and will already know how to address them.)
