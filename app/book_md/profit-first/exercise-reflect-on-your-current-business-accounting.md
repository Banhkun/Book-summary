## Exercise: Reflect On Your Current Business Accounting

Consider if you conduct your accounting by traditional principles, and how that might affect the way you run your business.

* * *

How much has your business’s revenue grown in the past year?

List how often you check each of the following: your profit & loss statement, your balance sheet, your cash flow statement, your accounts receivable report, your accounts payable report, and your inventory report.

In the past three months, how often have you had to scramble to cover your business’s costs? What was your strategy for doing so?
