## Exercise: Plan Your Profit First Setup

Start to plan how you can apply the Profit First system to your own business, and how it will change the way you do your accounting.

* * *

Besides using a different bank, what are other strategies you can use to make your tax and profit savings accounts difficult to access? Try to think of three.

Find the difference between each of your current percentages and Michalowicz’s listed healthy percentages, then order them from most to least different. What does this list suggest is the least healthy part of your business? What in this list surprises you most?

Find the difference between each of your current percentages and their ideal counterparts, then order them from least to most different. Where are you putting too much money? Too little? Does your experience running your business suggest you’re putting too much or too little money in those places?

Decide what you’ll prioritize when first reallocating three percent of your income: profit, your salary, tax, or expenses. Explain your answer.
