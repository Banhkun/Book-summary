## Exercise: Manage Your Personal Costs

Using some of Michalowicz’s overall Profit First guidelines, perform an assessment of your personal finances and consider how you can keep your personal costs down.

* * *

Separate your monthly expenses into two lists: one for needs (basic food, housing, transportation, etc.) and one for wants (entertainment, eating out, hobbies, etc.).

Go through your “needs” list, and find the expenses you might be able to reduce by getting a better deal or finding a cheaper option. List them here and briefly describe how you could improve them.

Go through your “wants” list, and find expenses that don’t particularly bring your happiness or improve your quality of life. List them here and briefly describe how you can remove them.
