## 1-Page Summary

Mike Michalowicz’s _Profit First_ criticizes traditional business accounting methods by claiming that they are unintuitive, and that their unintuitive nature leads many entrepreneurs to failure. He then outlines an alternate accounting system, which he calls **the Profit First method.** This method, he says, allows an entrepreneur to do their business accounting in a simple and intuitive way, and to increase their business’s profitability and stability. (Shortform note: Michalowicz claims that the financial stability offered by the Profit First method will help reduce your levels of stress, which is supported by psychological studies. Specifically, studies found higher levels of anxiety among those who have trouble properly managing their finances.)

### Part 1: Defining the Profit First Method

In this section, we’ll explore the main principles of traditional accounting, Michalowicz’s argument for why they don’t work, and the main tenets of his Profit First accounting method.

#### Traditional Business Accounting

First, let’s clarify what Michalowicz is referring to when he talks about traditional accounting. Specifically, he’s referring to three main principles in his arguments, which he claims are the common wisdom of the business world.

  1. Traditional business accounting recommends starting with income, subtracting all expenses, and labeling the difference as profit. 
  2. Constantly look to grow your business and**put growth as your first priority.** Growth leads to an increase in your income as well as the overall value of your company in case another company wants to buy it. 
  3. Traditional accounting also advises that you consult financial documents like balance sheets or income statements regularly, so you know what’s going on financially in your business at all times. 



#### The Danger of Traditional Accounting

While traditional principles work for some, they also lead many businesses to failure. Michalowicz argues that this high failure rate exists because traditional accounting principles clash with the way most people think and make decisions.

(Shortform note: Research supports Michalowicz’s claim that traditional accounting methods can clash with the way people think. A study revealed that even _professional accountants_ still allow some of their personal, unconscious bias to get in the way of their logical, rational accounting work, often turning out inaccurate results that favor their clients.)

Michalowicz identifies one major clash in particular: Entrepreneurs interpret the traditional principle that growth is success to mean they should reinvest all their money—**including their profits and personal funds** —back into their expenses. They think that this increase in expenses will be covered by the increased income from their larger business. However, reinvestment into growth makes a business unstable, as it creates high costs and eliminates cash on hand. This instability can make slow sales periods fatal for a business.

(Shortform note: Behavioral psychology studies on gambling support Michalowicz’s claim that people naturally think continuing to put money into their business will eventually result in success. Studies suggest that while gambling, losing money makes us want to spend again, and makes us think that doing so will earn us rewards. This research could be interpreted to suggest that if entrepreneurs are losing money growing their business, they will psychologically want to spend more money on growth to chase success.)

##### Challenges in Addressing Instability

The instability that comes from a rapidly growing business is also very difficult for most entrepreneurs to fix,**** says Michalowicz. He outlines three additional ways traditional principles clash with natural decision making and explains how these clashes prevent entrepreneurs from stabilizing their businesses.

**1)** Many entrepreneurs become used to the extra expenses they reinvested their profits on, and don’t want to get rid of them. They might have a hard time recognizing that they don’t need the company car or office space they have grown accustomed to, for example. (Shortform note: Research on compulsive spenders supports Michalowicz’s argument that people attach emotions to the things they buy, which makes cutting expenses much more difficult. Studies suggest that people tend to believe that buying things will make them happier, or compulsively buy as a way to try and cope with shame.)

**2)** Financial documents are often complex and difficult to navigate, even for accountants. This can make it difficult for entrepreneurs to even recognize when their business is financially unstable. (Shortform note: Michalowicz’s claim that small business entrepreneurs have trouble understanding their accounting is backed up by a recent survey, which found that 40 percent of small business owners would label themselves financially illiterate, and 66 percent wish they knew more about their finances.)

**3)** Financial instability and uncertainty often lead entrepreneurs to make irrational or panicked decisions, which only put a business into further trouble. Often, these decisions involve looking for increased growth and sales even if they come with expenses or opportunity costs. (Shortform note: Psychological research supports Michalowicz’s claim that as people lose money, they will make worse financial decisions. A study found that as gamblers lost money, they would be more likely to recklessly and impulsively spend more, believing that doing so would earn them money back. The study suggests that this is because losing money is an emotional event, and so it doesn’t encourage rational decision making.)

#### Core Tenets of the Profit First Method

Now that we’ve shown how traditional accounting clashes with normal thinking and decision making, we’ll outline Michalowicz’s accounting system: the Profit First method. In this system, **a percentage of income is taken as profit _before_ any expenses are paid. **The Profit First method works on four main tenets, which allow an entrepreneur to avoid the challenges of traditional accounting by using the natural way they think to make healthy financial decisions.

##### Tenet #1: Limit Your Resources

Michalowicz’s first tenet is to allocate a specific percentage of your income for expenses (we’ll discuss how to do this later on). By allocating only a percentage of your income to expenses, you’ll force yourself to spend that money more efficiently. That’s because of Parkinson’s Law: the theory that the more resources we have available, the more resources we will use.**** This theory works the other way as well: the fewer resources we have available, the fewer we’ll need to use.

(Shortform note: Michalowicz’s definition of Parkinson’s law isn’t quite accurate. Instead, it’s a common misinterpretation of an essay on government bureaucracy published by historian and author Cyril Northcote Parkinson. What Michalowicz (and many others) calls Parkinson’s law is actually just the article’s first sentence, which describes the “commonplace observation” that people use all available time to complete work. Parkinson’s actual law is an equation explained later in the article, which tries to predict bureaucratic growth. Because of this misinterpretation, keep in mind moving forward that this first tenet is founded not on behavioral psychology, but rather on a common-sense principle.)

##### Tenet #2: Order in Terms of Importance

The next tenet Michalowicz outlines is to allocate your income in order of importance, starting with profit to emphasize that it’s your first priority. This works due to what psychology calls the primacy effect: When given multiple pieces of information, our natural tendency is to**** better remember and place more importance on the first one given to us.

(Shortform note: Michalowicz claims that you’ll place the most focus and importance on whatever comes first. However, behavioral psychology suggests several other factors which might cause us to place more focus elsewhere in a list. Besides the primacy effect Michalowicz cites, there’s also the recency effect, which says that we’ll better remember and focus more on information given to us most recently. Also, there’s evidence that an item in a list emphasized more than others might also be better remembered, no matter where it is in the list.)

##### Tenet #3: Removing Temptation

For the third tenet, Michalowicz advises that you remove the temptation to reinvest money into growth by creating savings accounts for profit and other essentials, and**making those accounts inconvenient to access**. By making that money harder to access, you’ll be less tempted to misuse it. (Shortform note: Michalowicz’s suggestion of changing your _circumstances_ to avoid temptation may raise questions, as most people tend to think about temptation as an _internal_ struggle to maintain our willpower. However, studies show that changes in external circumstances can be an easier and more effective way to increase self-control, supporting Michalowicz’s tenet.)

##### Tenet #4: Keep Good Habits

Finally, Michalowicz’s fourth tenet is to make a habit of dividing your income between profit and expenses and paying your bills consistently. By making a habit of dividing income amongst your business’s bank accounts, **you can recognize financial changes** **just by looking at their account balances.** Then, you can react to those changes calmly because you’ll have seen them coming.

(Shortform note: You might be wondering how good habits will help you react calmly to change. According to Chip and Dan Heath in _The Power of Moments_ , habits help us stay calm because they help us prepare responses to change ahead of time. These prepared responses mean that when change does occur, we’ll respond more calmly because we’ll have already decided how to do so in advance and so won’t be caught by surprise.)

### Part 2: Setting up the Profit First Method

Now that we understand the benefits of the Profit First system, we’ll discuss how to set it up step by step. The process involves four different steps, all of which make it easier to understand your business’s finances.

#### Step #1: Bank Accounting

You’ll first open new bank accounts. Michalowicz recommends organizing your accounting with seven bank accounts, so you can understand your business’s finances by checking their account balances. First, he advises you to open five checking accounts at your primary bank: an **income** account, a **profit** account, an account for your **personal salary** , an account for **tax money** , and an account for **all other expenses**. In addition to your checking accounts, open two savings accounts at a separate bank: one for tax money, and one for profits. Transfer money from your tax and profit checking accounts into these savings accounts regularly, and make them inconvenient to withdraw from so you aren’t tempted to misuse their money.

(Shortform note: Alternatively, if checking your financial documents is a task you have trouble with, you can work with a bookkeeper. The U.S. Small Business Administration recommends sending your financial information to a reliable bookkeeper once a week. They can compile your financial documents then answer any questions you have, so you can understand your financial situation each week. Michalowicz does disagree with this suggestion, though, arguing that even bookkeepers can misinterpret or fail to understand financial information.)

#### Step #2: Assessing Your Business’s Current Financial Health

Once you have your bank accounts set up, Michalowicz says it’s time to assess your business’s current financial health. He explains that you should find the percentage of your income you’re spending on each aspect of your business: profit, your personal salary, taxes, and expenses. Then, you can compare these to a healthy business’s percentages. The more similar they are, the healthier your business is. (Shortform note: While this section of the guide provides a simple way to assess your business’s financial health, it isn’t as comprehensive as what a skilled financial advisor can offer. Michalowicz himself mentions that you should work with your accounting team throughout the book, so don’t use this as a substitute for that kind of support.)

##### Using the Allocation Percentage Equation

To assess your business’s financial health, Michalowicz first outlines how to find what percentage of your income is allocated to each aspect of your business.

  1. Find your total income from the last 12 months. 
  2. Now, add up all expenses spent on materials and subcontractors, and label these costs as (M).
  3. Subtract your material and subcontractor costs (M) from your total income to find your _adjusted revenue_. Label this value as R.
  4. Find how much money went into the following:
     1. **Profit:** Profit from the last year that you didn’t reinvest into your business. 
     2. **Salary:** Your salary from last year. 
     3. **Taxes** : How much of your business’s money you used to pay for taxes last year. If you use your business’s money to pay your personal taxes, include that amount here. 
     4. **Expenses:** All expenses from the last 12 months minus your costs of goods sold.
  5. Now, divide each of those values by your adjusted revenue to find what percentage is allocated to each. 



##### Your Allocation Percentages Versus Healthy Allocation Percentages

Now, you can**compare your percentages to Michalowicz’s in the table below** for the appropriate adjusted revenue bracket.**** The closer your percentages are to those in the table, the healthier your business is financially.

Adjusted Revenue Bracket (R)  | A = Profit Result  | A = Owner’s Compensation Result  | A = Taxes Result  | A = Expenses Result   
---|---|---|---|---  
0 - 250k  | 5%  | 50%  | 15%  | 30%   
250k - 500k  | 10%  | 35%  | 15%  | 40%   
500k - 1m  | 15%  | 20%  | 15%  | 50%   
1m - 5m  | 10%  | 10%  | 15%  | 65%   
5m - 10m  | 15%  | 5%  | 15%  | 65%   
10m - 50m  | 20%  | 0%  | 15%  | 65%   
  
(Shortform note: Michalowicz acknowledges that these numbers aren’t industry specific, but keep in mind that depending on your industry some of these numbers might not be realistic for your business. Percentages can range wildly from industry to industry—for example, the advertising industry has an average profit percentage of 3.1 percent, while the video game industry has an average profit percentage above 29 percent. Depending on your industry, then, Michalowicz’s percentages might be too conservative or too optimistic.)

#### Finding Your Business’s Ideal Allocation Percentages

While the percentages Michalowicz gave in the previous section are a good general example of where a healthy business allocates its income, he also provides the following instructions for finding your own ideal allocation percentages. (Shortform note: Once you determine these ideal percentages, think of them as good _initial_ goals for your business. They shouldn’t remain fixed forever—Michalowicz acknowledges that you’ll likely make adjustments over time to your ideal percentages based on your business’s needs and circumstances.)

**1) Your ideal profit percentage:** To find your business’s ideal profit percentage, look up the records of successful public companies in your industry similar to your business’s size, then divide their profit by their revenue for the past three to five years. The average of those results will give you a good idea of an ideal profit percentage.

(Shortform note: Michalowicz claims that when determining your profit percentage, you’re calculating money strictly for your personal use. This contrasts with Greg Crabtree’s _Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!_ , which argues that a financially healthy business needs a minimum profit percentage of 10 percent (before taxes) reinvested into expenses. This is because of three extra costs Crabtree says are often ignored: Debt payments, interest on debts, and depreciation (reduction of value in an asset over time, like from equipment wearing down). Crabtree argues that reinvesting 10 percent profit is needed to cover these additional costs and break even.)

**2) Your ideal salary percentage:** To determine an appropriate salary for yourself, Michalowicz recommends you pay yourself the same amount you would pay an employee to do your work. Divide this salary by last year’s adjusted revenue for your ideal salary percentage.

(Shortform note: You might be wondering why Michalowicz's methods encourage you to determine for yourself a salary appropriate for an employee, rather than the elevated salary more typical of a CEO. Paypal founder Peter Thiel offers an explanation in _Zero to One_ , where he outlines two reasons why a CEO should have a low salary. He argues that a CEO with low pay will work harder to help the business succeed, since they won’t just be getting paid for showing up. In addition, a CEO with low pay inspires other employees to work harder by showing their dedication to the company.)

**3) Your ideal tax percentage:** Michalowicz emphasizes here that your ideal tax percentage covers your business’s taxes**and your personal income taxes.** Find your ideal tax percentage by adding the amount you paid last year on your business and personal taxes together, then dividing that number by your adjusted revenue from the last year. (Shortform note: When Michalowicz refers to “your business’s taxes,” he can be referring to a number of possible taxes depending on what your business does and where it’s located. Be sure to check with an accountant or the IRS website for a list of taxes your business might have to pay.)

**4) Your ideal expense percentage:** To calculate your ideal expense percentage, subtract your profit, salary, and tax percentages from 100%. This is the “leftover” money you’ll use for expenses. (Shortform note: This ideal percentage is probably going to be a lot lower than your current one. To make sure you continue towards this goal and don’t give up, David Goggins recommends you visualize your success in _Can’t Hurt Me_. He says that when you visualize what succeeding will look like, you remind yourself what you’re working towards, and that it’s a worthy goal.)

#### Your First Year Using the Profit First Method

Once you’ve found your ideal percentages, Michalowicz says not to match them too quickly–if you allocate too much money away from expenses, you’ll often end up without enough money to keep your business running. Instead, **gradually change how you spend your money.** Michalowicz outlines three new financial habits for doing so. (Shortform note: When creating these new habits, try adding them onto your existing financial habits or routines. This way, it’ll be easier to stick with your new habits, according to James Clear in _Atomic Habits_. By connecting new habits to existing behaviors, following your existing behavior will remind you to follow your new habit as well.)

**1)** When you change your current percentages to meet your ideal percentages, **start by only changing three percent.** Subtract three percent from a percentage currently higher than its ideal, and add it to a percentage currently below its ideal. (Shortform note: Michalowicz claims that by making small changes, you’ll be more likely to stick with those changes. James Clear agrees and further explains why this is the case in _Atomic Habits_. He asserts that people have an easier time sticking with easier behaviors, and so smaller changes are better when forming new habits. In addition, by creating a smaller version of a habit, you can connect more behaviors to that existing habit, which makes it easier to stick to both.)

**2)** Allocate income to your bank accounts and pay your bills twice a month, so you can keep track of how much you spend and when you spend it. (Shortform note: If you have less money than you thought you would when paying your bills consistently, that could mean your business is experiencing cash flow issues. Often, businesses have cash “trapped” in inventory or in accounts receivable. They earn the revenue for their business to work in theory, but have trouble actually receiving this revenue as cash on hand. By maintaining the habit of allocating income and paying bills bimonthly, however, you’ll avoid being surprised by this issue again.)

**3)** Take half of the money in your profit savings account for yourself at the start of each quarter as a reward for yourself, and to leave the rest of the money in the account as an emergency fund. (Shortform note: If you don’t want or don’t need all the profit for yourself, don’t automatically plan on reinvesting it into your business. Instead, consider giving some of the profit distributions to your employees by setting up a profit-sharing plan as part of their retirement fund. An estimated 19 to 23 percent of U.S. businesses do so.)

### Part 3: Using the Profit First Method Long-Term

Once you’ve set up the Profit First method, you can start using it long-term to improve your financial stability and profitability. To do so, Michalowicz offers detailed instructions for improving your business by cutting expenses and increasing efficiency.****

#### Cutting Expenses

Michalowicz explains that as you increase your profit percentage, you’ll need more money available for your profit allocation. However, he emphasizes that increasing your income is _not_ how to get this additional money, because cutting expenses is a faster and easier way to make money available. Michalowicz recommends you cut costs by compiling a list of all expenses from the last year. Then, for each expense, ask yourself, “Is this necessary for keeping my business running or making customers happy?” If the answer is no, cut that cost. If the answer is yes, then consider ways you can accomplish the same thing in a cheaper way.

> **How Best to “Tidy Up” Your Expenses**
> 
> If you’re having trouble finding unnecessary expenses, try using the practical techniques author Marie Kondo recommends for determining the things you do or do not need. Kondo offers these two guidelines in her book _The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up_ which can be particularly useful when cutting costs.
> 
> **Discard in one go:** When going through the process of getting rid of what you don’t need, Kondo recommends you get together everything you have and work through it all in one go. This doesn’t necessarily mean doing it all in one sitting, but rather working to power through everything whenever you can. When you declutter in one go, you keep up your momentum and don’t drag the process out. For your business, use all the time you have available to assemble your list of expenses and keep, improve, or remove them until you’ve reached your current goal.
> 
> **Sort categorically:** Kondo recommends that you sort by category when determining what to keep and what to get rid of. By doing this with your costs, you’ll have an easier time noticing which costs are redundant and cuttable.
> 
>   * For example, when you sort your costs into categories you might realize how many online subscriptions you’re paying for, and then can cut those costs. 
> 


#### Focus On What’s Profitable

In addition to cutting expenses, Michalowicz also suggests you improve your business by specializing in whatever makes the most profit. He suggests two areas to consider when looking for profitability: services and clients.

Specialization in your most profitable services reduces the time and money spent on a given sale by narrowing your focus on fewer, more consistent tasks, and only providing these profitable services means every sale you make will have a high profit margin.

(Shortform note: If you’re having trouble understanding how to find your most profitable services, then consider reframing it as the process of cutting down on services that are only useful in specific circumstances. Often, companies will spend disproportionate amounts of money on offering complex and niche services just in case a client asks for them. These services are inefficient, because they require extra costs for something that doesn’t bring in a significant amount of revenue.)

Michalowicz also recommends you focus more on serving your most profitable clients—clients who consistently ask for your main product or service and aren’t difficult to work with. If you have any clients who are only interested in difficult to provide services or are difficult to work with, he says to drop those clients because they’ll reduce your profits.

> **How to Focus on Profitable Clients**
> 
> While Michalowicz recommends you focus more on profitable clients, you might be wondering what practical steps you can take to do so. To focus on profitable clients, the management consultancy Strategex recommends taking practical steps in these two areas of your business:
> 
>   * **Delivery:** Strategex recommends that your business delivers services and products to profitable clients before anyone else. When you do this, your business will better satisfy its profitable clients and be more likely to keep them. You will take longer to deliver to less profitable clients since they’ll be a lower priority, but even if they leave you, you won’t be losing much.
> 
>   * **Sales:** Strategex also recommends that you spend the majority of your sales time making calls to potential new clients who are profitable, and cut the time you spend calling less profitable clients to keep the overall hours spent on sales the same. This will make you more likely to get sales that will be profitable and benefit your business, while cutting down time spent trying to sell to unprofitable clients.
