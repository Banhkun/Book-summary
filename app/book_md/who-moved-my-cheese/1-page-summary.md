## 1-Page Summary

“Who Moved My Cheese,” a bestseller by Spencer Johnson published in 1998, is a parable about the inevitability of change, the ways in which we typically deal with it, and how revising our attitude toward change can reduce stress and increase success. Like all parables, it’s told as a story that you can relate clearly to your life.

### The Narrative

The story takes place in a maze, where four characters search for and consume cheese. Cheese represents happiness or satisfaction in its various forms — for instance, security, prestige, or wealth.

Two characters, Sniff and Scurry, are mice who take an industrious, uncomplicated trial-and-error approach to finding cheese, They don’t overthink things, instead trying out various routes until one day they find a large store of cheese.

The other two characters, Hem and Haw, are little humans who apply more sophisticated thinking and analytical skills to the daily search. They, too, find the same large stockpile of cheese as the mice.

But the two have very different attitudes toward their situation. The humans Hem and Haw take the cheese for granted, assuming it will always be there. By contrast, the mice stay alert to their surroundings. They notice that the quality and supply of the cheese are slowly dwindling.

One day the cheese is gone. How the characters cope with this change offers lessons in surviving and thriving despite the inevitable changes in life and the workplace.

The simple-minded mice don’t overthink things. **They quickly accept the changed situation for what it is** , not cursing the world or the environment for its unfairness. They adapt to the change and immediately head out to look for new cheese. And while it takes concerted effort, they eventually find happiness in the form of a huge new pile of cheese.

In contrast, the humans Hem and Haw are _shocked_ to lose the cheese. They had felt entitled to it, and they curse the world for its unfairness. **They sit around, waiting for the cheese to reappear, and they become increasingly frustrated when it doesn’t.** Hem yells, “Who moved my cheese?”

Eventually, hunger gnawing at him, **Haw realizes his situation isn’t going to improve unless he changes his attitude and behavior**. Going back out to the maze to find new cheese is scary, and it’ll take hard work. But he envisions the joy of finding cheese again, and it pushes him outward. He leaves behind Hem, who refuses to move and continues fuming at the unfairness of his situation.

In his journey, Haw **overcomes his psychological barriers to adapting to change**. He realizes that his fear of going back out to find new cheese was overblown — he had let the fear build up in his mind, and in reality it wasn’t that bad. He encounters setbacks in the maze, but he realizes he’s still happier taking control rather than being a victim of his situation. He continues imagining enjoying new cheese, which motivates him to push further. As he learns each of these lessons, he writes messages on the wall for Hem to read, should he ever decide to search for new cheese himself.

Finally, he finds a new giant pile of cheese, even bigger than the first. Sniff and Scurry have already been there for some time, happily enjoying the cheese. Haw reflects on how far he has come since the first cheese pile ran out, and he resolves to treat future change differently.

### The Takeaways

It’s easy to draw parallels from the story to unsettling changes in our own lives — for instance, changes in a job, relationship, or health. The characters’ flaws and successes reflect our own tendencies when confronting change: Like Haw, we may resist, complain, and deny change because we’ve become complacent or afraid. Or **we can be like Sniff and Scurry, staying on our toes, preparing for future change, not overanalyzing things, and being ready to adapt without fear**.

Even when we adapt, change is initially challenging, and “Who Moved My Cheese” offers a road map for navigating change in a way that minimizes stress.

**The key takeaways are:**

  * Realize that change is inevitable. Anticipate it and look for signs that it’s coming.
  * When change happens, overcome your fears, most of which are exaggerated, and move quickly to adapt. If you don’t, you may be left behind as others gain the benefits and advantages of adapting. 
  * You can enjoy change: Learning and experiencing new things is rewarding. Taking control of your situation is empowering.
  * Expect and prepare for further, ongoing change.
