## Exercise: Identify and Combat Your Saboteur

Chamine explains how different Saboteurs influence your thinking and negatively affect your happiness and success. Identify one Saboteur that you see in your own thinking and create a plan for overcoming it.

* * *

First, consider the different types of Saboteurs and decide which one you see most often in your own thinking. If you feel you’re overly critical, you may be susceptible to the Controller or the Stickler. If you find yourself frequently distracted, you may be listening to the Avoider or the Restless Saboteur.

Next, explore the way this Saboteur impacts your thinking. In what ways does it limit you? Think of one decision you’ve made or thought you’ve had recently that was a result of your Saboteur’s influence, and then think about what you would have done differently if your Sage had been in control.

Finally, establish a plan for how to counteract that Saboteur the next time it tries to influence you. What do you think triggered that Saboteur? How can you employ your Sage’s powers to overcome its influence?
