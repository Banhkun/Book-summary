## Exercise: Stop Keeping Score

In the business and political worlds, people often do favors with the expectation that others will return the favors. They keep track of who “owes” them. But the Law of Influence calls for totally putting others’ interests first while trusting that your interests will be taken care of in the process.

What would it be like to have that kind of selfless relationship with everyone in your life—family, friends, coworkers, strangers?

What would it take to make that happen?
