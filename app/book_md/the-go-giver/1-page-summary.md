## 1-Page Summary

_The Go-Giver_ by Bob Burg and John David Mann is a business parable that contradicts the notion that to be successful, you need to be a go-getter, a competitive hard-charger focused on getting new clients and making ever-bigger deals. Instead, the authors contend you should**make _giving_ rather than _getting_ your first priority in business and in life—and success will follow**. Becoming a “go-giver” means giving value to others, not as a strategy or _quid pro quo,_ but as a way of leading a satisfying life.

In the parable—in which a mentor guides a frustrated go-getter named Joe to success and fulfillment—the authors explain why and how to become a go-giver by practicing the Five Laws of Stratospheric Success.

### Joe’s Story

Joe, a go-getter at Clason-Hill Trust Corporation, was having a bad third quarter. He lost a contract that was up for renewal and failed to land a new account he had hoped for. As a last-ditch effort to gain an edge, he scheduled a meeting with a wealthy business consultant, who he hoped would help him connect with and influence clients.

At their first meeting, the consultant, identified only as Pindar or The Chairman, shared his counterintuitive “trade secret” for success: giving.

He said most people get things backward. They strive to get something, usually money, before giving anything. This is as foolish as wanting to get heat from a fireplace before adding logs, or wanting interest from a bank before making a deposit. Instead, successful people focus on giving—and that creates success. **The more you give, the more you have**.

Pindar agreed to teach Joe how to practice it via the Five Laws of Stratospheric Success—on the condition that Joe apply each law the day he learns it. Each day for a week, Pindar arranged for Joe to meet a successful person who embodied one of the laws of success. Day by day, Joe found the lessons changing his life in ways he never imagined.

### Five Lessons

**1) The Law of Value** : How much more you give others in value than you receive in payment defines your worth.

For Joe’s first lesson, they met with Ernesto Iafrate, owner of Iafrate’s Italian-American Cafe, one of a chain of restaurants Ernesto owned. Ernesto started his restaurant career with just a hot dog stand. Following the Law of Value—giving more in value than he received in payment—was the key to his success.

Ernesto gave exceptional value to his customers beyond the food they bought from him. He made buying a hot dog a memorable dining experience by building relationships with his customers—he remembered not only customers’ names and preferences, but their children’s names and birthdays as well as many details of their lives. Children brought their parents and parents brought their friends and associates to his stand. Several customers became Ernesto’s partners and he opened a chain of restaurants and began buying commercial real estate. His philosophy for running a great restaurant was providing better food and service than customers could pay for.

Joe questioned whether giving more in value than you get in return amounted to giving away money. Ernesto replied that asking whether something makes money is the wrong first question. He said the first question should be whether your enterprise serves and adds value to others. If the answer is yes, _then_ ask whether it makes money. You should give, not as a strategy, but as a way of life. When you do, profits or other benefits follow because people want to do business with you.

**2) The Law of Compensation** : Your income depends on how many people you serve and how well you serve them.

Joe’s next meeting was with Nicole Martin, CEO of a global educational software company. She explained that as a grade school teacher, she had invented some games to promote children’s curiosity and creativity. They worked so well that she wanted to enlarge her impact by sharing them with more children. With some investors, she started a company that ultimately brought her games to twenty-five million children.

Nicole told Joe that while the Law of Value determines your potential income, the Law of Compensation determines how much you actually earn. It states that your income depends on how many people you serve and how well you serve them—your impact. This means _you_ determine your level of compensation—to increase your success, just serve more people. There’s no limit to what you can earn or achieve: **Everyone can succeed because anyone can give**.

**3) The Law of Influence** : Your influence (social capital) is determined by the extent to which you put others’ interests first.

Joe and Pindar next visited Sam Rosen, a financier and owner of the Liberty Life Insurance and Financial Services Company, the most successful financial services company in the world.

Sam told Joe that besides giving, a key to success is expanding your influence by building a network of people who know, like, and trust you—an “army of personal ambassadors,” who might not necessarily buy from you but who always have you in mind. With such an army, you’ll have a stream of referrals.

The way to create a network of personal ambassadors is to stop “keeping score”—that is, doing favors with the expectation that others will return the favors and keeping track of who “owes” you. The third law of success means rejecting _quid pro quo_ and win-win scenarios where you each get something and instead putting the other person’s win first—focusing totally on her interests.

This approach generates success because **if you put others’ interests first, your interests will always be taken care of** because you build a reservoir of goodwill that ultimately benefits you.

**4) The Law of Authenticity** : The most important thing you can offer is yourself.

Joe’s next visit was to an annual sales conference to hear a speech by Debra Davenport, the city’s top Realtor. But as she explained in her speech, her career was a failure until she applied the Law of Authenticity.

Debra was a hard worker but couldn’t manage to sell any houses. She heard a speech by Pindar on the importance of giving added value, but couldn’t think of any value she could offer. Discouraged, she planned to quit after one final home-showing appointment. Since it was her last sales effort, she abandoned all her techniques and just chatted with the female client about her interests and experiences. And the woman bought the house.

Debra realized she had added value by being a friend, by caring, and by making the client feel good about herself. She’d been authentic. Her career soon took off from there. Debra’s message to her conference audience was, **the most important thing you can offer is yourself**.

**5) The Law of Receptivity** : For effective giving, be open to receiving.

In Joe’s last lesson, Pindar explained the relationship between giving and receiving. Everyone learns the adage, “It’s better to give than to receive,” which is interpreted to mean that if you’re a good person, you give without thinking of receiving anything. However, Pindar asserted that the adage is wrong: it’s not _better_ to give than to receive. It’s actually crazy to try to give and not receive because **receiving naturally follows giving.** They go together like inhaling and exhaling—you can’t do only one of them and one isn’t better than the other.

**You have to choose to receive—or giving won’t create the success or results you want.** You have to close the loop. Joe immediately grasped the concept. He observed that if you don’t receive, you’re refusing the gifts of others and you “shut down the flow.” Babies and children are receptive—in fact, they’re hungry to receive. But people tend to lose that quality later in life.

Joe concluded: **the secret to success is giving and the secret to giving is being open to receiving.** _That_ , Pindar said, was the Law of Receptivity.

### The Rest of the Story

Joe’s life changed when he began applying the laws of giving:

  * He gave a client more value than he received in payment by referring the customer to a competitor: the Law of Value. When Joe lost an account because his company didn’t have the international connections the client was looking for, Joe passed on the name of a competitor, Ed Barnes, who had the qualifications.
  * He put his wife’s interests first: the Law of Influence. When she needed to vent after a tough day at work, Joe gave her all the time she needed rather than shortening the discussion so he could get work done that he’d brought home.
  * He expanded the number of people he served at work—the Law of Compensation—by literally serving Rachel’s coffee to everyone on his office floor after she gave him the coffee as a gift.
  * He was honest and authentic with a colleague: The Law of Authenticity. Previously, he’d let office gossip get in the way of a working relationship with his colleague Gus. Once Joe cleared the air, they had a productive relationship.
  * Finally, he experienced the Law of Receptivity when the referral he had made to a competitor started a ripple effect, bringing new clients for Joe. It expanded his network of “personal ambassadors” and ultimately led to a successful new business venture that made him wealthy.



Joe, the one-time go-getter, had become a go-giver.
