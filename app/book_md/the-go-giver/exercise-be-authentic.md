## Exercise: Be Authentic

The Law of Authenticity states that the most important thing you can offer is yourself. Applied to a business environment, it means that when you sell a product or service, you’re selling yourself. If you put on an act instead of being authentic, you’ll fail.

* * *

Think of an instance where you played a role or acted in a certain way because it was expected. What kind of response did you get? How did it make you feel?

How would the situation have been different had you acted authentically? What value could you have added by being yourself?

How much of your time do you spend playing a role that isn’t the real you? How can you reduce that time and be more authentic overall?
