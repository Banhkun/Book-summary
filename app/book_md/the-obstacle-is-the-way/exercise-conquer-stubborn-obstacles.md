## Exercise: Conquer Stubborn Obstacles

When you’re stuck on a problem, don’t be tempted to give up. Each effort is an opportunity to test ideas and learn; eventually, you’ll find the right one.

* * *

Think of a problem where you’ve tried multiple solutions, but nothing’s worked (for example, searching for a new job). What do you think makes this problem so difficult to solve?

Why do you think your attempts so far have failed? What have you learned so far?

How might you be making the situation more difficult for yourself? What unfounded assumptions might you be making about the problem? (For example, if you’re unable to find a new job, you may be limiting yourself to jobs that are too similar to your previous position, or falsely assuming that your resumé is perfect for the kind of job you’re trying to land.)

What’s an unconventional approach you could use to solve this problem? (Remember: You might need to try something unexpected, break the rules, or do nothing. In your job search, you may take an unexpected route and look for a job in a new field, or even settle for a temp job or paid internship.)
