## Exercise: Be a Practical Pessimist

When making plans, consider what could go wrong _in advance_ to prepare for or prevent problems. When you’ve anticipated a problem, you won’t be thrown off track or respond incorrectly if it comes to pass.

* * *

Describe a plan you’re making for an upcoming event—for example, for a trip, wedding, renovation project, or community event.

Next, list everything you can think of that could disrupt your plan (such as weather, illness, or a financial emergency).

For the three most likely problems, write out backup plans in the form of “if … then” scenarios (if this happens, I’ll do this). For example, if rain is forecast, we’ll move the event to the gymnasium.

How did this exercise make you feel? Can you see yourself doing it more often in your regular life?
