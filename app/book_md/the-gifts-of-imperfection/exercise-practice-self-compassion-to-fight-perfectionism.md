## Exercise: Practice Self-Compassion to Fight Perfectionism

Learn how to practice self-compassion to overcome perfectionism.

* * *

Describe a situation in which you were very self-critical. What drove this self-criticism? Had you made a mistake, or failed in some way?

Consider how perfectionism may have played a part in this incident. Did you strive to appear perfect, only to fall short? Were you criticizing yourself for failing to meet impossible standards?

Imagine you had the chance to react to the same situation again. How could you treat yourself in a more compassionate way? (Remember the three tools of self-compassion: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness.)
