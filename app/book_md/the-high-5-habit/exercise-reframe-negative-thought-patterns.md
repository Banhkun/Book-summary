## Exercise: Reframe Negative Thought Patterns

As you begin to build a High 5 Habit, you’ll still have moments of self-doubt or negative self-talk. Robbins argues that it’s important to address the negative thoughts as they occur using the following three-step process: Interrupt the thought, replace it with a positive affirmation, and take action to validate that affirmation.

* * *

What is a common negative thought or limiting belief that you have? Write it down.

Reframe the negative thought as a positive affirmation. For example, if your doubt is, "I don't have the right skills," you could reframe it as, "I have the ability to learn and acquire the skills necessary to achieve my dream."

Now come up with one action step you can take to prove that affirmation is true. For example, you might enroll in a course, workshop, or training program that focuses on developing the skills you believe you lack.
