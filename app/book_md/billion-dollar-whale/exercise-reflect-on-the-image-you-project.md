## Exercise: Reflect on the Image You Project

Project the right image of yourself to the world.

* * *

Jho Low was exceptionally gifted at controlling his public image. While Low chose to use this skill for criminal purposes, you can use it to benefit yourself at work and in other relationships. The first step is to understand how people see you now. For instance, Low recognized that his peers at Wharton initially saw him as an outsider with little social and financial clout. Consider someone you’d like to impress, for example, a manager at your office. Imagine how they see you, and write down a brief description of yourself, as seen through the other person’s eyes.

Once you’ve reflected on how others currently see you, decide how you’d like to be seen. Write down a short list of adjectives that reflect your desired qualities. For instance, while Jho Low would have chosen “rich,” “influential,” and “powerful,” you might instead want others to see you as being “reliable,” “hardworking,” and “kind.”

Once you’ve decided on the qualities you’d like to project, the next step is to demonstrate those qualities through action. For example, because Low wanted to project wealth, he took to throwing extravagant parties.nnFor each adjective you listed in the previous prompt, list a corresponding action you can take to demonstrate that quality. For instance, if you want other people to recognize that you’re a hard worker, putting in extra hours at work this week would be a great first step!
