## 1-Page Summary

_Billion Dollar Whale _by Tom Wright and Bradley Hope details the exploits of Jho Low, a Malaysian financier who allegedly stole billions of dollars from Malaysian sovereign funds. In order to leverage these heists, Low courted figureheads from international banks and governments by branding himself as a successful, powerful businessman. While the scandal was ultimately exposed in 2015, and many of his associates were prosecuted, Low remains at large.

Wright and Hope covered Low’s story in _The_ _Wall Street Journal_. Their Pulitzer-nominated coverage of the scandal helped bring public awareness and scrutiny to Low and his associates. _Billion Dollar Whale,_ originally __ published in 2018,__ sheds light on the corruption and unsavory practices that individuals, banks, and governments used to commit fraud. The book also describes how Low spent the money he stole, primarily on luxurious parties, gambling binges, and shopping sprees (the title references this pattern; “whale” is a term some casinos and nightclubs use to describe customers who spend extravagant amounts of money gambling or partying).

In our guide, we’ll examine the path Low took to prominence—manipulating his image and fostering friendships with powerful people. We’ll focus on the techniques Low used to embezzle billions, as well as the mistakes that led to his downfall.

We’ll also compare Low’s scheme to other financial heists and provide context on the political and financial systems that allowed Low to operate. Finally, we’ll provide updates on further developments in Low’s story since the book was published.

### Low Learned to Cultivate Connections by Controlling His Image

Jho Low’s beginnings—he was born and raised in Penang, Malaysia—were far from humble. Low’s father, Larry Low, had made millions through the sale of his shares in a garment company. However, attending the UK’s prestigious Harrow boarding school, and later on the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School in the US, the younger Low was surrounded by the children of some of the wealthiest, most influential families in the world. According to Wright and Hope, while Low’s family was wealthy, its riches and status paled in comparison to those of these young members of the global elite.

(Shortform note: While Wright and Hope note that Low’s relative lack of wealth put him at a social disadvantage, even the wealthiest students might have struggled to stand out at Wharton. Wharton’s list of famous and successful alumni includes Elon Musk, Warren Buffet, and Donald Trump, to name a few. At such a prestigious institution, it would have been difficult for Low to make a name for himself, even with more money.)

At school abroad, **Low learned to carefully manipulate his image to convince the rich and powerful that he belonged among them**. As Wright and Hope describe, Low threw parties designed to elevate his status. For example, in boarding school, he invited several classmates to vacation in Malaysia. He hosted them in an extravagant, rented mansion, claiming it was his own. The ruse worked, convincing Low’s young classmates of his wealth. Throughout his time at Wharton, Low continued to earn a reputation for the lavish parties he hosted.

(Shortform note: Low may only have been able to pull off his ruse because he was from a wealthy background to begin with. Some experts believe that because of the high correlation between wealth and physical well-being, strangers can tell if you’re wealthy just by looking at your face. This principle suggests that if someone from a low-income family attempted to seem more wealthy, others might be able to intuitively determine the truth.)

#### Low Began Building Influence in the Middle East and Malaysia

Once his reputation was established, Low began looking for ways to leverage his new connections. Wright and Hope note that Low began visiting the Middle East with his Wharton friends, hoping to be introduced to potential future business partners.

Wright and Hope describe how Low soon began to forge relationships with powerful political and financial figures overseas. Notably, Low met with Yousef al Otaiba, a political adviser who would later become an ambassador, and Khaldoon Khalifa al Mubarak, who ran Mubadala Development, a sovereign wealth fund in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Shadowing al Mubarak, **Low was able to observe the freedom with which sovereign wealth funds operate**. Backed by the UAE’s government, al Mubarak and the other men at the head of Mubadala had billions at their disposal, with little oversight or regulation.

(Shortform note: A sovereign wealth fund is a state-controlled investment fund that a country uses to generate revenue that it can then repurpose as necessary. These government-owned funds serve a variety of purposes. Some sovereign wealth funds exist to help their governments pay off debts in hard times, others exist to bolster pension funds for retired citizens, and some exist simply to generate as much money for the government as possible.)

At home in Malaysia, Low used his father’s connections to get in touch with the family of Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak. Najib, who would become prime minister in 2009, aspired to a more expensive lifestyle, much like Low. As Wright and Hope describe, Low tried to turn his connection with Najib’s family into a real estate deal. However, Low immediately ran into problems, promising profits to his new friends, while lacking the capital to fund the project. While the deal ultimately fell through, **Low’s newfound friendship with Najib was an important one**.

(Shortform note: Low’s relationship with Najib was especially useful because Najib was the scion of one of the most politically powerful families in Malaysia. Both Najib’s father and his uncle had served as prime ministers before him. While Najib entered office promising liberal reform, during his tenure he strengthened laws that allowed him to silence dissent—these measures would later help him conceal evidence of his involvement with Low.)

#### Low Learned to Work Carefully to Seem Legitimate

Low’s first foray into business failed due to his eagerness to quickly put things together, which resulted in him cutting corners. According to Wright and Hope, to succeed in his future ventures, **Low would have to learn to work more carefully**. Low’s next endeavor, the Iskandar land project, which brought together his contacts in the Middle East and Malaysia, would offer him another learning experience.

(Shortform note: While Low learned to work somewhat more carefully, his risk-taking behavior continued and ultimately led his scheme to be exposed. According to the experts, this is a common theme for embezzlers and money launderers—psychologically speaking, many white-collar criminals fail to reflect on their behaviors and are unable to foresee the consequences of their actions.)

The Iskandar land project was a plan to use a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund to construct and develop a financial center in Malaysia’s Iskandar region, to rival financial centers in Singapore and elsewhere. When Low learned that the Malaysian fund was looking for co-investors, he immediately put them in touch with his friend Khaldoon Khalifa al Mubarak, who ran the UAE’s Mubadala development fund. Thanks to Low’s involvement, Mubadala agreed to help fund the project.

(Shortform note: The Iskandar land project was Malaysia’s bid to enter the ongoing battle to be at the center of Asian finance. According to experts, as Asian economies have grown, Asia’s financial capitals, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shanghai, are now three of the five most important financial centers in the world. While the Malaysian economy has experienced rapid recent growth, Malaysia still has a long way to go to catch up with its neighbors.)

As Wright and Hope describe, the deal was a win for both Najib and Low. Low permitted Najib to take credit for the project’s success, bolstering his political credentials. In turn, Low had become increasingly influential with Najib and his family, as their political power grew.

While the Iskandar land project helped Low increase his influence, he failed to benefit financially from his role in the deal. According to Wright and Hope, Low intended to profit by charging a fee for setting up and brokering the deal. However,**the bank that handled the Iskandar project’s funds refused to pay Low** , seeing such fees as shady and archaic.

(Shortform note: While Low’s proposed brokerage fees were deemed suspect, brokerage fees are fairly common in many other industries, albeit for much smaller transactions. In particular, brokerage fees are common in the stock market and in real estate, where they’re often charged by stockbrokers and Realtors in exchange for their services.)

As Wright and Hope describe, Low realized that he would need to use more subtle methods to siphon money from these kinds of deals. When his brokerage fee was denied, Low opened several offshore accounts set up to look like construction companies. By creating these look-alikes, and getting his powerful contacts to vouch for their validity, **Low fooled banks into depositing money from the Iskandar project into accounts that he alone controlled**.

(Shortform note: Companies like the ones that Low set up are known as shell corporations. While shell corporations have some legitimate purposes, such as in the case of startups seeking investment, they’re also often used to evade taxes and launder money.)

On future deals, Low would set things up but avoid taking any public role. Instead Low’s associates took the public face of operations and helped funnel money out to him. This strategy allowed Low to use his friends’ legitimacy to push his deals through. His friends could profit too, while Low pulled the strings in secret.

(Shortform note: This setup, in which Low did the majority of the financial dirty work himself, may have offered his associates some degree of plausible deniability. Plausible deniability is a legal and political concept in which some members of an illicit organization who lack full knowledge of the organization’s wrongdoing are able to escape being blamed.)

### Low Used His Increasingly Powerful Network to Carry Out More Lucrative Heists

After the Iskandar deal, Low began to aim higher. According to Wright and Hope, rather than siphoning money from a deal he was peripheral to, Low sought to gain control over a large fund for himself.

#### Low Set His Sights on a Malaysian Sovereign Wealth Fund

When Najib became prime minister, he created the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MBD), a sovereign wealth fund. As Wright and Hope note, the fund’s stated purpose was to use government money to invest in green energy for Malaysia’s future. Through his experience with Mubadala, **Low learned that involvement in a sovereign wealth fund would lend him unregulated access to larger sums of money than ever before**.

In an attempt to leverage his influence with Najib, Low proposed that in addition to funding green energy, 1MDB’s money could also be used as a political slush fund for Najib to pull from as needed. To further strengthen his position, Low connected Najib to his old friend, Ambassador Otaiba of the UAE, and through this connection was able to ensure that the Abu Dhabi government would invest alongside 1MDB in its future ventures.

(Shortform note: Low and Najib’s misuse of the 1MDB funds has sparked international scrutiny of sovereign wealth funds. In the Philippines, a proposed new sovereign wealth fund has been criticized, with some fearing that it will be used and misused in the same ways as 1MDB. Criticism centered on the fact that the fund was originally going to be chaired by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. (son of the deposed dictator), which would have created a conflict of interest, incentivizing Marcos to misuse state funds for political purposes, as Najib did.)

Thanks to his relationship with Najib, as well as his role in connecting Najib to Abu Dhabi, **Low convinced Najib to put him in charge of 1MDB**. Wright and Hope write that the relationship was mutually beneficial: With Low in charge of the fund, Najib could rest easy knowing that his co-conspirator would be able to assist him in moving money around. And, for Low, working closely with Prime Minister Najib meant that he was free to operate with no fear of intervention from the Malaysian government.

As he had in the past, Low continued to operate in secrecy, taking no official role at 1MDB, instead staffing the fund’s board with associates who could lend 1MDB more legitimacy. Only Low himself, his associates, and Najib knew that Low was really in charge of the fund.

(Shortform note: Low may have felt especially protected by Najib because of Najib’s approach to government. Najib’s regime was so controlling that some authors have characterized him as an authoritarian. Critics of Najib note that he readily imprisoned political opponents and attempted to control Malaysian media as strictly as possible.)

#### Low Manipulated Financial Systems to Take Money From 1MDB

Wright and Hope note that **Low quickly set up a deal in 2009 between 1MDB and PetroSaudi, an oil company controlled by Prince Turki Bin Abdullah of Saudi Arabia**. While Prince Turki’s domestic influence was limited, Low took advantage of his royal status to convince Najib to invest in the PetroSaudi deal. Low’s plan was for PetroSaudi and 1MDB to co-invest in an oil exploration venture—together the two funds would buy up land, look for oil, and sell what they found. The sum total of this investment was billions of dollars. Low was indifferent to whether or not the oil investment became successful. As Wright and Hope argue, Low’s real purpose was to quietly siphon money away from the massive transactions that the deal involved.

(Shortform note: While PetroSaudi was involved in Low’s shady dealings through 1MDB, the exact extent of this involvement is still debated. Some experts have alleged that PetroSaudi used illicit funds from 1MDB to expand operations in Venezuela, advancing their own oil exploration and buying new drilling ships. While PetroSaudi’s lawyers have continually denied this, the allegations are still being investigated by the Malaysian legal system.)

With Najib on board, Low’s next step was to convince banks to both process the deal and to send Low a cut. However, sending large sums to an individual as part of a transaction between sovereign funds made some institutions uncomfortable. When the first few banks refused to work with Low, he adopted a new strategy. Instead of trying to ease suspicion, Low chose to avoid it altogether. According to Wright and Hope, **if a particular bank scrutinized Low’s transactions, he would simply test the waters at other institutions until he found one that was willing to work with him without questioning him**. Using this strategy, Low found a group of financial institutions and individuals who were willing to cooperate with him on the PetroSaudi deal.

(Shortform note: Low’s tactic of shopping out different banks was especially effective because of the large number of major financial institutions that take part in money laundering. Leaked US government documents show that many major banks engage in illicit transactions, including Deutsche, HSBC, and JP Morgan. With such an abundance of banks willing to get their hands dirty, it was inevitable that Low would find an institution that was ready to work with him.)

As the deal went through, Low once again used shell companies to take his cut of the funds. As a result of his strategic maneuvering, Low managed to get banks to wire hundreds of millions of dollars to offshore accounts he alone controlled.

(Shortform note: While Low used offshore accounts to hide his income from authorities, there are also plenty of legal reasons that offshore accounts exist. For example, companies that do business in multiple countries often use multiple bank accounts in different countries to make it easier to work with different currencies.)

#### Low’s Associates Ignored Wrongdoing Because They Stood to Profit

Wright and Hope write that throughout Low’s tenure at 1MDB, he worked with powerful political figures such as Najib, Otaiba, Prince Turki, and bankers at well-known international firms such as Goldman Sachs and Coutts. All of these people knew Low was stealing money, and yet they all worked with him anyway because they wanted cuts of the money for themselves.

(Shortform note: According to some authors, the reason financial leaders engage in these types of unethical behaviors is that they prioritize profit over purpose. These authors argue that when individuals and organizations are only in business to make money and aren’t interested in providing a meaningful service, they’re more likely to behave unethically. By contrast, organizations that are organized around purpose and values are less likely to succumb to corruption.)

Low held up his end of the bargain. In the wake of the PetroSaudi deal, Low sent multimillion-dollar payouts to his associates and bought extravagant jewels for Najib’s wife, rewarding them for aiding him.

### Focused on His Image and Lifestyle, Low Made Mistakes as His Scheme Grew

When the PetroSaudi deal went through, Low suddenly became a multimillionaire. Low used the money to boost his status even further, befriending a laundry list of celebrities. However, Wright and Hope note that **as Low focused on funding his new, glamorous lifestyle, it became difficult for him to manage an increasingly complicated scheme**.

#### Low Leveraged Success to Prop Up His Image

Low spent exorbitant amounts on parties and gambling excursions in an effort to court increasingly famous and powerful friends. As Wright and Hope describe them, Low’s parties were almost unbelievably extravagant. Hosted on multimillion-dollar yachts or at high-end Vegas casinos and hotels, Low’s parties featured A-list musicians and actors, as well as Low’s accomplices and other wealthy businesspeople. Guests drank the most expensive wine and spirits, and seven-figure gifts of jewelry and luxury vehicles were often exchanged.

(Shortform note: While Low was obviously chasing money and power, his high-profile parties indicate that to some degree he may have also been chasing fame. Low’s desire for renown isn’t unique—psychological surveys have shown that about a third of adults regularly fantasize about being famous. Experts believe that the lifelong desire for fame often stems from a nagging sense of social rejection. In Low’s case, this explanation fits fairly well, considering his struggle to fit in at both Harrow and Wharton.)

Through his newfound celebrity acquaintances, **Low began to invest in the entertainment industry** , funding musical projects and even his own film development company, Red Granite Pictures. While these ventures were largely vanity projects for Low, they also served a financial function. By investing in legitimate businesses, Low hoped to be able to make back enough money to repay the funds he pilfered from 1MDB before anyone noticed they’d disappeared. As Wright and Hope note, thanks in part to Low’s friendship with actor Leonardo DiCaprio, Red Granite would go on to produce the acclaimed 2013 film _The Wolf of Wall Street_.

(Shortform note: Low wasn’t alone in using the film industry as a vehicle to launder money. Thanks to the high production costs as well as the potentially large margins associated with Hollywood filmmaking, the industry has attracted its share of grifters. In 2006 several executives at Limelight Films were arrested, accused of money laundering, and charged with intent to distribute illegal drugs. And, in 2022, an executive at Aviron Pictures was convicted of using Aviron to commit both fraud and money laundering.)

In addition to his aspirations as an entertainment mogul, Low also began to invest in the art market, purchasing works by Basquiat, Monet, and others at multimillion-dollar auctions. Wright and Hope argue that Low’s forays into art collecting served a dual purpose, much like his entertainment investments. Collecting art raised his stature in elite circles and gave him assets he could quickly and untraceably liquidate if he found himself in need of emergency cash.

(Shortform note: As Low’s art investments illustrate, money laundering is rampant in the world of fine art. The art world exists in a legal loophole, where sellers are not required to disclose the names of their clients in the same way that a banker would. As a result of this, art investments allow individuals to anonymously store their wealth.)

#### The 1MDB Scheme Continued to Expand

Wright and Hope note that as Low’s lifestyle grew increasingly expensive, he continued to set up deals at 1MDB that allowed him to take the money he needed to keep up with his expenses.

According to the authors, Low’s past successes brought him increased legitimacy and a wider network of contacts. Because he had worked with reputable institutions, individuals and banks viewed him with less scrutiny. On his next major deal, **Low brought together the International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), a sovereign wealth fund owned by Saudi royalty, with Goldman Sachs** on a plan to sell bonds through 1MDB. Goldman Sachs’s involvement is especially notable considering that they were once again engaging in questionable practices only a few years after their actions contributed to the subprime mortgage bubble crash.

As with the PetroSaudi deal, Low wasn’t trying to set 1MDB up for success. Low set up the deal with IPIC and Goldman Sachs solely so that he could poach a cut of the transactions involved in the deal, taking the money and moving it into his accounts or those of his associates.

(Shortform note: Human nature may help explain why Low was able to charm so many wealthy and powerful people into investing in his schemes. According to some experts, human beings tend to trust each other by default. These experts argue that the human tendency toward trust may help explain how white-collar criminals win others over—in many cases people are inherently too trusting to notice wrongdoing.)

#### Low Struggled to Tie Up Seemingly Endless Loose Ends

While the IPIC deal proved lucrative for Low, the money he took from 1MDB pushed the fund further into debt. To make matters worse for Low, there was almost no income going back into 1MDB to make up for it.

Additionally, Wright and Hope note that Low now had to pay out those who had worked with him on the IPIC deal in addition to the Mubadala deal. Sending such large sums of money to so many people scattered across the globe necessitated a complex network of shell companies and offshore accounts to avoid arousing suspicion. Low struggled to manage these payments and was often late or forgetful making them. Additionally, as the number of illicit transactions increased, Low became lazy, often doing little to hide the nature of the transfers. These practices began to arouse suspicion at the banks Low worked with.

(Shortform note: Low’s struggle to repay his associates in some ways mirrors the collapse of Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. During the 2008 recession, many of Madoff’s investors tried to pull out of the scheme, but Madoff lacked the funds to repay them all. Madoff became overwhelmed and confided in his sons, who reported his crimes. While Low would make no such confession, like Madoff he too became ensnared in his own complex financial web.)

According to the authors, Low’s negligence began to put the entire scheme at risk. In 2013 a disgruntled former PetroSaudi employee named Xavier Justo reached out to Low’s associates. Justo threatened to leak thousands of emails detailing Low’s illicit dealings to the press and legal authorities unless he was paid the two million dollars he felt he was owed.

(Shortform note: While releasing the emails would have been a major threat to Low and company, in doing so Justo would likely have implicated himself in the scheme too. By threatening his former employers, Justo inadvertently created a situation resembling a prisoner’s dilemma. The prisoner’s dilemma is a famous thought experiment that explains why individuals in a group may sometimes choose to betray each other instead of acting in their shared best interest. Just as in the prisoner’s dilemma, both Low and Justo chose to betray each other—Justo by leaking information, and Low by refusing to pay Justo. Again, just as in the prisoner’s dilemma, both groups paid a price for their refusal to cooperate.)

Wright and Hope note that two million dollars would have mattered little to Low, and yet instead of paying Justo off, Low ignored his demands. Eventually, Justo began reaching out to journalists in an attempt to get them to pay him for the evidence he’d collected.

(Shortform note: Within the field of journalism, writers debate whether it’s ethical to pay sources like Justo for their stories. Many journalists believe it’s unethical to pay sources, as doing so creates a conflict of interest in which the source has a financial incentive to exaggerate their story to make it more attractive to publications. However, some journalists argue that when breaking a particular story helps expose corruption and wrongdoing, it can be worth paying sources in order to publicize critical information.)

Just as he could have easily paid Justo off, Low had plenty of money that he could have used to cover 1MDB’s debts and pay off his accomplices. However, distracted by his luxurious lifestyle, Low allowed these problems to fester while continuing to spend wildly at casinos and auctions.

(Shortform note: While caught up in extraordinary financial circumstances, Low succumbed to an ordinary problem: procrastination. According to experts, procrastination is a vicious cycle—by seeking to avoid an uncomfortable situation or task, you put it off, which only causes the problem to escalate, making it more difficult and uncomfortable to deal with later. Unfortunately for Low, he was unable to break this cycle before his problems came to a rapid boil.)

#### Low and His Associates Began to Attract the Attention of Journalists

Low’s friendships with the rich and famous, as well as his extravagant parties, brought him an increasing amount of attention from journalists and paparazzi. According to Wright and Hope, as Low’s lifestyle brought him into the spotlight, he attempted to shift the public narrative around his wealth. Just as he had done with his boarding school friends, Low tried to convince the media that his family was much wealthier than they really were. While Low had previously attempted to brand himself as a dealmaker in order to build a network, now that he was established, his goal was to disguise the source of his wealth. Attributing his money to inheritance served that purpose.

(Shortform note: Low’s attempt to change the media narrative around his wealth was an ultimately unsuccessful public relations strategy. Instead of changing the story, public relations experts advise that during a crisis, it can be helpful to engage with criticism and focus on positive news stories. According to these principles, Low’s denial may have only made his situation worse, as it did little to calm the negative buzz around him.)

As Wright and Hope note, in spite of Low’s best efforts, journalists began to investigate both Low’s debauchery and 1MDB’s dealings, with some stories beginning to link the two, albeit without strong evidence. Notably, _The_ _New York Times_ published a front-page story on Low, linking him to Najib. None of the media coverage of Low was able to conclusively implicate him in any wrongdoing until Justo, the disgruntled former PetroSaudi employee, contacted blogger and journalist Clare Rewcastle-Brown. Using Justo’s evidence, Rewcastle-Brown published a story in 2015 detailing 1MDB’s fraudulent deals. As Wright and Hope describe, **the story exposed the scandal and kicked off a wave of international investigations**.

(Shortform note: Just as Justo worked with Rewcastle-Brown to publicize Low’s misdeeds, whistleblowers often work with journalists to expose scandal and wrongdoing. These whistleblowers reach out to journalists to help them share information when it isn’t safe for them to do so themselves. In a particularly famous example, Edward Snowden provided journalists with documents that contained details of the US government’s surveillance of its own citizens. While Snowden later chose to reveal his identity, he originally leaked the documents anonymously in an attempt to avoid arrest.)

### Low’s Scheme Unraveled as Authorities Closed In

As a result of the information Justo leaked, world governments began prosecuting Low and his associates. Low’s co-conspirators at Goldman Sachs and in Abu Dhabi were now facing hefty fines and in some cases jail time.

#### Najib Used Extreme Measures to Silence Dissent

Wright and Hope note that while foreign governments were able to prosecute individuals and institutions within their jurisdictions, at home in Malaysia, Prime Minister Najib took extreme measures to protect himself and his allies, including Low. According to the authors, **Najib’s regime imprisoned Justo and publicly attempted to discredit him**. With Justo silenced, Najib made sure to keep stories about 1MDB and Low out of state-controlled media. He threatened journalists and political opponents with violence. During this period, a Malaysian anti-corruption prosecutor is alleged to have been murdered by Najib’s regime.

(Shortform note: While Justo spent almost two years in prison, he was eventually pardoned, and he recently released a book detailing his experience as an imprisoned whistleblower. According to Justo, in prison, he faced inhumane treatment, while his wife was simultaneously threatened and harassed. On his release, he reportedly struggled to find work in the banking industry, as many employers saw hiring a prominent whistleblower as a liability.)

However, despite his dictatorial actions, Najib could not hold on to power forever. Eventually, Wright and Hope write, Najib lost a reelection bid in 2018 and was subsequently prosecuted and sentenced by the opposition government.

(Shortform note: While he was sentenced in 2020, Najib only began to serve his 12-year sentence in 2022, when the Malaysian court system rejected his final appeal. In addition to jail time, Najib was also ordered to pay almost $50 million in fines.)

#### Low Evaded Capture by Hiding Out in Countries That Refused to Pursue Him

According to Wright and Hope, authorities in Malaysia and the United States seized any of Low’s assets that they could access, but Low escaped with plenty of money still discreetly squirreled away.

(Shortform note: While Low and his associates stole billions from the Malaysian state, at least some of that money eventually made its way back after being seized by international governments. The United States has reportedly repatriated over one billion dollars in seized assets to the Malaysian government.)

While his associates faced fines and prosecution, **Low himself managed to evade capture, slipping away into countries where he knew he wouldn’t be extradited**. Low kept a low profile, being only occasionally sighted in Bangkok and Shanghai. As Wright and Hope note, Low’s money still protected him in China, where the government was happy to shelter him, believing that his influence in Malaysia could eventually prove useful.

(Shortform note: While Low has evaded capture and is presumed to be under the protection of Chinese intelligence as of early 2023, some authors believe that Low may soon face justice. According to these authors, Low has become less valuable to the Chinese government and may one day soon be extradited to Malaysia.)
