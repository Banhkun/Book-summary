## Exercise: Reflect on the Struggle Between Nature and Society

Weisman paints a picture of the world that shows how thoroughly the human race is carving up the natural landscape to suit our own purposes. However, he argues that given the chance, nature could quickly take back the upper hand. Think about ways you’ve seen civilization and nature interact in your everyday environment.

In what sort of setting do you spend most of your time—urban, suburban, or rural? What plants and animals do you see on a regular basis? Are they wild and native to your region, or domesticated imports?

Describe an area near where you live that’s been recently cleared to build housing or a business. What was the area like before? How will the new construction change the landscape?

Consider an abandoned property you’re aware of. How long has it been out of use? What are the most obvious signs of decay? What plants or animals, if any, have moved in?
