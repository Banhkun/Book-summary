## Exercise: Examine Your Transportation Habits

Based on some of Smilâ€™s metrics about the environmental footprint of transportation, consider steps you can take to reduce the environmental impact of your travel. Because such change will require a collaborative, global effort, think about what you can do as an individual and as a member of a community.

* * *

Consider your method of daily and weekly travel. Do you drive to work alone in a vehicle? Do you ever take public transportation, bike, or walk? Jot down some of your common transport methods and how often you use them.

Now consider how you could spend less time driving alone. If you drive to work, could you carpool with a coworker? Or could you use other methods of transportation, such as a bus or a train? Note some possible alternative transportation methods.

Finally, think about if the area you live in has adequate public transportation in the first place. What non-car options are available? If these are lacking, could you take action to improve them? (You might do this by signing petitions, giving feedback to the existing public transit companies, or contacting local representatives.)
