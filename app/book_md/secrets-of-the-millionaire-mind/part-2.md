## Part 2: The Poor Mindset

In the first part of this guide, you learned that your money mindset is an accumulation of thoughts and beliefs that you picked up throughout your childhood. You _unconsciously replicate_ _or oppose_ the attitudes and behaviors that you grew up with, and this is why your finances are the way that they are.

Eker argues that thoughts and beliefs about money tend to fall into either a **rich mindset** (an attitude that moves you _toward_ financial success) or a **poor mindset**(an attitude that moves you _away_ from financial success).**If you’re not happy with the state of your finances, it’s because you’ve been negatively conditioned to have a poor money mindset** : Your unproductive thoughts and beliefs _impel_ you to act in ways that move you away from financial success. Therefore, in this second part of the guide, we’ll explore how negative conditioning works, and we’ll help you to _identify the specific thoughts and beliefs_ that discourage you from taking positive actions to improve your finances.

> **Wealth Doesn’t Always Equate to Success**
> 
> Eker claims that your thoughts and beliefs about money fall into two categories: rich and poor. It’s also clear that he considers wealth to be the root of well-being and success—if you’re rich, you’re happy and successful. On the other hand, if you’re poor, you’re unhappy and unsuccessful.
> 
> While self-improvement literature does support the concept of classifying our thoughts into distinct groups that determine our likelihood of success, it tends to provide a more well-rounded definition of well-being and success than Eker provides. For example, Carol S. Dweck (_Mindset_) argues that your traits and tendencies determine whether you have a “growth mindset” that leads you to success, or a “fixed mindset” that inhibits your success.
> 
> Dweck’s focus is not on what you _have_ or _achieve_ , but on your general attitude and approach to all areas of your life. According to her, you’re successful if you have a growth mindset, consistently embrace challenges, and take steps to move forward and improve your life. Therefore, even if you have very little money, you’re _more successful_ than someone who may have more money but, due to their fixed mindset, fails to move past self-imposed limitations due to a lack of confidence or motivation.

### Poor People Have a Negative Attitude and Mismanage Their Money

Eker argues that, if you have a poor mindset, each time you engage in negative thought patterns, you reinforce the belief that you’re powerless when it comes to money. This is because you deny your role in your financial situation and reinforce the negative conditioning you adopted throughout your childhood—the more you engage in this type of thinking, the more you associate money with the feeling of powerlessness. As a result, you’re incapable of achieving the financial success that you want.

(Shortform note: _The Happiness Advantage_ sheds light on Eker’s claim that negative thoughts lead you to feel powerless. The book presents the latest research in neuroscience and positive psychology to argue that _**happiness is the cause of success**_ : When you choose to cultivate the habit of thinking positive thoughts, you train your brain to find opportunities in adversity and more easily overcome challenges and setbacks. On the other hand, when you habitually think negative thoughts, your pessimism blocks you from perceiving opportunities and trains your brain to shy away from challenges. This stops you from moving forward and leaves you feeling powerless to improve your situation.)

#### Negative Conditioning Creates Low Self-Esteem and a Victim Mentality

Eker claims that low self-esteem goes hand in hand with negative conditioning and negative thinking: Poor people generally suffer from low self-esteem—due to their interpretation of their upbringing, they don’t feel like they’re _good enough_ to have or manage more money. This money mindset leads them to **unconsciously sabotage** their chances of financial success. For example, they feel impelled to spend their money on unnecessary expenses instead of saving.

With every setback poor people face, Eker argues, their confidence takes a knock and they become habituated to the feeling of failure. Eventually, their lack of confidence prevents them from moving past their comfort zones to embrace challenges—this is because they allow their fear of failure to stop them from taking advantage of opportunities.

> **Not All Poor People Have Low Self-Esteem**
> 
> Psychological research confirms that negative thought patterns do contribute to low self-esteem. However, it’s necessary to make the distinction here that **not all “poor people” have low self-esteem**. Eker’s argument is based on the premise that if you’re poor, you must be unhappy because you’re _not rich_ , and that your low self-esteem is holding you back from wealth.
> 
> But his argument is based on the assumption that _everyone wants to be rich_ , and he doesn’t factor in that some people actively _choose_ not to make more money: for example, the parent who _wants_ to prioritize family over career and finances, or the freelancer who works just enough to sustain her lifestyle so that she can spend more time doing things that feel meaningful to her. In both cases, money itself is not a priority, just a means to an end. Therefore, not having money probably wouldn’t impact these people’s self-esteem.

##### How Negative Conditioning Manifests

Eker claims that this negative conditioning is easy to identify once you start taking notice of how you think and talk about money. But, he argues, instead of investigating why they’re unable to overcome their financial problems, poor people **_deflect attention away from themselves and seek external causes for their problems_**. They blame others for their misfortune, resent people who have what they want, and justify their poverty and their negative attitudes with **false beliefs** such as, “Rich people are greedy and corrupt.”

Eker claims that poor people use these tactics to relieve the stress of feeling poor and powerless. Unfortunately, these stress-relievers leave them locked into operating from a negative mindset that keeps them in poverty.

(Shortform note: The negative mindset that Eker describes is more commonly referred to as a victim mentality—the belief that bad things always happen to you through no fault of your own. This belief creates a feeling of apathy because, when you feel like other people are always trying to thwart you, you find it difficult to build the motivation to take positive action and change your life. Instead, people with a victim mentality often magnify their problems and their _perceived injustices_ in an attempt to seek attention (comfort, sympathy, reinforcement of their beliefs) from others. The attention they receive from others **_validates their powerlessness_** and keeps them from moving forward.)

##### Poor Mindset Tendencies

Eker mentions 10 behavioral traits that poor people tend to engage in:

**1) Blame others for their financial problems** : “It’s the economy’s fault that I’m not making the amount of money that I want.”

(Shortform note: Jordan Peterson (_12 Rules for Life_) offers a more constructive approach than blame. Before you blame the outside world or specific people for your misfortunes, ask yourself: What personal responsibility did you have in your misfortune? Have you done everything in your ability to solve your problems, or are you _passively letting bad things happen to you_?)

**2) Resent others’ good fortune** : “They think they’re so much better than us!”

(Shortform note: _Alcoholics Anonymous: The Big Book_ claims that resentment is a major flaw that leads you to avoid facing your own flaws and accepting responsibility for your own thoughts and actions. Confront your feelings of resentment by investigating their cause. Ask yourself: Why do you feel resentment, and how is this resentment harming you? For example, you resent your neighbors because they have a beautiful new car. The resentment makes you feel embarrassed about your old car and this harms your self-esteem. Next, ask yourself whether your embarrassment about your car is really their fault.)

**3) Rationalize their lack of wealth** : “It’s okay, there are more important things than money.”

(Shortform note: Malcolm Gladwell (_Blink_) explains that rationalizing is simply explaining our actions or thoughts with reasons that aren’t accurate. Our inaccurate explanations for our decisions **harm our ability to make smart decisions**. For example, if you make excuses for your lack of wealth by claiming that you don’t care about money, you’ll base your future decisions on this premise and make decisions that keep you poor.)

**4) Complain about their financial situation** : “I hate my job and it doesn’t pay enough.”

(Shortform note: According to the authors of _Crucial Conversations_ , complaining is a method we use to intentionally ignore the role we play in our problems. It justifies our current behavior by excusing us from any responsibility and, as a result, we don’t feel any motivation to change our thoughts and behaviors. The authors argue that instead of complaining, you should focus on telling yourself _accurate stories_ that motivate you to think and act constructively. In other words, focus on your role in the problem and think about what you need to do to change the situation.)

**5) Limit their choices** : “I can’t be rich _and_ be there for my family and friends.”

(Shortform note: When you focus on your limitations, you block yourself from seeking solutions that will improve your life, and you resign yourself to staying in the same situation. In _Awaken the Giant Within_ , Tony Robbins suggests that you should instead focus on asking yourself positive and empowering questions that lead to solutions. For example: What can you do to create more money _and_ be there for your family and friends? Empowering questions lead to solutions that will help you to create the life that you want.)

**6) Feel unworthy of financial success** : “I’m not good enough to earn more money.”

(Shortform note: Feelings of unworthiness or of “not being good enough” are very common. However, according to Jen Sincero (_You Are A Badass_), it takes the same amount of energy to see your faults as it does to see your strengths. She suggests countering your insecurities by imagining yourself through the eyes of someone who admires you—this person will _only see_ your full potential and your talents. This method will train you to focus on your strengths, and, as a result, feel less stress around your _perceived flaws_.)

**7) Focus on their problems and fears** : “I’m not going to try in case I fail.”

(Shortform note: Brendon Burchard (_High Performance Habits_), claims that the tendency to focus on problems and fears occurs when we don’t have a clear purpose for our actions and are too focused on the difficulty of our present circumstances to look to the future. According to Burchard, if you want to make improvements in your life, accept that **challenges and hardships are the route to your success**. Therefore, focus on what you’ll gain from overcoming your problems and fears, and use this to motivate yourself to move forward.)

**8) Aim low and seek security** : “What’s the point in working more than I have to?”

(Shortform note: When you aim low, it’s often because you’re afraid to take risks and move out of your comfort zone. If you remain inactive in your comfort zone, you’ll never improve or gain the confidence to go for what you want. The authors of _The Confidence Code_ claim that the best way to move forward to what you want is to _continually_ take actions that move you out of your comfort zone. For example, offer to take on more responsibilities at work—the extra work will challenge you, and may lead to a promotion and a pay rise.)

**9) Mismanage their money** : “I might as well spend my money because I’ll never be rich.”

(Shortform note: According to Ramit Sethi, author of _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_ , there’s a psychological reason underlying our tendency to mismanage our money: **decision paralysis**. Sethi argues that we become too overwhelmed to make decisions about our finances when we’re presented with multiple options and opinions about the best way to move forward. To move past this, he recommends that you switch your focus from information-gathering and start taking small _proactive_ steps towards financial success.)

**10) Seek instant gratification** : “I will spend my money because I have nothing else to look forward to.”

(Shortform note: It can be difficult to make sacrifices now for the sake of your future comfort. James Clear, the author of _Atomic Habits_ , offers a way to overcome the temptation to indulge in instant gratification: He suggests that you find ways to **immediately reward yourself** for engaging in the positive habits you want to form. For example, each time you avoid spending your money on something frivolous, transfer this money to an account earmarked for something that represents the wealth that you want, like a new car or a special outfit. The satisfaction of watching this account grow will outweigh your fear of missing out and will encourage you to make decisions that benefit your finances.)

##### An Example of Negative Conditioning at Play

To illustrate how negative conditioning can perpetuate a victim mentality, let’s look at an example. If you dislike your job and blame your employer for not paying you enough, you **limit your choices** because you prevent yourself from accepting your role in the situation (you _choose_ to do this job and to accept this pay). You vent your frustration by resenting and blaming people who have what you want. To cope with this feeling of powerlessness and frustration, you make excuses to explain why you’re in this unhappy situation, such as, “It’s okay, at least I have a job to pay the bills.” **These negative habits stop you from focusing on what you need to do to move forward and keep you trapped in an unsuccessful situation.**

> **How Your Unconscious Biases Keep You Stuck in Negative Cycles**
> 
> Throughout the book, Eker argues that poor people get stuck in a cycle of poverty because they want money but have no money. They engage in negative habits to deal with their disappointment, and these habits prevent them from taking the actions necessary to earn, receive, or “attract” money.
> 
> While you may feel that your negative thoughts and beliefs are entirely rational (your experiences _justify_ your negative reactions), it’s likely that your conditioning has prompted the formation of unconscious biases that led you to develop these negative tendencies. These biases are the result of your brain’s attempt to make quick judgments based on your past experiences, and they shape the way you think about and perceive your environment.
> 
> There are many different types of cognitive biases, and each of them influences your perception in different ways. The most common forms are confirmation bias, the tendency to pay more attention to the information that confirms and reinforces your opinion, and negativity bias, the tendency to notice and dwell on the negative aspects of your experience.
> 
> **Break Free From Your Negative Tendencies**
> 
> To break free from the impact of your conditioning and the cognitive biases that influence you, ask yourself why you engage in negative thinking and what reasons you use to justify these thoughts. If you notice that you engage in any of the tendencies on Eker’s list, first ask yourself where you learned to react in this way (for example, from your role models or your social group). Next, ask yourself what benefits you receive from behaving this way (you get to stay in your comfort zone). Finally, ask yourself if reacting in this way empowers you to move towards your financial success or discourages you from taking positive action to improve your finances.
