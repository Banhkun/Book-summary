## Part 3: The Rich Mindset

In the previous part, you learned how negative conditioning creates specific thoughts and beliefs that discourage you from taking positive actions to improve your finances. In this final part of the guide, we’ll explore how developing a rich mindset leads to wealth. We’ll cover specific techniques and strategies to help you adopt and cultivate a wealthy attitude that ensures your financial success.

### Why You Need a Rich Mindset

Eker argues that no matter how hard you work to accumulate money, or how many financial books you read or seminars that you attend, **your finances cannot improve unless you improve your mindset**. Recall: This is because your mindset will always find ways to sabotage the way you handle your money if the amount rises above your financial setpoint.

Fortunately, there is a way to increase your financial setpoint. Eker believes that you can **consciously reprogram your money mindset** to improve your finances by replacing your unproductive thoughts and beliefs about money with the productive thoughts and beliefs that _rich people_ have. The more you think like a rich person, the more you’ll improve your money mindset and raise your financial setpoint so that you can comfortably accumulate and manage more money.

> **How to Change Your Thoughts and Beliefs**
> 
> According to Eker, you only need to replace your unproductive thoughts and beliefs about money with productive thoughts and beliefs—this will improve your mindset, reprogram the way you behave around money, and increase your financial setpoint. Similarly, lots of self-help books claim that you just need to improve your thoughts to improve your life.
> 
> For example, Louise Hay (_You Can Heal Your Life_) argues that you just need to “affirm” what you want to make it come true: Change the statement “ _I’m not rich_ ” to “ _I am rich_ ” and repeat this multiple times a day. Eventually, you’ll come to believe this thought and your programming will align with your new beliefs. As a result, you’ll find yourself naturally taking actions that lead to more money.
> 
> However, while Maltz (_Psycho-Cybernetics_) believes that you can train yourself into feeling, and then acting successfully (by copying the positive thought patterns that successful people have), he argues that affirmations are not enough to change your beliefs and your programming—he believes that **your mind will automatically reject thoughts that don’t align with your established beliefs**.
> 
> Maltz claims that the only way to change your beliefs is to regularly use your imagination to visualize and **_feel_ the success (wealth) that you want**—this is because _your nervous system operates according to how you feel, not how you think_. According to Maltz, this practice will train your mind to become more comfortable with the feeling of financial success, and it’s the only way to change old and unproductive beliefs. Therefore, as you work through Eker’s suggestions, _imagine how you’d feel_ if you adopted the rich mindset and achieved the wealth that you want.

### Rich People Have a Positive Attitude and Effectively Manage Their Money

Eker argues that rich people always have a positive attitude towards their finances. They hold themselves accountable for the state of their finances and they take full responsibility for the impact of their thoughts and decisions. They understand that their positive thoughts lead them to take actions that produce successful results.

(Shortform note: While many people characterize a positive attitude according to multiple factors, such as how well you treat other people or how ethical you are, Eker focuses solely on the productive thoughts required to build and maintain wealth—not general personality traits or ethical behavior. This arguably makes his definition a little limited.)

Throughout the rest of this part, we’ll outline the specific thought patterns and habits that Eker claims rich people practice, and we’ll include practical techniques that you can use to recondition your thoughts and adopt the attitude of success.

#### Rich Mindset 1: Develop Discipline and Take Responsibility for Your Finances

Eker claims that rich people know that positive thoughts lead to positive actions. These positive actions lead to success and wealth. Consequently, they always focus on finding and creating solutions so that they can meet their financial goals. Eker proposes two ways to develop discipline and take responsibility for your finances:

  1. Stop yourself from thinking or speaking about money in a negative way. 
  2. Make a daily habit of reflecting on one thing that went well and one thing that didn’t. Think about what part you played in creating each of the situations and how you can improve your attitude and behavior. For example, if you had an argument about money with your partner, instead of casting blame, try to think about your role—what did you say or do to fuel the disagreement, and what can you learn from this?



> **Motivate Yourself to Think Positively**
> 
> Like Eker, Tony Robbins (_Awaken the Giant Within_) argues that you have to make the conscious decision to make your current thought patterns and behaviors more positive to change your life. He claims that each of your decisions (about how you think and behave) set into motion a series of actions that ultimately shape your life—each time you reflect on how your decisions have led you to create positive and negative experiences, you can learn from them and choose to make more beneficial decisions.
> 
> Robbins suggests that you can motivate yourself to take control of your mindset and increase its positivity by answering the following question: What are the financial and emotional costs of _not_ changing your mindset? In other words, what are you missing out on? Next, Robbins recommends that you reinforce the pleasure you expect to gain from improving your mindset by answering the following questions:
> 
>   * How will you feel about yourself if you make this change?
> 
>   * How will this change increase your happiness?
> 
>   * How will this change impact your loved ones?
> 
> 

> 
> When you identify the consequences of repeating the same negative thoughts and ineffective behaviors and weigh this against the benefits you’ll receive if you accept your role and change them, you’ll feel motivated to take control of your thoughts and behaviors to improve your financial situation.

#### Rich Mindset 2: Appreciate What You Want and Associate With Wealthy People

According to Eker, rich people feel inspired by the success of others—they take every opportunity to learn and take advice from people who are more successful than they are. Eker suggests three ways to develop this mindset:

1) Feel appreciation whenever you see signs of success, such as a beautiful car or an expensive home.

2) Make a point of celebrating your good fortune when you receive money, gifts, or compliments, and make a list of ten things you’re grateful for every day.

(Shortform note: How does feeling appreciation and gratitude bring more wealth into your life? Gretchen Rubin (_The Happiness Project_) argues that focusing on things that are going well in your life not only makes you happier, but it also makes you less envious of others. The more grateful you feel about _your_ life, the more inclined you are to appreciate what’s going well in the lives of _others_. This gratitude and appreciation ultimately helps you to transcend everyday negativity and makes you more resilient to any setbacks you face as you move toward your financial goals.)

3) Avoid identifying with negative people or watching useless television programs that perpetuate negativity. Instead, find ways to associate with rich people so that you can observe how they behave and habituate yourself to the feeling of wealth. You can do this by joining a high-end club or visiting expensive restaurants.

(Shortform note: Law of Attraction practitioners agree with Eker’s suggestion that you should avoid identifying with what you don’t want and instead act “as if” you already have what you do want. While Eker’s suggestion that you join a high-end club might be impractical for most, it’s worth considering how you can surround yourself with people that inspire you to learn more about how to become wealthy and successful. A practical way to approach this is to first consider whether the activities you engage in, or the people you hang around with, support your financial goals or prevent you from achieving them. Next, make a list of the successful people you already know, and try to learn more about how they accomplished their goals.)

#### Rich Mindset 3: Stop Making Excuses and Confront Your Fears

Eker argues that rich people take measurable steps towards what they want. They always focus on the end result of what they want to achieve, and they expect to succeed despite their doubts and fears. They plan ahead and create strategies to overcome their fears or potential problems—their confidence grows with each step they take to move forward. Eker suggests two ways to develop this positive mindset:

  1. Think about your greatest worries or concerns regarding money and plan the specific actions you’d take to overcome or limit their impact if they came true.
  2. Seek ways to move past your fears. For example, if there’s a project you want to start or a business field you want to get involved in, just start working for or with someone in that field and learn whatever skills you need to move forward. 



> **Use Your Worst-Case Scenario to Empower Yourself**
> 
> Like Eker, Tim Ferriss suggests that you should define your greatest worries and concerns as a tool to empower yourself. He argues that you’re more likely to hold back from taking action when you think of your fears as just vague possibilities that could happen. On the other hand, when you think about what you want to achieve and define the _actual_ worst-case scenario, you give your mind something specific and productive to work on.
> 
> If there’s a specific project you want to start or a business you want to get involved in, Ferriss suggests that you:
> 
>   * **Envision** your worst-case scenario in detail
> 
>   * **Plan** how you would get back in control of the situation
> 
>   * **Ask** yourself how you could benefit from this situation
> 
> 

> 
> Your answers to these questions will provide clues about what you can do to better prepare yourself and ultimately move past your fears—feeling prepared for anything will empower you to move forward toward your financial goals.

#### Rich Mindset 4: Aim High

According to Eker, rich people set a clear intention to create massive wealth—they align their thoughts and behaviors with this intention and their commitment leads them to take actions that create wealth. This clarity of intention allows them to focus wholeheartedly on what they want and they willingly make any necessary sacrifices to achieve their goal. Their motivation to create wealth overrides their doubts and fears and makes them more resilient to setbacks.

(Shortform note: Research supports Eker’s claim that setting intentions increases your likelihood of achieving your financial goals. This is because intentions force you to focus on _who you want to be_ , and they increase your self-discipline when you’re faced with conflicting choices about how to spend your time or your money. For example, if you set a clear intention to invest a specific amount of money into a savings account, you’ll know the _right_ way to act when faced with a decision between saving and wasting your money on something frivolous.)

Eker proposes two ways to clarify your intention to create wealth:

1) Write down the specific benefits you’ll receive from creating more wealth in your life.

(Shortform note: Many self-improvement practitioners agree that you need to feel emotionally invested in your goals in order to achieve them—in other words, the more benefits you anticipate from achieving your financial goal, the more inspired and motivated you’ll feel to achieve it. Therefore, when you write your list of benefits, try to make it as exciting as possible.)

2) Write down an ambitious financial goal that reflects the rich life you want and place it somewhere you will see it multiple times a day. Aim high but make sure this goal is achievable within a realistic time frame.

(Shortform note: Eker suggests that you challenge yourself when setting your financial goal. Similarly, Grant Cardone (_The 10X Rule_) argues that **the only way to achieve success is to set extreme goals and take extreme action to meet them**. Even if you fail to achieve the specific goal you set for yourself, your extreme actions will impact your finances in a positive way and leave you in a better financial position than if you aim low and take “small” actions.)

#### Rich Mindset 5: Promote Your Value

Eker claims that rich people understand that salaries or hourly wages limit their income (your income is tied directly to the number of hours you work). Therefore, they aim to get paid for the _value they provide_ and the _results they produce_. They do this by opting for commission, profit sharing, or investing in their company’s stock options.

Because their income is tied directly to the results they produce, rich people make every effort to promote themselves and the value that they have to offer—being overlooked or ignored means they don’t receive an income. Therefore, they make sure that they reach and benefit as many people as possible to maximize their profits: The more people they reach, the more income they receive.

(Shortform note: Eker’s claim that self-promotion is necessary to acquire wealth implies that extroverted people are more likely to feel comfortable with this process than introverted people. If the thought of indulging in verbal self-promotion makes your palms sweat, don’t feel pressured to adopt a more confident persona just to get ahead. Instead, consider how you can communicate your professional skills and value to just one or two people at a time. With practice, you’ll not only develop the confidence to talk about your expertise and accomplishments to bigger groups, but you’ll also receive the recognition you deserve.)

Eker proposes four ways to effectively advertise your value:

1) Suggest to your employer that they pay you based on both your individual results and the results of your company. This way, you’ll feel motivated to work harder so that you can earn more than your salary and profit from the results you produce.

(Shortform note: How can commissions or profit-sharing pay more than a salary? When you work for an employer, you only get paid a fraction of the value that you generate—this value may be many multiples of your hourly wage or salary. For example, you earn $20 an hour and work 40 hours a week—your salary is $800 a week. But the work you do generates sales for your employer totaling $5,000 a week. If you were paid a 25% commission, you would receive $1,250 a week ($450 more each week). Unlike a standard salary, the more sales you generate, the more income you receive so it’s in your best interest to produce results and promote your value.)

2) Think about the product or service you offer and rate it from 1-10 based on how much value you believe it offers. If your score is less than 10, think about ways you can increase the value of what you’re offering. Alternatively, start offering something you can fully believe in.

(Shortform note: Eker doesn’t offer advice on _how_ to assess the value you offer or come up with new ideas. The authors of _Business Model Generation_ argue that your product or service is more likely to be perceived as valuable if it **aligns with the specific needs of your customers _and_ differentiates itself from existing solutions**.)

3) Consider starting your own business (for instance, as an entrepreneur, coach, or consultant) based on your natural gifts and talents—how could you add more value to the world and get paid for your results as well as your time?

(Shortform note: Eker doesn’t explain __ how to start a business based on your interests and talents. There are a few practical steps you can take to start earning money from your natural gifts: First, identify what you're good at and enjoy doing. Next, identify profitable opportunities in high-growth areas that you’re interested in. Finally, explore ways that you can use your talents to add value to these areas. For example, if you’re good at organizing and you enjoy looking at healthy recipes, there are multiple businesses you can create from this combination, such as a meal-planning service for people who want to lose weight or are on special diets.)

4) Think about how many people you impact with your current work. Now come up with at least three different strategies so that you can provide value to and impact ten times the number of people. Learn as much as you can about marketing and sales so that you can successfully promote your value.

(Shortform note: How can you promote your value and reach more people? Eker doesn’t elaborate on this, but the authors of _Positioning _suggest over-simplifying the value you intend to offer so that your customers can immediately understand the benefits they’ll receive. For example, if you offer a professional cleaning service, focus on a simple benefit your customers get from using your service—they get to come home and relax knowing that all of the chores have been taken care of.)

#### Rich Mindset 6: Think Long-Term, Leverage Your Money, and Build Your Net Worth

Eker argues that rich people plan for their long-term wealth by growing **all of their financial assets**(their net worth): They think of the money they earn as _seeds that they can plant in order to grow more money_ for their future wealth. The more money they grow, the less they have to work to pay for their lifestyle. Rich people work to receive an income but they also**leverage their money in a way that makes it grow for them in the long term**.

(Shortform note: Financial experts agree with Eker’s claim that the route to wealth is to leverage your money through investments that create long-term growth. While this is sage advice, it doesn’t address the fact that many people must work multiple jobs or rely on credit cards just to cover basic living expenses such as groceries and utilities. They don’t have the resources to live comfortably _now_ let alone spare money to invest toward their future comfort.)

Eker proposes five ways to leverage your money and build your net worth:

1) Learn about investments: Read financial books or journals and then begin investing your money. Consider hiring a financial planner to manage your investments for you.

(Shortform note: Eker doesn’t offer practical advice on how to choose and set up investments or create passive income. Many finance books, including _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_ , _The Automatic Millionaire_ , and _The Millionaire Next Door_ , explain how investments work and discuss the benefits of leveraging your money in ways that make it grow. These books also offer detailed strategies to help you set up and manage your investments to create ongoing income in the form of compound interest. The authors of these books, in contrast to Eker, say that you shouldn’t need to hire a financial planner once you understand how to balance your investments.)

2) Switch your focus from earning money through hard work to earning money from passive income. Write down three ways you can create income without working. Research and then act on these strategies.

(Shortform note: While Eker doesn’t elaborate on how to create passive income, there are many ways you can create passive income streams such as selling digital products, renting out property, or investing your money in an account that applies compound interest.)

3) Write down your current net worth—add up the value of everything you own such as your cash, current business, investments, and real estate. Then subtract what you owe such as your mortgage payments or other debts. Next, write down your ideal net worth—the total value of all of your assets. What amount will allow you to achieve financial freedom (that is, you won’t need to work to live comfortably)? Track your net worth every 90 days—this will motivate you to keep moving toward your net worth goal.

(Shortform note: Eker doesn’t provide advice on how to determine your ideal net worth. According to _The Millionaire Next Door_ (Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko), your ideal net worth _should be_ based on your income and your age. Stanley and Danko present the following formula: Multiply your age by your taxable income, then divide this amount by 10, and subtract any inherited money. **The result is what your net worth _should be_ according to your income and age**. If your actual net worth is significantly below this figure, you’re probably living a consumption-orientated lifestyle (spending more than you save). On the other hand, if your net worth is significantly above this figure, you’re already practicing wealthy habits.)

4) Develop the habit of directing your money towards different savings and investment accounts regardless of what you earn. This act will reprogram your money mindset into believing that you can effectively handle more money and will increase both your confidence and your financial setpoint. **Divide your income and deposit into the following categories** :

  * 50% to cover your essential living expenses (rent, utilities, food)
  * 10% into an investment account (stocks, passive income businesses, real estate)
  * 10% into a savings account to cover large or emergency expenses (unexpected repairs or medical costs) 
  * 10% into a self-improvement account (mentoring, coaching, books, and seminars)
  * 10% into a rewards account (use this guilt-free money to indulge yourself and feel rich)
  * 10% into a charitable account (donations to causes you care about)
  * Deposit your loose change into a jar every day



> **Additional Advice About Dividing Your Income**
> 
> Like Eker, David Bach (_The Automatic Millionaire_) suggests that you should develop the skills to manage your money regardless of what you earn. This way, you’ll develop positive habits that will increase your current net worth _and_ prepare you to effectively manage your future income.
> 
> Eker’s suggestion to divide your income into separate accounts is standard practice—the majority of financial books suggest that you restrict your daily expenses and contribute towards your savings and investment accounts. A number of these books also suggest that you set up a separate account with money that you can spend on treating or educating yourself (_I Will Teach You to Be Rich_ and _The Barefoot Investor_), and that you donate a portion of your money to causes that you care about.
> 
> However, Eker doesn’t mention anything in his list of categories about planning for your retirement—this is something that the majority of financial books place a lot of emphasis on, as it’s accepted as the safest and most proactive way to ensure that you're financially comfortable after you stop working. _The Automatic Millionaire_ offers advice and presents specific steps to help you set up and automate your retirement account—Bach suggests that setting up a tax-deferred retirement account and maximizing your contributions is the easiest way to accumulate wealth for a comfortable retirement.

5) To increase your net worth, focus on increasing your working income and your passive income. Next, decrease your current expenses so that you can contribute more money towards your savings and investment accounts.

(Shortform note: Eker doesn’t explain how to increase your working and passive income and decrease your current expenses. If you’re employed, _I Will Teach You to Be Rich_ offers advice on methods for negotiating a higher salary, such as emphasizing the _value_ and benefits you provide. If you’re self-employed, _Business Model Generation_ offers strategies for you to maximize your profits, such as employing different pricing mechanisms for different customer groups. For advice on ways to decrease your expenses, _The Automatic Millionaire_ suggests that you track your daily expenses to identify how much money you can redirect towards your savings and investment accounts.)
