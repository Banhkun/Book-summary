## Exercise: Plan Your Marketing Campaign

Now that you know Daniel Priestley’s strategy for building more demand than you can meet, think about how you might put it into practice to sell a product or service of your own.

* * *

What product or service would you like to sell?

Who is your target market? For example, you might want to target a certain geographical area, a certain income bracket, or specific personality traits. (Remember, you’re looking for people whom you’re interested in working with, who would want to buy what you’re selling, and who can afford to pay your prices.)

How will you advertise to that market? How will you get them talking about your company? (Remember, you need a way to stand out from the competition—create a unique product or something that’s cheaper or more convenient than similar offerings currently on the market.)

How might you overdeliver on your promises to your customers? (For example, you might include a free sample of another product or offer a discount on their next payment for a service.)
