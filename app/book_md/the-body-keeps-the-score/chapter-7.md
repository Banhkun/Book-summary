## Chapter 7: Resilience Builds From Birth

From the moment you’re born, every interaction with your caregivers helps form your understanding of the world and teaches you how to have relationships with others; this comes through your _attachment_ and _attunement_ to your caregiver, which we’ll describe below. In fact, **the biggest predictor of your ability to cope with challenges in life is the security you feel with your primary caregiver during the first two years of your life.**

### Attachment

As a baby, since you’re unable to care for yourself, you must rely on your caregivers to meet your most basic needs, from food and clothing to safety and comfort. **Your attachment—how well your caregivers meet your needs—determines how well you’ll take care of these needs for yourself later in life. Furthermore, the more responsive your caregivers are to you, the more responsive you’ll be to _others_. **

Babies are programmed to form an attachment no matter what, so the quality of that attachment depends upon the kind of caregiver they have.

Caregivers’ own traumas and mental health issues can impede their ability to care for and provide secure attachment. Children without a healthy attachment tend to dissociate and shut down when they’re older; they feel numb or not real, and may resort to dangerous behavior or self-harm in order to feel _something_.

#### Secure Attachment

Children whose caregivers are responsive to their needs form secure attachments. **Securely attached children are most resilient in the face of life’s challenges:** They understand when they have control over a situation and when things are out of their hands, and they have a sense of agency, giving them the confidence that they have control over their actions and can impact their circumstances.

In a study of how babies reacted to short-term separations from their mothers, researchers found that securely attached babies showed distress when their mothers left the room, but were excited when their mothers returned and quickly settled and continued playing in their mothers’ company.

#### Insecure Attachment

When caregivers don’t reliably meet a baby’s needs, it creates an insecure attachment. Insecure attachments create psychological issues, as we’ll see, but insecure attachments are still considered _organized_ attachments (as are secure attachments, as opposed to _disorganized_ attachments, which we’ll discuss next) because the caregiver’s behavior is consistent and the baby can learn what to expect and how to cope.

There are two forms of insecure attachments, depending upon how the baby adapts to her caregiver’s shortcomings:

**1\. Avoidant attachment** is typically a reaction to mothers who don’t enjoy touching, cuddling, or holding their babies, and who fail to use their voices and facial expressions to communicate with their babies. These babies are quiet and withdrawn, and never seem to get upset.

In the study, avoidantly attached babies didn’t cry when their mothers left and didn’t react when they returned. However, **despite their calm exterior, avoidantly attached infants’ heart rates remained high, revealing that they’re constantly in a state of hyperarousal.**

Avoidantly attached babies become adults who are not in touch with their feelings or others’ feelings, and they often become bullies.

**2\. Anxious or ambivalent attachment** forms when babies**** conclude that the only way to get attention is to cry and fuss constantly.

Anxious babies are clingy and demanding. In the study, these babies were very distressed when their mothers left but didn’t calm down when they returned, and remained focused on their mothers instead of resuming play.

Unsurprisingly, **anxious babies tend to grow into anxious adults, who tend to be the victims of bullying by their avoidantly attached peers**.

#### Disorganized Attachment

Although insecure attachments are psychologically problematic, the consistent style of caregiving provides some stability. By contrast, babies whose caregivers cause them fear or distress have a disorganized attachment.

**When a baby is afraid of her caregiver, she is stuck between needing that caregiver for survival and simultaneously being scared of the caregiver**. As a result, the baby doesn’t know how to engage with her caregiver. This is the most psychologically damaging form of attachment.

There are two types of caregivers that foster disorganized attachment:

  1. Caregivers who are too busy with their own problems to attend to their babies’ needs. These caregivers tend to act hostile toward the babies, rejecting them or seemingly expecting the babies to respond to the caregivers’ needs. These caregivers typically have experienced abuse or witnessed domestic violence during their own childhoods.
  2. Caregivers who are somewhat helpless, incapable of being the adult in the dynamic with their babies. These caregivers looked to their children for comfort, instead of being a source of comfort. These caregivers often have trauma from sexual abuse or loss of a parent. 



Children with disorganized attachment often become aggressive or disengaged and exhibit related physical symptoms, including increased heart rate, high stress hormone levels, and decreased immune system. **As adults, people with disorganized attachment can’t distinguish whom they can trust from whom they should fear** , so they may either be overly affectionate with strangers or distrustful of everyone.

### Attunement

A caregiver’s emotional attunement—being in sync with the baby’s needs, which helps the baby feel understood and taken care of—is a critical aspect of developing secure attachment. If a baby feels hungry and her caregiver promptly offers a bottle, or the baby feels overwhelmed and her caregiver soothes her, the baby learns that those intense sensations can be satiated and return to comfort and safety; when those babies grow up, they’ll be better able to self-soothe and self-nurture and less inclined to feel distressed in the face of other intense sensations.

On the other hand, **babies and children who face abuse and neglect learn that their needs will not be met, no matter how much they cry. This conditions them to become adults who give up in the face of obstacles.**

Emotional attunement also fosters physical attunement. Babies can’t calm themselves down through mindful breathing or relaxation exercises. Instead, their caregivers’ competency and attunement provide the comfort and safety that allows babies to calm down: When a baby feels emotionally in sync with her caregiver, her body reflects it with calm breathing, a steady heartbeat, and low stress hormone levels.

Pediatrician and psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott suggests that when a caregiver can’t meet a baby’s needs, the baby adjusts to meet the mother’s capabilities. **The baby learns to deny her own inner sensations, eventually learning that there’s something wrong with the way she is.** As these babies grow up, they continue rejecting what their bodies tell them; as we discussed earlier, when people are disconnected from their physical sensations, they lose their sense of joy, purpose, and direction in life.

### Secure Attachment Doesn’t Shield Children From Trauma

Abuse or neglect can reverse the positive effects of even the most secure attachment. Like adults, abused children become hypervigilant to threat and see danger in everything.

Traumatized children’s hypervigilance, overreactions, aggressions, and tendencies to shut down emotionally make it difficult to have friendships. As a result, **traumatized children learn to hide their vulnerabilities with a tough and aggressive attitude or by isolating themselves; both scenarios exacerbate their trouble with social skills and self-regulation, creating a vicious cycle.**

The author conducted a study with a group of 6- to 11-year-olds who had experienced trauma, and another group who hadn’t. He showed all the children pictures depicting a scene—including a man working under a car while two children watched, and a pregnant woman looking off in the distance—and asked them to tell the story of what’s going on in the picture. Children who hadn’t been through trauma told stories with benign endings; even if the story had some sadness or threat of danger, they could also imagine a happy ending. But the traumatized group imagined violent and scary stories even from the most ordinary images.

**Trauma in adulthood _alters_ your ability to interpret the world around you, but trauma in childhood interferes with the _formation_ of the maps you use to understand the world.**

#### Trauma Alters Your Inner Maps

Attachment, childhood experiences, and childhood traumas shape your inner maps of the world. As an adult, **your inner map determines what you consider normal and familiar, how you interpret situations, and how you engage with the people and world around you:** If something falls in line with your inner map, it must be right—whether it’s abuse and mistreatment or love and appreciation.

Inner maps are generally consistent throughout life, but it’s possible for them to change through profound experiences, such as an intimate, loving relationship during adolescence (a time of great change in your brain) or the birth of a child. By the same token, traumatic experiences can distort otherwise healthy inner maps.

Your inner map is housed in your emotional brain, so reconstructing it requires treatment that alters the responses of your central nervous system (recall from earlier sections that your emotional brain houses the amygdala, or the smoke detector, which sounds the alarm for your nervous system to release stress hormones in the face of a threat). Although logic from the rational brain can begin to help you rework your inner map, powerful emotions like fear, rejection, rage, or vulnerability will cause your emotional brain to take control and use your (flawed) inner map to guide you.

### Childhood Trauma Is the Source of Many Adulthood Ailments

In 1990, a massive study of Adverse Childhood Experiences (known as the ACE study) revealed that **childhood dysfunction and trauma—including abuse, neglect, and parental absence—are highly correlated with mental, emotional, and physical problems later in life.~~ ~~**

First, the researchers found that so-called adverse experiences are seldom isolated; if you have a parent in prison or witness your mother being abused, other family issues are likely also present. And the more of these adverse experiences are present, the higher the so-called ACE score, and the worse the effects.

Patients who had higher ACE scores were more likely to have

  * Behavioral and academic problems in school
  * Financial troubles in adulthood
  * Lower lifetime income
  * Chronic depression
  * Suicide attempts
  * Substance abuse problems
  * Health problems, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, liver disease, cancer, and emphysema



> One of the researchers in the ACE study, Vincent Felitti, saw a pattern in his own work of morbidly obese patients who had suffered childhood incest and other traumas. He determined that for these patients, they had become obese as a _solution_ to their traumas, because it made them feel safer to be physically larger or to be considered less attractive.
> 
> Without understanding the root of the patients’ obesity, doctors look at the _solution_ the patients had developed to survive as the _problem_. This misunderstanding leads most of these patients to ultimately fail in their weight-loss efforts; the same often happens in addiction recovery, because the addiction is a symptom of other deep-seated issues.

### Nurture Trumps Nature in Childhood Development

When looking at children who have severe behavior issues as a result of abuse, there are elements of both nature and nurture; life experiences can switch on or off certain genes to make them react differently to emotions and experiences. In other words, **stressful experiences can make you more susceptible to subsequent stress.** (The genetic modifications that result from life events can also be passed on to your children, which is known as epigenetics.)

What’s more, these trauma-caused genetic modifications can have a stronger influence on behavior than pre-existing genetic abnormalities, meaning that the role of nurture is at least as strong as nature.

One long-term study followed 180 families, beginning three months before first-time mothers had their babies and checking in periodically for 30 years. The study found that**the biggest factor in whether a child developed behavioral problems later in life was the parent-child relationship—more than the mother’s personality or the baby’s brain abnormalities, IQ, or temperament.**

Various programs in the U.S. and other countries have invested in supporting families by providing safe, nurturing, stimulating environments for children. Economists calculate that these programs more than pay for themselves by reducing the number of those children who later end up incarcerated, seek public assistance, and need assistance with healthcare costs or substance abuse treatment programs.
