## Chapter 5: Your Mind Impacts Your Body and Vice Versa

Your mental and physical states are inextricably connected. Both positive and negative emotions can give you physical sensations—like when the hair on the back of your neck stands up in the face of a threat, or you feel butterflies in your stomach when you’re excited.

Other people pick up on your mental and emotional state through your facial expressions and body language, and likewise, you read other people’s emotions and intentions through their physical expressions. However, **if your mind and emotions are hijacked by a hypervigilance to danger—as is the case with trauma sufferers—it prevents you from relaxing enough to connect with other people** ; they don’t read an open, welcoming state in your posture, and you mistakenly see them as threatening.

Researcher Stephen Porges’s Polyvagal Theory explains how our social interactions with others, and the way we read each others’ body language, impacts our emotions—for instance, why hearing a soothing voice can calm you, and why feeling ostracized by other people can make you angry or cause you to shut down. Your mirror neurons (which help you pick up on other people’s actions, emotions, and intentions and are responsible for empathy) interpret people’s emotions through their body language, and then your body adjusts in response. This function helps humans live and function in communities.

### Trauma Survivors Struggle to Find Safety and Belonging in Communities

The Polyvagal Theory shows how critical social relationships are to your emotional well-being, and in order to have relationships, you must feel safe—safe enough to play, open up to someone, mate, and nurture children. Feeling safe is the most important factor in good mental health; it requires social support and reciprocity, feeling seen and heard by the people around you.

**Many trauma survivors struggle to feel truly understood, seen, and heard by those around them, and thus seldom feel safe and comfortable in social settings.** Some trauma sufferers find a community in fellow trauma survivors, but confining yourself to a community of fellow victims, while comforting, ultimately leads to further isolation from the rest of society.

Healing from trauma means restoring the ability to feel safe and experience reciprocity. For trauma survivors who especially struggle to feel safe with people, animals—particularly dogs and horses—are used in treatment because they offer companionship and safety without the complexities of human relationships.

#### Even Eye Contact Is Threatening

Trauma sufferers’ hypervigilance to threats makes direct eye contact with other people intimidating, rather than intimate. People with PTSD were put through a brain scanner and shown images of a cartoon figure making direct eye contact, and the part of their emotional brains that lit up (called the Periaqueductal Gray) is responsible for startling, cowering, hypervigilance, and other protective behaviors.

Non-trauma sufferers, by contrast, had a more socially oriented response; their mirror neurons were activated to interpret the cartoon character’s intentions. **Trauma robs people of the ability to view other people as anything but a potential threat.**

### Three Levels of Safety

Feeling safe is an emotion, but it’s inextricably tied to physiological responses. There are three levels of safety that determine how you react to a threat; each level is associated with a different part of the nervous system.

#### Level 1: Social Engagement

The first level is social engagement, meaning that you call to others for help and comfort. At this level, the ventral vagal complex (VVC) is at work, coordinating your facial muscles to communicate your distress to others through facial and verbal expressions.

The VVC develops during infancy, as parents smile and talk to their babies, and is essential for social relationships because it operates your nonverbal communication. **The better your VVC works—helping others intuitively understand your state of mind—and the better you can read others’ nonverbal cues, the better you’ll function in a community.**

#### Level 2: Fight or Flight

If no one responds or there’s no time to call for help, you reach the second level: fight or flight. **In this state, your social-engagement system is shut off, making you less responsive to human voices and more responsive to threatening sounds.**

This response activates your mammalian brain, specifically the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The SNS manages arousal by triggering adrenaline to increase heart rate and blood pressure to prepare your body for swift action.

#### Level 3: Collapse

If you’re unable to fight or escape—suffering from immobilization, as we discussed in an earlier section—then you reach the third level, where your brain and body do the only thing they can to survive: freeze or collapse. **Collapse is a function of your reptilian brain and causes you to shut down—the most basic form of survival in the face of inescapable circumstances.**

The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) kicks in, which is responsible for slowing down bodily functions in the interest of self-preservation; the PNS slows your heart rate and manages functions like digesting food and healing wounds. In times of collapse, a part of the PNS called the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) slows metabolism, makes your breathing shallow, and even empties your bowels. In this state, you dissociate from yourself and may not even be aware of pain.

_Depersonalization_ is a form of dissociation. After a trauma, many survivors may be explosive—a result of level 2’s fight or flight—and later evolve to become more numb and depersonalized.

#### Treating Level 2 and Level 3

In order to re-engage in social relationships and community, trauma survivors who have had level 2 and 3 reactions need help rewiring their brain’s and body’s responses from the hypervigilance or collapse that helped them survive their traumatic events.

Talk therapy is ineffective for people who have engaged in depersonalization because they have disconnected so thoroughly from the event that talking about it isn’t productive. Treatment strategies that incorporate physical sensations tend to be most effective for both level 2 and level 3 survivors; this can include breathing exercises or rhythmic motions like bouncing on a yoga ball or drumming. We’ll dive deeper into treatment methods later in the summary.
