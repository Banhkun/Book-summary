## Chapter 8: Treatments to Heal the Mind, Brain, and Body

As the fields of science and psychology have evolved, so have the understanding and treatment of trauma. There are three general approaches to treatment.

  1. Top-down: Talking, connecting with other people, opening up about your traumatic memories and their present-day effects. 
  2. Medication: Using prescription drugs that inhibit trauma survivors’ overactive internal alarm systems, or affect the brain’s chemistry in some other way to alleviate the symptoms of trauma. 
  3. Bottom-up: Seeking physical experiences that connect the body and mind to counteract feelings of helplessness, rage, and emotional collapse that plague trauma survivors.



The goal of treatment is to regain control of yourself and your thoughts, feelings, and body. Generally, this involves four steps:

  1. Learn how to be calm and focused.
  2. Find a way to stay calm in the face of sensations (images, sounds, smells) associated with your trauma.
  3. Learn how to be present and engage with the people around you.
  4. Don’t hide things from yourself, such as the ways you adapted in order to survive during and after your trauma.



First we’ll explore top-down trauma treatments and discuss their benefits and drawbacks. In the following chapters, we’ll do the same with the medication approach and the bottom-up approach.

### Top-Down: Talking Can’t Heal Trauma, But It’s an Important First Step

Talk therapy alone isn’t adequate to heal trauma—and if the patient isn’t yet ready to cope with the emotions that come up, it can retraumatize her and increase fixation on the trauma. What’s more,**it can be difficult for trauma survivors to articulate what happened to them, because their brains didn’t process the event as a coherent narrative but rather as a collection of fragmented sensations.**

However, talking and acknowledging your trauma is a critical piece of the healing process for a few reasons. First, talking about your trauma breaks the silence and isolation of keeping it a secret; although many trauma survivors are inclined to suppress their traumatic memories in an attempt to gain control over the overwhelming emotions they bring up, failing to acknowledge your trauma and the reactions it triggers only inhibits you from managing it.

Second, talking about your experience and emotions relieves the incredible amount of energy and attention required to suppress them and allows you to work through your psychological wounds. Bottling up such overwhelming feelings doesn’t make them go away, and in the meantime it saps your energy from engaging in the present and pursuing goals; as a result, you’re likely to feel bored and disengaged from life. **Despite your efforts to suppress the trauma, your chronic hypervigilance is continuing to trigger stress hormones—causing physical ailments such as headaches, muscle pain, and digestive issues, as well as irrational emotions and behavior. You can’t deal with these symptoms until you’ve identified what’s causing them.**

Third, when you open up to other people, you create the opportunity to feel heard and understood, which activates your limbic brain and helps in the physiological healing process. Sharing your experience with others can help break down the isolation of trauma and reconnect you with your community.

On the other hand, if someone fails to respond or understand, it can be further damaging. Non-trauma survivors often can’t handle or don’t want to hear the details of terrible wartime tragedies or child abuse, so trauma survivors withdraw or develop a more palatable narrative for public consumption. This is why trauma sufferers need safe spaces to share their experiences in order to recover. Therapists are great sources of support, as are groups like Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and Adult Children of Alcoholics.

#### Trauma Creates Two Versions of the Same Event

Trauma survivors carry two parallel stories about their experiences, from two forms of self-awareness:

  1. **Autobiographical self-awareness** connects your experiences through the timeline of your life and creates an ongoing narrative. This awareness is based in language and creates the story of your experiences that you tell other people. 
  2. **Moment-to-moment self-awareness** is rooted in physical sensations, but if you feel safe and have time to process, you can put the experience into words. This awareness is the deep, personal truth of how you experience situations. 



The two systems are located in different parts of the brain that are largely disconnected, so these two forms of self-awareness don’t always align: You may tell others that you are happy, but your body language is slumped and hints at the fact that you feel unhappy. Trauma victims develop a coherent narrative of their trauma that they tell others, but it doesn’t capture—and may even downplay—the terror of their experience.

**If you focus too heavily on your autobiographical self-awareness, you may begin to believe that it’s the whole truth, lose sight of your internal truth, and suppress your moment-to-moment self-awareness.** In order to heal, trauma survivors must reconnect with their moment-to-moment self-awareness and come to terms with how the experience of their trauma felt, reconciling that with the brave-faced narrative they’ve developed in order to endure.

#### Methods to Express Yourself When Words Are Elusive

Trauma survivors can become so overwhelmed by their traumatic memories that the language area of their brain shuts down and they’re rendered speechless. In other cases, survivors may try to tone down their retelling of a traumatic event so that it doesn’t trigger them.

Since it can be so difficult to connect your inner experiences to language, there are methods you can use to help bridge that divide.

  * **Notice physical sensations.** Being aware of how your voice changes or where you feel tension in your body can lead you to notice the emotions behind those sensations. 
  * **Engage in art, music, and dance, which can be outlets for expressing your innermost feelings** when you can’t put them into words. These outlets can also help you connect with your feelings so that you can then write about them. 
  * **Try free writing** , an exercise in which you choose an object and begin writing your associations with that object and continue writing your stream of consciousness without stopping, re-reading, or self-editing. Writing something that is for your eyes only allows you to express yourself without worrying about anyone else’s judgment. Later, when you read back through what you wrote, you’re likely to discover surprising inner truths. 



> **The “Switching” Phenomenon**
> 
> When people express difficult or intimate things, they’re accessing different physiological and emotional states. As a result, their manner of speaking or writing can change profoundly.
> 
> The pitch, tone, and volume of a person’s voice may change dramatically between when she’s talking about the schedule of her day and when she’s talking about a deep secret or traumatic experience. Likewise, her handwriting may change from flowy cursive to rigid block letters, and from straight up-and-down to slanted (when people write about their deepest fears, their handwriting tends to be more childlike).
> 
> Furthermore, some people may even show changes in their personality: They may morph from shy to aggressive, or docile to domineering.

### Internal Family Systems Therapy

Everyone has various parts of themselves, or subpersonalities: Among them, you have a part that is loving and affectionate that comes out when you’re around family and friends, as well as a part that is aggressive and confrontational, which only comes out when you’re angry. We all have many different parts, each with distinct beliefs, roles, emotions, and sensations. Collectively, they make you the complex, multifaceted person that you are.

Internal family systems therapy (IFS) looks at all these parts as members of a family, all with different levels of wisdom, maturity, excitability, and pain. Healthy internal leadership skills allow you to manage your different parts, so that they remain balanced and don’t work against each other. However, **in trauma survivors, some parts take on the pain of the trauma and others take on protective roles in response, ultimately working against each other, causing intense inner conflict** and, in extreme cases, dissociative identity disorder (DID).

Everyone has a part that is childlike and joyful, but if you experience childhood abuse that part of you may become frozen with the pain and fear from that abuse. As a result, that part—or family member—becomes toxic to the rest of you and is locked away, becoming what IFS calls an _exile_.

In response, other parts work to protect you from the pain the exile carries by any means necessary, whether by dissociation or behavioral changes, perhaps preventing you from developing intimate relationships with other people who could hurt you like your abuser did. These parts are called _managers_ , and they use control as a means of coping.

Other parts take over to try to protect you whenever something triggers your exiled emotions. These are called _firefighters_ ; they’ll destroy the house to put out the fire. For example, firefighters may cause you to binge drink or engage in some other impulsive behavior to dull the pain of a triggered exile.

All these parts are trying to work to protect the whole—you—from feeling the full force of your trauma. But **the way certain parts must adapt in response to trauma can cause dysfunction in the whole family or network of parts; when any network is dysfunctional** (think of a company, for example), **it needs strong leadership to steer it straight.**

IFS approaches healing through developing self-leadership of your parts. IFS takes the view that the parts have protected an undamaged inner Self, and that—with guidance—once the protective parts trust that it is safe and the trauma is over, they can make way for the Self to resurface. Through mindfulness, the Self must then take on leadership of all the parts, making sure each one heals and regularly has its needs met through self-reflection, exploration, and self-care; IFS therapy aims to help a patient develop inner relationships between her Self and her parts.

#### The Case Against Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

The philosophy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is that repeatedly exposing a patient to the source of her fear and anxiety will eventually desensitize her and make her realize that her fear is irrational. However, the author maintains that **CBT is an inadequate treatment for trauma because it overwhelms, retraumatizes, or worsens patients’ fixation on the event.** Even when CBT effectively reduces a patient’s fear and anxiety, she’s likely to still suffer from physical problems, guilt, and other mental and emotional issues.

Rather than desensitization, trauma survivors need help integrating the traumatic memory into the timeline of their lives, placing it securely in the past, so they can fully accept that it is over. This still involves revisiting the memory, but only once the patient learns to cope with the reactions that the trauma will inevitably bring up, to avoid becoming overwhelmed and enable her to complete the integration.

### Learning to Cope with Overwhelming Emotions

As we explained earlier, trauma lives in the emotional brain, which triggers physical responses and is not governed by logic as the rational brain is. Trauma sufferers tend to develop thoughts that are irrational—for instance, that they were at fault for their assault or that they acted in a cowardly way but submitting to abuse. These **irrational thoughts should be considered cognitive flashbacks; they’re thoughts that the survivor had during or shortly after the trauma that are being triggered by memories or stress.**

CBT attempts to correct this “dysfunctional thinking” by reframing the thoughts. But just like you can’t make a trauma survivor edit her visual flashbacks, you won’t make much headway arguing with her cognitive flashbacks.

You can’t approach trauma with logic (e.g. “it wasn’t your fault,” “you were just a child,” “you had no control over the situation”) and you can’t reason your way through your emotions because you’re working with the emotional brain: Understanding why you feel something won’t prevent you from feeling it. But **understanding that your trauma is triggering certain emotions can help you begin to resist intense overreactions in everyday situations** (e.g. exploding at your spouse for an innocent comment that reminds you of your abusive father).

Therapy for trauma must help patients reestablish a balance between the emotional brain and the rational brain, instead of letting the hyperreactive emotional brain send them into overdrive or cause them to shut down in response to minor threats. In order to do this, patients must practice self-awareness, or _interoception_ , to notice what’s going on inside themselves.

Let’s explore several strategies you can use to cope with the intense emotions and regain control of your mind and body.

#### Managing Hyperarousal

As we’ve discussed, trauma survivors remain hypervigilant, are easily sent into a fight-or-flight response, and take longer to calm down after a perceived threat has passed. To heal, they must gain control over their arousal system, which is possible through mindful breathing and movement.

Slow, deep breaths with long exhales trigger the parasympathetic nervous system to slow your heart rate. Yoga, chanting, martial arts, and rhythmic drumming can all help trauma sufferers gain and maintain a sense of calm, even in the face of flashbacks and the emotions they arouse.

#### Practice Mindfulness

Mindfulness means having a self-awareness of your emotions, your body, and your responses. Traumatized people are haunted by seemingly ever-present sensations that remind them of their traumas, so they’re constantly either avoiding them, repressing them, or succumbing to them. **Self-awareness gives trauma survivors the power to face those sensations and then move on from them.**

It begins by merely noticing how you’re feeling; as you pay closer attention to your emotions and the ways they shift—based on your thoughts, perceptions, breathing, or body posture—it becomes clearer that feelings are short-lived. That realization takes the power away from the emotion and gives you the option to decide how to respond, rather than feeling like a victim of your emotions and resorting to the habitual reactions you’ve developed to survive and cope.

Once you’ve begun noticing your feelings and physical sensations, label them and notice how certain emotions are tied to specific physical reactions. Again, noticing and identifying these sensations gives you the power to endure them, because you know that they are temporary and that you have the power to change them.

Mindfulness has many documented benefits, including

  * Easing psychiatric and psychosomatic symptoms such as depression and chronic pain
  * Improving physical health by boosting the immune system and lowering blood pressure and stress hormone levels
  * Boosting the brain’s ability for emotional regulation
  * Calming the amygdala—your internal smoke detector—and decreasing reactivity to perceived threats



#### Relationships are Vital for Resilience and Recovery

Humans are hard-wired to connect with others and be engaged members of communities. Consequently, strong, supportive relationships are the best protection against trauma and the biggest factor in healing from trauma. By the same token, **trauma at the hands of a person who’s supposed to be a source of love and support is the most damaging because it undermines your ability to form new relationships that are necessary for healing.**

If someone who’s supposed to love and protect you instead hurts and scares you, you adapt by shutting down and repressing how you feel. As you attempt to form new relationships, you’re likely to fear that this person will also hurt you in some way, so you shut down, turn away, or try to beat her to the punch by hurting her first.

In order to recover, you need someone whom you can not only trust with your emotional baggage, but who will also help you carry the load and work on unpacking it. Therapists are trained to help trauma sufferers in this way through three primary steps toward recovery:

  1. Gain stability and calmness
  2. Put traumatic memories and reenactments to rest
  3. Regain social connections



Several factors can help you determine if a therapist is the right fit for you.

  * It’s helpful if your therapist has been through this same form of therapy as a patient.
  * She should be open to exploring which treatment options fit best for you.
  * You should feel comfortable with her.
  * She should seem comfortable with herself and with you.
  * You should feel she genuinely wants to get to know you and what you need.



#### Synchronize with a Group

Just as babies need to feel attuned with their caregivers, humans thrive on feeling in sync with others. **Trauma survivors often lose attunement with those around them when they collapse or shut down for survival** ; they can benefit greatly from activities that put them back in sync with others in a visceral way, such as kickboxing, dancing, choral singing, and the martial arts practice of aikido. Even forms of play can give people a sense of connection and physical attunement with each other.

#### Healing Through Touch

In contrast to oft-prescribed medications that simply numb people to overwhelming sensations, **physical touch—including hugs and rocking—is a powerful way to calm people and make people feel safe, protected, and empowered**.

Since trauma and tension are held in the body, so-called bodywork such as massage and Feldenkrais (a therapeutic method of movement) can help patients literally feel—and then release—sensations and tensions in their body that they may even be unaware of until it’s relieved. Physical touch can also add to a patient’s physical self-awareness and help them feel more in tune and in control of their mind and body.

#### Reverse Immobilization

As we discussed earlier, people who are able to take action to help themselves or others in a trauma are more resilient, while those who are immobilized (e.g. trapped in a car accident, held down in an assault, or stuck in a war zone) are more likely to suffer from the trauma; the stress hormones their bodies secreted to give them the power and energy to _do_ something had no outlet, so they continue to pump into the body and trigger fight-or-flight responses or collapse.**Treatments such as body-based therapies, sensorimotor psychotherapy, and somatic experiencing help patients essentially complete the actions they weren’t able to perform during the traumatic event, and thus resolve their trauma**.

First patients learn to gradually dip into their traumatic sensations and memories in a process called _pendulation_. With this method, patients find “islands of safety” in their bodies that they can retreat back to when traumatic memories become overwhelming; this can mean focusing on their hands, paying attention to their exhales, or touching acupressure points. Over time they can build up their tolerance for revisiting the trauma and the physical sensations it triggers.

Revisiting the trauma triggers physical impulses from the event (for example, running or pushing someone away) that the patient was unable to do during the trauma, so the patient will make subtler moves like twisting or backing away. The next step in treatment is to explore and modify those movements **so patients can complete the actions they couldn’t do during the event, so they can get a sense of what it would’ve felt like to escape or fight back; this gives patients the sense of agency and the ability to protect themselves** , of which the trauma robbed them.

### Checklist: How to Cope with Strong Emotions

Several of the same techniques trauma survivors use to manage their overwhelming emotions can be useful in stressful day-to-day situations. Try these strategies next time you’re stressed, anxious, or angry.

* * *

  * Slow, deep breaths with long exhales
  * Yoga
  * Chanting
  * Martial arts
  * Rhythmic drumming
  * Mindfulness (notice, observe, and identify your emotions and physical sensations)
  * Talk or get together with a trusted friend or family member
  * Participate in a group activity (e.g. kickboxing, dancing, choral singing)
  * Get a massage
