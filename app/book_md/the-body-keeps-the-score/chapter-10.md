## Chapter 10: Bottom-Up: Engaging the Body in Healing

The bottom-up approach to treatment uses physical experiences that connect the body and mind. This empowers patients to inhabit their bodies, be present, and learn how they can affect their emotions—all of which help them to counteract feelings of helplessness, rage, and emotional collapse.

### Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a treatment in which patients revisit their trauma while focusing on a therapist’s finger moving side-to-side. In contrast to exposure therapy, which aims to desensitize patients through repeatedly revisiting the traumatic memory, EMDR uses the trauma as merely a starting point leading to other, seemingly unrelated thoughts and memories.

While researchers don’t know exactly how EMDR works, the treatment helps people get in touch with loosely connected memories and images and then integrate their traumatic experience into a broader context. **After EMDR treatment, patients are able to look at the traumatic event as they would another memory—something that’s in the past, that doesn’t have power over them in the present.** Furthermore, one study showed that not only was EMDR more effective than Prozac, but several months after EMDR, patients continued to improve.

Researchers believe that EMDR’s effectiveness is related to how the eye movement mimics the way eyes move during the rapid eye movement (REM) phase of sleep, when dreaming occurs. Dreams connect and recombine unrelated pieces of memories and information, reshaping and reintegrating memories over time; EMDR appears to do something similar with traumatic memories.

Unlike other forms of therapy, **EMDR patients don’t have to verbalize the memories they’re having in order for EMDR to work; they can go through the whole process without saying a word.** Additionally, an EMDR patient doesn’t need to trust or even like her therapist in order for the treatment to be effective. This makes EMDR especially valuable for trauma survivors, who often struggle to trust others.

EMDR has been shown to be less effective for people who were traumatized as children. As we discussed earlier, childhood trauma creates unique mental and physiological problems, and EMDR can’t necessarily resolve deep-seated betrayal and abandonment issues.

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

Heart rate variability (HRV) is the balance between how your heart rate rises and falls. As a reminder, inhaling activates the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which increases heart rate and fuels arousal, while exhaling stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which slows your heart rate and aids body functions like digestion and healing of wounds.**A healthy balance between your arousal and relaxation—your HRV—indicates that your autonomic nervous system (ANS) is in good working order, and that helps you stay calm and in control in the face of minor challenges.**

Poor HRV means your breathing and heart rate are out of sync, which has negative effects on how you think, feel, and respond to stress; it can make you vulnerable to physical issues such as heart disease and cancer, as well as depression and PTSD. Trauma survivors have low HRV, which helps explain why they are hyperreactive to minor threats and stresses.

You can train yourself to change your breathing (and thus improve your HRV) through yoga as well as certain devices and smart phone apps. Improved HRV can help with depression, anxiety, and anger issues as well as high blood pressure, high stress hormone levels, lower back pain, and asthma.

### Yoga

Several aspects of yoga make it an incredibly healing treatment for trauma survivors. First, yoga’s inherent focus on the breath—moving with each inhale and exhale, noticing whether your breath is fast or slow, and counting breaths in certain poses—improves HRV.

Second, yoga teaches you to listen and respond to your body, ultimately helping trauma survivors be more aware of and comfortable in their bodies. Often trauma survivors learn to shut out and dissociate from their physical sensations, so yoga can help them reconnect with their bodies. You need to feel connected with your body in order to have a sense of self; **if you can’t understand what your body is telling you** (e.g. are you hungry, or are you anxious?) **then you can’t identify how you feel or what you need, and you won’t be able to properly take care of yourself.** Feeling safe in your body also helps you articulate your emotions and even traumatic memories that were previously overwhelming.

Third, **yoga teaches you to notice the emotions that are connected to certain physical sensations; this is especially critical for trauma sufferers, because certain physical sensations and poses can trigger flashbacks**(for example, many sexual assault survivors panic in poses that have them lying on their backs with their feet up in the air). As long as trauma sufferers approach yoga at a slow pace and avoid becoming overwhelmed, the practice can help them work through those intense emotions.

Finally, yoga and body awareness improve trauma sufferers’ sense of time. Trauma causes people to feel stuck in their traumatic memory, and they struggle to be present; yoga encourages you to be present by focusing on your breath and body sensations, and reinforces the fact that experiences are transitory (e.g. as hard as this pose may be, you only need to endure it for ten breaths).

Yoga’s positive effects can even be seen in the brain: A study of women with histories of intense trauma found that 20 weeks of yoga increased activity in the insula and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), where trauma survivors typically have abnormally low activity. The insula takes sensory information and signals the amygdala if it needs to trigger a fight-or-flight response, and the MPFC is the watchtower that logically weighs information and balances out the response of the amygdala (the smoke detector). In other words, **yoga strengthens the parts of the brain that help prevent you from overreacting to minor threats.**

### Psychomotor Therapy

Another form of therapy, called Pesso Boyden System Psychomotor (PBSP) therapy, allows you to physically recreate scenes of your childhood and trauma, and then essentially rewrite the story. **Creating a physical representation of traumatic memories activates the right hemisphere of the brain—the same hemisphere where trauma is also largely imprinted.**

This psychomotor therapy typically happens in a group, with one person—called the protagonist—at the center. As the protagonist talks about her experiences, the therapist periodically makes witness statements, which are observations of how the protagonist’s body language changes as she brings up certain details (e.g. slumping over as she talks about how her father left her family). This helps the protagonist feel seen and understood, making it safer and more comfortable to dig deeper.

When the protagonist begins to feel overwhelmed, the therapist can ask if she’d like to choose a contact person to sit next to her; if so, she gets to choose who in the group is her contact person and where exactly they’ll sit. The presence of the contact person is meant to offer a sense of safety and comfort as the protagonist continues to delve into her painful memories.

As the protagonist continues telling her memories, **members of the group are chosen to stand in as key characters from the story, such as parents and siblings, allowing the protagonist an opportunity to say something to her father that she couldn’t say as a child** , for instance. Furthermore, the protagonist instructs these actors where exactly to stand and which direction to face; this activates the right hemisphere’s spatial abilities, and it can offer insight about the protagonist’s feelings toward these people (e.g. instructing an abusive father to stand far away and face out demonstrates the protagonist’s fear of or anger toward him, while instructing a nurturing mother to sit nearby indicates the protagonist’s feelings of safety around her).

In addition, other group members also stand in as ideal versions of those characters, so the protagonist can create a loving, attentive version of her father. She can then tell him something she wishes she could’ve told her father or, better yet hear him say something loving and reassuring that she never heard from her father.

Actively directing and participating in your memories in this way allows you to explore your memories and emotions in a way that’s deeper than simply talking about it. **Creating and rewriting these scenes also empowers protagonists to experience what it would’ve been like if those events had gone differently and gives them a chance to complete actions they were unable to do during the actual events.**

This form of therapy doesn’t eliminate or neutralize traumatic memories, but it does create a new experience (e.g. of being loved or protected) that helps to rewrite your inner maps. Those inner maps are the foundation for future behavior, so altering them can change your default from being distrustful and fearful of intimacy to allowing others to get close to you and feeling safe.

### Neurofeedback

Think of the brain as a network of electrical circuits that fires off jolts of electricity in order to carry out its functions—creating thoughts, stimulating behavior, arousing physical responses—just like switching on a light. When the circuits are out of order, it creates mental and emotional disorders. Neurofeedback aims to fix the circuitry in patients’ brains.

Neurofeedback is a method that involves hooking up patients to machines that track their brain waves and mirror them back in order to encourage certain frequencies and brain patterns while discouraging others. Patients may watch an animation that looks like a video game, with spaceships moving around the screen randomly; when the patient is calm and focused, for example, the spaceships start moving in a more orderly way than when the patient is tense and anxious. **Think of neurofeedback like the feedback you get from someone’s facial expressions when you’re having a conversation: You’re subtly encouraged to continue when the person smiles and nods, but if they frown or zone out you get the cue to change the topic.**

Neurofeedback is also able to target frequencies in certain areas of the brain in order to increase focus, alertness, and other states. Each type of brain wave is related to a different state of being.

  * **Delta waves** are the slowest frequency and typically occur while you’re sleeping. If you have a lot of delta wave activity during waking hours, it makes you foggy and causes poor judgment and impulse control. The majority of PTSD sufferers have excessive delta waves. 
  * **Theta frequencies** are slightly faster and are common when you’re in a trance-like state, on the edge of sleep, or when you’re depressed. These waves facilitate allows you to think outside the box and make new connections and associations. Alpha/theta training is a form of neurofeedback that has the potential to help PTSD patients break out of their habitual patterns and associations to create new ones. 
  * **Alpha waves** bring a feeling of peace and calm, and are present during meditation. Neurofeedback with alpha training is helpful for trauma patients who are chronically numb or agitated to feel a sense of peace and focused relaxation. 
  * **Beta waves** are the highest frequency, and help you to be alert to the world around you and focused on the task at hand. However, too many beta waves can make you agitated, anxious, and tense. 



After enough sessions of neurofeedback (depending upon the patient), the brain is trained to sustain those new brain wave patterns and treatment can end, with perhaps sporadic tune-up sessions.

Neurofeedback can be an empowering form of treatment because patients can see a visual representation on the scans of the brain activity behind their dysfunctional or problematic behavior. **Seeing the source of their issues in these brain scans allows patients to free themselves from self-blame and attempts to control their behavior, and instead puts their focus on learning new ways to process information, which is at the root of their behavior.**

We’ve discussed how survivors of childhood trauma face unique challenges because their traumas often interfered with their ability to establish psychological building blocks like healthy inner maps and a sense of being loved and wanted; as a result, healing isn’t just a matter of working through the scars of their trauma but also rewiring their instincts and brain functions. Medications and traditional talk therapy are inadequate to restore these basic brain functions after the early years of brain development have passed, so more research is needed to see if neurofeedback can achieve that.

### Theater

Theater targets many of the things trauma survivors struggle with most, making it a challenging and effective form of therapy.

First, it gives patients a chance to escape from the ailments, circumstances, and feelings they face every day and embody a different character—someone strong, resilient, and confident. But in order to do that, they must work through many of the challenges that come with trauma, such as getting in touch with emotions, exploring conflicts between characters, and exposing vulnerability. These are some of the hardest things for trauma sufferers to do—because they’re inclined to suppress emotions and avoid conflicts—but are essential to acting.

Second, actors must be in full control of their bodies and their physical expressions. **Even standing up straight and projecting their voices through the theater can be a major challenge to trauma sufferers, who typically try to be invisible.** Feeling that you have full control and ownership of your body is key to having a sense of agency, a necessary aspect of healing for trauma survivors.

Third, being part of a theatrical production makes patients a valuable, contributing member of a community (in this case, the theater group), which helps them regain a sense of worth and competence. Competence is a powerful antidote to the helplessness that trauma instills.

Additionally, beyond simply being a _part_ of the community, theater and music create a communal rhythm and synchronization. From religious hymns to protest chants, **communal singing and movement give a sense of strength, hope, and a visceral feeling of being part of something bigger than yourself.**

Being part of that community requires that you trust the other members of that community, and in yourself—both huge challenges to trauma survivors. Actors must trust in each other to perform convincing scenes, and must trust in themselves to commit to their character and lines, revealing their vulnerability in front of an audience.
