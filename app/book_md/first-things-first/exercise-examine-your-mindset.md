## Exercise: Examine Your Mindset

Consider a situation that you approached with an independence mindset—in other words, you thought you had to deal with it all on your own. Consider how you might have handled it differently.

* * *

Describe a recent situation that you handled independently?

What difficulties did you encounter in dealing with it?

How might collaborating with another person or people have made that situation easier to handle?

The next time you’re in a similar situation, how might you get the support you need?
