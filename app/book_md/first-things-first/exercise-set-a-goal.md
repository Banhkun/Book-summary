## Exercise: Set a Goal

Think of something that youâ€™d like to accomplish. This could be a long-term life goal, or it could be something with a shorter time frame like a week or a month.

* * *

What is your goal?

Which role or roles does this goal pertain to?

How does this goal use your four human gifts?

How could you synergize this goal with some of your other goals?
