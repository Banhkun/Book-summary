## Exercise: Prepare for Zone 2 Scheduling

Determine what you’ll need for your Zone 2 scheduling, and how you’ll approach it.

* * *

What tools will you use to complete your Zone 2 scheduling? A large piece of paper? A paper or digital planner?

When will you carve out the time to start your Zone 2 scheduling? Put it in your calendar now.

Name at least three of your roles.

What is a mission statement that would encourage you to fulfill those roles?
