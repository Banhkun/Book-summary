## Part 3.2: Finding Solutions Where Everybody Wins

Covey asserts that a key aspect of having an interdependent mindset is having **an everybody-wins mindset, meaning that you approach winning by looking for ways to accomplish your goals _as well as_ others’ goals through cooperation.** This helps to ensure that you’re using your time—and others’ time—as effectively as possible. He warns that society teaches us to have a “win-lose” mindset—if you win, someone else must lose, and vice versa. But to reach your goals in an interdependent world, you need to shift your mindset to understand that winning doesn’t mean defeating someone else.

> **The Infinite Game Mindset**
> 
> Simon Sinek’s book _The Infinite Game _draws a line between “finite games” (games where somebody wins and the game ends) and the titular “infinite games” (games that never end). Most things that we think of as games—from _Monopoly_ to _Fortnite_ —are finite games. Things like battles, elections, and boxing matches are also finite games. The thing they all have in common is that the “game” ends with clear winners and losers. **Conversely, things like your career, your family, and your romantic relationships are infinite games:** There’s (hopefully) no point where you declare that you’ve “won” a relationship and end it. The objective in an infinite game is to do as well as possible, and keep playing for as long as you can.
> 
> Covey’s “win-lose” mindset comes from finite game thinking: For you to win, someone else must lose—and if someone else wins, that means you’ve lost. **It may help to recognize that you’re actually playing an infinite game, where you don’t have to be in competition with the other players because there’s no such thing as a winner or a loser.**

### How to Create a Win-Win Solution

Covey lays out three steps to creating a solution where everyone wins:

**1\. Approach the problem with a group-oriented mindset.** To make sure that everybody wins, you first need to acknowledge that individual success at the expense of the group isn’t true success.

(Shortform note: It’s an oft-cited fact that any percent of zero is zero. If the group as a whole fails, it won’t matter what percentage of the effort you contributed or what percentage of the rewards you think you’re entitled to—you’ll still end up with nothing.)

**2\. Listen first, then speak.** The second step involves listening to the other person or people, and seeking to understand their points of view. **Don’t add your own thoughts until you understand all sides of the issue, and others in the group are satisfied that you understand.** This ensures that you’re not only listening, but _correctly_ understanding the issues at hand.

(Shortform note: In _Difficult Conversations_ , the authors say that many of us assume listening is passive—that we’re supposed to sit quietly and absorb what the other person is saying. However, they argue the reverse: listening is often an active process. In brief, they say that a good listener is someone who pays attention to the speaker’s tone and body language—not just the words—and asks questions as necessary to make sure he understands.)

**3\. Synergize.** The last step is to create a list of alternatives that are better than the solutions that any individual could come up with or accomplish alone.

> **Example:_Our Iceberg Is Melting_**
> 
> The business fable _Our Iceberg Is Melting_ illustrates how working together can yield powerful results.__ In the story, a penguin colony on a melting iceberg must find a way to save the colony before the iceberg falls apart.
> 
> The book focuses on how to lead a group or organization in order to make changes that would be impossible on your own. According to _Iceberg_ , there are six steps to this process:
> 
>   * **Raise the alarm.** The first step toward making any major change is recognizing that there’s a problem, and alerting the people who have the authority or ability to do something about it.
> 
>   * **Make a team.** The main lesson of this book is that groups can accomplish things that one person never could. (This is the essence of collaboration.) You must carefully select the best team for the job and consider who would excel in each role that you need filled—even if your “organization” is a fixed group, such as your family.
> 
>   * **Develop a vision.** As with Covey’s advice, you need a clear goal to work toward.
> 
>   * **Spread the word.** Once you have a team and a vision, spread the word to everyone it concerns. In a company, that means your employees; in a family, that might mean extended family and friends.
> 
>   * **Empower others.** The more people who are able and allowed to contribute to your mission, the more successful it will be. Letting people contribute in their own ways will also keep them enthusiastic about the mission.
> 
>   * **Don’t get complacent.** Even once you’ve accomplished your goal (assuming it has a fixed endpoint), don’t assume that means your work is done. Keep looking for ways to improve your organization, and look for new goals to pursue.
>

> 
> By using this process, a small group of penguins was able to accomplish the unthinkable: Getting the entire colony to pack up and move to a new, safer iceberg.

### Creating a Shared Vision

**Covey believes that every interdependent unit benefits from having a shared vision.** In fact, he says that most problems in families and organizations arise from the absence of a shared vision—people become confused about what goals they’re collectively working toward or, worse, they aren’t working together at all.

A shared vision taps the creativity, motivation, and initiative of every individual involved; it’s a type of constitution that gives the group clear criteria on which to base decisions. **But in order to reap these benefits, the group must create a mission statement articulating a shared vision that empowers _everyone_.**

When creating your shared mission statement, ensure that it:

  * Focuses on a purpose that everyone feels passionate about
  * Comes from the employees—the heart of the organization—not the administrative level
  * Is based on universal principles such as fairness, integrity, honesty, and human dignity
  * Addresses everyone’s needs
  * Addresses all four essential needs: survival, connection, learning, and giving back



(Shortform note: One key element that Covey doesn’t list is that effective group mission statements **inspire the group members to work toward that shared vision.** In _The Leadership Challenge_ the authors list the second principle of leadership as “Be Inspirational” (second only to “Set the Example”) because engaging people’s emotions and imaginations ensures the best results. They promise much greater effectiveness from people who want to work than from people just acting out their roles because they “have to”—like an employee at a job she hates, or a sullen teenager being forced to spend time with his family.)

### Developing Shared Responsibility Agreements

Once you’ve created a shared mission statement, it’s time to create a shared responsibility agreement, which establishes how you will collectively reach the goals set out in your mission statement, and how you’ll all share in the rewards.

Creating such an agreement will take time, but in the long run, you’ll save much more time than you spend. That’s because addressing these issues beforehand will limit the problems that come from miscommunication, as well as unclear expectations and objectives.

**Covey lays out five parts to a shared responsibility agreement:**

  1. **Desired Outcome:** What outcome do we want to achieve? Make sure to set a goal or goals that everyone considers a win, and that addresses all four essential needs. 
  2. **Parameters:** What moral, legal, and logistical limits do we need to consider? How much authority does each person in the group have? What kinds of action can each person take without consulting the others?
  3. **Assets:** What money, people, and technology do we have to work with? Also consider how the group will access and share those resources.
  4. **Criteria:** How will we know we’ve reached our goal? What criteria will we use to measure our success individually and as a group? How will we respectfully and effectively hold each other accountable?
  5. **Stakes:** What will happen if we achieve our goals? What will happen if we don’t achieve our goals? Establish clear rewards for people who fulfill their duties to the group, and penalties for those who don’t, so that everyone understands what’s at stake for the group and individually. 



> **Go Beyond the Letter of the Agreement**
> 
> The _Harvard Business Review _explains why all five parts of this shared agreement are necessary:
> 
>   * **Desired outcome:** Everyone involved needs to agree, specifically and explicitly, about what you all hope to achieve. Even business deals arranged by top negotiators fall apart when the parties have different ideas about the purpose of the deal.
> 
>   * **Parameters and assets:** Make clear what each person _can_ contribute, is _willing to_ contribute, and is _expected to_ contribute. Differing ideas about these contributions—and unclear guidelines about how to use those resources—can leave a group working with far fewer resources than expected.
> 
>   * **Criteria and stakes:** The agreement must make it clear how much each person can do without consulting the others, and what the chain of command is (if any). Muddled leadership structures, unclear expectations, and vague methods of accountability can quickly destroy an otherwise promising agreement.
> 
> 

> 
> The most common issues with shared agreements come from misunderstandings and “benign neglect.” In other words, people have different understandings of what they’ve agreed to, and they don’t realize that until it’s too late. **That’s why it’s crucial to make sure that everybody’s clear on the _spirit_ of the agreement, not just the terms of it. **
