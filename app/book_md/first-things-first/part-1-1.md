## Part 1.1: Be Effective, Not Efficient

_First Things First_ expands on the third of Covey’s _7 Habits of Highly Effective People_ , which is to focus on important things over urgent or time-sensitive tasks. As Covey explains in the first chapter, _First Things First_ is a pushback against the myriad time management methods that only focus on how to get as much done as possible.

Covey begins by saying that many time management systems are about how to accomplish your goals as quickly as possible. For example, he points out how many books urge you to create lists of tasks, and then start checking things off those lists. However, he says this isn’t an effective approach to time management—it may leave you feeling like you never have enough time for the really important things like spending time with your loved ones or taking care of yourself.

Covey argues that, rather than focusing on how much time we spend on each task, we should focus on which tasks we’re working on.**Covey believes that the key to effective time management is deciding which tasks are the most important (rather than the most pressing), and then working on those for however long it takes to complete them** —in other words, putting the _first things first_.

(Shortform note: In _The 4-Hour Workweek_ , entrepreneur Tim Ferriss tackles the idea of effectiveness versus efficiency in a business context, rather than a personal context. Ferriss adds that, although focusing on effectiveness is the best way to accomplish goals, companies typically focus on efficiency (how much work you get done) because it’s easier to measure. Unfortunately, that may leave management with an unclear picture of how well the company is doing—finishing a large number of unimportant tasks makes the company look very productive, but doesn’t move it any closer to its goals.)

### The Past Eras of Time Management

Covey points out that, as culture has changed and life has gotten more hectic for everyone, there’s been an explosion of time management tools and literature using different methods to promote efficiency. He breaks down these tools into three “eras” of time management to reflect evolving theories and techniques, and he says that each era has its own strengths and weaknesses.

> **Efficiency Is Limited, Work Is Not**
> 
> Oliver Burkeman, author of multiple books on balancing time management and happiness, wrote in 2016 that “time management is ruining our lives.” Burkeman argues that in the Information Age, work has become endless—that when you’re working with computers and data, there’s no point where you can look at a concrete, finished product and declare it done. As a result, we keep cramming more and more tasks into our days (increasing efficiency) in an effort to finish our unfinishable work, which leads to anxiety and burnout.
> 
> Burkeman describes what happens when you focus only on efficiency, rather than effectiveness. His solution—and Covey’s, as we’ll discuss—is to choose a few things to devote your time to, and leave the rest of the infinite pile of work alone.

#### The First Era: Reminders

The first era of time management is simply about reminding yourself of upcoming tasks. **Writing to-do lists, leaving yourself notes, and setting alarms on your phone are examples of tools from this era of time management.**

Covey says this era is good for individual tasks and short-term planning, but its weakness is that it doesn’t help you prioritize; it focuses on accomplishing the _greatest number_ of tasks, rather than the _most important_ tasks.

(Shortform note: In _Getting Things Done_ , management consultant David Allen also talks about “outdated” time management techniques like calendars and to-do lists. Allen believes that such methods were effective in the past, when more people’s jobs tended to consist of concrete tasks (manufacturing products, for example, instead of programming websites), and their work hours ended at a set time. However, Allen does believe that calendars and lists still have their place. He suggests using them for tasks that _must_ be done on a particular day or at a particular time—for example, a doctor’s appointment, which you must either go to when it’s scheduled or not go to at all.)

#### The Second Era: Long-Term Planning

This second category is similar to the first, but it goes a step further. Covey explains that **this era uses calendars and agendas that allow you to prioritize your tasks and plan much further ahead than simple notes or alarms.** For example, you could fill out a monthly or yearly planner with your goals, deadlines, and necessary steps to reach them.

Covey says this era’s main weakness is its inflexibility—something urgent or unexpected could disrupt your whole plan. You also run the risk of viewing interpersonal relationships and self-care as interruptions or distractions from your schedule of concrete tasks, instead of important and worthwhile uses of your time.

> **Another Approach: Keep Your Options Open**
> 
> Covey points out that the main weakness of long-term planning is that it can’t account for unforeseen events. As we’ll see, his solution is to develop firm principles and goals to guide your moment-to-moment decisions, rather than relying on preset plans.
> 
> In _Antifragile_ , author and mathematician Nassim Nicholas Taleb recommends a different approach. He agrees with Covey that planning for the future is impossible—there are simply too many unknown variables—but Taleb’s solution is to always give yourself as many different options as possible.
> 
> For example, even if you currently have a stable and enjoyable job, you might keep looking for work. That way, if your company starts downsizing and you’ve found something better, you’ll have the _option_ to take it—if not, you don’t lose anything by staying in your current job.

#### The Third Era: Prioritizing and Goal-Setting

Covey writes that the third era of time management requires you to have some sense of your big-picture objectives and values so that you can set short-, medium-, and long-term goals for yourself. Much like the second era, this category relies heavily on planning and scheduling your tasks far in advance using tools like calendars and daily planners.

Covey acknowledges that the third era is a step in the right direction because it recognizes that your goals should be tied to your values. **However, it’s fatally flawed because it’s rooted in incomplete or incorrect ideas:** Namely, third-era time management focuses on controlling every aspect of your life (which is impossible) and doing more with your time (which is the same as the previous eras).

**In essence, Covey argues that all three existing types of time management rely on narrow management techniques, rather than all-encompassing leadership techniques.**

The difference between management and leadership, according to Covey, is that management is all about finding the best way to work within the current system, while leadership is about fixing the system itself. In other words, **whereas management looks for the best way to accomplish pre-set goals, leadership finds the right goals to pursue.**

Therefore, Covey proposes a fourth era: one that shifts focus from simple time management to true personal leadership.

> **Ask “Why” Instead of “How”**
> 
> To look at this issue another way, you could say that **management is about what you do, and leadership is about why you do it.**
> 
> Simon Sinek, who writes and speaks about business and leadership, explores the question of “why” in _Start With Why_. According to Sinek, getting mired in questions of what you do and how you do it can cause you to lose sight of your principles and your goals. As a result, you’ll feel less motivated and accomplish less—and other people will think you’re shallow or self-centered.
> 
> **By focusing instead on the _reasons_ behind what you do, Sinek says you’ll be sure to make moment-to-moment decisions that are true to yourself and your personal objectives. **In other words, stay focused on your principles and the rest will come naturally. __
> 
> Although _Start With Why_ is about how to run a company or organization, the same principles apply to personal leadership.

### The Fourth Era: Personal Leadership

**Covey believes that a fulfilling life isn’t about control or efficiency, but instead about determining the best uses of your time.** You must first determine your priorities, or your “first things.” That’s why Covey’s fourth era is about making plans and goals based on your priorities, then using skills from the first, second, and third eras to achieve those goals.

The rest of _First Things First_ lays out Covey’s ideas and techniques for this proposed fourth era of time management.

> **Background Info: Self-leadership**
> 
> Business leadership professor Charles Manz first coined the idea of personal leadership (or, to use his term, self-leadership) in the early 1980s. According to Manz, there are two key aspects of self-leadership:
> 
>   * Guiding yourself toward tasks that naturally motivate you.
> 
>   * Managing yourself to do tasks that _don’t_ naturally motivate you. (Later models, including Covey’s, would argue that this is self-management and should not be included under self-leadership).
> 
> 

> 
> Covey’s proposed fourth era of time management is concerned with the first aspect: He wants you to learn what motivates you so that you can guide yourself toward relevant tasks.
