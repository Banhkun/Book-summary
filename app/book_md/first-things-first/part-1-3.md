## Part 1.3: Adopt a Significance-Based Approach

We’ve discussed why it’s critical to place significance over pressure and use your time in a way that aligns with your goals and values. Furthermore, people who take a significance-based approach to life (as opposed to a pressure-based approach) tend to feel more confident, peaceful, and fulfilled, because they feel like they’re using their time in a meaningful way. So, how do you do that?

**According to Covey, there are three critical elements to a significance-based approach to life.** This section is devoted to explaining these three elements and teaching you how to incorporate them into your life.

**The three elements of a significance-based approach are:**

  1. Meet your essential needs. 
  2. Follow universal principles. 
  3. Use your unique human gifts.



> **What’s Significant to You?**
> 
> Determining what’s significant and meaningful to you is a personal process, but one way to think about it is to reflect on what would make you feel _successful_. _Psychology Today _interviewed four business executives from various industries and countries around the world. One question was how they defined success for themselves.
> 
> Two of the four executives answered that they needed to have specific goals and be actively working to accomplish those goals in order to consider themselves successful. Notably, neither of their goals had anything to do with wealth or power: One wanted to create jobs in Myanmar, while the other wanted to provide education and security to people who needed it.
> 
> Another executive answered that, to her, success meant freedom—the ability to do what she wanted when she wanted, and to work on whatever project held her attention at the moment. The last person answered that her satisfaction came from the process of working and the progress she saw herself making, rather than from any specific goal.
> 
> **The common thread among all four executives is that they know what success means to them, and they feel satisfied when they work toward it.** Whether it’s a concrete goal like creating jobs, or a more nebulous value like freedom, they all know what brings them fulfillment.

### Element #1: Fulfill Your Four Essential Needs

Covey says we each have four essential needs:

  1. **Survival:** This refers to your physical needs like food, housing, and medicine—everything you need to stay alive and healthy. 
  2. **Connection:** Humans are social creatures; we have a deep-seated need to connect with each other. To that end, we need strong relationships with friends, family, and romantic partners. 
  3. **Learning:** This doesn’t just mean formal education, but rather the lifelong pursuit of new knowledge and experiences to enrich your mind.
  4. **Giving Back:** People want to live purposeful lives that somehow improve the world. This also connects with the desire to be remembered—to leave a legacy.



> **Why Are These Essential Needs?**
> 
> The phrase “essential needs” should be taken literally: **These are all things that are hardwired into our biology because they helped our ancestors to survive.** In his book _The Selfish Gene_ , scientist Richard Dawkins explains in much greater detail how these needs (and other traits) are passed down through generations.
> 
>   * **Survival:** Our bodies need things like food and sleep to survive and function properly.
> 
>   * **Connection:** Many animals, including humans, live in groups or communities to protect themselves from predators, to find food and resources, or to tackle construction projects that no individual could finish alone.
> 
>   * **Learning:** At its most basic level, learning is about incorporating new information and experiences into your thought processes. Learning (and teaching) what was safe to eat, how to avoid predators, and more advanced skills like making tools and starting fires was invaluable to our ancestors’ survival.
> 
>   * **Giving back:** Our ancestors helped each other to survive—that was why they lived in communities in the first place. Therefore, by helping others, they ensured that their community members would help them in return.__
> 
> 


Covey also believes that the four essential needs are interrelated—if you’re not meeting one of them, that can hinder your ability to meet the others. For example, if you’re struggling with your survival needs, you probably don’t have the time or resources to give back to your community.

**However, that interconnection also means that putting more energy into one need helps fulfill the other areas.** For example, if you learn a new skill or trade, that may help you to earn more money—which, in turn, will allow you to meet your survival needs.

> **Maslow’s Pyramid vs. Covey’s Web**
> 
> Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, one of the best-known models of human psychology, also describes essential human needs. Maslow’s model consists of five levels, some of which overlap with Covey’s four essential needs:
> 
>   * **Physical needs:** What your body needs to function, such as food and sleep.
> 
>   * **Safety needs:** What you need to feel secure, such as shelter and money.
> 
>   * **Social needs:** What you need to feel understood and accepted, such as friendship and intimacy.
> 
>   * **Value needs:** What you need to feel important, including both self-esteem and the esteem of others.
> 
>   * **Self-fulfillment needs:** What you need to realize your full potential and feel fulfilled, such as strong values, respect for others, and a feeling of accomplishment.
> 
> 

> 
> Maslow’s hierarchy is traditionally shown as a pyramid, with physical needs at the bottom and self-fulfillment needs at the top—the idea is that each level is necessary to support the ones above it. For example, according to Maslow, a person struggling to meet his survival needs won’t be concerned with social needs.
> 
> By contrast, Covey takes a different approach with his suggestion that human needs are an interconnected web, and that meeting any of them can help you to fulfill the others. For example, a loving family or a strong community will help make sure that your physical and safety needs are met; they might donate money and food, or give you a place to stay until you can support yourself again.

### Element #2: Understand Universal Principles

Covey’s second step toward shifting to a significance-based approach is understanding “universal principles.”

According to Covey, a number of fundamental principles govern the world, and you can use them to guide your actions. These core principles are valued across all cultures, generations, and schools of thought.

(Shortform note: Although Covey says that these are universal values, it’s worth noting that some cultures value them more highly than others. For example, many Western cultures tend to emphasize individualism over cooperation.)

While you can’t control the outcomes of your actions, Covey says, you can be sure that universal principles will affect those outcomes. Therefore, if you also live according to universal principles, the outcomes will be in line with your intentions—even if they’re not exactly what you had in mind.

**Some of Covey’s “universal principles” are:**

  * Truthfulness
  * Faithfulness
  * Discipline
  * Self-control
  * Perseverance 
  * Cooperation
  * Charity



> **Make Sure Your Principles Are Positive**
> 
> In his popular self-help book _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,_ author Mark Manson offers some guidelines for determining good values (or principles) as opposed to bad ones.
> 
> Manson says that all positive values share three qualities: 
> 
>   * **Fact-based:** Your values should be rooted in concrete things that are external to yourself. For example, “happiness” isn’t a good value, because it’s purely a feeling. Conversely, honesty is a good value to have, because it’s rooted in objective facts.
> 
>   * **Constructive:** Your values should benefit others or somehow improve the world. Any value that leads you to harm or manipulate others (_power_ or _control_ , for example) is a negative value.
> 
>   * **Within your control:** Any value that relies on what other people think or do will only set you up for frustration and failure. Therefore, things like popularity and being respected are negative values. You can only control what _you_ think and do, which is why Manson believes that you should instead adopt values like kindness and responsibility.
> 
> 

> 
> All of Covey’s “universal principles” meet these three criteria, and you can use Manson’s criteria as a guide to finding values that speak to you.

#### Use Principles to Build Practices

To better understand Covey’s universal principles, it’s important to realize that principles aren’t the same thing as practices.

Covey defines _practices_ as specific skills and actions. They can help you achieve short-term results in certain situations, but they won’t be universally applicable. Imagine if you learned how to play Poker (a practice), then tried to apply the same rules to Blackjack: it just wouldn’t work.

**However, if you focus on developing _principles,_ you’ll have a strong foundation on which to build new practices whenever you need to. **Continuing with the Blackjack example, someone who approaches a table with principles of truthfulness (“I don’t know how to play this game”), discipline (“I am willing to learn how to play”), and perseverance (“I’ll lose at first, but I won’t give up”) will quickly develop a new practice: playing Blackjack.

> **How to Build Principles**
> 
> In his self-help classic _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ , Dale Carnegie notes that it’s not easy to develop new principles. He offers a few tips to help the process:
> 
>   * **Be sincere.** Approach your new principles with genuine interest and desire to change—don’t try to adopt them just because a book told you to.
> 
>   * **Remind yourself of why you need these principles.** Whenever you feel the need, take a moment to step back and remember why you’re changing your behavior, and how your new principles will benefit you.
> 
>   * **Have someone hold you accountable.** Just like some people have a “swear jar,” and people who remind them to put money in it whenever they swear, have a friend who will hold you to your new principles and a penalty you have to pay when you fall short.
> 
>   * **Review your mistakes.** If you do fail to live up to one of your new principles, take some time to think about what went wrong and how you can do better in the future.
> 
>   * **Keep at it.** Adopting new principles and changing your behavior aren’t easy things to do. The most important part is to keep improving and never give up.
> 
> 


#### There Are No Quick Fixes

Everybody wants a quick fix for their problems. However, Covey says that won’t work.**If you want to make substantial, lasting changes in your life, you first need to change your principles** because—as we discussed before—your principles guide your practices. Therefore, if your practices aren’t getting you the results you want, the only solution is to change your principles.

Covey suggests that you think about how universal principles pertain to each of your four essential needs:

**Essential Need** | **Universal Principle(s)** | **Reasoning**  
---|---|---  
Survival  | 

  * Discipline 
  * Self-control 

| This essential need encompasses everything you need to stay physically healthy, such as exercise, a good diet, and a steady income.  Discipline and self-control are necessary to avoid the quick-fix pleasures of junk food, laziness, or get-rich-quick schemes.   
Connection  | 

  * Perseverance 
  * Faithfulness 

| Strong, healthy relationships (whether romantic or platonic) take time and effort to build and maintain. If you aren’t faithful and loyal to others, those relationships will quickly fall apart.  Quick-fix relationships, like drinking buddies or purely sexual conquests, won’t bring you long-term satisfaction.   
Learning  | 

  * Discipline 
  * Perseverance 
  * Commitment (Shortform note: Covey doesn't directly associate a principle with this need, but we can infer some appropriate principles from his description of it.) 

| Learning doesn’t end when you graduate from school; enriching and expanding your mind is a lifelong process.  The quick-fix view of education as just a way to get a good job may leave you feeling stuck and unfulfilled in a job that doesn’t stimulate your mind.   
Giving back  | 

  * Cooperation 
  * Charity 

| Modern society tends to promote self-improvement and personal goals as quick-fix methods for happiness and satisfaction.  While those are valuable practices, true fulfillment comes from having a purpose that’s greater than yourself—helping other people and making the world a little better.   
  
### Element #3: Understand the Four Human Gifts

Covey’s third step for changing to a significance-based approach is understanding the four unique human gifts:

  1. **Self-awareness** is your ability to think about your thoughts and actions. This allows you to recognize that you have paradigms, question them, and evaluate how they’re affecting your behavior. 
  2. **Morality** is your internal compass. Your morality helps you recognize when your actions don’t align with your principles. 
  3. **Creativity** is your capacity to imagine new possibilities. This is the power to envision the future you want or come up with new solutions to problems. 
  4. **Willpower** is your ability to choose your actions. Although habits, environment, and conditioning can strongly influence how you _react_ to a situation, your will gives you the power to _choose_ a different response.



> **Tara Brach’s “Essential Pause”**
> 
> One way of bringing your unique human gifts to bear is through what Tara Brach describes in _Radical Acceptance_ as the essential pause. Instead of immediately reacting to a situation, Brach tells us to take a moment to consider what’s happening, how it’s impacting us in that moment, and what we should do about it.
> 
> In other words, in that moment of pause, you can ask yourself:
> 
>   * How is this situation affecting me physically, mentally, and emotionally? **(Self-awareness)**
> 
>   * What are my possible responses? **(Creativity)**
> 
>   * What would be the _best_ response? **(Morality)**
> 
> 

> 
> And finally, you would use your **willpower** to enact the response you’ve chosen.

Like the four essential needs, Covey’s four human gifts are interrelated, and neglecting one harms the others. For example, you might have the self-awareness to recognize a change you want to make in your life, but you’ll also need the creativity to figure out how to make that change and the will to implement it. Conversely, when you effectively develop and nourish all of your human gifts, they work together to help you achieve a higher quality of life. **These four unique gifts are the core of Covey’s fourth era of time management: personal leadership.**

(Shortform note: President Eisenhower is famously quoted as saying that leadership means getting someone to do what you want, because he wants to do it. It means that a true leader doesn’t just tell others what to do—he or she inspires those people so that they choose to do it. That quote holds true for self-leadership as well: It’s not just about telling yourself what to do and when, it’s about inspiring yourself to _want_ to make changes and improvements to your life. **Covey says that engaging your four human gifts will help you feel fulfilled and motivated to make those changes.**)
