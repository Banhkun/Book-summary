## Exercise: Understand Your Management Tools

Use these questions to determine which “generation” of management tools you currently use and which paradigms may be holding you back from living an effective life, rather than an efficient one. After you’ve identified the issues, later exercises will help you find solutions.

* * *

List two or three time management tools you use most often. (Perhaps you check off items on a daily to-do list, write in a planner, or use an app on your phone.)

Which generation(s) of management approaches do these tools come from? (Remember, sticky notes and checklists are “first generation,” planners and calendars are “second generation,” and detailed daily plans are “third generation.”)

Which generation-specific traps do you find yourself falling into? (First-generation time managers may fail to prioritize, second-generation managers may prioritize their schedule over unexpected opportunities, and third-generation managers may be too short-sighted to develop more impactful goals.)
