## Part 2.1: Start Zone 2 Scheduling

Now that you understand the significance-based approach, let’s put it into practice with **Covey’s Zone 2 scheduling process, which aims to improve your quality of life by prioritizing your time based on principles, needs, and gifts.**

Each section in Part 2 explores one step of Covey’s Zone 2 organizing process in detail. The first step we’ll explore is creating a personal mission statement that helps you determine what’s significant to you.

> **Do More by Doing Less**
> 
> In _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ , self-help author Robin Sharma suggests **managing your time by doing less, rather than more.** At its core, this advice is the same as Covey’s Zone 2 organizing process: Do what’s most important to you (effectiveness), instead of trying to accomplish the most in the least time (efficiency).
> 
> However, Sharma suggests a different way of evaluating what’s important, by using the “80/20 Rule” (sometimes called the Pareto Principle), a rule-of-thumb that 80% of outcomes stem from just 20% of what you do. Therefore, the key to getting the most value out of your time is to identify which parts of your life fall into that 20%, and to devote most of your time to those.

### Create Your Personal Mission Statement

**Covey believes that your idea of the future is your most powerful tool when it comes to building the life you want.** Your human gift of creativity allows you to create a vision of the future, and that vision has an incredible influence on your behaviors, affecting the choices you make each day and how you manage your time.

Covey says if you have a vision that’s based on your principles, addresses your essential needs, uses your human gifts, and encompasses all the roles and aspects of your life, it sparks a powerful passion inside you to create the life you envision in spite of all obstacles—**in other words, turning your vision into reality will become your mission.**

> **Use Goals to Find Your Purpose**
> 
> Much like Covey, Robin Sharma believes that a clear purpose in life will guide you to the right decisions in uncertain situations—all you have to do is determine which course of action gets you closer to your purpose. In _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari_ , _Sharma says that purpose is like a lighthouse guiding you through dark and dangerous waters.
> 
> However, while Covey suggests finding your purpose by looking at what you’re already doing with your life (as we’ll discuss), Sharma suggests considering what you _want_ to do in various areas of your life. **Sharma urges you to take a few minutes right now to write down some clear and specific goals related to your career, family, physical health, or wherever you have a clear idea of what you want to achieve.** Sharma also urges you not to second-guess yourself while you’re making this list—remember, you can always update it later.
> 
> Once you have some specific goals written down, you may be able to see a larger purpose that they’re leading you toward. For example, perhaps the reason you want to stay physically healthy is so you can be present in your childrens’ lives for longer, because your purpose is to be a good parent.

### Discover Your Roles

Everyone plays a number of roles in life. For example, you might be a parent, a child, an employee, a supervisor or manager, a churchgoer, or a community leader. The first step in writing your personal mission statement is to identify each of your roles in life; Covey suggests focusing on no more than seven roles.

Next to each role, write down what you hope to contribute to the world through that role, and how you’d like others to think of you as a result of it. These roles and their associated goals should collectively paint a picture of your ideal life. **Consider how you feel as you look at this vision of what your life could amount to—are you satisfied with it?**

> **Counterpoint: Maybe It’s Not About You**
> 
> For many people, envisioning and then creating the life that they want for themselves is the most powerful motivation imaginable. However, some people have trouble getting motivated while thinking only of their own benefit—something that Covey addresses in a roundabout way when he notes that our roles only exist in terms of other people (parent, teacher, employee, and so on). **Therefore, if you don’t find improving your own life to be a compelling motivation, think of your mission statement as a way to help the people you interact with in your various roles.**
> 
> In _Meditations_ , Marcus Aurelius reinforces this view when he suggests taking a step back and seeing your life in the context of the universe: You are one small spark of awareness in an infinite universe, and you only exist for a tiny fraction of eternity. Aurelius’s insistence that each of us (including himself) is insignificant isn’t meant to be discouraging or degrading; rather, he wants to encourage us to see things in perspective. If our own lives are insignificant, then our duties—the things we’re meant to do with our lives—must be to serve others and improve the world in some way that only we can.

According to Covey, **the roles we play are key to finding fulfillment, but only if we approach them in a balanced way.** Most people’s biggest source of dissatisfaction and unhappiness in life is the imbalance they feel between their different roles and responsibilities. For example, many people feel that their careers are so demanding that they don’t have time or energy to devote to their families and friends. This feeling of being constantly pulled in different directions stems from the idea that your roles are either/or decisions—for example, that you could devote your next hour to your job or to your community, but not both.

**However, Covey asserts that separation of roles is an illusion** : The person who goes to work and brainstorms in meetings is the same person who cooks dinner at home and helps the kids with homework. All of your roles are part of you as a whole; therefore, who you are in each role impacts who you are in all your other roles.

For instance, if you’re struggling at work because you’re constantly tired, then devoting time to your role as an individual—a person who needs time to rest and to enjoy life—might make you a faster and more efficient worker.

> Covey’s description of your roles all working together is similar to Robin Sharma’s description of discipline in _The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari._ Sharma believes that discipline is like many thin wires (practices) all wrapped around each other. Individually, each wire is weak and easily broken, but together they form an extremely strong cable.
> 
> When Covey discusses the relationships among your various roles, or how fulfilling one need can help you to fulfill others, picture yourself weaving that cable of wires; any Zone 2 (significant but not pressing) practice in one role also supports and strengthens your other roles.

#### Set Expectations for Each Role

**Remember that your roles are really just labels for how you relate to other people.** Each role impacts the people around you, just as those people’s roles impact you.

Therefore, another way to maintain balance and organization among your roles is to clearly define each of your roles and the responsibilities you have within them. Many people find it helpful to do this in the form of a mission statement or collective agreement that’s separate from their general personal mission statement.

**As you define each role, clarify the expectations that the people involved have for each other.** For example, in your role as a spouse, talk with your partner about each of your expectations of each other in your marriage. In your role as an employee, talk to your boss about your position in the company: what the company needs from you, and vice versa.

In Part 3, we’ll take a closer look at how to work with others to mutually fulfill your roles.

> **Examine Your Relationships**
> 
> Another word for “role” is “relationship”; Covey is really telling us to think about our relationships with other people, and what we hope to get out of them. It may be helpful to examine not only your present relationships (as Covey suggests) but also your past ones, as suggested in the lifestyle guide _Minimalism. _
> 
> In _Minimalism_ , former corporate managers Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus (who call themselves The Minimalists) talk about how they gave up most of their wealth and possessions to focus on what really matters, including their relationships. They found that every past relationship, whether positive or negative, contained important lessons that they could use to improve their present and future relationships.
> 
> For example, if you once had a romantic partner who used you as an emotional crutch and never gave support to you when you needed it, that’s a red flag that you now know to watch out for as you define your roles and expectations.

#### Organize Information by Roles

**Covey says that you can further nurture balance by organizing notes and information according to your roles.** He suggests creating separate sections in your planner or organizer for each role. Then, when you have information or notes pertaining to a specific role, file it in that section.

You can also file phone numbers and addresses according to each role—for anything from friends (personal role), to colleagues (work role), to carpet cleaning services (home management role).

This style of organization plays to your natural mental associations and makes it easier to organize and find information. This strategy also reinforces balance and a Zone 2 emphasis on importance because **you can easily see what’s important within each role, rather than throwing everything into the same pile where anything pressing will naturally grab your attention.**

Covey also suggests setting up a filing drawer or computer folders with the same roles for longer-term planning; when you no longer need to keep something readily accessible in your planner, transfer it over to this filing system. That way, all of your information will still be organized by role, but you won’t get overwhelmed by having too many things in your weekly planner.

(Shortform note: Dividing information by role naturally plays into what learning expert Barbara Oakley calls “information chunking.” Basically, your mind will naturally organize information into chunks of related knowledge, a bit like a computer defragmenting its hard drive. Later, when you try to recall something about that topic, instead of accessing one specific fact in your memory, you’ll access that entire chunk. Covey’s suggestion here is essentially the same process, only done externally instead of inside your mind: You’re compiling small pieces of information into larger chunks for quick and easy access.)

#### Balance Your Roles

It’s one thing to understand that your roles are interrelated, but it’s another to put that into practice in your time management approach. How do you combine your time when you need to create a presentation for work and also help your daughter with her science project?

**To find balance among your roles in life, Covey urges you to stop thinking in terms of “either/or,” and start thinking in terms of “and.”** Look for areas where your roles overlap, so that you can address multiple needs at once. For example, if you find a hobby that you and your kids both enjoy, you can fulfill your role as a parent and your role as an individual at the same time.

Finding those overlaps won’t always be possible—but, when it is, you can accomplish goals much more effectively.

(Shortform note: Covey isn’t talking about multitasking in this section. In fact, there’s no such thing—what people see as “multitasking” is actually rapidly switching between tasks, which makes you unfocused and less effective overall. Instead, Covey’s urging you to look for ways to **meet multiple needs or fulfill multiple roles by focusing entirely on a single activity.**)****

### Base Your Mission Statement on Your Roles

According to Covey, your roles and goals should be the basis for your personal mission statement. **You’ll translate them into a principles-based mission that meets your four essential needs and makes use of your unique human gifts.**

Covey says that personal mission statements are as unique as the people who write them. They can be pages long or just a few sentences; they can be expressed in words, music, or art.

However, for all of its uniqueness, Covey believes any effective mission statement has several characteristics:

  1. It reflects a deep understanding of yourself: your values, your unique abilities, and your vision of the future. 
  2. It addresses all four human needs: survival, connection, learning, and giving back. 
  3. It balances all the important roles in your life—personal, family, work, and community.
  4. It includes a purpose and methods of achieving that purpose that are based on universal principles. 
  5. It inspires you. 



> **Sinek’s Guidelines for a Mission Statement**
> 
> In _The Infinite Game_ , Simon Sinek offers his own set of guidelines for what defines an effective mission statement (or in Sinek’s words, a just cause).
> 
> According to Sinek, a mission statement should:
> 
>   * **Stand for something (rather than against something).** An effective mission statement should focus on making a positive change, rather than resisting change.
> 
>   * **Be idealistic but achievable.** A vision that’s bold, yet feasible, will inspire you and others to pursue it.
> 
>   * **Be inclusive.** Your mission statement should invite others to get involved.
> 
>   * **Be resilient.** Your mission shouldn’t get derailed by changing circumstances—the only reason your mission statement should change is that _you_ decide to update it.
> 
>   * **Be helpful.** Your mission should benefit others, not only yourself.
> 
> 

> 
> After coming up with a mission statement based on Covey’s advice, you may find it useful to check that statement against these more specific guidelines from Sinek.

### Live Out Your Mission Statement

Covey says that crafting your personal mission statement is a critical first step, and the next step is to live that mission through your day-to-day activities.

In order to do that, **you need to revisit your mission statement frequently to internalize your mission.** Your personal mission statement must always be in your heart and mind, and you should use it as the foundation of your weekly Zone 2 organizing.

Covey also suggests setting aside a specific time each year to review your mission statement and update it, if needed.

> **Find Your Dominant Question**
> 
> **By crafting a mission statement and keeping it at the forefront of your mind, you’re priming your brain with the question, “How can I fulfill my mission?”** That question will encourage you to subconsciously look for answers and to consciously make choices that bring you closer to your goals.
> 
> Limitless author Jim Kwik calls these thoughts dominant questions: difficult or complicated questions that prime your mind to look for answers or relevant information. For instance, if you’re in the market for a new car and suddenly notice car ads everywhere, Kwik would say it’s because your mind is looking for the answer to your current dominant question (“Which car should I get?”).

### The Zone 2 Organizing Process Creates Balance

Your personal mission statement is the foundation of Covey’s Zone 2 organizing process, which is designed to nurture and balance your roles as you pursue your mission.

**First, the practice of reviewing your mission statement before you begin your weekly planning keeps you connected with your vision, passion, and principles.** Since your mission statement addresses all four of your human needs, reviewing it improves your ability to create inner balance.

**Second, by reviewing your roles each week, you’re able to see them as the avenues through which you can achieve your mission.** You’re reminded of each role’s physical, social, mental, and spiritual dimensions, and so you’re able to effectively balance and synergize them.

> **Why Is Balance Important?**
> 
> Psychologist Jim Taylor writes about the harmful impacts of an imbalanced life, including stress, poor health, problems at work and at home, and overall reduced life satisfaction. Warning signs to watch out for include feelings of guilt (that you’re not devoting enough time to an area of your life, such as your family), feeling like you’re missing out on social activities, and losing touch with friends or loved ones.
> 
> Though Taylor talks specifically about work/life balance, the same principles apply to balancing all of the roles in your life.

#### Balance Is Large-Scale and Long-Term

Covey warns that, even with all the tools in _First Things First_ , your roles won’t always be in perfect balance from week to week.**Sometimes you’ll need a short-term imbalance in order to create long-term balance—this is normal, and often necessary in order to deal with the changing demands of life.** For example, a student with final exams coming up will probably need to devote more time to her studies and less time to her friends and family for a while.

If you must create a short-term imbalance in your life, make sure it’s a conscious choice that serves your personal mission. Check in regularly with your conscience and your personal mission statement; make sure your actions are still in line with your long-term goals and that they promote long-term balance. Above all else, avoid the trap of falling back into Zone 3 (pressing but not significant) tasks and pressure-based decision making.

> **Balance vs. Counterbalance**
> 
> Real estate entrepreneur Gary Keller’s book _The One Thing_ rebukes a number of “myths” about life and work, one of which is the concept of a balanced life. Keller’s and Covey’s approaches for a balanced life are the same in practice, but their framings are opposite. While Covey emphasizes a balanced life, **Keller argues that striving for balance prevents you from making any extraordinary commitments to anything—which, in turn, keeps you from achieving anything extraordinary.**
> 
> Keller’s solution is to “counterbalance” by constantly making small adjustments to your focus and your commitments. For example, put in a lot of overtime one week, and make up for it by focusing on your family or yourself the next week. In other words, you’ll never be perfectly balanced; the key is to make sure that you constantly compensate for your imbalances.
