## Exercise: Reflect on the First Things First Approach

Reflect on the lessons of _First Things First_ and how you’ll implement them in your life.

* * *

What elements of Covey’s approach do you find most useful? The guidelines for Zone 2 scheduling? The steps for creating win-win stewardship agreements?

In what areas of your life do you plan to implement the _First Things First_ approach? In your personal life? At work? With your family? With your colleagues?

What is one thing you can do this week to start implementing this in your life?

What stumbling blocks to implementation do you anticipate? What strategies and mindsets can you develop now to keep you on track when the road gets bumpy?
