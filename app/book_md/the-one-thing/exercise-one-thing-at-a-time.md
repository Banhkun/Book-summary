## Exercise: One Thing at a TIme

Studies show that when we try to multitask, we end up doing multiple things badly. In addition, trying to do two things at once wastes time because the brain has to switch back and forth between the tasks and reorient itself each time.

* * *

Think about how your day went yesterday. How many times did you attempt to multitask and what tasks were involved?

How did the instances of multitasking turn out? Was there something you wish you had done better? What was it?

Looking at your computer right now, how many windows do you have open? How many times do you check them? Why do you need to keep these windows open?
