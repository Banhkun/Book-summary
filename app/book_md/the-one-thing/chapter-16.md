## Chapter 16: Make the Most of Your Time Block

Achieving exceptional results from time blocking requires exceptional effort in three areas: 1) committing yourself to mastery, 2) determining the best way to do something, and 3) holding yourself accountable.

### 1) Commit Yourself to Mastery

Mastery is a process rather than an end result. It’s based on the desire to become the best you can be at doing your most important thing and an understanding that there’s always more to learn. You’ve mastered tasks accomplished in the past, but you’re an apprentice when it comes to future tasks. There’s always a new level of expertise to reach.

Mastery of the right thing topples your first domino and “makes everything else easier or no longer necessary.”

Besides requiring a mindset of continual learning, achieving mastery or expertise requires a significant investment of time. The time you spend is ultimately more important than talent.

Psychologist K. Anders Ericsson debunked the idea that top performers excel because they’re gifted. He found that the key to reaching elite levels was intense and “deliberate” practice over many years—for instance, top violinists accumulated over 10,000 hours of practice by age 20. If you put in 250 work days a year on your One Thing, you need to average four hours a day to amass 10,000 hours in ten years. (Shortform note: Read more about why high-quality practice matters more than talent in our summary of Ericsson’s book Peak.)

**When you approach your focused time blocks with a “mastery mentality,” each level you achieve prepares you for the next** —your growing knowledge, skills, and competence give you momentum for further successes. Mastery is a pursuit that “keeps on giving.”

### 2) Determine the _Best_ Way

**When you set out to do something, you have a choice of either doing it the best you can or doing it _the best it can possibly be done_**.

Doing something the best you can is an entrepreneurial approach. With an entrepreneurial mindset, you see what needs to be done and jump into it by applying your energy and ability. However, everyone has an ability limit and will top out. For instance, some people hit their home-repair skill limit as soon as they pick up a hammer, while others are more expert at using it. If your goal is to just do your best, then you’re done once you reach your talent limit. Your best effort won’t bring you exceptional success—that requires continually improving _how_ you do your One Thing.

Instead of an entrepreneurial approach, you must take a purposeful approach. **This means not stopping when you reach your knowledge and talent limit, but seeking new and better ways to do what you’re doing.**

Here’s an example comparing the two approaches:

  * An entrepreneurial approach to cutting firewood would be to pick up an ax and head for the woodpile.
  * A purposeful approach would be to look for the best or most efficient way to cut wood: a chainsaw or a log splitter. 



A purposeful approach applies the rule that getting a different or better result requires doing something different. Applying a purposeful approach during your time block unlocks your potential.

### 3) Hold Yourself Accountable

A key to exceptional outcomes or results is **holding yourself accountable for the way things turn out**.

You can choose to be accountable and be the “author of your life,” or choose to be unaccountable and be a victim. An accountable person acknowledges or seeks to understand the reality, tackles the task or problem, takes ownership of it, and finds a solution. In contrast, someone with a victim attitude avoids or fights reality, blames, makes excuses, waits, and hopes things will improve. An accountability approach shapes the outcome, while a victim approach doesn’t. Either attitude becomes a habit.

The best way to become accountable is to find an accountability partner—a mentor, peer, or coach who will:

  * Provide honest, objective feedback on your performance
  * Expect you to improve
  * Brainstorm with you and offer expertise



Research shows that accountability leads to better results—in one study, people who wrote down their goals were almost 40% more likely to achieve them. In addition, those who not only wrote down their goals but also sent progress reports to friends were 77% more likely to achieve them.

An accountability partner will help you stay on track and improve your productivity.
