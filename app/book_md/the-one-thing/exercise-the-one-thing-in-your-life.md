## Exercise: The ‘One Thing’ in Your Life

Focusing on One Thing brings success. The One Thing spurring success can be a product, person, passion, or life purpose. To discover the impact of the One Thing principle in your life, consider the following:

* * *

Does your company know its One Thing—the distinctive product or service that defines it? What is your company’s One Thing? How has it evolved over time and where is it headed?

What one person has positively influenced your life the most and how?

What one skill or passion has brought you success? How did you discover and invest/focus on it? How might you build on your success so far?
