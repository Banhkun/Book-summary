## Exercise: Managing Your Willpower

Willpower is like the battery power of your phone. As you draw on the available power, the supply diminishes. You make difficult challenges harder when you don’t reserve enough willpower to help you with them.

* * *

Think of a time when you wanted to accomplish something (for instance, to complete a task) but you couldn’t summon the willpower to make it happen. What was the situation and what time of day did it occur?

Now, recall the other things you did that day, leading up to the event where your willpower failed. How many/which of your prior actions might have drained your willpower (for instance, suppressing an emotion, resisting a temptation, doing something you disliked)?

The next time you face this task or a similar one, what steps can you take to conserve the willpower you’ll need to get it done?
