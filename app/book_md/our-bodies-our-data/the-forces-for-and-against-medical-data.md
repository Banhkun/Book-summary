## The Forces For and Against Medical Data

### Propelling Forces for Patient Data Selling

Here are forces that have propelled patient data selling over the past decades:

  * A general public indifference about privacy
    * A majority of people do not opt out of anonymized sharing when given the option.
    * More recently, sites like Facebook, Google train people to expect a lack of privacy in their everyday life.
  * Data sources (such as pharmacies and hospitals) want to improve their earnings numbers, and selling data is a high-margin boost to their bottom line.
  * HIPAA only protects health data with identifiable info and only applies to providers, payers, and clearinghouses (so-called “covered entities”).
    * Other parties can bypass this with loophole
  * Digitization of healthcare info makes transfer of patient data easier than mailing in receipts like in olden days.
  * Medical data is sold for its purported benefits about helping people.
    * Manufacturers believe their drugs are good, so selling their drugs more effectively can only help more people.
    * Pharma salespeople believe they’re educating doctors about better medications.
    * Doctors believe more data access helps research studies.
    * Shared medical data is actually useful for research, and it’s legally difficult to block commercial uses while allowing research uses.
  * More drugs available in the late 20th century, along with readily available reimbursement from insurers, power more marketing spend by pharma companies.
  * Generics and me-too drugs require for more effective marketing to attract attention.
  * Salespeople are actually effective—physicians are too busy to read the latest literature, so they’re swayed by salespeople pitches



### Opposing Forces

Here are forces that have counteracted the sale of patient data:

  * Negative public sentiment in a few dimensions:
    * General fear of privacy invasion
      * Korea has fought against the sale of anonymized data
      * Some patients ask, “If I pay you cash, will you keep my medical records private?”
    * Fear of being discriminated against using your medical record, resulting in:
      * Higher rates for life, health insurance
      * Job rejection
      * Blackmail
    * Providers feel manipulated by being tracked for their prescribing behavior.
      * Increasingly, providers are refusing to see salespeople
  * Regulatory changes
    * Gifts to doctors from pharma are now largely prohibited.
      * Current guidelines are for gifts not to exceed $100, and they should be medically related (such as stethoscopes, not golf trips).
    * Some states are outlawing the use of prescription data for marketing.
      * For example, in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine.
      * But this was struck down by the Supreme Court, which hesitated to bar pharma but not researchers from accessing doctor-identified data.
    * The FDA is clamping down on me-too drugs, which will decrease the marketing demand to separate drugs that are largely identical.
  * Insurance companies are now seeking higher co-pays for branded drugs vs. generics, which limits the marketing efficacy of branded drugs.
  * Among researchers, there is a perception that it’s more difficult to get accurate insights from medical record data compared to a randomized controlled trial.
