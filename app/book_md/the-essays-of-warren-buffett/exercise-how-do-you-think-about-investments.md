## Exercise: How Do You Think About Investments?

Buffett has many suggestions for applying his basic philosophy of investing. Principal among these are that you should invest for long-term gains, focusing on companies that you understand, and that you should approach buying shares of a business as if you’re buying an ownership stake—because that’s what you’re doing. Consider whether your investing practices align with Buffett’s ideas and if you would make any changes in the future.

Are you a passive investor in retirement plans and mutual funds, or do you actively trade in common stocks? If you are the latter, how often do you trade, and how long do you hold any given stock? How do you think your investing style has affected your wealth over time?

What business sectors fall within your personal areas of expertise? How have you used your industry knowledge to guide your investment decisions, if at all? What companies that you’re familiar with through your career would you consider investing in?

How closely do you read the annual reports of any of the companies you’re invested in? What information would you like, as an investor, about the companies in which you own stock? If you were to own a significant number of shares in one of the companies you invested in, what business practices would you like them to focus on?
