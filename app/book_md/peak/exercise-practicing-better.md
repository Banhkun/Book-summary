## Exercise: Practicing Better

Think about how to improve your performance with better practice.

* * *

Have you ever trained for a long period of time to achieve a particular milestone? Describe the situation in a few sentences.

What methods did you use to try to improve? How did you practice? Explain how effective (or ineffective) you found these methods to be.

Based on what you’ve read, how would you have restructured your practice routine to achieve more significant progress? (Remember the keys to purposeful practice: 1) well-defined, specific goals, 2) complete focus, 3) feedback, 4) stepping out of your comfort zone.)

Today, to what skill are you most interested in applying purposeful practice? How would you change what you’re currently doing to practice better?
