## Chapter 6: The Process of Expertise

How do the world’s top performers do what they do? In this chapter, we’re going to examine what is required to fully tap into the potential of the human mind and body. This is usually a process that people begin when they’re still children, continuing through adolescence and into early adulthood until true mastery is attained. **But expert performers don’t just stop when they reach a certain level of skill. They keep going, constantly striving to improve their practice routines in the quest to get better and better**.

### Childhood

In a study at the University of Chicago, one researcher looked at top achievers in music, swimming, tennis, mathematics, neurology, and sculpture. He found that they had common childhood experiences which exerted a meaningful impact on their subsequent records of achievement.

**As children, they had all been introduced to their field of interest in a fun, playful way**. Their parents provided them the time, attention, and encouragement to engage with it further. Indeed, the study found that the parents themselves were likely to be highly achievement-oriented. Crucially, the parents supplemented the child’s initial curiosity-driven motivation with praise.

The children at this stage didn’t engage in deliberate practice—yet. But they did creatively come up with activities that incorporated some elements of training. The hockey great Mario Lemieux, for example, regularly skated around with his two older brothers on a makeshift “rink” in the basement of the family home (using a bottle cap as a puck and kitchen spoons as hockey sticks). Like Lemieux, many future experts had older siblings to look up to and use as models for improving their own performance. Even the great Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart had his older sister, Maria Anna, who inspired him to pursue music.

For people who went on to dominate in fields like advanced mathematics or neurology (which, unlike chess, music, or hockey, are fairly inaccessible to young children), the parents **introduced the children to the general _idea_ of intellectual pursuit, rather than the particular subject matter itself**. They also encouraged the children to build models or conduct science projects as part of their play.

### Upping the Ante

With this foundation in early childhood, the study found that the **future experts then took it to the next level, taking real lessons from a coach or teacher.** These instructors knew how to properly motivate their young students and guide them along the path of deliberate practice. Praise from their teachers for reaching new levels of performance was a key ingredient in the early careers of these future experts.

Parents still played an important role in this stage of development. They sometimes exerted harsh pressure on their children to maintain their practice schedule—threatening to cut off piano lessons or not take the child to their swim lessons unless they committed to deliberate practice at home.

**Eventually, the encouragement of parents and teachers yielded to more intrinsic, self-directed motivation: the students began to enjoy the fruits of their labor and wanted to experience it more**. They relished being seen as a swimmer or a tennis player or a musician. It became a major part of their identity and self-conception. They also began to seek out the company of people with similar interests and motivations, while also looking for the best teachers they could find.

**As they got even older, the future experts truly committed to their field, being willing to pay high prices and endure difficult sacrifices to pursue their dreams**. In seeking out the best coaches, many of them moved to other parts of the country. Elite tennis players, for example, make significant financial investments in their training—the IMG Academy in Florida charges in excess of $70,000 for tuition, room, and board.

### Benefits of Starting Young

**One of the main benefits of starting young is the fact that children and adolescents have fairly few time constraints that inhibit their ability to commit lots of hours to purposeful practice**. Outside of school, their time is fairly unlimited, as opposed to adults, who must juggle the responsibilities of work and family.

This is the main barrier adults face, _not_ physical or mental limitation. Nevertheless, there are _some_ limitations that come with age, which can’t be surmounted, no matter how much deliberate practice one devotes to overcoming them. Physical performance, for example, tends to peak around age 20. After that point, flexibility decreases and muscles become more prone to injury. Moreover, some physical skills can’t be developed past a certain age, because skeletal structure is already set in place. Thus, if you start training to become an Olympic swimmer at age 50, you probably won’t succeed.

Similarly, researchers have found that the corpus callosum, a part of the brain that serves as a communication path between the right and left hemispheres, is significantly larger in adult musicians who started practicing before the age of seven—and smaller in both non-musicians and musicians who first picked up their instruments after this age.

Or we can look at gray matter, the tissue that connects neurons in the brain. The brain has the most gray matter during adolescence, after which it begins to diminish. Thus, a two-year-old child has about 50 times as many synapses (junctions between brain cells, which enhance learning) as an adult. But people who have learned a second language have been found to have retained more gray matter—and this is even more true for people who became bilingual early in life.

**It is _not_ the case, however, that adults are incapable of mastering new skills later in life**.

Even as an adult, you can achieve expertise if you’re willing to put in the deliberate practice to do so. **And deliberate practice is something that _everyone_ can do.**

### Mastering Perfect Pitch: Reaching Expertise in Adulthood

Perfect pitch—the ability to recognize any note on the musical scale without using a reference note—is thought to be either a rare talent that some are simply born with, or a skill that can only be perfected if one starts in childhood. As the example of Paul Brady shows, both notions are false.

Brady was a 32-year-old man who decided that he wanted to learn perfect pitch, a skill that had eluded him throughout his life. He worked with a tone generator, a computer program that produced random pure tones (unlike the notes on a piano, which produced multiple frequencies).

At first, he practiced with the C note, reasoning that he could use that note as a base from which to recognize all the other notes on the scale. **Brady stuck to the principles of deliberate practice, setting aside time each day to work on his project**. The software was likewise written with these ideals in mind—as he got better and better at identifying C, the program began generating fewer and fewer of them and producing more of the other notes. This was deliberate practice in a nutshell: pushing Brady to challenge himself more after every improvement.

And the results showed. After two months, when his wife played individual notes on the piano, Brady was able to correctly guess 37 out of 55. And those he got wrong were only off by half a note. This performance met the standard of perfect pitch. Brady had taught himself to do something that was thought to be unteachable.
