## Chapter 5: Becoming an Expert Through Deliberate Practice

Most of us have dreams. Some people would like to become experts in golf and make the PGA Tour. Others want to master the Japanese martial art of karate and attain black belt status. And most of us are dissuaded from pursuing those dreams because **we have bought into the idea that we just aren’t good enough or don’t have the natural talent to perform at these levels.**

But this notion is false. Through deliberate practice, you can take control of your life and fulfill your untapped potential.

### Find a Good Teacher

The first step is to find a good teacher. Deliberate practice requires structure and feedback—you need someone who is well-versed in your field who can point out when you’re making mistakes and devise a practice regimen that will push and challenge you. And remember, the best teachers are _not_ always themselves the best performers. Indeed, many experts make terrible teachers.

(Shortform note: We see this in sports all the time, with great players who prove to be utter flops as coaches. Wayne Gretzky, for example, is widely regarded as the greatest player ever to play in the National Hockey League. But he was a disappointment as a coach, posting a decidedly mediocre .436 win percentage over four seasons as head coach of the Phoenix Coyotes.)

When looking for your teacher, try to avoid overly subjective criteria (online ratings sites like ratemyprofessors.com, for example, are notorious for being biased in favor of teachers who are fun, personable, or physically attractive, rather than effective teachers). **You should find someone who has established skills and a strong background in the field you wish to pursue, and one who will help you develop your _own_ mental representations** and focus on the specific areas in which you need the most improvement. You may also need to switch teachers at some point, especially if you notice that you have stopped improving.

If you don’t have a teacher, can’t find one, or can’t afford one, you can still apply most of the principles of deliberate practice to your routine. Try to do something that you’re currently unable to do, take yourself out of your comfort zone, and practice it again and again—not through unthinking repetition, but with a keen focus on exactly _how_ you’re doing it and where you’re specifically coming up short. The Internet can be a great tool for finding the most effective training techniques in most disciplines. If we look at the example of Benjamin Franklin, we see how effective this approach can be—even without a teacher.

#### Benjamin Franklin: A Self-Taught Writer

Benjamin Franklin, the renowned 18th- century polymath and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, taught himself to become an effective and skilled writer without the aid of a teacher because he was intensely focused and disciplined in the pursuit of this goal. He had been inspired by the quality of prose in a British magazine he read, and he wanted to perfect his own writing. **Without access to a teacher, he put the principles of deliberate practice into action all on his own.**

His method was to try to replicate the sentences and paragraphs in the magazine _after_ they had left his short-term memory. To help himself, he wrote short summaries of the magazine’s content, so he could be reminded of the meaning of each sentence. His goal was never to reproduce the work of the magazine word-for-word. Rather, Franklin was attempting to create his own articles in his own words that were just as detailed, witty, and skillfully written as the original.

**When he compared his work to the original, he would identify common instances where his writing fell short, and refine this practice technique to focus on those particular weaknesses**. In this way, he acted as his own teacher, giving himself feedback and perfecting his deliberate practice regimen.

For example, he found that one of his shortcomings was his immediate vocabulary—it wasn’t as large or extensive as the writers of the magazine. He _knew_ all the words they used, but never had all of them in his mind, at his immediate disposal. To correct this, he added a _new_ component to his deliberate practice regimen. He transformed the articles from prose to poetic verse, reasoning that the rhyming and metric demands of poetry would force him to use a greater variety of words. Then, once he had forgotten the original phrasing of the article, he would translate his poems back to prose in his own words.

### Focus

**Focus and engagement are key. Remember, if your mind is wandering elsewhere, you’re not truly engaging in deliberate practice and you’ll be unlikely to see any improvement**. To really tap into your potential, your practice sessions away from your teacher will be intensive, rigorously focused, and unfortunately, not always fun—you probably won’t become a chess master by playing friendly, non-competitive matches in the park; you’re not going to become a bowling pro by heading to the bowling alley with your friends once a week. Short, intense training sessions with clear goals are the most effective way to quickly develop new skills.

Olympic swimmer Natalie Coughlin attributes her success to this sort of intense focus. She used to spend hours and hours every week practicing her strokes, but would often become bored and distracted by the repetitive nature of what she was doing—because she wasn’t engaged in deliberate practice. She was just mindlessly performing the same moves over and over again, instead of developing a mental representation of what her body felt like when she performed a “perfect” stroke and honing her technique until she fulfilled that mental ideal.

This realization inspired Coughlin to alter her practice regimen. Her sessions would now be focused on building specific skills, instead of working toward a vague overall “improvement.” She began cutting the excess time from her practices and used the remaining time to rigorously focus on improving her form. As with all deliberate practice, **focus and quality are far more important than repetition and quantity.**

### Motivation

**How do you remain motivated throughout a long and intensive deliberate practice regimen?** How do you avoid succumbing to the mental and physical exhaustion and just giving up? Deliberate practice is highly effective, but can be grueling—many people simply cannot maintain focus and discipline, especially when they reach temporary plateaus (which are usually a cue to intensify and up the ante with their practice regimen) or don’t see immediate performance improvement.

Is it simply that the people who maintain deliberate practice just _enjoy_ it more? Not if you believe the results of a study of Scripps National Spelling Bee contestants. According to that study, the contestants didn’t _like_ studying at all. What distinguished the best spellers, in fact, was their ability to stick to the task _despite_ the unappealing nature of spelling practice. So why did they keep doing it? Because they had the motivation to do so.

Motivativation itself, of course, varies greatly from person to person. For some, it’s entirely intrinsic: they just have an intense desire to be a track runner, a violinist, a chess master. For others, it’s more grounded in immediate or material goals, i.e., they want to improve their public speaking skills so they can advance in their career and earn more money.

Sometimes, seeing the improvement itself can be a powerful motivator—you see that you’re getting better and want to push yourself harder to improve even _more_. This convinces you that you _can_ succeed, which inspires you to keep going.

**The evidence argues against what many people believe—that there is an ingrained or natural quality of “grit” or “stick-to-itiveness.”** People who are experts are usually experts in one particular field: they were motivated to practice and excel in one pursuit that interested or motivated them, not in _all_ endeavors. Chess masters who apply rigorous deliberate practice to reach the pinnacle of performance in their field don’t usually apply that same discipline to other things, like swimming or karate. This situational dependence renders the idea of a generic “willpower” trait highly dubious.

Moreover, belief in such a trait leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy: **your unwillingness to practice leads you to conclude that you lack the necessary willpower, which causes you to further avoid practice, which means you don’t improve.** It leads to defeatism and an unwillingness to try.

#### Tactics to Stay Motivated

One good way to reduce the desire to quit is to set aside allotted time each day, devoted solely to deliberate practice, with full concentration—and that means turning off the computer, smartphone, TV, or anything else that can be a distraction. An hour is usually a good amount of time, as it’s hard to maintain concentration for longer than that and you’ll experience burnout if you push yourself too hard.

**Clear your schedule so that there is nothing else to do during this time other than practice** —the Berlin violin students we saw earlier used the early morning for their practice sessions, a time when they had nothing else to do. This sort of time management limits the temptation of other activities, while also ensuring that your practice sessions don’t consume other aspects of your life.

#### Self-Confidence

**Belief in one’s own abilities may be the most powerful motivator of all.** The Swedish middle-distance runner Gunder Hägg was trained, in part, by his father. As a boy, young Gunder would run through the woods near the family’s home, while his father would time his results. What the boy _didn’t_ know was that his father would tell him that his times were far better than they actually were: if Gunder really completed the run in 5 minutes and 50 seconds, his father would tell him that his finishing time was 4 minutes and 50 seconds.

In his autobiography, written after he had become one of Sweden’s most famous athletes, Gunder cited his father’s ruse as a key motivator. He believed that he had a bright future as a runner, so he was inspired and motivated to work harder and harder to beat his previous records.

#### Social Motivation

**Motivation can also be extrinsic, fueled by a desire for praise and recognition from others**. If this is what motivates you, you should surround yourself with people who will support you in your pursuits. If we return to the example of the Berlin violin students from Chapter 2, it’s no coincidence that these top achievers were spending their time with fellow music students. It was mutually reinforcing, as the students appreciated and encouraged one another’s passion for music.

In the same spirit, Benjamin Franklin formed an intellectual club, called the “Junto” in his home city of Philadelphia. Members of the Junto were the city’s leading thought leaders across a wide variety of fields. In their meetings, members would discuss the leading intellectual topics of the day. They benefited from debating and conversing with some of the finest minds of the era. Everyone was focused on self-improvement and intellectual growth. Franklin applied deliberate practice to the Junto as well, challenging himself to ask at least one interesting question each week—even if the topic was one in which he wasn’t already well-versed.
