## Chapter 7: The Prodigy Myth

**One of the most enduring beliefs is the idea that some people are born with natural talent that enables them to excel in a particular field with comparatively little effort**. In fact, innate characteristics play a much smaller role in determining performance than most people believe. Great performers and great performances are the product of long, careful, and deliberate practice. The idea of prodigies is revealed as being largely a myth, now that we have an understanding of how deliberate practice works.

**There is usually a wide variability in the performance level of beginners in most fields. Some seem to excel easily, while others struggle at the outset**. This also contributes to the idea that some people are just born with innate talent. But this is false. One study of young chess players, for example, showed that the amount of chess practice performed by a student was far more correlated with high scores than raw intelligence (as measured by IQ scores).

In fact, among the best-performing players, high IQ was _negatively_ correlated with high scores in chess. The researchers found that the lower-IQ members of this elite group within the study were more likely to devote time to deliberate practice—and practice simply counted for far more than intelligence. The quality of mental representations that these elite players developed through deliberate practice was a far more important factor in their success than anything else, rendering other characteristics far less statistically significant.

The idea of prodigies is highly appealing. People _want_ to believe in something magical or divine and reject the notion that so many wonderful parts of the human experience can be explained through science, reason, and observation. But while such a belief does speak to the unquenchable human need for mystery and wonder, it is actually quite limiting. **Accepting that some people simply have natural talent and others don’t might discourage you from even trying to fulfill your dreams: “I’m not good at this, so why bother?”**

And it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy—people who develop the idea that they’re “bad” at something never practice, and, therefore, never get good at it. The opposite is also true. Children who show some early promise in music, mathematics, or athletics tend to be lavished with attention and praise from teachers and parents and receive more training and resources to help them develop their skills than children who struggle. **The “gifted” students don’t possess some innate ability that others don’t, they’re just (mistakenly) given more of an opportunity to develop.** This is truly tragic—the world has likely been deprived of the talents of countless people who were deemed at an early age to be “no good” at things.

And we know from our study of deliberate practice that improvement—even _great_ improvement—in almost any field is possible for nearly _everyone_ who is willing to stick with it and push themselves a little further after each incremental improvement. **This is a far more inspiring and empowering idea than a belief in natural talent—it shows us the true power of the human body and mind.**

### Mozart

**Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is often regarded as the very embodiment of a musical prodigy,** someone whose extraordinary artistic accomplishments at such a young age can only be explained by some inimitable talent within him. At the age of six, he was already dazzling audiences with his skills on a grand European tour in which he showcased his—allegedly— original compositions.

But Mozart had something that counted a lot more than raw talent. He had a father, Leopold, who was himself an accomplished musician and who was highly motivated to have his young son become a great figure in the annals of musical history. The elder Mozart had even written a book about teaching music to children. We know that he began his son’s training before the boy was even four—ample time for Wolfgang to soak up important hours of deliberate practice in his formative years, as he taught the young man multiple instruments, as well as how to listen to and analyze music.

**Thus, the claims about Mozart’s childhood compositions are likely exaggerated**. His early childhood compositions are actually written in his _father’s_ handwriting—a clue that perhaps the elder Mozart played a larger role in this stage of his son’s career than history cares to remember. Musicologists have also discovered that these compositions were derivative, based mainly on the work of obscure composers.

In fact, they were probably training exercises that Leopold gave to his son, the best surviving evidence of Mozart’s deliberate practice. In fact, the first serious work that can be unequivocally attributed to him came when he was in his teens— _after_ a decade of purposeful practice. Still a remarkable achievement, but not quite the child prodigy that legend has made him out to be.

### Savant Syndrome

People with savant syndrome are said to possess extraordinary talents, for which there is no rational explanation. Whether it is arithmetic calculation, musical proficiency, sculpture, or any other highly specific area, these individuals display an extraordinary aptitude. People with savant syndrome are usually mentally challenged in some way, often through severe autism. With such mental limitations, it often seems as if the achievements of people with savant syndrome came about without the sort of deliberate practice one would expect.

But this is not the case. **Savants have worked hard and practiced to reach their level of performance, the same as everyone else.** One study from the UK looked at autistic children, comparing savants and non-savants. The results showed that the savants were much more likely to be highly detail-oriented and prone to repetitive behaviors—qualities which would certainly aid in one’s ability to engage in successful deliberate practice.

One autistic savant, named Donny, is the world’s most accomplished calendar calculator—he is able to tell you the day of the week for any date (no matter how far into the future or far back into the past) and can do it faster and more accurately than anyone who’s ever been recorded. How does he do this? Through plain deliberate practice and mental representation.

Donny is fixated upon, perhaps even addicted to, dates. He has all 14 possible annual calendars memorized—the seven which correspond to each of the days of the week on which January 1 can fall, as well as the corresponding leap year calendars. Once he has these calendars memorized, it’s a matter of using this mental representation to find the date and day of the week that he is asked to retrieve. If you ask him, for example, what day of the week July 13, 1987 was, he will first determine which of the 14 calendars the year 1987 corresponds to. From there, he can use his memory of the calendars to determine the day of the week to which that date corresponds.

It is an impressive skill, to be sure, but one borne of years of deliberate practice and the development of a memory-retrieval system of mental representation (not dissimilar to Feng Wang’s digit memorization process of imagining bananas and monks). It is _not_ a product of some inexplicable natural talent.

### Fulfilling the Potential

**Clearly, deliberate practice has the potential to unleash the full power of human ability.** This could have world-changing implications across every field of human endeavor. So how do we start putting it into practice?

We should start with education. Unlike chess, athletics, or music, _everyone_ is affected by the quality of education they receive. Improvements in education—training people to be more effective teachers and showing them how to teach the principles of deliberate practice to _their_ students—could have a powerful effect. **The key is focusing teaching on the acquisition of skills rather than the accumulation of knowledge. What you _do_ matters more than what you _know_.**

This should be the basis of the lesson plans that teachers draw up for their students. **Crucial to all of this is the development of effective mental representations and a conceptual, holistic understanding of the subject matter.**

One experiment examined the effectiveness of different approaches to teaching physics to college freshmen. The experimental group of students participated in a training module that focused on student-led discussion groups, in which the students discussed and debated physics questions amongst each other. The researchers found that students who participated in _this_ module were much more active participants in class than students who were taught through a traditional lecture-and-test program. This was because students in the experimental group had to _use_ their physics knowledge. They were engaging in deliberate practice and forming mental representations, whereas students in the traditional program were only gaining knowledge, not the skills to apply it. Students in the experimental group demonstrated a better understanding of the core concepts of physics, which also enabled them to perform far better than their peers on tests.

Moreover, teaching skills through deliberate practice is not mutually exclusive with knowledge. As the students practice applying their skills, they will gain new knowledge along the way. Teaching students how expertise works and how they can direct much of their own skill-building through purposeful practice is one of the most fulfilling lessons we can impart to them.

Through embracing these principles, we could create a far more prosperous and happy world, one in which _everyone_ honed their skills to reach the same level of elite performance as a Mozart or Alekhine. It would have an enormously positive impact on technology, healthcare, public service, and countless other fields. The lesson is clear. Fulfill your untapped potential. **Work hard and practice to take control of your life and become whatever it is you wish to be. Your future is entirely in your hands.**
