## Chapter 6: Approach #3—Become Emotionally Invulnerable to Shame

The third approach you can take when suffering a shaming is to become emotionally invulnerable to shame: In other words, refuse to let shame affect you. Ronson spoke to **porn stars about how to become invulnerable to shame** —naked photos and videos of porn stars in all sorts of compromising positions are all over the internet, which most people would find mortifying.

To find out how porn stars manage shame, Ronson interviewed Princess Donna Dolore of Kink.com studios. Dolore felt a lot of shame when she was growing up. At one point, **she realized that if she _shared_ the things that embarrassed her, they were no longer embarrassing or shameful.** This is actually how she comes up with her porn scenarios—she brainstorms humiliating scenarios alone and then acts them out with others to rob the scenarios of their shaming power.

Dolore helps other people get over their sexual shame in a similar way. For example, she organized a public disgrace scene in a porn video for actor Jody Taylor. In the taped scene, Dolore unexpectedly dragged Taylor into a bar, stripped her, and attached live electrodes to her genitals. The bar patrons humiliated Taylor by groping her (if they washed their hands and clipped their nails first), shouting at her, pouring drinks on her, or spitting at her, among other things. Taylor said that if something like this happened to her in real life, it would be awful, but **she thinks that fiction, by nature, can’t be frightening or humiliating,** so instead, filming “shaming” scenes is “awesome.”

Dolore’s goal is to make people feel less ashamed of what they want and **her work to demystify strange sex is probably part of the reason that fewer men are shamed for sex scandals these days.**

However, Dolore isn’t immune to shame in all contexts—when she read an article about herself on TMZ that mentioned she was good with her fist, she realized that people saw her as an idiot and this humiliated her. Within her own circles, where people were educated about sex, she felt comfortable, but seeing an outside perspective was completely different.

### Extended Example: Max Mosley

In 2008, _News of the World_ published a story about Max Mosley’s involvement in “sick” Nazi-themed orgies. This story should have caused massive public shaming—Mosley was a powerful public figure as the head of Formula One racing’s governing body. Additionally, his parents were well-known Hitler supporters—Hitler had been at their wedding, which was held at Joseph Goebbels’s house.

However, **Mosley survived the scandal just fine and is actually _more_ popular now than before. **Some people think he leads by example when it comes to feeling unashamed.

#### The Transgression: A “Nazi-Themed” Orgy

When Mosley was in his mid-twenties, he started going to S&M clubs. He found them comfortable and relaxing. They were shame-free places where he could be authentic. He was careful, though—he’d started working in the auto industry, which regularly dug up shameful dirt on people to blackmail them.

  * For example, when lawyer Ralph Nader began to push for seat belt laws after one of his friends was in an accident and became a paraplegic. General Motors was so furious about being told what to do that they hired prostitutes to try to seduce him so they could blackmail him. They also had him followed by private detectives in the hopes of finding something to shame him with.



In spring 2008, the _News of the World_ photographed Mosley with hidden cameras while in the middle of a Nazi-themed sex orgy and released the photos and story.

#### Immediate Aftermath

Mosley didn’t withdraw or apologize when the story broke. He showed his wife the story and interviewed with BBC Radio 4. In the interview, he said that in the context of sex, people do strange things. He agreed his sex life was strange, but people shouldn’t think badly of him for it. **Mosley brought his actual personality closer to his public persona, unlike Lehrer, who was almost two entirely different people and was shamed for being two-faced.**

**Mosley also sued the _News of the World_ because they’d written that the orgy was Nazi-themed, which, in reality, it wasn’t**:

  * The orgy included a prop that the paper called a “SS-style inspection sheet.” In fact, this prop was a spiral-bound notebook.
  * The orgy included Max’s being shaved by a woman guard. Jews were shaved at concentration camps, but Max’s bottom, specifically, was shaved, and this wasn’t something that happened at concentration camps.
  * The actors wore German military uniforms, not Nazi uniforms, and it would have been easy to source Nazi uniforms if desired.
  * Two of the women guards, when scheduling the scenario, referred to it as a “judicial,” rather than a _Gerchtsverfahren_ or trial.



#### Long-Term Consequences

**Mosley won the case** and as a result, **most people see him as someone who was wronged.**(The _News of the World_ already had a villainous reputation—it had previously publicly shamed two people so badly that they committed suicide.)

Mosley had two guesses for why he’d escaped a shaming:

  * He was a sociopath and couldn’t feel any emotions. As part of a job application, he was analyzed by a psychiatrist, who determined he was a sociopath. However, Ronson doesn’t think Mosley is a sociopath at all for a number of reasons—namely, the psychiatrist didn’t assess him in person, Mosley feels empathy, which sociopaths usually don’t, and people who worry they’re sociopaths generally aren’t.
  * He refused to feel shame. Unlike other victims of public shamings, he talked about his transgressions and defended his right to do what he liked in the bedroom.



While Mosley was good at managing his emotions, both **he and Ronson eventually concluded that Mosley escaped shame because he was a man in a consensual sex scandal.** In modern times, sex scandals aren’t that shameful for men.
