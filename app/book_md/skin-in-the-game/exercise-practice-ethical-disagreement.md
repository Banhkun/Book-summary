## Exercise: Practice Ethical Disagreement

Ethical disagreement, the way Taleb describes it, benefits everyone. It turns ego-driven competition into a productive brainstorming session. Ethical disagreement is a valuable skill that’s worth practicing.

* * *

Think of a fight or debate you’ve had recently. Were you trying to discover the truth, or find a valid solution to a problem? Or were you just trying to prove that you were right?

Temporarily take your opponent’s side of this fight as if it were yours: Write up the argument that they _should_ _have_ made, in a way that would make them say, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”

List everything you can think of that both sides of this argument can agree on.

Has this process made you think about the argument differently? How would you feel if your opponent went through this process for you?
