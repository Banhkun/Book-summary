## Exercise: Evaluate Your Current Risk-Freedom Balance

Taleb asserts that each of us trades away a certain amount of freedom for a reduction in personal risk. Reflect on the levels of freedom and risk in your life and determine if something needs to change.

* * *

On a scale from one to ten, how much freedom do you have at work?

Are you satisfied with your current level of freedom? (Does the way you spend your time at work make you feel comfortable, or constrained?)

On a scale from one to ten, how much risk do you take at work?

Are you satisfied with your current level of risk? (Do you feel bored or directionless at work? On the other hand, do you feel overwhelmed or anxious?)

If youâ€™d like more freedom at work, what is a risk you can take or a sacrifice you can make that will get you closer to doing what you want to do? If you feel overwhelmed, how can you add more stability to your life?
