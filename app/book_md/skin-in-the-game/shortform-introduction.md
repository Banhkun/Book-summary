## Shortform Introduction

_Skin in the Game_ is the 2018 addition to Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s bestselling _Incerto_ , a series of philosophical nonfiction works dedicated to exploring how uncertainty defines our world.

The book is a treatise on the necessity of skin in the game—the need for everyone to be held accountable for the consequences of their actions. In this guide, you’ll become familiar with Taleb’s unique way of making sense of the world and in the process discover game-changing insights in wide-ranging areas of life, such as business, science, history, and religion.

### About the Author

Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a Lebanon-born author and statistician. A provocateur in the academic world, Taleb is simultaneously lauded for his revolutionary insights and criticized for his bombastic, combative style.

Taleb draws heavily from his experience as a former options trader, to which he attributes his deep familiarity with risk and uncertainty. Taleb earned a PhD in management science from Paris Dauphine University and has researched and taught risk management and probability at institutions such as University of Massachusetts Amherst, Oxford University, and NYU’s Tandon School of Engineering.

He is the author of the critically acclaimed books _Fooled by Randomness_ (2001), _The Black Swan_ (2007), and _Antifragile_ (2012).

### The Book’s Publication

Publisher: Penguin Random House

_Skin in the Game_ was published in February of 2018, six years after the release of his previous work _Antifragile_. Several chapters from _Skin in the Game_ were published on Medium over the course of a year and a half preceding its official release.

_Skin in the Game_ is the fifth book in Taleb’s critically acclaimed _Incerto_ series. The book expands upon many of the ideas established in the previous _Incerto_ works, putting greater emphasis on the ethical and political implications of Taleb’s philosophy.

This addition to the _Incerto_ was originally unplanned—in the introduction to _Skin in the Game_ , Taleb states that he considered retiring as an author after finishing _Antifragile_ but soon felt the irresistible need to combat the “well-marketed nonsense” of modern intellectuals. For this reason, he began writing _Skin in the Game_.

### The Book’s Context

Taleb intended this book as a response to the work of those influential academics who he perceived to be propagating dangerous misinformation and faulty thinking. He argues that because these intellectuals lack “skin in the game,” errors in their thinking are never corrected, and the negative consequences of their ideas can never be directly observed.

Among the books Taleb specifically criticizes are _Capital in the Twenty-First Century_ by Thomas Piketty, _Nudge_ by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, and _The Better Angels of Our Nature _by Steven Pinker. Taleb poses direct counterarguments to each of these books in chapters dedicated to economics, rationality, and the history of war, respectively, and he disparages their status as risk-exempt intellectuals throughout the book.

In other chapters, this book is a natural progression from the ideas presented in Taleb’s earlier _Incerto_ works. He has previously advised individuals and organizations on how best to operate in a deeply unpredictable world—now, he details his vision of an effective, moral civilization within this uncertain world and points out in greater detail where he sees modern society fall short, addressing new topics such as employment and virtue.

### The Book’s Strengths and Weaknesses

#### Critical Reception

_Skin in the Game_ debuted at #2 on the New York Times Bestseller list, despite Taleb’s choice to refrain from promoting the book or sending out copies to reviewers.

Reviews of _Skin in the Game_ were largely positive. Critics and readers alike praised the book for being Taleb’s most complete view of the world to date, completing the holistic philosophy established throughout the Incerto. Fans of Taleb’s unique voice were satisfied, as he’s brasher and snappier than ever. Overall, nearly all critics were at least somewhat receptive to Taleb’s central thesis of accountability and consequence.

However, critics disliked Taleb’s prideful animosity that dominates much of this book. Phil Coggan of The Economist mourns that the author behind _The Black Swan_ has become “submerged,” overpowered by “a second Mr. Taleb,” a “cantankerous and over-opinionated [cab] driver.” Some critics and readers questioned the validity of Taleb’s more specific sub-arguments, especially since his conclusions are so extreme. For example, Taleb at one point advocates for the total elimination of salaried research positions—an impractical proposal at best.

Interestingly, Taleb posted a direct response to the most popular critical reviews of Skin in the Game, calling out what he sees as critics’ misunderstandings of his work.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Approach

Taleb deliberately cultivates an abrasive style in his writing—one that bounces from topic to topic without fully fleshing out many of the points he makes. There are more ideas than justification in this book, but the book becomes somewhat more focused as it progresses.

In the introduction, Taleb claims his book is “organized the way the reader reads, or wants to read, and according to how deep the author wants to go into a topic,” but the intentionally stream-of-consciousness flow of ideas makes it difficult to detect the larger argument that Taleb is driving toward in each chapter.

On the other hand, Taleb’s idea-dense prose gives the book an engaging forward momentum. The twists and turns of his train of thought keep things consistently interesting. And, while the links between ideas can be hazy, the ideas themselves are presented in clear, precise language, making it easy to follow Taleb down his winding path.

#### Commentary on the Book’s Organization

Taleb posted many of the chapters in this book separately online before publication, and, consequently, the book reads at times like a collection of loosely connected essays. The sequencing of chapters comes off as somewhat arbitrary. Taleb groups the chapters into “Books” of inconsistent length, stitching together chapters that don’t obviously belong with one another. Some topics are spread out throughout the book when they would be clearer concentrated in a single chapter.

### Our Approach in This Guide

Instead of preserving Taleb’s unique stream of consciousness, we’ve reorganized his ideas into a progression that’s easier to follow. We’ve also synthesized points on topics that are scattered throughout the book, such as science and government, into their own sections in order to get a better sense of how they fit into Taleb’s central argument. Here’s a map showing how Taleb’s chapters are organized within this guide:

Introduction

  * Chapter 1: The Basics of Skin in the Game → Book Introduction, Chapter 1



Part 1: How Skin in the Game Makes the World Better

  * Chapter 2: Skin in the Game of Employment → Book Chapter 3
  * Chapter 3: Skin in the Game of Economics and Wealth → Book Chapter 7
  * Chapter 4: Skin in the Game of the Passionate Few → Book Chapter 2
  * Chapter 5: Skin in the Game Speaks Louder Than Words → Book Chapters 11, 13



Part 2: How a Lack of Skin in the Game Makes the World Worse

  * Chapter 6: A Lack of Skin in the Game Causes Systemic Decay → Book Chapters 6, 8, 9
  * Chapter 7: Skin in the Game Problems in Science and Academia → Book Chapters 8, 9
  * Chapter 8: Skin in the Game Problems in Government → Book Introduction, Chapters 1, 2, 7
  * Chapter 9: Skin in the Game Problems in Journalism → Book Chapter 12
  * Chapter 10: Skin in the Game Problems of War and Peace → Book Chapter 14



Part 3: Philosophical Implications of Skin in the Game

  * Chapter 11: Skin in the Game of Philosophy and Religion → Book Chapters 5, 15-19



In this guide, we’ll begin by establishing what skin in the game is and why it’s important in Part 1 We’ll move on to show the different ways in which skin in the game makes the world better in Part 2, beginning with concrete topics such as employment and economics and working toward more abstract topics such as passion and virtue.

In Part 3, we’ll investigate Taleb’s criticisms of areas in which a lack of Skin in the Game causes problems. We’ll describe how and why this happens in Chapter 6 before applying those principles to specific institutions such as academia and government in Chapters 7-10.

Finally, we’ll conclude with the philosophical implications of Taleb’s worldview in Part 3, summarizing the author’s ideas about the meaning of life and religion.

Along the way, we’ll paint a fuller picture of Taleb’s complex worldview by providing context from other books in the _Incerto_ series, as well as other written work by Taleb such as op-eds and academic papers.
