## Chapter 3: Skin in the Game of Economics and Wealth

Now that we’ve discussed how employees’ skin in the game benefits employers, employees, and consumers, we’ll zoom out and take a look at the role skin in the game plays in building a healthy, wealthy economy.

Taleb argues that wealth earned through skin in the game contributes to society in a healthy way, and that **the way to create an ethical and productive economic system is to force top earners to risk their wealth in order to keep it**.

In this section, we’ll first redefine economic inequality using skin in the game, distinguishing between two types of wealth and two types of inequality. Then, we’ll examine Taleb’s argument that the free market does the most to reduce economic inequality. Finally, we’ll explain why most opponents of the free market are upper class intellectuals instead of the lower class that would be impacted the most.

### Good Wealth and Bad Wealth

Taleb uses the concept of skin in the game to distinguish between two categories of wealthy people: those who built and maintain their wealth through skin in the game, and those who built and maintain their wealth with minimal-to-no risk. Taleb argues that we want more of this first type of wealth and less of the second.

First, let’s discuss wealthy people with skin in the game. These are people who earned money through risky ventures and sacrifice—entrepreneurs, artists, anyone who habitually took _risks_ that eventually paid off. Alternatively, these could be people born into money—kings, heirs—who _risked their fortunes_ , reinvested, and were able to create more wealth.

Importantly, Taleb notes that **wealth is not necessarily a zero-sum game.** If wealth is correctly invested, it can create more wealth than would have otherwise existed, and distribute some of that wealth to others. Think of Adobe, for example, a company that creates industry-grade creative software (Photoshop, After Effects). By investing wealth in the risky prospect of creating software that people might not want to buy, Adobe enabled millions of its users to create value (appealing graphics, movies with special effects) and earn wealth for themselves (a paycheck for creative work). This new wealth wouldn’t exist without Adobe, and wouldn’t have existed without the wealth of its initial investors. In this way, wealthy people with skin in the game generally use their wealth in ways that better society.

This group of wealthy people isn’t necessarily resented by those poorer than them—on the contrary, they are often admired, and perceived as skilled and hardworking. Beloved actors, famous authors, and bootstrap entrepreneurs are often rich—sometimes outrageously rich—yet they attract adoring audiences. Many would say these people “deserve” their wealth.

In contrast, let’s take a look at wealthy people without skin in the game. These are people who created wealth in ways that don’t contribute value to society—often by taking advantage of others. This group consists of anyone whose income is independent of the value of their work, and as such, is being earned without risk.

Taleb specifically calls out employees in salaried positions that don’t provide value for others, such as predatory gossip bloggers, dishonest lawyers, ineffective government bureaucrats, or corrupt CEOs. Recall that employees are paid for fulfilling job descriptions, and that their work is not necessarily linked to its consequences. A guaranteed salary removes a degree of skin in the game, allowing this second group of people to amass wealth without risking much or generating real value. Taleb states that this second group of people are more resented by the general public, and rightfully so.

These two opposing types of wealth are vital to understanding economic inequality—**one kind of wealth is relatively healthy for society, while the other is not**.

> **Most People Don’t Want Equality**
> 
> Studies have confirmed Taleb’s assertion that most people harbor no resentment toward wealthy people with skin in the game. On average, Americans from all political backgrounds and people from around the world believe that some economic inequality is healthy for the world—although they want far less than there currently is. We want to reward people for making the world better. What people resent is not economic inequality, but economic unfairness—that is, earning money without producing value, giving without taking, having no skin in the game.
> 
> The question now becomes: what level of inequality is ideal?
> 
> **How Much Inequality Do We Want?**
> 
> Unsurprisingly, this is a politically charged issue and a fierce point of contention among theorists. Opponents of wealth distribution object in the name of economic growth. Reducing the potential income of top earners disincentivizes risky investments (for example, funding a start-up), innovation (funding research and development), and specialized training (going to med school) by limiting the rewards available for such socially constructive behavior.
> 
> Additionally, as economist Casey Mulligan points out, publicly-funded “safety net” programs discourage those in poverty from working to improve their lives. Income independent of labor takes skin out of the Game.
> 
> On the other hand, Harvard’s Thomas Freeman warns that excessive economic inequality hinders economic growth in its own way. Concentrated wealth enables greater political rent-seeking, as top earners are able to wield disproportionate influence among government officials, earning advantages in policy or unnecessary subsidies at the expense of the rest of society.
> 
> Economists from the International Monetary Fund argue that when spent on education and healthcare for the underprivileged, redistributed wealth can even accelerate economic growth by subsidizing the creation of valuable workers, offsetting the cost of reduced incentives for productivity. They also argue that there are ways to redistribute wealth that preserve incentives entirely—for example, cleaning up loopholes in the tax code, or implementing a more aggressive inheritance tax.
> 
> **Are We Focusing Too Much on Inequality?**
> 
> Notice that this discussion of inequality is tangled up with a number of adjacent issues and debates—the efficacy of social welfare, how to manage political rent-seeking, how to provide effective opportunities for education, and the ideal tax structure are all at play here. It’s possible that economic inequality isn’t the issue to focus on at all.
> 
> Columnist David Brooks argues that outrage over economic inequality is predicated on the false assumption that the poor stay poor as a direct result of the rich getting richer. As Taleb notes, wealth is not a zero-sum game. Instead, we are dealing with “two different constellations of problems”—factors that allow the rich to get richer unethically, for example, their undue influence on politicians, and factors that are causing the poor to stay poor, for example, the disappearance of entry-level jobs. All these problems are valid, but Brooks argues that combining them into one issue labeled “inequality” is a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation.
> 
> As we’ll see next, Taleb, too, argues that we are looking at economic inequality the wrong way.

### Two Types of Inequality

In view of these two categories of Good Wealth and Bad Wealth, Taleb distinguishes between two ways of understanding the distribution of wealth: “Static” Inequality and “Dynamic” Inequality.

Static inequality refers to the wealth disparity of a population at any given _single point in time_. On the other hand, dynamic inequality refers to the inability for a given individual to rise in economic class _across a lifetime._

**Dynamic equality can be understood as _two-way income mobility_** —how easy it is to earn more wealth, as well as how easy it is to lose the wealth you have. A perfectly Dynamically Equal society would be one in which no individual spends more time in any one income bracket than anyone else. In other words, dynamic equality is skin in the game of wealth—your financial status is always at risk.

#### Why Is Dynamic Equality Better Than Static Equality?

Taleb implies that a**** perfectly Dynamically Equal society would be better off than a perfectly Statically Equal society.

An ideal society is one in which everyone, rich and poor, has skin in the game. If you do good for others, you should be rewarded. If you harm others, you should be punished. As we discussed in Chapter 1 of this guide, this is the definition of skin in the game and the foundation of a healthy society. An ideal market should reward wealthy people who invest their wealth in risky ventures that benefit others. Those who do not should eventually lose their wealth.

**Dynamic equality allows those who create value to become richer, while forcing those who don’t to become poorer.** For this reason, dynamic inequality is a far more important statistic to measure than static inequality—it measures how well a society rewards those who contribute to the collective and punishes those who do not. It measures skin in the game.

Judgments made based on measurements of static inequality can result in faulty conclusions. Even if you chart the data of static inequality across time, it’s impossible to tell how the income of _specific people_ is changing.

For example, if you’re looking at static inequality, Europe appears to be more egalitarian than the United States—their wealth is more evenly distributed across the population. But Taleb uses some statistics of dynamic inequality that propose America may be fairer than Europe. In Europe, more than a third of the five hundred wealthiest people inherited their wealth from family dynasties that have lasted for centuries. Compare this to the US, where 90% of the wealthiest five hundred people entered that list less than thirty years ago.

Here’s another statistic on dynamic equality in America: 10% of Americans will spend at least one year in the top 1% of income earners, and more than _half_ of all Americans will spend at least a year in the top 10% of income earners. Since what we’re trying to do is allow the market to reward those who contribute to society, greater turnover among the rich in the United States is a sign of fairness.

In Taleb’s opinion, dynamic inequality is something to resent far more than static inequality. In our uncertain world, the only way an individual permanently stays in a high income bracket is if he doesn’t have skin in the game. In this way, dynamic inequality indicates wealth that is unfairly exempt from risk, failing to contribute value to society.

> **Controversies of Social Mobility**
> 
> Social mobility is a difficult statistic to track, and various interpretations of data result in contradictory conclusions.
> 
> The social mobility statistics that Taleb cites are from Cornell’s Dr. Thomas Hirschl, who concludes that high rates of income mobility in the United States make the nation far less segregated by class than it initially appears. “54% of Americans will experience poverty or near-poverty at least once between the ages of 25 and 60,” indicating that hardship isn’t limited to a single downtrodden group.
> 
> On the other hand, the Brookings Institution has concluded that growth in inequality is putting an abrupt halt to social mobility. By comparing individuals’ income to their parents’, these researchers have determined that children born in the bottom 20% of income are ten times more likely to stay in the bottom 20% than to rise to the top 20%. Similarly, children born in the top quintile are five times more likely to stay in the top quintile than drop to the lowest. Being born into a wealthy family appears to have a sizable impact on a child’s future opportunity. This statistic lies somewhere in between Taleb’s categories of “Static” and “Dynamic”—it tracks income across generations, but still only measures individuals at one static point in their life.

### The Free Market Increases Dynamic Equality

Taleb argues that the way to reduce dynamic inequality is to force those with wealth to _risk it_ in order to avoid losing it.**** In short, to put their skin in the game. For the most part, the free market does this automatically.

Free markets are “Winner-takes-all” in regards to wealth. If a company can offer a significantly higher quality product than its competitors, it receives a dominant market share. For example, when DVDs were invented, VHSs soon became completely extinct. A winning company could stop being a winner at any time, meaning that those collecting its profits are always at risk. The company continues earning only as long as it’s generating more value for society than its competitors.

> As elaborated in this article written by Taleb in 2020, the exception to this rule __(that the free market puts companies’ skin in the game automatically) is when governments bail out businesses that are “too big to fail”—for example, banks in 2008 after the financial crisis and airlines in 2020 after the Covid-19 pandemic. He argues that if these corporations are truly so vital that their failure would be disastrous, they should be treated as publicly funded utilities. Otherwise, as things stand, bankers and airline shareholders/managers are able to earn profits, yet the taxpayers have to pay for their losses—an immoral asymmetry. This incentivizes irresponsible behavior—these companies should have prepared for disastrous eventualities like this (even if they couldn’t predict them). Bailouts disincentivize wise contingency plans.

### Why the Upper Class Pushes for Static Equality

Taleb asserts that the intellectual upper class is far more invested in the fight for economic equality than the lower class they claim to be fighting for. To this point, he cites the book _The Dignity of Working Men_ by Harvard professor Michéle Lamont. In it, Lamont extensively interviews low-income workers and discovers that generally, they don’t harbor the same resentment toward the super-rich that the upper class does.

To explain why, Taleb puts forward the principle that **people generally envy those close to them,** in proximity and social class. Since salaried academics are closer in status to the über-rich, they’re more likely to compare themselves to them. They’re jealous, and deem the concentrated wealth of the richest people to be unfair.

Despite the fact that economics and other academics have no skin in the game of inequality, they assume they know what is best for the lower class and want to dictate economic policy for them. Upper-class intellectuals won’t be the ones to face the consequences if their theories harm the lower class, so Taleb argues that they shouldn’t be involved.

> **Envy or Outrage?**
> 
> What Taleb labels envy is seen as justified outrage by those who perceive the current concentration of wealth as unfair. In an op-ed for the New York Times, Arthur C. Brooks mourns the shifting American perception of opportunity—in 2007, surveys showed that 70% of Americans were “satisfied” with their opportunities to succeed through hard work, but just seven years later in 2014, only 54% said the same. To Brooks, this loss of faith in the system is the problem—those surveyed who professed such a skepticism were five times less likely to report being “very happy” about their lives.
> 
> Responses to this article strongly protested Brooks’ categorization of their resentment as “envy.” Those who saw today’s society as truly oppressive toward hard workers felt that their anger was justified—in their eyes, being satisfied with the current state of affairs would mean turning a blind eye to those being taken advantage of.
> 
> To Taleb’s credit, two of these six letters to the editor were written by university social science professors—the exact group of intellectuals that he argues are far more outraged than the truly impoverished, despite having no direct experience with modern poverty. On the other hand, according to statistics in Brooks’s original op-ed, 43% of Americans hold the opinion that the government should do “a lot” to reduce economic inequality. It seems that, while academics and intellectuals advocate for the redistribution of wealth, the fight is by no means restricted to such a small group.
