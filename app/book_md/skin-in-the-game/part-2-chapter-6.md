## Part 2 | Chapter 6: A Lack of Skin in the Game Causes Systemic Decay

We’ve explored the different ways in which skin in the game helps create a better world: It gets people to form productive organizations, provides economic rewards for those who create value, allows passionate people to change the world, and acts as the definition of virtuous, socially constructive behavior.

Now, let’s explore the other side: We’re going to discuss defective institutions and areas of life in which a lack of skin in the game creates fatal flaws. Before we dive into specifics, however, we have to explain the process by which this occurs. **Taleb argues that skin in the game is a necessary component of human progress, and that those who deny the need for skin in the game create systems that are doomed to fail**.

First, we’ll define the “Lindy effect,” a principle that explains how systems with skin in the game self-correct and improve as time goes on. Then, we'll take a closer look at the ideology that directly opposes skin in the game, which Taleb refers to as “Intellectualism.” Finally, we’ll show why, in the absence of the Lindy effect, false appearances slowly tear apart systems without skin in the game.

### Skin in the Game and the Lindy Effect

Skin in the game makes the world better by allowing only the most effective ideas, inventions, and institutions to survive. This process is called the “Lindy effect.”

#### Defining the Lindy Effect

Named after a deli in which actors are said to have casually invented the idea, the Lindy effect states that a nonperishable thing’s longevity is roughly equal to its current age. In other words, **truly effective ideas, inventions, and institutions become less likely to die as time goes on.**

As Taleb puts it, if something is “Lindy,” it “ages in reverse.” As conceptual, nonperishable things like stories, companies, and religions age, they fall into two categories: they either get weaker or _stronger_. If a concept is fundamentally flawed, as time passes it is more likely to fail. Think of all the movies that succeed with huge box office numbers at release, but as years pass, no one watches them anymore.

On the other hand, if a concept is useful and/or effective, as time passes, the less likely it is to fail. Think of old classic movies like _The Wizard of Oz_ and _It’s a Wonderful Life_ that are still regularly watched today. As time goes by, the fact that people still value these movies attests to their lasting quality. Their old age actually makes them more likely to survive for even longer. This is the Lindy effect.

> **_Antifragile_ on the Lindy Effect**
> 
> Taleb first discusses the Lindy effect by name in _Antifragile_ , where he includes several details about the rule that didn’t make it into this book.
> 
> Taleb is generally skeptical about the impact future technology will have on the human race. He asserts that people who try to predict the future assume that much more is going to change than actually does, overestimating the impact of new technology. It’s counterintuitive, but according to the Lindy effect, the newer a technology is, the less likely it is to be truly impactful. Although many new technologies end up changing the world, we ignore the countless new technologies that failed and faded from the public consciousness—a manifestation of the survivorship bias.
> 
> People often argue that if you value old ideas, you’re adopting an old or outdated mindset. People who hang on to traditional ideas are sometimes said to be “stuck in the past.” Taleb claims that this is an unfounded criticism. The Lindy effect shows that ideas age in reverse—they get stronger over time.

The Lindy effect functions through skin in the game. When people with skin in the game make efforts to minimize risk and loss, they eliminate whatever is ineffective. But if people are shielded from the consequences of their actions, ineffective or harmful ideas are indistinguishable from beneficial ideas.

Taleb states that the test of time in conjunction with skin in the game is the only inerrant judge of quality. **Given enough time and skin in the game, everything effective will survive and everything ineffective will die out.** This is the mechanism behind humanity’s advancement. (We’ll expand on this in the next section.)

### Intellectualism Opposes Skin in the Game

It takes a long time for the Lindy effect to make things better, and it’s difficult to observe in action. On the other hand, it’s easy to see successful people working to make things better—leaders, entrepreneurs, inventors. Consequently, **many people over-attribute human progress to skilled, gifted individuals instead of the systems that filter out failure and reward success.** This is the foundation of the philosophy of _Intellectualism_.

**“Intellectualism,” in the sense Taleb uses here, is the school of thought stating that rational humans have the capacity to replace skin in the game as judges and reliably distinguish good from bad**. Consequently, intellectualists believe that systems should be designed by a select few instead of being allowed to evolve over time. Intellectualism overestimates the reliability of human intellect and underestimates the world’s complexity and unpredictability.

Intellectualists fail to see the Lindy effect at work and rarely acknowledge its existence. As a result, Taleb insists that institutions based on the Intellectualist ideology are destined to fail.

> Intellectualism is associated with top-down decision-making—for example, centralized urban planning. As outlined in _Antifragile,_ Taleb vastly prefers bottom-up decision-making—individuals deciding where and why to construct their own buildings.
> 
> Bottom-up decision making works because it involves skin in the game. If the people don’t like something—for example, the layout of an apartment building—it’s reflected in the supply and demand, and the design disappears. As a result, bottom-up planning involves the constant micro-destruction necessary for the Lindy effect to operate.
> 
> Top-down decision-making, on the other hand, is protected from destruction. Taleb claims that the 2005 French riots were caused in part by the unnatural, alienating design of the housing projects designated for those in poverty. Top-down decisions are not easily revoked, resulting in mass permanent dissatisfaction.

#### Skinless Intellectuals

In the book, Taleb paints a specific portrait of a subsection of his opponents, the epitome of the Intellectualism movement he loathes so much—who we’ll call “Skinless Intellectuals.” Skinless Intellectuals, or the “Intellectual, Yet Idiot,” as Taleb labels them, create flawed systems because they’re averse to risk, and they’re educated, yet ignorant.

##### Skinless Intellectuals Are Risk-Averse

The defining characteristic of Skinless Intellectuals is an aversion to skin in the game. Skinless Intellectuals will never take risks if they can help it.

To illustrate, Taleb writes that the Skinless Intellectual “studies grammar before speaking a language.” This sums up the character nicely. Skinless Intellectuals want to avoid the uncomfortable experience of speaking a language poorly. They would much rather spend their time and energy studying rules of grammar in a safe environment free of consequences. This is a far less effective way to learn a language than to go out and risk embarrassment talking to native speakers. However, Skinless Intellectuals fail to acknowledge this.

**This is because the concept of skin in the game is totally foreign to a Skinless Intellectual.** They would never think to dissect a situation in terms of risk, and as a result, they fundamentally misunderstand many aspects of life.

> **Risk Aversion as Habit Trigger**
> 
> Risk aversion and fear are some of the greatest obstacles in our lives, but they also offer a hidden gift. In his book _The Art of Impossible: A Peak Performance Primer, _Steven Kotler argues that many of the world’s top performers have trained themselves to instinctively move toward discomfort instead of away from it—what he calls the “habit of ferocity.”
> 
> To illustrate, Kotler recounts the story of a track coach who trained his runners to snap into perfect form whenever they began running uphill. At times when other competitors would react to discomfort by getting sloppy with their form, bodies instinctively trying to conserve energy, the track team would _speed up—_ an antifragile mindset, one might say. According to Kotler, once this became a habit, the team would eventually lean into discomfort without even realizing it.
> 
> Kotler argues that peak performers apply this habit to every aspect of life. Discomfort becomes a compass pointing to success.

##### Skinless Intellectuals Are Educated yet Ignorant

Skinless Intellectuals earn degrees from prestigious universities without ever needing to verify their knowledge in real life, then get jobs that similarly fail to require skin in the game. These are jobs that involve theorizing and giving advice, with no penalty inflicted if their theories and advice are wrong—Taleb lists journalists, consultants, and university faculty members.

Skinless Intellectuals assume that they know more than they actually do. Without direct consequences for their misunderstandings, Skinless Intellectuals never have any reason to question their actions and beliefs. For this reason, Taleb asserts that Skinless Intellectuals make worse decisions than the average laborer.

**As firm believers in the potential of human rationality, Skinless Intellectuals create systems in which educated decision-makers are able to exert influence and in which accountability is a lesser concern.** Since they fail to factor in skin in the game, they see distant educated decision-makers as more effective than less educated decision-makers who are directly involved with the consequences of the decisions made.

> **The Curse of Learning**
> 
> According to Taleb, Skinless Intellectuals suffer from what he calls the “curse of learning,” as described in _The Black Swan_. Because the world is so complex, even the most experienced experts are often unable to accurately learn from it—yet because of their education, they vastly overestimate their own understanding, resulting in bigger mistakes than individuals with less education would make.
> 
> The book _Superforecasting _documents this same phenomenon _._ Researchers found that the vast majority of experts are no better at predicting significant world events than someone randomly guessing. Additionally, despite being wrong as often as anyone else, experts were far more likely to make extreme predictions within their field—they frequently declared events either impossible or 100% certain to occur.
> 
> Experts’ blindness of their own inadequacies supports Taleb’s argument against Intellectualism. When experts are so frequently and extremely mistaken, systems need to be built around skin in the game so that errors can be corrected.

### Without Skin in the Game, False Appearances Cause Systemic Collapse

Skinless Intellectuals and their followers aren’t mistaken in believing that systems can be improved by intelligent and experienced decision-makers. However, in the absence of skin in the game, this reliance on human judgment is exactly what causes systems to collapse.

We’re going to discuss two principles that explain why this is:

  * Principle #1: Without skin in the game, appearances matter more than reality.
  * Principle #2: Appearances often contradict reality.



#### Principle #1: Without Skin in the Game, Appearances Matter More Than Reality

In systems that incorporate skin in the game, it’s obvious what works and what doesn’t. Your start-up company either succeeds and earns you a profit, or it fails, forcing you to shut down.

Without skin in the game, however, third-party judges and administrators are forced to conduct reviews and decide what is effective. If you’re one of many in the marketing department of a massive corporation, your manager has to judge how much value you individually are creating.

**By definition, human judges mean that how you are perceived becomes the determining factor of your success.** In the right setting, if you never get any work done, but always _seem_ to be doing work, you could earn a promotion.

> **Poor Judges of Each Other**
> 
> Malcolm Gladwell’s 2019 book Talking to Strangers is all about the human inability to see through appearances. People vastly overestimate their ability to read the intentions and emotions of others.
> 
> Gladwell cites the example of Amanda Knox to illustrate this point. Knox was a 20-year-old American exchange student convicted of murdering her roommate in Perugia, Italy. Despite the fact that Knox lacked motive or any physical evidence tying her to the crime, she was imprisoned for four years and wasn’t wholly exonerated for another four. Knox was convicted simply because she _seemed_ guilty—she never appeared to grieve for her roommate’s death, instead joking around and cuddling with her boyfriend.
> 
> Human judges are notoriously unreliable, making appearance-based performance reviews similarly unreliable, in Taleb’s eyes.

#### Principle #2: Appearances Often Contradict Realty

Taleb argues the idea that “things are not always what they seem” to the extreme: **appearances often convey the exact opposite of the truth.**

For example, business plans and scientific proposals that cleanly explain why you can expect success are more likely to fail. The point of plans and proposals is to create the appearance of competence, typically with the hope of selling the business or securing funding. Counterintuitively, this indicates less personal investment in the project itself.

The best businesses and scientists embrace the fact that it’s impossible to predict everything from the outset, instead hedging their bets and organically growing and adapting as circumstances change. The less you understand why something is successful, the more reliable it probably is.

(Shortform note: While Taleb insists that all business plans are good for is maintaining the false appearance of certain success, many entrepreneurs find them to be valuable tools to clarify their thinking about their business. Author and entrepreneur Ash Maurya is known for creating the Lean Canvas, adapted from the Business Model Canvas to better enhance internal perspective and adapt to changing circumstances. The Lean Canvas fits on one page, limiting the entrepreneur’s ability to over-plan—a minimalist approach Taleb would appreciate.)

Similarly, successful professionals who seem extraordinarily confident, intellectual, or put-together, in many cases, are at times only successful because of their ability to manipulate their image. They’re better at cultivating the appearance of expertise than true expertise.

This principle also works in reverse: **successful people who _don’t_ appear successful are usually the most skilled.** A professional who succeeds without “looking the part” has to overcome the negative impressions he gives to others—making it more likely that he’s highly competent.

Imagine a pimply teen who looks like he’s never set foot outside who earned $300,000 within a year of starting his own company. His soaring profits are even more indicative of his skill considering that he was likely underestimated by everyone he did business with.

(Shortform note: Studies have shown that attractive people have been given more advantages than you would expect. Employers are willing to pay 10% more to attractive employees, attractive politicians are more likely to be elected, and attractive teachers cause their students to better retain information. Attractive CEOs not only get paid more, they win more negotiations, and result in greater stock prices—when they’re hired and even when they appear on TV. However, this doesn’t always mean that attractive people are less skilled, as Taleb argues. The preferential treatment given to attractive people as they grow, as well as the accompanying boost in confidence, result in a very real boost in skills and achievement.)

#### False Appearances Cause Collapse

Due to false appearances, human judges are unavoidably fallible—**thus, It’s the system’s ability to eliminate ineffective judges that drives progress**. This is only attained through skin in the game.

Decision-makers who have something to lose for poor judgments either learn from their mistakes or are filtered out by the system. If an entrepreneur is misled by false appearances, their business will go belly-up.

Without skin in the game, entire professions can become dominated by people whose competent-looking public image is nothing but smoke and mirrors, along with ideas that seem smart on paper but crumble when applied in the real world. This is a vicious cycle—as ineffective people and ideas fail to get filtered out, the institution’s image of what success looks like drifts further away from reality.

Eventually, these industries completely fail to recognize how to accomplish anything desirable, and the system collapses. In the next few sections of our guide, we’ll describe how this is happening in several specific industries and institutions.

> **Skin in the Game of Racial Bias**
> 
> Racial bias is an extension of Taleb’s “False Appearances” idea—human judges are tragically fallible judges of intent and character. In light of this, many argue that police officers don’t have enough skin in the game. Racial bias is something that happens internally—it’s difficult to prove in a court of law, making it difficult to easily keep officers accountable.
> 
> Taleb asserts that the sign of a healthy system is the ability to eliminate ineffective judges. The degree to which this is happening in law enforcement is a point of conflict. For decades, police unions in the United States gave officers some degree of protection against liability—for example, giving officers 48 hours before being required to offer an official statement on a controversial incident, and allowing binding arbitration to supersede the discretion of police department managers. These union laws began to undergo reform in some states following the 2020 George Floyd protests. Taleb would likely agree that third-party arbitrators with no skin in the game should not have the ability to reinstate offending officers.
> 
> There are also simpler ways to put more of the police’s skin in the game. When body cameras became required for officers in the Oakland police department in 2011, incidents requiring the use of force dropped by 66%. The number of citizen complaints fell as well, reflecting a drop in distrust of law enforcement.
