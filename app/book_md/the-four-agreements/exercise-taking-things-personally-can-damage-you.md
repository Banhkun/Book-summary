## Exercise: Taking Things Personally Can Damage You

Use these questions to reflect on the damage that taking things personally can inflict on your self-esteem.

* * *

Think about a recent time when someone’s words hurt you. What was said? Why did it hurt you?

Let’s try to overcome this feeling of being attacked and offended. How can you not take this type of comment personally? (Remember: Nothing they think about you is really about you. If someone gets upset at you, they’re dealing with their own issues. You don’t need to accept their emotional garbage.)
