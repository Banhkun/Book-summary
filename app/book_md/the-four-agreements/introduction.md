## Introduction: The Smoky Mirror

_The Four Agreements_ is based on beliefs in Mexican indigenous (Toltec) culture.

Toltec lore has it that 3,000 years ago, a human studying to be a medicine man awoke to the soul-altering realization that he was made of light and stars, and he existed in between those stars. He called the stars the **tonal** and the light between the stars the **nagual**. He realized that life is what creates the harmony between the two. Life is the force of the Creator.

**The medicine man came to some profound conclusions:**

  * Everything in existence is a manifestation of God.
  * Humans in their true form are love and light, reflecting God. This realization allowed him to see himself in everything and everyone around him.



Unfortunately, when he tried to share this knowledge with others, they didn’t understand. They agreed that _he_ was an incarnation of God, but when he tried to explain that they too were just as sacred, they didn’t believe him. They couldn’t see it.

The medicine man likened everything to a mirror. We all have the ability to see ourselves in everything else, but our human existence – termed a “dream” – clouds our vision. Picture a wall of smoke or fog between mirrors. We humans are the mirrors, but the wall of smoke stops us from seeing ourselves in everyone and everything else.

The medicine man called himself the “Smoky Mirror” to convey the idea that he could see himself in everyone else, but people don’t recognize each other because of the smoke in between them.

All this can be a bit confusing, but the point is this: **the Smoky Mirror symbolizes that we are not seeing who and what we really are**. We’re not seeing others for who they really are. We’re not seeing that, deep down, we’re all the same.

By adopting the four agreements outlined in this book, we blow away the fog and begin to see ourselves – and others – clearly and with more understanding.
