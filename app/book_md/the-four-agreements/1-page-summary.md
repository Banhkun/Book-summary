## 1-Page Summary

### The Domestication of Humans

The world is full of misery and suffering. We are hard on each other, but even harder on ourselves. Too many of us are unfulfilled, unhappy, joyless.

Why?

The framework of our world has been handed down to us. We were trained just like dogs. We learned how to behave, what is acceptable and not, what to believe, what’s right and wrong. None of this was taught to us by our choice. We learned a language that was not our choice. We didn’t even choose our own names. This process is called “the domestication of humans.”

We then use this belief system (that we never chose) to criticize ourselves and others. No wonder we feel powerlessly unhappy at times!

### Old Agreements

Everything we accept as “the way it is” is an **agreement.** But too many of these agreements hurt ourselves and others. For example, think of the teenager who starves herself to fit in. Think of someone who stays in an unhappy relationship because it’s all they know.

If we want a life of joy, **we must break these harmful agreements that promote suffering and failure.** But how? We feel powerless because creating and keeping all these negative agreements has sucked our personal power.

The answer is that we must **change the agreements**.

### The Four Agreements

There are four powerful agreements that will bring back our personal power and help us break the dangerous cycle we’re in. It won’t be easy, and we’ll need a strong will to make these new agreements, but when we succeed we will transform our lives.

**The First Agreement: Be Impeccable With Your Word**

Words have the power to create and the power to destroy. When you are “impeccable with your word,” you:

  * Say only what you mean
  * Speak with integrity
  * Stop your internal negative self-talk (“I am stupid.”)
  * Refrain from gossiping



Following this agreement helps you become happy and at peace. As you become impeccable with your word, love replaces fear. You diminish the number of conflicts in your life.

**The Second Agreement: Don’t Take Anything Personally**

When someone gives you negative input, it speaks more about the other person, not about you. In fact, whether it’s good or bad, just don’t accept others’ judgment of you (or even your own judgment).

  * Nothing they think about you is really about you.
  * Others see the world with different eyes. 
  * Everyone’s truth is their own. 
  * If someone gets mad at you, they’re dealing with their own issues. 



When we’re immune to the careless comments and actions of others, our hearts can open up, allowing us to be vulnerable and open to love.

**The Third Agreement: Don’t Make Assumptions**

We make assumptions and believe they’re true. But making assumptions inevitably leads to problems. Assumptions cause misunderstandings between people. We then argue, get offended, and take the issue personally. Cue the drama.

So how do you stop making assumptions and jumping to conclusions?

  * **Be** **aware** of your tendency to make assumptions. We can’t change what we’re not aware of!
  * **Ask questions.** Have the courage to seek the truth, even if the truth is painful.
  * **Communicate.** You won’t have to make assumptions if everyone is on the same page.
  * **Take action**. Forge a new habit of NOT assuming, but rather seeking the truth. Do this over and over, establishing a solid foundation for this new habit.



When we stop making assumptions, we stop overanalyzing situations and we start understanding the truth. And once we know the truth, we can make better decisions.

**The Fourth Agreement: Always Do Your Best**

This final agreement will allow the other three to become more deeply ingrained and effective. After all, the first three agreements can truly work _only_ if you do your best, day in and day out.

But it’s important to know that your best can change from moment to moment. Your best when you’re tired or sick will be different from your best when you’re healthy. That’s OK.

How do you do your best? Some tips:

  * Let go of the past. Don’t judge your past behavior. What’s important is what you do from this point forward. 
  * Learn to say NO when you want and YES when you want. You’ll stop yourself from taking on things you don’t want to do, and you’ll spend your time doing your best at things that uplift you.
  * Keep trying if you fall short on following the Four Agreements. Do your best in the moment. Don’t judge yourself for past shortcomings.
  * Keep your attention on today. Stay in the present moment. Do your best one moment at a time.



### Freeing Ourselves From the Old Agreements and Creating a New, Happy Life

The Four Agreements gives us a new, positive blueprint by which to live our lives. But we still have to break away from the harmful old agreements to gain freedom.

There are three ways to do this:

  * Face your fears.
  * Gain control over your emotions; learn to forgive.
  * Remember that each day may be your last; live each day to the fullest.



When we follow the Four Agreements, we have the tools to create our own version of “heaven” in our lives, using imagination and a new set of eyes to visualize a happy life.

When we do so, we gain the following:

  * No fear of being judged; no judging others
  * No fear of being rejected, keeping an open heart
  * No fear of taking risks
  * Ability to enjoy life
  * No more fog and confusion
  * Awareness that love is all around you
