## Chapter 6: Breaking Old Agreements

Now we have a blueprint for how to live our lives in a better way. We know the new Four Agreements that will save us from living empty lives. We know how to transform our lives into a new experience of joy, happiness and love.

Except we still have all those old agreements lingering around. We have to fight through and discard them. How can we dismantle these old agreements that have created needless suffering in our lives? **How do we free ourselves from the old agreements?**

There are three ways to break with our old, bad agreements:

  1. Face your fears one by one. 
  2. Forgive those who have hurt us. (“Starve the parasite.”)
  3. Live every day as if it were your last. (“Initiation of the dead.”)



**1\. Facing Your Fears Takes Awareness**

First, you have to be **aware** of the agreements you must fix.

  * **Develop an _awareness_ **of all the self-limiting, fear-based beliefs that are holding you back. Examples:
    * What things do you tell yourself that make you feel down?
    * What do you assume about yourself that might be wrong and that you should test?
    * What are assumptions you have about other people that you should clarify?



Once we have this awareness, we can then **focus our attention on _what_ we want to change**.

For example, remember the little girl who stopped singing when her mother snapped at her? How does she break that agreement? She can try to sing, even if it starts out badly. She can gain power back little by little.

But for every agreement you break, you have to replace it with a new one that makes you **happy**. The little girl might replace “if I sing, other people will get mad” with “I love singing and it makes me happy.”

This isn’t easy. There are a lot of old agreements to break and replace. But go step by step; don’t get discouraged.

**2\. “Starving the Parasite” by Forgiving Others for the Past**

The Toltecs liken the old, bad agreements to a “parasitic” organism in control of our minds and thoughts. To get rid of the parasite, we have to starve it by not giving it attention. We have to stop dwelling on the old wounds in our minds so that we can heal.

The key to “starving the parasite” is **forgiveness**. We must forgive those who have wronged us. This is actually for our benefit – when we resent others, we’re the ones paying for the injustice. We feel the resentment and the anger.

Because we love ourselves, we must forgive _whoever_ we perceive as having hurt us – God, others and ourselves.

You know **you’ve successfully forgiven someone when seeing them no longer brings up an emotional reaction.** You know you are no longer the victim. The old wound doesn’t hurt anymore.

Controlling our emotions is also an important part of forgiveness. When we lose control of our emotions, we say things we don’t want to say and do things we don’t want to do. **When we learn to control our emotions, we gain personal power** , making it easier to forgive those who have hurt us. We have more power to c _hange our fear-based agreements_.

**3\. “Initiation of the Dead” Means Living Each Day Like It’s Your Last**

The Toltecs referred to this final step as the “initiation of the dead,” representing the symbolic death of the parasite within. But it’s easier to think about it this way: **_Be aware that we can die at any time_**. When you treat every day like it’s your last, you have a clearer vision of how you want to live today. You don’t want to waste time fretting over past injustices and worrying what others think of you. You want to live a free, happy life.

Keep these things in mind when you vow to live each day like it’s your last:

  * Use every moment to be happy.
  * Don’t be afraid of what others think.
  * Be yourself.
  * Be open.
  * Treat others with love.
  * Live in the present.



Surviving the Initiation of the Dead leads to a kind of resurrection – being alive again, like a child. Only this time our freedom is colored by wisdom, not innocence. **We are free adults who can live life on our own terms.**

When you use these three paths to break free from your old agreements, you are free to create a dream of the future without carrying the burdens of the past.
