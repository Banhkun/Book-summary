## Exercise: Reflect on the Idea of Doing Your Best

Use this exercise to examine why you sometimes don’t give your best effort.

* * *

Think of the last time you know you didn’t do your best. What were you trying to do, and where did you fall short?

How did you feel about yourself when you know you didn’t do your best? Did this feeling cause any other problems?

Why didn’t you do your best? Part of it may be internal, part of it may be external.

Next time you run into a situation like this, what could you do differently to try to do your best? (These might be changes you make to your situation, or internal thoughts you say to yourself.)
