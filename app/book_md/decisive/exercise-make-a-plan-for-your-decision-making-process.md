## Exercise: Make a Plan for Your Decision-Making Process

The remaining steps of the Heath brothers’ decision-making process (assessing options, choosing one, and preparing for its outcomes) are steps that may take time and involve others. To set you up for success on these steps, let’s plan which strategies you’ll use for each step.

* * *

Look over the three to four options you developed in the first exercise. Which option(s) do you prefer, and why do you prefer those options?

Now, make a plan for how you’ll resist your confirmation bias as you further assess those options. Select at least one strategy that you’ll use to resist your confirmation bias toward your “favorite” option: Seek out an opposing viewpoint, seek out objective information, and/or conduct a trial run. Describe how you’ll carry it out. (For example, if you’re leaning towards adopting a dog, seek out an opposing viewpoint by asking a dog-owning friend to share downsides of owning a dog.)

Next, identify your current emotions. What feelings come up for you as you think about this decision? (For example: “hesitant,” and/or “excited.”) Why do you think you feel this way?

Make a plan for how you’ll put those emotions into perspective when it’s time to make the final decision. Will you imagine what a friend or colleague would do, try the 10/10/10 test, and/or make a stop-doing list? Describe how you’ll implement this strategy. (For example, you could use the 10/10/10 strategy to imagine how you’ll feel about adopting a dog in the future.)

Finally, make a plan for how you’ll prepare for the decision’s outcome. Will you prepare for its best-case and worst-case scenarios, build safety factors into your predictive calculations, and/or create an alert? Describe specifically how you’ll carry out the strategy. (For example, if you decide to foster a dog before adopting it, you could create an alert by listing and watching out for warning signs that the dog isn’t a good fit.)
