## Chapter 2: The Failures of the Articles of Confederation (Essays 15-22)

In the last chapter, we made the case for the preservation of the Union, illustrating why it was crucial for the security, liberty, and prosperity of the American people.

In this chapter, we will analyze why **maintaining the Articles of Confederation was totally at odds with the goal of preserving that Union.** To do this, we will need to explore the specific weaknesses of the Articles and why Publius believed it was necessary to scrap them entirely and replace them with the new United States Constitution.

### The General Weakness of Confederacies

**A confederacy is an association of independent states or political communities. They are an inherently unstable and weak form of government.** Under a confederacy, the overarching state tends to lack the proper authority to perform important central functions like raising an army, administering justice, collecting revenue, or regulating coinage, because its constituent members are too powerful and can block any initiative.

The weak central government is only held together because the constituent states are _also_ too weak to exist on their own as independent nations. This leaves the entire confederacy vulnerable to civil war and outside invasion.

This is precisely what plagued 18th-century confederacies like the Holy Roman Empire (consisting of large parts of what is now Germany). A ramshackle polity made up of competing and disunited principalities, duchies, and baronies, the Holy Roman Empire was a scene of constant warfare and strife, largely because of its flawed constitutional design.

Opponents of a strong federal government often made the argument that it would trample upon the rights of state and local governments. But Publius made the opposite case—that **the _states_ were more likely to infringe upon the _federal_ government, not the other way around. **This was because the people would naturally feel more closely connected and loyal to their state governments, owing to their physical proximity and shared history and experiences—just as an individual is more connected to her family than she is to her community at large. In any conflict between a state and the federal government, the state was likely to have the majority on its side.

Historically, the only way that confederacies have overcome this tendency to split apart is when local governments become so oppressive to the people that the latter unite with the higher central authority to overthrow them.

During the Age of Feudalism in Europe’s Middle Ages, the local aristocracy was frequently more powerful than the monarch and, therefore, had greater ability to exploit the peasantry. Successful monarchs were only able to break the backs of the nobility by tapping into this rich source of discontent and allying with the peasants.

#### The Experience of the Greek Confederacies

Unfortunately for Americans living under the Articles of Confederation, **the historical evidence showed that confederacies were likely to result in dissolution and chaos.**

The city-states of ancient Greece often banded together in leagues, usually to protect themselves against foreign threats. Two such leagues were the Amphictyonic League and the Achaean League. Although the city-states in these leagues had nominally equal status, the larger and more powerful ones like Athens inevitably came to occupy a dominant position within the confederation.

Because of their independence, the cities had few interests in common and proved unwilling to come to one another’s defense or contribute funds for the common good. Foreign powers like Macedon, Persia, and Rome exploited these divisions, resulting in conquest, annexation, and the destruction of ancient Greek liberty.

These disastrous results were a direct result of the weak central structure of the leagues, which delegated too much power to the individual cities and gave the league itself no enforcement mechanisms to bring recalcitrant members to heel. Publius warned that the same fate could befall the United States if the Articles of Confederation weren’t scrapped and replaced with a stronger framework for national government.

### An Assembly of States

The principal weakness of the Articles was one rooted in these general weaknesses that afflict _all_ confederacies—**the central government could act upon the _states_ of which it was composed, but not upon the actual _people_ of those states**. The states, not the people, were the fundamental political units.

This is an important distinction. It meant that the federal government, acting through Congress, could pass legislation requiring the states to furnish money or manpower to meet some emergency. But it was left entirely to the states to actually marshall those resources from their citizens.

This effectively gave each state total discretion as to whether or not they would comply. In this sense, the Articles created something more akin to a league or assembly of independent states acting together on a voluntary basis than an actual unified polity. Under the Articles, the only way a state could have been compelled to action would have been for the other states to agree to raise an army and make war on it. Thus, the loose structure of the Articles was a recipe for civil war, chaos, and the ultimate destruction of the Union.

#### Laws for People, Not for States

The only solution to this state of affairs was to adopt **a new constitutional framework that would allow the federal government to enact laws that directly affected the _people,_ not the states**. That federal government also needed to have sufficient powers of enforcement.

Even if a state did choose to disregard federal authority under such a constitutional framework, there would be universal agreement that its actions were blatantly and undeniably illegal. The federal government would be better able to marshall the resources and manpower to put down such a rebellion, with many citizens of the rebellious state eagerly assisting in the suppression of such a clearly unconstitutional move by their state government.

Because the federal government would have the power to act directly on them, the people would feel a closer attachment to such a government than they did to that of the Articles. Citizens would be more apt to recognize that _their_ rights were being violated by a rebellious state.

### Lack of Enforcement, Lack of Revenue

**The Articles gave the federal government some formal powers over the states, but no effective means of compelling them to action.** This rendered the federal government effectively toothless.

Revenue collection presented an especially glaring enforcement problem. The system established revenue quotas that each state was required to send to the federal government. But, given the lack of an agreed-upon standard for assessing and apportioning what each state owed and the inability of the federal government to enforce its quotas, the states frequently evaded their fiscal responsibilities. They often cited the arbitrary and unequal distribution of the fiscal burden as a pretext for withholding what they owed.

**This had disastrous consequences during an episode known as Shays’ Rebellion, which rocked the state of Massachusetts in 1786-87**. Economically discontented farmers in the western part of the state staged a violent action against the government, even seizing and burning down a state armory. But because of its inadequate revenue system, the federal government was unable to pay troops to put down the rebellion. Instead, the state of Massachusetts had to hire a private force to quell it.

The rebellion showed that the glaring defects of the Articles of Confederation could have disastrous real-world consequences.

### Equal Representation, Unequal Outcomes

**Another defect of the Articles of Confederation was that they gave equal representation to the 13 states in Congress, regardless of population.** While this was intended to protect the smaller states, it paradoxically led to the tyranny and domineering influence of the smaller states.

States representing a small minority of the overall population of the country had effective veto power over national legislation. This was rendered worse by the fact that any legislation required the consent of a supermajority of nine states. Having a minority exert its will over the majority was inimical to the republican values for which the Revolution had been waged.

Further, there were no provisions governing the population requirements of the _future_ states that were certain to be carved out of the western territories. This uncertainty only threatened to make the situation worse.

Maintaining such a system would be counterproductive for the small states in the long run, as the large states wouldn’t long consent to being part of a system that so constrained their political power. After the large states left the Union, the smaller states wouldn’t be viable as political entities on their own—ironically, their disproportionate power was creating the conditions that made such a dissolution more likely.

All of this meant that**the nation was unable to act as a unified state in key policy matters, constantly subject to the demands and whims of a vocal minority.** This was a major flaw that highlighted the danger of treating states—not people—as the main political unit.

#### Interference With Treaties

On a final note, **the equal sovereignty of the states also made it impossible for the United States to conduct foreign policy.** After all, there was no reason for foreign powers like Great Britain or France to enter into treaties with and thereby make concessions to the US when the individual states had the power to abrogate or undermine such treaties.

These countries knew that they could always secure more favorable terms by playing the states against one another. This inability to speak with one voice and act as one nation rendered early American diplomacy largely useless.
