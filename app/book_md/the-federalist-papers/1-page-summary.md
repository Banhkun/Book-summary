## 1-Page Summary

**The purpose of _The Federalist Papers_ was to make the general case for a stronger national government and urge the ratification of the Constitution** drafted during the Constitutional Convention held at Philadelphia in 1787. The 85 essays that comprise _The Federalist Papers_ were published in New York City newspapers in a piecemeal fashion between October 1787 and April 1788, while the ratification debate over the new Constitution was taking place in the 13 states. They were written with the specific purpose of building public support for the state of New York to ratify the plan of government.

(Shortform note: Historians are unclear as to what impact _The Federalist Papers_ had on the ratification of the Constitution. New York’s constitutional convention _did_ vote to ratify, but it was the 11th state to do so—the Constitution had only needed the approval of nine states to become law, thus making New York’s vote largely symbolic. Moreover, New York’s convention only approved the Constitution by a razor-thin 30-27 margin, indicating that _The Federalist Papers_ failed to significantly move public opinion at the time, even in the state where they were most heavily published. Outside of New York, they were hardly published at all, further calling into question their effect. Nevertheless, they stand as an important analysis of the merits of the Constitution and are widely regarded as essential reading for those interested in the history of American governance.)

We’ll take a thematic approach to _The Federalist Papers_ , exploring:

  * Why the preservation of the American Union was so vitally important for the liberty, prosperity, and security of the states within it—and for the people themselves;
  * How the integrity of the Union was threatened by the highly decentralized and ineffective Articles of Confederation;
  * The general principles of the new Constitution drafted at Philadelphia, why it promised to be such a vast improvement over the Articles of Confederation, and how its reallocation of power between the federal government and the states would boost the prosperity, liberty, and safety of both;
  * The structure of the new Constitution, with particular emphasis on the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government and how the new framework established a careful system of checks and balances between these branches; and
  * The objections raised against the Constitution by critics and opponents, including its shift of power toward the federal government and away from the states, its powers of taxation, and its lack of a Bill of Rights.



### The Case for the Union

The ratification of the Constitution was essential to the preservation of the Union. This was important, because **the prosperity and freedom of the American people depended upon the continuance of the Union.** The country had _always_ been linked by a generally shared political and cultural connection to a common British heritage, similar political institutions between the colonies, and a high degree of economic interdependence (aided by North America’s navigable rivers, which boosted commerce).

Unfortunately, the Articles of Confederation, the plan of government in place at the time of the ratification debate, had proven utterly disastrous for the Union. The Articles of Confederation created a highly decentralized structure and weak central government that rendered the nation powerless to act in the face of both internal and external threats. Unless they were scrapped entirely, the Union threatened to break apart.

If the Union dissolved, it would be replaced by petty, rival confederacies, each vying against one another for the vast resources of the North American continent. Inevitably, this would lead to a state of permanent warfare—which, in turn, would lead to the creation of permanent standing armies in each state, something that Americans feared would be destructive of the liberties they held so dear. Dissolution, in short, would represent the death of the young nation and the failure of the republican experiment. To forestall this possibility, the only option was to ratify the Constitution and create a stronger, more durable Union.

#### National Security and the Prevention of War

**A Union, bound together by a strong national government, would be far less likely to start external wars with its neighbors than would a series of small states or confederations of states.** This was because smaller confederations would each be pursuing their own interests and independent policies. Unconstrained by the steadying hand of a unifying federal government, they would be free to act aggressively toward other nations, provoking more wars.

The danger went the _other_ way as well—**foreign powers would be more easily able to exploit weak confederations that were not supported by a strong federal government**. Such confederations would lack the financial resources to levy armies and navies to prevent or turn back the aggressive actions of other countries. Moreover, states or confederations would have little reason to aid their neighbors in a war against a foreign power, because they would barely be part of the same political nation. **Thus, unity was crucial to national defense, prosperity, and the protection of liberty**.

#### Against Factions

**A** **large and strong Union, comprising all the states, was the best remedy against the dangers of factionalism**. A faction is any group of citizens, whether they constitute a majority or a minority, who seek to advance their interests and passions without regard to the rights and interests of others.

In a republic, decisions are made by _representatives_ meeting in a designated capital, not by the people themselves in person. **Therefore, popular passions are filtered through and tempered by more sober-minded representatives, making it harder for any single faction to achieve dominant status.**

A large and populous country like the United States would be safer from tyrannical factions within the Union than it would be if it were split into a number of petty confederacies. Even if a faction seized control in one of the states, the largeness of the Union would make it difficult for it to extend that domination over the _other_ states, let alone _all_ of them. The size of the political community itself limited the spread of the political contagion.

#### The Economic Case for the Union

**Disunion would also have harmful effects on the economy.** For example, there would be no effective mechanism for paying back or apportioning the debt that the Union and the individual states had accrued during the Revolutionary War. If the states were only joined in a loose league rather than a compact union, the individual states would be extremely reluctant to contribute money to help pay the debts of _other_ states. This would have a harmful effect on the establishment of strong national credit and depress trade.

By enabling the United States to act with a unified commercial policy, the Union would give the nation greater leverage in its economic relations with other countries and enable it to secure more favorable terms of trade.

**A strong Union would also provide better and more efficient means of revenue collection than would a series of independent or semi-independent states.** Merchants would have to contend with only one customs regime, rather than 13, which would stimulate trade. This stimulation of trade would further enhance revenue for the federal government.

### The Failures of the Articles of Confederation

The preservation of the Union was crucial for the security, liberty, and prosperity of the American people. But **maintaining the Articles of Confederation was totally at odds with the goal of preserving that Union.**

As a confederacy, the Articles of Confederation created an association of independent states. It was an inherently unstable and weak form of government. The central government lacked the strength to perform important functions like raising an army, administering justice, collecting revenue, or regulating coinage, because the individual states were too powerful and could block any initiative.

#### An Assembly of States

The principal weakness of the Articles was one rooted in these general weaknesses that afflict _all_ confederacies—**the central government could act upon the _states_ of which it was composed, but not upon the actual _people_ of those states**. The states, not the people, were the fundamental political units.

This is an important distinction. It meant that the federal government, acting through Congress, could pass legislation requiring the states to furnish money or manpower to meet some emergency. But it was left entirely to the states to actually marshall those resources from their citizens. This effectively gave each state total discretion as to whether or not they would comply.

#### Equal Representation, Unequal Outcomes

**Another defect of the Articles of Confederation was that they gave equal representation to the 13 states in Congress, regardless of population.** While this was intended to protect the smaller states, it paradoxically led to the tyranny and domineering influence of the smaller states.

States representing a small minority of the overall population of the country had effective veto power over national legislation. This was rendered worse by the fact that any legislation required the consent of a supermajority of nine states. Having a minority exert its will over the majority was inimical to the republican values for which the Revolution had been waged. **The nation was unable to act as a unified state in key policy matters, constantly subject to the demands and whims of a vocal minority.**

### Powers of the New Government

Having already established the failures of the _old_ system of government, we can now pivot to an analysis of the principles of the _new_ Constitution. The new government had specific powers with regard to:

  * National defense 
  * Taxation
  * Overseeing interstate commerce



A core principle held by the Framers of the new Constitution was that it wasn’t enough to merely _grant_ powers to the federal government on paper. **The new government needed to have the authority to make laws and enforce provisions that would enable it to effectively _exert_ those powers**.

#### Standing Armies and the National Defense

**The most important purpose of any government is to secure peace and protect its people from internal and external threats.** Accordingly, the federal government under the Constitution would have the power to raise and equip a standing army—the only way the US could survive in the face of threats from European powers.

**Standing armies under the Constitution would _not_ become agents of tyranny because they could only be raised by the legislative—not the executive—branch. **Thus, the people’s representatives (the legislative branch) would retain control and prevent the creation of a permanent military establishment.

#### The Power of Direct Taxation

**The management of public finances is another core function of any government.** Under the Articles, the federal government only had a few direct revenue streams, like taxes on imported goods. This left the government unable to meet basic fiscal obligations and led to rising costs in the financing of the national debt and a collapse in public confidence. Because it acted directly on individuals, not states, the new Constitution gave the government powers of _direct_ taxation. Thus, it could directly assess taxes on land and people, without relying on the states as intermediaries.

**Giving the federal government the power of direct taxation would also be good for the broader economy.** If the federal government had to rely solely on customs duties and excise taxes (taxes paid by manufacturers and incorporated into the final price of the product paid by consumers) for its revenue, it would have to tax these items at an extraordinary rate. Giving the federal government a broad tax base would encourage modest tax rates, which would be good for both producers and consumers.

#### Interstate Commerce

The Constitution greatly simplified the economic relationships between the states by granting the federal government the sole authority to unilaterally impose tariffs and duties on imports. Thus, states could no longer (without the consent of Congress) put tariffs on imports from other states.

To further stimulate interstate commerce, **Congress was also given the sole authority to coin money and issue paper notes of legal tender** , establish post roads, set uniform standards of weights and measures, further rationalizing and harmonizing trade between the states, and create national rules for naturalization.

#### The Necessary and Proper and Supremacy Clauses

**The Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution states that Congress has the power to enact all “necessary and proper” laws to enforce the powers it is granted**. Some critics of the Constitution alleged that this language gave Congress a blank check to pass any laws it wished. But these objections were rooted in a misunderstanding of the purposes of drafting a Constitution in the first place—it would have been nonsensical to create a plan for a government and assign to it specific powers _without_ giving it the means to enforce those powers.

**The Supremacy Clause made federal law the supreme law of the land—superseding state law**(and requiring even state officials to swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution). A national government that was unable to exercise supremacy over its constituent members was not a national government at all; it was merely a voluntary treaty or association, vulnerable to dissolution by any of the parties to it.

#### The Role of the States

The new government balanced the priorities of _national_ government (a central government with the necessary authority to act directly on the people) and _federal_ government (a system in which the central government shares powers with subordinate government).

Indeed, the states would play a key role. The Senate would be elected by the state legislatures. And in assigning every state equal representation in the Senate regardless of population, the Constitution preserved a key federal feature of the old Articles of Confederation. The Electoral College, meanwhile, guaranteed that the president would not be chosen in a national election that treated the states as non-entities. The states were the elemental unit in the Electoral College, with each state receiving electoral votes equal to its combined number of representatives and senators.

Thus,**the states did not just passively accept their status under the Constitution; they would play an active role in shaping the nature of the Union itself.**

### Structure of the New Constitution

Having outlined the general principles of the new Constitution, we can now look at the structure of the federal government itself, exploring:

  * How the Constitution separated power within the federal government between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches;
  * How the system of checks and balances was designed to keep any of the branches from growing too powerful at the expense of the other branches; and 
  * The specific powers and functions of each of the branches and their constituent parts, examining how they’re elected and what their responsibilities are.



#### Separation of Powers

**All constitutional forms of government have three branches:**

  * The legislative branch, which writes the laws;
  * The executive branch, which enforces the laws; and
  * The judicial branch, which interprets the laws.



A basic principle of republicanism is that the executive, legislative, and judicial functions must remain separate. **Critics of the new Constitution argued that its provisions for the separation of powers were too weak and that the result would be a corrupt despotism.**

But instead of striving for complete separation of powers (which was an impossibility), it was far more important to imbue the Constitution with the principle of checks and balances.

**The new Constitution was well-designed with a robust system of checks and balances** to ensure that the branches remained coequal, that none reigned supreme over the others, and that each had the means to hold the others in check.

#### The House of Representatives

There are few eligibility requirements for election to the House. A member merely needs to:

  * Be age 25 or older
  * Be a resident of the state they represent
  * Have been a citizen for at least seven years prior to their election
  * Hold no other office during their tenure in the chamber



Beyond these requirements, anyone is eligible to run and serve (although the House retains the right to expel members by a two-thirds vote). Members of the House were to be directly elected to two-year terms by the voters of the state, with voters meeting the same eligibility requirements that they did for state legislative elections.

**Because apportionment in the House was to be determined by state population, the larger states would naturally hold sway.**

It was to have **sole authority to impeach members of the executive branch, including the president, for high crimes and misdemeanors—a crucial check on executive power.**

#### The Senate

The Senate is the upper chamber of the national legislature. Unlike the House, its members must be _30_ years of age and have been citizens of the United States for _nine_ years prior to their election. Thus, senators would tend to be older, more experienced, and have greater familiarity with the laws and customs of the United States than their counterparts in the House.

Senators were to serve six-year terms and be elected by the state legislatures— _not_ by the people themselves. Each state was to have two senators, regardless of population. Naturally, the Senate conferred an advantage on _smaller_ states, who received disproportional representation in the upper chamber relative to their actual number of voters.

**The Senate was designed to temper the more dangerous democratic impulses of the House.** This was because its members were fewer, they were not elected directly by the people, and their terms in office would be longer. This would prevent them from being susceptible to democratic political pressures.

(Shortform note: The system of having state legislatures elect senators had become rife with corruption by the late-19th century, with scandalous incidents of Senate seats being openly bought and sold. Moreover, the political polarization of the time had frequently resulted in state legislatures failing to come to agreement on elections to the Senate. This resulted in many Senate seats going unfilled, leaving states without representation in the upper chamber of Congress. The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1913, finally ended senatorial election by state legislatures, mandating instead that senators be directly elected by the voters of their states.)

The Senate, as the upper chamber, was designated with certain special privileges. **One of the most important of these was its sole prerogative, via a two-thirds vote, to ratify treaties negotiated and submitted to it by the President.** The Senate would also be responsible for approving all cabinet appointments submitted by the president. These were both powerful checks on the executive branch.

Another, arguably more important check on the power of the executive branch was the Senate’s sole authority to convict members of the executive (including the president) for high crimes and misdemeanors by a two-thirds vote, following impeachment in the House.

#### The Presidency

**The presidency, the chief executive of the federal government, was perhaps the most controversial and hotly contested feature of the Constitution.** The president would have the power to:

  * Veto bills passed by both houses of Congress, thus serving as an important check on legislative power;
  * Propose legislation;
  * Negotiate treaties;
  * Nominate executive officials and federal judges;
  * Make temporary appointments when Congress was not in session;
  * Adjourn Congress when it could not agree on a time of adjournment;
  * Issue pardons, except in cases of impeachment; and
  * Direct and oversee the armed forces as commander-in-chief



Anti-Federalist critics argued that these powers rendered the office tantamount to a monarch. But, in reality,**** the office’s authority was heavily restricted by the provisions of the Constitution.**** The president’s veto could be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote in each house of Congress; treaties and executive appointments required Senate approval; he could not pardon offenders who’d been impeached; and he could not declare war or raise funds for an army without Congress.

#### The Judiciary

The third branch of government, the judiciary, is unique. Unlike the executive branch, it possesses no army, navy, or other powers of enforcement to compel adherence to its decisions. Unlike the legislature, it has no direct power of the purse.

**Instead, the way that the federal courts exercise this power is through judicial review.** This is the power of the courts to declare null and void those laws or executive orders that are in violation of the Constitution. Judicial review serves as a powerful check on both the executive and legislative branches. While courts generally do not have many formal powers to enforce their rulings, Congress and the president have historically complied with court orders, even when they disagreed with them.

Given its crucial function, and judges’ comparative lack of enforcement power, **it was important that the judiciary be independent from the executive and legislative branches.** To ensure this, judges were to serve for life, provided that they maintained “good behavior” on the bench. There were good reasons for this. Judges were meant to make their rulings solely on the Constitution, not for political considerations. If they had to be renominated and re-confirmed, they might feel the need to curry favor with Congress and the president, which could exert a corrupting influence on their jurisprudence.

**The highest court in the land was to be the United States Supreme Court.** In the main, the Supreme Court acted as an _appellate_ court—issuing final rulings (for those cases it chose to hear) on cases that had worked their way through the inferior federal courts. The only cases where the Supreme Court would have _original_ jurisdiction would be cases involving ambassadors or cases in which a state was a party to a suit.

### No Bill of Rights?

**One of the primary objections to the Constitution was that it contained no bill of rights._The Federalist Papers_** , however, argued that a Bill of Rights was entirely unnecessary. The Constitution _already_ guaranteed the liberties that such a bill would plausibly contain:

  * Trial by jury in criminal cases;
  * A prohibition on bills of attainder (a law passed by a legislature declaring a specific individual guilty of some crime without due process) and _ex post facto_ laws (a law that makes an act illegal or increases the punishment for it _after_ the accused has committed it);
  * A guarantee of _habeas corpus_ (the requirement that a person under arrest be brought before a judge) except in cases where the country was under attack or insurrection
  * A prohibition against the conferral of any titles of nobility; and
  * A guarantee that impeachment could only result in removal from office



### Conclusion

In short, **_The Federalist Papers_ outline a plan of government that promised to be far superior to the Articles of Confederation. **The new Constitution aimed to create a stronger bond between the states, lay the foundation for national prosperity, establish a strong national defense, create a more efficient and energetic national administration, and safeguard the liberties of the states and the people.

**Inevitably, future generations of Americans would see the need to update the Constitution to meet new challenges**. The Framers could not anticipate what these needs and challenges would be, but they created a process by which the Constitution could be amended.

But _The Federalist Papers_ cautioned against hasty changes. It was prudent, instead, to let the merits of the new plan of government reveal themselves over time. Time and experience would prove the wisdom and effectiveness of the new, supreme law of the land.
