## Chapter 3: Powers of the New Government (Essays 23-36)

Having established the failures of the _old_ system of government, we’ll use this chapter to outline the principles of the _new_ Constitution that had been drafted at Philadelphia in 1787. In particular, we’ll analyze the specific purposes the new government was designed to achieve with regard to the core functions of national administration:

  * National defense 
  * Taxation
  * Regulating foreign commerce and making treaties
  * Overseeing interstate commerce



A core principle held by the framers of the new Constitution was that it wasn’t enough to merely _grant_ powers to the federal government in the abstract; the Articles of Confederation had done that, to no effect. Rather, **the new government needed to have the authority to make laws and enforce provisions that would enable it to effectively _exert_ those powers**. Without this, the Constitution would be worthless.

If the government was to be tasked with defending the nation and securing peace, it needed the power to raise an army; if it was to finance the public debt and secure public credit, it needed to have the requisite powers of taxation to do so. We will explore these and other powers of the new government in this chapter.

### Standing Armies and the National Defense

**The most important purpose of any government is to secure peace and protect its people from internal and external threats.** Therefore, maintaining armed forces is essential to the survival of a nation.

Accordingly, the federal government under the Constitution would have the power to raise and equip armed forces. This was vitally important for the young United States. Although separated from Europe by the Atlantic Ocean, the US maintained frontiers with the colonial possessions of Britain, France, and Spain, not to mention the Indian nations that frequently allied with these European powers. Given the mutual hostilities between these powers and their competition for the untapped resources of the American West, it was not inconceivable that these nations could combine to make war on the US.

The only way the US could survive was through the creation of a standing army. Given their experience with British occupation during the Revolutionary War, however, this was something about which Americans of the time had great apprehension.

But the creation of standing armies in peacetime was not something to be feared, nor had it ever been explicitly prohibited, either by the Articles of Confederation or by the state constitutions themselves. Provisions prohibiting the national legislature from raising an army in peacetime were foolish because they left the country vulnerable to attack. The country would only be able to respond with force _after_ it had been subjected to an assault.

#### An Agent of Liberty, Not an Opponent

**Standing armies under the Constitution would not become agents of tyranny because they could only be raised by the legislative—not the executive—branch.** As the legislative branch would be composed of members popularly and periodically elected, this would ensure that the people’s representatives retained control and would prevent the creation of a permanent military establishment—something much feared by Americans of the time.

By placing this power in the hands of the House of Representatives and Senate (the two bodies of Congress, which we’ll explore in a later chapter), the Constitution would make it harder for a conspiracy to arise that would seek to use the military to overthrow the republic. Such a conspiracy would need to coordinate the actions of many representatives from many states, as well as the state legislatures, rather than just one supreme executive.

Moreover, the Constitution only allowed Congress to authorize military funds for a period of two years. As elected officials, members of both houses would be wary of provoking the anger of their constituents by voting for military appropriations when they were no longer necessary for defense.

As we explored in the previous chapter, it was the state governments that were more likely to threaten liberties, as they were more susceptible to takeover by a hostile faction. In this scenario, a national army that had sovereignty over _all_ the people, regardless of their state, was the _only_ instrument capable of putting down a petty state-based tyranny. But this would be impossible under a confederacy, in which states would be left almost entirely alone to manage their affairs.

**The great extent of the country would further make it difficult for a national army to impose tyranny on the people.** Likewise, the size of the country would make it difficult for a _foreign_ power to invade and occupy it, which in and of itself, would reduce the need for a large standing army in the first place. But such a security could only be predicated on the continued survival of the Union—and the only way to secure that Union was through the adoption of the new Constitution.

#### The Inadequacy of Militias

**State militias had proven inadequate to meet the national security needs of the country** , as they were too loyal to their home jurisdictions and unwilling to serve in distant outposts. The poor performance of colonial militias during the Revolutionary War stood as a grim reminder of the dangers of relying upon such flimsy institutions for national defense.

Moreover, all states were not equally threatened. If national defense was left entirely to the states, larger states that had greater military needs would come to have large military establishments. These military establishments could, with time, become powerful enough to threaten the other states or the federal government itself.

**A national standing army, by contrast, would serve wherever the need for it arose because it would be created by the federal government, loyal to and representing the entire nation**. There would still be a role for militias to put down minor insurrections or incidents of civil unrest, but their officers would be appointed by the federal government and the men serving in them would also be formally trained by the federal government. This would turn them into more proficient fighting forces, better able to defend their states.

The people would have little to fear from such a well-regulated militia, because it would still be composed of their friends, neighbors, and fellow citizens. Given the highly parochial nature and inherently defensive character of militias, moreover, the men serving in them would be unlikely to ever consent to being deployed out-of-state for any circumstances or for any reason—which would make it extremely difficult for the federal government to transform the militias into instruments of national oppression.

### The Power of Direct Taxation

**The management of public finances is another core function of any government.** As we explored in the previous chapter, the Articles of Confederation had failed badly on this score because they made federal revenue dependent on the fulfillment of quotas and requisitions of the state.

The federal government itself only had a few revenue streams, like imposts on imported goods, that it directly controlled; for everything else, it had to rely on the states functioning as intermediaries. This left the government unable to meet basic fiscal obligations and led to rising costs in the financing of the national debt and a collapse in public confidence.

**Publius feared that a national emergency like a war would expose the dire condition of public finances**. The federal government, unable to raise adequate revenue, would be forced to rely on loans at usurious interest rates, which would only compound the debt crisis. Because it acted directly on individuals, not states, the new Constitution gave the government powers of direct taxation. Thus, it could directly assess taxes on land and people, without relying on the states as intermediaries.

#### Concurrent Jurisdiction

Fears of federal encroachment on state revenues under this arrangement were unfounded. In the first place, the Constitution did not prohibit states from _also_ levying direct taxes. **This was a core principle of federalism—on many issues, especially those related to revenue, the states and the federal government exercised concurrent or coequal jurisdiction.**

Concurrent jurisdiction over revenue was the only logical way to put the government on sound financial footing. If the _states_ held the exclusive power of direct taxation, this would be a gross misallocation of resources, diverting revenue to where it was least needed. After all, the greatest public expenses were those related to the national defense, a power reserved to the federal government under the new Constitution. Giving it the lion’s share of revenue was appropriate.

But this would not deprive the states of revenue; the only source of revenue reserved _exclusively_ for the federal government under the Constitution was the collection of taxes on imports and exports. States would still be free to tax property and land, which were _already_ their main sources of revenue.

Also, the federal government would still rely upon states and localities for much day-to-day administration, not to mention the fact that the people would be likely to side with their states in any conflict between the two levels of government. Therefore, it would be foolish for the federal government to ever attempt to usurp state power, especially where revenue collection was concerned.

#### The Benefits of Direct Taxation

**Giving the federal union the power of direct taxation wouldn’t just benefit public finances; it would also be good for the broader economy.** If the federal government had to rely solely on customs duties and excise taxes (taxes on manufactured goods levied at the point of manufacture) for its revenue, it would have to tax these items at an extraordinary rate.

This would have distortionary and unequal effects on the different states. States with large manufacturing sectors would be able to produce more of their own goods instead of relying on imports, while passing the costs of the excise taxes onto consumers. States without a manufacturing base, however, would be forced to pay much higher prices for manufactured goods, either from abroad or produced domestically.

The high rates would encourage the growth of tax evasion and black markets, while undermining general respect for the law. In general, giving the federal government a broad tax base would encourage modest tax rates, which would be good for both producers and consumers.

#### Equal Tax Burden Among the States

The Constitution further guarded against the possibilities of the tax burden falling unequally on the various states by mandating that all imposts be uniform across the Union—in other words, there couldn’t be a higher federal tax for imports coming into Virginia than for those coming into New York.

Moreover, any direct taxes levied by Congress (in the 18th century these taxes would have applied chiefly to real estate) were required by the Constitution to be proportional. As per Article 1, Section 2, the tax burden assessed in each state was to be tied to that state’s population according to the decennial census.

(Shortform note: The requirement that direct taxes be levied proportionally according to the census was effectively nullified by the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913, which allowed the federal government to levy an income tax without regard to apportionment among the states.)

While there was a possibility of double taxation, Publius thought this was unlikely to pose a major burden. With an adequate revenue stream, the federal government would have little political desire to provoke resistance by taxing articles of consumption already being taxed by the states.

The states, for their part, would have few expenses to meet once their debts from the Revolutionary War were discharged. After that point, a small land tax would likely be wholly sufficient to meet their limited financial obligations.

### Treaties and Foreign Commerce

**Any functional national government needs to have the ability to manage its relations with other countries.** This would be especially important for a commercial republic like the United States.

The Constitution expressly authorized the federal government to make treaties with foreign nations and regulate the commerce with them. The national government was the only logical place to lodge this authority; under the Articles of Confederation (as we’ve seen), the individual states had a dangerous amount of leeway to conduct their own _de facto_ foreign policies.

Perhaps the most historically significant foreign policy provision of the Constitution was the explicit authority it gave to the federal government to outlaw the international slave trade beginning in 1808. This was a great moral victory for the young nation.

(Shortform note: The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves of 1807 went into effect on January 1, 1808, thus extricating the United States from the international slave trade as soon as it was constitutionally permitted. A massive _internal_ slave trade _between_ the states, however, persisted until the final abolition of slavery in 1865.)

### Interstate Commerce and Naturalization

**It would make little sense for the new government to be able to regulate international commerce without being able to regulate _interstate_ commerce. **The Constitution greatly simplified the economic relationships between the states by granting the federal government the sole authority to unilaterally impose tariffs and duties on imports.

Thus, states could no longer (without the consent of Congress) put tariffs on imports from other states. Under the Articles, states taxed the products of other states in a protectionist effort to boost their own domestic goods. This led to higher prices for both producers and consumers, uncertainty about true prices, the general depression of commerce, and widespread evasion.

To further stimulate interstate commerce, **Congress was also given the sole authority to coin money and issue paper notes of legal tender** ; this put the Union on the path to having a stable and strong currency, enabling merchants and consumers to be more clear about the true value of the goods they were buying and selling. Before the ratification of the Constitution, the states had been coining and printing their own money, leading to widespread economic chaos.

The new Constitution also granted federal power to establish post roads and to set uniform standards of weights and measures, further rationalizing and harmonizing trade between the states.

One of the most important powers granted to the federal government by the Constitution was the power to set national rules for naturalization. This meant that Congress would be the ultimate arbiter of who was and was not a citizen and what privileges and rights individuals would have. Under the Articles, there was widespread confusion over the differences between free citizens and resident aliens.

### The Necessary and Proper and Supremacy Clauses

**In enumerating the _purposes_ of the federal government under the new Constitution, Publius also took care to make explicit the _powers_ necessary to achieve them.**

The Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution states that Congress has the power to enact all “necessary and proper” laws to enforce the powers it is granted. Opponents of the Constitution believed that this clause gave tyrannical power to Congress, but it did nothing of the kind. Rather, the very idea of establishing a government made the Necessary and Proper Clause self-evident.

It would be nonsensical to create a plan for a government and assign to it specific powers (say, to raise an army or collect taxes) without giving it the means to enforce those powers. It was also the right decision not to specifically enumerate the powers either assigned to or withheld from the federal government under this clause. Explicitly listing the powers granted to the government would have implied that it _lacked_ those powers not enumerated; explicitly listing those denied it would have implied that it _possessed_ all the powers _not_ denied.

**The framers of the Constitution could not have known how society and law would develop over time** ; overly constraining or empowering the government by listing specific powers could have the effect of making it difficult for it to respond to future situations. Instead, it was better to let future politicians, judges, and citizens determine the specific scope of federal power.

The opponents of the new government were also agitated over the Supremacy Clause, that part of the Constitution which made federal law the supreme law of the land—superseding state law (and requiring even state officials to swear an oath of allegiance to the Constitution). But again, such a clause simply goes hand-in-hand with the task of setting up a federal system.

A national government that is unable to exercise supremacy over its constituent members is not a national government at all; it’s merely a voluntary treaty or association that can be broken up by any of the parties to it. The framers of the Constitution were charged with creating a government for the United States. Without some sort of Supremacy Clause, any plan for a Union that comprised both the states and a national government would have been meaningless.
