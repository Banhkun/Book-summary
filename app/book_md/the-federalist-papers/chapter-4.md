## Chapter 4: General Principles of the New Constitution (Essays 37-46)

Given the obvious failures of the Articles of Confederation, there was a clear need for reform. But no mere revision would suit the needs of the moment. For, as we’ve seen, **the defects of the Articles had afflicted _all_ confederate governments going back to the days of ancient Greece.** They were beyond salvation because the entire system of government they created was inherently unworkable; they needed to be discarded and replaced wholesale.

The framers at the Philadelphia Convention had to juggle many competing interests as they set about their historic task, such as:

  * Striking the right balance between an energetic and dynamic government and one that still represented the popular will; and
  * Apportioning power between the large states and the small states



This chapter will examine the structure and principles of the new Constitution and make the case for why the new framework adopted at Philadelphia was the right one for the young republic.

### The Necessity of the New Constitution

As we’ve seen, the proposed Constitution was a controversial issue at the time of _The Federalist Papers_. Opponents raised various objections against it, although many of these individual objections contradicted each other.

  * Some claimed that it gave too much power to the smaller states through their equal representation in the Senate.
  * Others claimed that the proportionate representation by population in the House of Representatives gave too much influence to the larger states.
  * Critics in the manufacturing states objected to the power of direct taxation (because they feared it would fall heavily on their goods), while agricultural states opposed the federal government’s power to tax imports (because they feared it would make the foreign manufactured goods upon which they relied too expensive).
  * Those in the more agricultural states, meanwhile, objected to the federal power to tax imports.



**But the weakness of the Anti-Federalist position was that it did not coalesce around an alternative. If they objected to the new Constitution, what did they propose instead?** The Articles of Confederation had proven to be an abject failure. Retaining them was a non-starter.

#### The Exercise of Power

The Articles had actually already granted most of the same powers to the federal government that the new Constitution proposed to. The difference was that **the Articles gave the federal government no effective tools by which to _exercise_ those powers, **because the states were too strong. The result was a federal government that was forced to go outside the bounds of law to secure the public good.

Publius argued that the government under the Articles had _already_ exceeded its authority with respect to the administration of western lands and the creation of new states. These lands promised to be a great source of wealth for the country, so it was clearly unrealistic to expect that the national government would simply neglect the opportunity to incorporate them.

Surely, a lawless government was the opposite of what everyone wanted. But, paradoxically, by constraining the hands of the federal government, the Articles of Confederation had left the Union no choice but to undermine the law in its pursuit of the goals that any government would seek to achieve.

**The new government would not be perfect, because it was created by imperfect human beings.** But perfection was the wrong standard by which to judge it. It should instead be judged in comparison to the _existing_ , clearly inadequate government. And on this count, the new government would represent a significant improvement.

### The Republican Character of the New Government

Critics feared that the new government would represent a departure from republican principles for which the Revolution had been fought, empowering the few against the many. What Americans wanted was a government that derived its ultimate sovereign authority from the people.

Thankfully, the new government was decidedly republican in character. In the first place,**the Constitution was to be ratified by popular conventions and referenda in the states**. This made the people direct parties to the new government. Once the Constitution was in operation, the House of Representatives was to be elected directly by the people of each state, according to the same voting qualifications by which people voted for representatives to their respective state legislatures. The Senate, meanwhile, was to be indirectly elected by the people via their state legislatures.

The President would also be indirectly elected by the members of the Electoral College, a body of electors chosen specifically for the purpose of choosing the chief executive. Lastly, the new Constitution expressly prohibited the establishment of titles of hereditary nobility. The supporters of the new government believed that these safeguards made it essentially representative in character.

### National vs. Federal Government

But it was not enough to prove that the new government was republican. **Critics and opponents worried that the government was too _national_** ;**** in other words, that it created a unitary government that ruled directly over the people, with no regard for the authority of the individual states.

But Publius argued that the new Constitution deftly balanced the priorities of _national_ government (a central government with the necessary authority to act directly on the people) and _federal_ government (a system in which the central government shares powers with subordinate government).

It was a mixture of both forms. While the people would ratify the new Constitution, they would not do so in some national referendum that paid no regard to the states. Rather, the ratification process would be on a state-by-state basis and would only go into operation until nine of them ratified it. This preserved an important role for the sovereignty of the states.

**Furthermore, the legislative branch under the Constitution would be considerably determined by the states.** Similarly, the House of Representatives would be popularly elected, but seats would be apportioned by _state_. The Senate, for its part, was one of the strongest guarantors of state power under the new arrangement. In having state legislatures select their state’s senators, the Constitution left it entirely to the states (acting in their capacity _as_ states) to determine the composition of the upper chamber of the national legislature. And in assigning every state equal representation in the Senate regardless of population, the Constitution preserved a key federal feature of the old Articles of Confederation.

**The Electoral College, meanwhile, guaranteed that the president would not be chosen in a national election that treated the states as non-entities**. The states were the elemental unit in the Electoral College, with each state receiving electoral votes equal to its combined number of representatives and senators.

Thus, the states would have a considerable role in determining the composition of the federal government; but the federal government would have no such role in determining the composition of the state governments.

### Relations Between the States and the Union

Continuing on this theme, the Constitution provided clearer guidance than the Articles on what the balance of powers would be between the states and the central government. Beyond what we’ve already outlined, the Constitution stipulated that, while the admission of new states was solely the prerogative of Congress, **the federal government had no authority to make new states out of the old ones without the consent of the latter.**

This meant that Congress could not unilaterally carve new states out of the boundaries of the existing ones or merge two existing states together to forge a new one. This was an important guarantee and demonstrated that the states would continue to exercise political sovereignty under the new Constitution.

The amendment process also placed the states front and center. The Constitution could not be amended without the amendment being ratified by ¾ of the states, acting through their legislatures. Thus,**the states did not just passively accept their status under the Constitution; they would play an active role in shaping the nature of the Union itself.**

Unlike the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution explicitly guaranteed that each of the states was to have a republican form of government. The newly strengthened federal government had the requisite power to enforce this provision and come to the aid of any state, should it have the misfortune of falling under the sway of a monarchical or aristocratic faction.

#### The Unlikelihood of Federal Overreach

Most of the federal powers outlined in the Constitution were already granted to it under the Articles of Confederation. **What the new framework did was give the federal government the ability to effectively _administer_ those powers.**

The very nature of state-based representation in the national legislature made it highly unlikely that the federal government could ever overpower the states. Both houses of Congress would be composed of representatives who, because they would owe their political careers to the people and legislatures of their states, were likely to be highly loyal to their states. They would strongly resist any federal encroachment on their state's power (just as members of state legislatures were highly loyal to and protective of their towns and counties).

**The existence of a strong political union itself rendered fear of federal overreach highly dubious.** Just as the size and unity of the colonies had helped them resist the British during the Revolutionary War, so would the states—bound together in the Union—be able to push back any encroachment at the national level. Any federal army would be dwarfed by the size of the combined state militias and powerless in the face of the loyalty of the people to their states.
