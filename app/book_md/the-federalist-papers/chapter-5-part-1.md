## Chapter 5 Part 1: Structure of the New Constitution (Essays 47-66)

So far, we’ve outlined general principles of the new Constitution and made the case for why it was such an improvement over the ineffective Articles of Confederation. We’ve also discussed the sharing of powers between the federal government and the states.

Now, we’re going to pivot our analysis to the structure of the federal government itself. In this chapter, we’ll explore:

  * How the Constitution separates power within the federal government between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches;
  * How the system of checks and balances was designed to keep any of the branches from growing too powerful at the expense of the other branches; and 
  * The specific powers and functions of each of the branches and their constituent parts, examining how they’re elected and what their responsibilities are.



### Separation of Powers

**All constitutional forms of government have three branches:**

  * The legislative branch, which writes the laws;
  * The executive branch, which enforces the laws; and
  * The judicial branch, which interprets the laws.



A basic principle of republican government, going back to the writings of the French political philosopher Montesquieu, is that these functions must remain separate. Tyranny results when there is too much overlap between these functions: a president, for example, should not be able to write, enforce, and interpret his own laws.

**Critics of the new Constitution argued that its provisions for the separation of powers were too weak and that the result would be a corrupt despotism.** Publius, however, argued that separation of powers was a _general_ principle that was impossible to follow completely—some mixture and overlap between the powers was inevitable and, indeed, necessary.

For example, the British constitution (at the time regarded as the world’s finest) gave the monarch (the executive) the power to veto laws passed by Parliament (the legislative branch).

Similarly, the various state constitutions blended the powers to one degree or another. Some states had the legislature appoint the executive cabinet, and even the chief executive himself. Others allowed the legislature to impeach members of both the executive and judicial branches. In other states, the executive branch had sole authority for appointing members of the judiciary.

Simply declaring on paper that the three branches ought to be separate was a totally insufficient way to guarantee this end.**** And instead of striving for complete separation of powers (which was an impossibility), it was far more important to imbue the Constitution with the principle of checks and balances.

**The new Constitution was well-designed with a robust system of checks and balances** to ensure that the branches remained coequal, that none reigned supreme over the others, and that each had the means to hold the others in check.

#### Ambition Checks Ambition

The government would be composed of human beings, with all their fallacies and weaknesses. As we’ve emphasized,**if humans were perfect, there would be no need for government in the first place.**

Any rational plan of government needed to proceed with this insight into human nature in mind. The new Constitution, therefore, would not seek to create a government where individual ambition or thirst for power played no role—that would be an impossible standard to meet. Instead, the new government would create a system in which ambition would check ambition.

The three branches of government would _compete_ with one another for power. In the process, power grabs by one branch would be checked by the power grabs of another. The mutual ambitions of the players in this system would cancel each other out, preserving liberty.

(Shortform note: The authors of the Constitution and _The Federalist Papers_ seem not to have anticipated the rise of organized political parties. Indeed, the first two parties—the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans—came into existence almost immediately after ratification. With the arrival of political parties, the main theatre of political competition was not _between_ branches of government. Instead, co-partisans began to cooperate _across_ branches of government to achieve shared party goals, precisely the opposite of what the Framers had intended. Ironically, these original parties were led in large part by the primary authors of _The Federalist Papers—_ Hamilton for the Federalists and Madison for the Democratic-Republicans.)

### The House of Representatives

Now, let’s turn to the specific branches of government and their components to get a fuller picture of how the system of checks and balances was designed to function. The House of Representatives is the lower house of the national legislature, with members apportioned within each state by population—the higher the state’s population, the more representatives it has.

There are few eligibility requirements for election to the House. A member merely needs to:

  * Be age 25 or older
  * Be a resident of the state they represent
  * Have been a citizen for at least seven years prior to their election
  * Hold no other office during their tenure in the chamber



Beyond these requirements, anyone is eligible to run and serve (although the House retains the right to expel members by a two-thirds vote).

**Because membership was to be determined by population, the larger states would naturally hold sway in the House.** That power would be checked, however, by the Senate, where the smaller states would dominate. The House would tend to have the upper hand, however, because the Constitution mandated that all revenue bills originate from the lower chamber. This gave the House the decisive power of the purse.

Although candidacy for election to the House was open to almost anyone, being a US Representative was still an important public position that ought to be taken seriously. Given the diversity of laws throughout the Union, members of the House needed to be well-acquainted with the laws not only of their _own_ states, but with those of all the _other_ states as well. After all, they would be drafting and voting on legislation that would affect the _whole_ Union—and should therefore understand how a piece of legislation might have disparate impacts on the different states.

Representatives should also be versed in foreign affairs and diplomacy. Although the House was not the chamber that would vote on treaties or confirm ambassadors (those functions belonged to the Senate, which we’ll explore later in the chapter), they might nevertheless have to consider passing domestic legislation that resulted from the United States’ relations with other countries.

#### The People’s Chamber

**The House was to be directly elected by the voters of the state, with voters meeting the same eligibility requirements that they did for state legislative elections.** It also represented the people, not the states. Thus, the House was the body of government most directly connected to the sentiments of the people.

Members were to be elected every two years, a shorter term than other federal offices:

  * The president’s term was for four years
  * Senators were to serve for six years
  * Federal judges (including justices of the Supreme Court) would serve for life, provided they maintained good behavior on the bench



**By having to run for reelection every two years, members of the House would maintain closer relations with the people they represented.** Voters would have frequent opportunity to replace those representatives who failed to acquit themselves well or who had proven themselves to be threats to liberty.

Moreover, the regular, frequent, and fixed time of election would make it difficult for any single faction to gain a foothold in the House for any considerable period of time. Every two years, the entire membership of the lower house could be replaced. Representatives, understanding these political realities, would behave accordingly.

Historical experience had shown that there was no danger in having such a short term of office. In the various state legislatures, members of the lower houses served terms that ranged from between six months to seven years. All of these governments had been broadly successful at maintaining republican liberties. Two-year terms were therefore perfectly compatible with longstanding norms of American governance.

#### The Power of Impeachment

**The House would also have the sole authority, with a simple majority vote, to impeach members of the executive branch, including the president, for high crimes and misdemeanors.**

This was a crucial check on executive power. The House would not, however, have the authority to _convict_ officials and remove them from office. That power rested solely with the Senate, which we’ll explore later in the chapter.

#### The Three-Fifths Compromise

We’ve already seen how each state’s number of House members was to be tied to its population, as determined by the decennial census. **But this didn’t answer the question of enslaved people. How were they to be counted?**

The slaveholding states (located primarily in the South) had insisted at the Constitutional Convention that enslaved people be counted as full persons for purposes of representation (which would have given the South an outsized influence in Congress), but _not_ for purposes of direct taxation (which would reduce the federal tax burden to be borne by the slaveholding states). In other words, southerners wanted to treat slaves as _people_ when it would benefit them, and as _property_ when _that_ would benefit them.

Eventually, the delegates reached the notorious Three-Fifths Compromise. This stated that enslaved people were to count as three-fifths of a person for _both_ federal representation and for direct taxation.

(Shortform note: This concession to the South gave the region an influence over national politics out of all proportion to its numbers of free white voters. It enabled the slaveholding states to gain additional representatives in the House as well as votes in the Electoral College that they wouldn’t have otherwise had. The compromise was only repealed by the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, which explicitly stated that representation was to be allotted based on “the whole number of persons in each State.”)

#### Apportionment in the House

**A key question in drafting the Constitution was how large to make the House of Representatives.** If the number of representatives was too _small_ , it would be unrepresentative of the entire nation. But if it was too _large_ , the body would be chaotic and dysfunctional; each representative would only represent small numbers of voters, making it too easy for factions to control members and dominate national politics.

The key, then, was to set the number of representatives (or, more specifically, the ratio of representatives to voters) at the right level. The Constitution called for a House of 65 members. While critics objected that this number was too small, the Constitution made it clear that this figure was to be temporary. It called for the House to be enlarged just three years after the first decennial census of 1790, as would happen every ten years thereafter.

Moreover, the ratio of representatives to voters was to be fixed at one for every 30,000. This, too, was based on sound practice. The British Constitution, held in high regard by the Framers, had roughly the same apportionment for the House of Commons. In fact, the House of Representatives was an _improvement_ on this model, as it contained no property or wealth qualifications for either representatives or voters (beyond what may have been required by the individual states).

Also, the ratio of apportionment for seats in the various state legislatures was sometimes very great (one representative for 40,000-50,000 voters) or very small (one representative for just a few hundred voters). In either case, the federal ratio of 30,000 was well in line with longstanding governing norms.

(Shortform note: The Reapportionment Act of 1929 changed this formula, fixing the total number of representatives at 435. As the national population grew, so did that of the average House district. Today, the average House district has over 700,000 constituents.)

### The Senate

The Senate is the upper chamber of the national legislature. Unlike the House, its members must be _30_ years of age and have been citizens of the United States for _nine_ years prior to their election. Thus, **senators would tend to be older and more experienced, and have greater familiarity with the laws and customs of the United States, than their counterparts in the House.**

These more stringent qualifications (as compared to those for the House) were in place to make it more likely that temperate and considered representatives would serve in the upper chamber.

Senators were to serve six-year terms and be elected by the state legislatures— _not_ by the people themselves. One-third of the senators would be up for reelection every two years. This structure blended the principles of national government and federal government, a point we explored in Chapter 4. **By having state legislatures choose senators, the Constitution preserved an essential role for state governments in the composition of the national legislature.** This was a continuation of the federal practices of the Articles of Confederation. It checked the national government orientation of the House, in which the people, not the states, directly elected representatives.

(Shortform note: The system of having state legislatures elect senators had become rife with corruption by the late-19th century, with scandalous incidents of Senate seats being openly bought and sold. Moreover, the political polarization of the time had frequently resulted in state legislatures failing to come to agreement on elections to the Senate. This resulted in many Senate seats going unfilled, leaving states without representation in the upper chamber of Congress. The Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1913, finally ended senatorial election by state legislatures, mandating instead that senators be directly elected by the voters of their states.)

Lastly, **each state was to have two senators, regardless of population**. This was also meant to counterbalance the House, where representation was proportional based on a state’s population (with three-fifths of a state’s slave population counting as one person for these purposes). Naturally, the Senate conferred an advantage on _smaller_ states, who received disproportional representation in the upper chamber relative to their actual number of voters.

(Shortform note: Some political observers have argued that the disproportionate representation in the Senate has become problematic and undermines democratic norms. At the time of the Constitution’s adoption, the largest state, Virginia, had a population roughly nine times greater than that of the smallest state, Georgia. Today, the most populous state, California, has a population approximately _70_ times that of the smallest state, Wyoming. Put another way, Wyoming voters have 70 times the voting power of Californians within the Senate.)

#### Cooling the Passions of Democracy

**The Senate was designed to temper the more dangerous democratic impulses of the House.** This was because its members were fewer, they were not elected directly by the people, and their terms in office would be longer. This would prevent them from being susceptible to democratic political pressures.

This was meant to insulate senators from the passions of the people. The Senate was meant to act as a check, slowing down or stopping the passage of hasty and ill-considered legislation. By acting as a purposely deliberative and conservative-minded body, the Senate was to provide more wisdom and consistency in legislation and national administration.

The six-year terms were instrumental to this. Because senators served such long terms, they would provide much-needed constancy. This would be unworkable, however, if they had to stand for reelection every two years, as members of the House did. While it was important to preserve republican principles, it was also important to ensure that the United States acted with a steady and consistent hand, and was not seized by fleeting impulses toward dangerous policy decisions.

**This function for the Senate was perfectly in keeping with the best practices of constitutional government**. Once more, the paramount example was Great Britain. There, the House of Lords (the rough equivalent of the Senate) was not even indirectly elected, but was instead composed of landed nobility and clergy, serving for life by right of birth.

Yet, even with such a body comprising the upper chamber of Parliament, Great Britain had remained well-governed and had _not_ sunk into despotism. In fact, the aristocratic House of Lords had steadily _lost_ power relative to the more representative House of Commons. If even a noble upper house could not destroy free government in Great Britain, then surely one elected by the state legislatures in America would prove to be perfectly harmonious with liberty.

#### Ratification of Treaties and Executive Appointments

The Senate, as the upper chamber, was designated with certain special privileges. **One of the most important of these was its sole prerogative, via a two-thirds vote, to ratify treaties negotiated and submitted to it by the President.**

As it would be composed of leaders with greater experience and superior judgment in international affairs, the Senate was the proper body to provide this advice and consent on treaties. There would be a need to balance expediency and secrecy in matters of diplomacy. This was why the president would have sole authority to _negotiate_ and draft treaties, but would require the _approval_ of the Senate for them to become effective.

**There was little danger of the Senate becoming corrupted by either the president or by a foreign power in its treaty-approval function**. The provision in the Constitution requiring two-thirds approval for any treaty was paramount here—it would be very difficult to bribe that many Senators (and the state legislators who would be responsible for electing them) without the conspiracy being detected and discovered.

The Senate would also be responsible for approving all cabinet appointments by the president, although this could be achieved with a simple majority vote. This would make it less likely that the president would attempt to appoint unqualified loyalists, cronies, and favorites to important cabinet positions. Knowing that his nominations would need to survive a Senate confirmation vote, the president would have a strong incentive to nominate qualified officials.

In both its treaty approval and executive-appointment confirmation functions, the Senate served as a powerful check on the executive branch.

#### Conviction After Impeachment

Another, arguably more important check on the power of the executive branch was the Senate’s **sole authority to convict members of the executive (including the President) for high crimes and misdemeanors by a two-thirds vote, following impeachment in the House.** This high threshold for conviction made it highly unlikely that a President would be removed from office for purely partisan reasons. Only those who had committed truly heinous offenses would be convicted.

(Shortform note: This has indeed proven to be a high bar. Although three presidents have been impeached by the House as of 2020—Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump—none has been convicted in the Senate. Richard Nixon likely _would_ have been both impeached and convicted had he not resigned from office in 1974 amid the Watergate scandal.)

The Senate was the best place to house this crucial function. It would be unjust and contrary to basic principles of the rule of law to give the House the power to both charge and convict an official. The Supreme Court, meanwhile, was too weak, too distant from the people, and too small in numbers to have the legitimacy to remove high-ranking officials. The members of the Supreme Court would also have been nominated to their office by the president, and thus might be too biased in favor of the executive branch to behave impartially.

In addition, the Supreme Court might later be called on to preside over an _ordinary_ trial of such officials _after_ they’d been removed from office. It would be inconsistent with common law principles to force a defendant to appear twice before the same judicial body.

As with so many other aspects of the Constitution,**the decision to grant the upper house of the national legislature the power to convict corrupt officials was strongly supported by precedent.** Such was the practice with the House of Lords in Great Britain, as well as the state senates in many of the states (including New York, to whose voters _The Federalist Papers_ were originally addressed).
