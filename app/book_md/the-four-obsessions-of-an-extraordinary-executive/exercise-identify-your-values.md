## Exercise: Identify Your Values

Identify the values your organization most deeply represents.

* * *

Chances are your organization has some stated values. These could be reflected in a company slogan or a mission statement. List these values here, as they are stated in official company materials. Reflect on how these values are stated. Are they clear and concise, or is there a long list of confusing terms?

Think about one of your favorite people to work with. Consider the specific qualities that make this person such an effective member of your team and list them here. Try to describe these values in just one or two words each.

Compare the values you listed in the first two questions. If they differ significantly, your organization may need to clarify its values. Take a moment to reflect on your organizationâ€™s values and whether or not they need to be restated. If they do, how could you address this with the rest of your team?
