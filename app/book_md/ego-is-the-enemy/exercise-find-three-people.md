## Exercise: Find Three People

To become great, you need to find three types of people with whom you can interact on your journey to success:

  * Someone better than you whom you can learn from
  * Someone lesser than you whom you can teach
  * Someone equal to you whom you can challenge yourself against



* * *

Think of someone better than you at your current job or the job you dream of. How can you reach out to that person and ask for assistance? What exactly would you ask?

Think of someone who knows less than you do and who could use some advice and instruction. What advice does that person need most right now? How can you reach out to that person and offer to help?

Think of someone you work with whoâ€™s striving toward a goal similar to yours. How can you partner with that person to support and motivate each other?
