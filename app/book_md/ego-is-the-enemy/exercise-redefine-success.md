## Exercise: Redefine Success

Sometimes your ego defines success based entirely on how much or how little others give you recognition, through honors, praise, awards, job titles, raises, and so on. If you let your ego define success for you in this way, you are setting yourself up for disappointment, because you can’t control how the world receives, judges, or acts upon your work.

* * *

Think of a time when you had an opportunity but passed it up because it didn’t meet a superficial marker of success. (Maybe you passed on an entry-level job in an industry you loved because it didn’t pay well, or you didn’t bother submitting to an art contest because the prize wasn’t prestigious enough.)

Imagine what might have happened had you moved forward with that opportunity instead of letting it go. What other opportunities might have come your way had you followed through? How might one thing have led to another?

Think of your current goal for your career or life. What’s something small you could do that would advance that goal but would earn you no immediate recognition? What opportunities might that lead to?
