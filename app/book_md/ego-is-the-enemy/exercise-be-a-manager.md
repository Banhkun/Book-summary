## Exercise: Be a Manager

While your ego wants you to be the boss of _everything_ , managing properly means delegating and focusing your efforts on big-picture issues.

* * *

Think of a situation where you couldnâ€™t stop yourself from micromanaging details. What responsibilities did you take on that you could have delegated to another person?

How did this create difficulties for you? For example, were you unable to attend to larger issues? Did the other people resent not being allowed to contribute effectively? Did you mess up the details because you were spread too thin?

What details of your current project could you delegate that would free you up to focus on more important issues?
