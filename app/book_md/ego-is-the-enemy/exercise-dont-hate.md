## Exercise: Don’t Hate

The paradox of hatred is that it accomplishes the exact opposite of what we hope it will accomplish. While we may feel hatred will demonstrate how wrongly we’ve been treated, it more often demonstrates how appropriate our failures are—how well-deserved.

* * *

Think of a situation that made you angry, in which you felt bitterness or hatred toward someone.

Write down what results those feelings brought about. Did they bring anything positive into your life? Did they rob you of something positive (for example, a good night’s sleep)?

How might you have viewed your situation from a different perspective—one in which your ego played a smaller role—to prevent such negative feelings from developing? How might you approach a similar situation in the future in a more positive way?
