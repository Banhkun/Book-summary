## Introduction to Ego

In _Ego Is the Enemy_ , bestselling author and marketer Ryan Holiday contends that ego is an unhealthy belief in one’s own importance that distorts our perception of the world so that we see ourselves as central figures and see everyone else as either subservient or oppositional.

Holiday notes that many successful people are famously egotistical—ambitious, self-important, and caught up in their own vision of the world. He says that as a result, society tends to think that ego is an important ingredient in success, as if _ego_ leads to _accomplishment_. Holiday disagrees. The premise of his book is that **ego leads far more often to _failure_ , and that people find success only when they’re able to control their egotistical impulses. **

Holiday argues that overall, ego leads us to failure because it causes us to overestimate our own skills while underestimating threats and challenges. It also prevents us from effectively connecting with people, which limits our ability to lead them or to inspire them to help us. Further, it can lead to a host of adverse characteristics, such as addiction, depression, mania, and abuse, which can destroy a person’s career (and life). He emphasizes that you don’t need to be a full-blown “egomaniac” (a person _completely_ obsessed with themselves) to suffer the effects of ego, but that even slightly elevated levels of ego can hold you back from success and create difficulties in your life.

> **Holiday’s Definition of Ego**
> 
> Holiday uses the term “ego” in the way it’s come to be known in our general popular culture and not as psychiatrists define the term.
> 
> Psychiatrists define the term as one of three pieces of the human psyche: the id, the superego, and the ego.
> 
>   * **The id** is the impulsive part of us that responds to basic desires, fears, and urges.
> 
>   * **The superego** is the opposite of the id—it counters the id’s urges with morals and societal expectations.
> 
>   * **The ego** is the part in the middle. It evaluates the input from the id and the superego and makes our decisions.
> 
> 

> 
> Psychiatrists consider a healthy psyche as one where the ego is firmly in control of both the id and the superego, so that a person is not ruled by either too many primitive impulses (from the id) or too many rules (from the superego, which leads to compulsive disorders).
> 
> In contrast, Holiday uses the term “ego” to mean the part of our psyche that is always and only looking out for ourselves—the part that is driven by primitive instincts of “me first” and is influenced by fears and desires. His use of the term corresponds most closely with the psychiatric term “id.” Therefore, while he argues that the ego should not drive our decisions, psychiatrists would say the ego _should_ drive our decisions. However, the difference between the two arguments is only a difference in language. Both theories say that we should not let the more primitive, instinct-driven part of our psyche control our thoughts and actions.
> 
> Throughout our guide, we use the term “ego” in the way Holiday uses it, to mean the selfish part of our psyches, even when we refer to psychologists or their theories.

(Shortform note: Holiday credits the philosophies of Stoicism for the development of his thinking on ego. Stoicism advises that you quell your emotional urges of desire and fear so that you can approach life rationally. Though he doesn’t explicitly say so, **Holiday defines these emotional urges as your ego.** His advice on the subject then mirrors Stoicism—that you learn to control your ego (your emotional urges) so that you can approach life with a clear, rational outlook.)
