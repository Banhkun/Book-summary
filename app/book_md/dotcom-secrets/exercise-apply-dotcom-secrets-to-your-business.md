## Exercise: Apply Dotcom Secrets to Your Business

Brunson prescribes a specific model that online businesses can use to maximize their profits. Consider how your business can fit into this structure. You can answer these questions either for an existing business you run or an idea you have for a business.

* * *

Clarify the message that you’ll share with subscribers to your direct marketing email list. What’s the personal, relatable story behind your business? What motivated you to start it? How do you plan to serve your customers, and why? (For example, if you sell refurbished musical instruments, you could describe how you grew up playing guitar and loved having a creative outlet throughout adolescence. This made you set the goal to get instruments in the hands of people who normally can’t afford it.)

Brainstorm a few options for add-ons you could offer in your sales funnel. If you’re having trouble, ask yourself what goal the customer is trying to accomplish and what else you could give them to help them reach that goal. (For example, after you sell a guitar, you could brainstorm what else the customer might need to buy to make great music on the guitar—perhaps offering them a book of guitar lessons, an amplifier, or a pack of guitar picks.)

Brunson recommends eventually expanding your business to offer extremely valuable services for your most dedicated customers. List a few ideas for products you can include at this tier. (For example, in addition to your refurbished musical instruments, you could sell autographed guitars that you personally made or tickets to a music festival that you host.)
