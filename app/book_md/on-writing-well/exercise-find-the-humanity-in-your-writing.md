## Exercise: Find the Humanity in Your Writing

Incorporating humanity, or some truth about being human, will make your writing more engaging. Let’s identify some underlying truths in your writing so you can craft more compelling stories in the future.

* * *

Think of a story you’re currently writing, would like to write, or wrote in the past. What was the story about? Give a brief description of the piece.

Now dig a little deeper. What was your writing _really_ about? What kind of truth did it speak to? Perhaps your company memo was really about the desire to improve your sales performance or your profile on a local baker was about the preservation of family values and customs.

Finally, think about what truths _you_ value most, such as family or loyalty. If nothing immediately comes to mind, consider what kind of stories you gravitate toward—maybe you like murder mysteries and the search for justice or knowledge, or maybe you like biographies of entrepreneurs and their ability to overcome obstacles and solve important problems. Describe what truths you’d enjoy exploring.
