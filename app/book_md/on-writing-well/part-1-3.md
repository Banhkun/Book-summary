## Part 1.3: Identity

Many writers worry that by writing with simplicity and clarity, their writing will be boring. Further, they think complexity and embellishment will give them a unique voice, or _writing identity_. But Zinsser argues that writing simply and clearly is the most effective way to develop a unique writing identity. In this part, we’ll define identity, explain how to find your writing identity, discuss how to develop good taste, and explore the importance of humanity in writing.

### What Is Identity?

Zinsser’s third principle of good writing is _identity_ , or what makes your writing unique to you. It’s the specific style and personality that you as an individual bring to your writing. Zinsser explains that identity is a writer’s most recognizable quality to a reader. If a reader likes your identity and the way you tell stories, they’ll read more of your writing because they’re interested in what you have to say and how you say it. Zinsser argues that identity will determine whether or not readers like _you_ as a writer.

Good artists develop a distinct style in their work, no matter what medium they’re working in. For example, when you look at a painting by Vincent van Gogh, you can probably identify that it’s his painting before looking at the signature. When you see a Quentin Tarantino film, you can tell whose movie it is. Why? It’s their identity—the personal style these artists apply to all of their work. The same is true for writers.

> **Elements of Identity**
> 
> Zinsser explains identity as putting your personality on paper, but this may be easier said than done. While identity can be hard to define, experts do outline a few factors that contribute to a writer’s individual style.
> 
>   * **Word choice:** Zinsser believes you should use simple words, but not every writer adheres to this advice. For example, writer Will Self uses large, complex words, such as “strabismus” and “stereoscopically.”
> 
>   * **Punctuation:** Some writers make certain stylistic choices with their punctuation. For example, Sally Rooney is known for her omission of quotation marks.
> 
>   * **Sentence structure:** As we discussed earlier, sentence structure looks different from writer to writer—Hemingway preferred short sentences, while Faulkner wrote longer sentences.
> 
>   * **Tone:** As discussed earlier, this is the attitude you take toward a piece. You can take different tones in different pieces and still sound like yourself.
> 
>   * **Sensory details:** This is imagery that uses the senses: sight, smell, taste, touch, hearing, as well as kinesthetic sensations. Some writers prefer certain sensory details over others. For example, Chuck Palahniuk frequently describes smells in his writing.
> 
>   * **Figurative language, such as metaphors and similes:** This is another stylistic device to add detail and connect ideas. The way you connect ideas is unique to you and thus your writing identity.
> 
>   * **Sound devices, such as alliteration and onomatopoeia:** Just like the cadence of your speaking voice, the sound of your sentences can sound like you too.
> 
> 

> 
> We’ve discussed several of these factors in the sections on simplicity and clarity, which echoes Zinsser’s claim that writing with simplicity and clarity will help you write like yourself.

### How to Develop Your Identity

Zinsser believes identity is your personality and style revealing itself through words. The more you write, the more comfortable you’ll become with your unique style. While writing like yourself should eventually feel effortless, Zinsser offers these tips for finding your writing identity:

#### Write for Yourself

To write in your unique style, start by writing for yourself. Zinsser explains that your identity will shine through when you write about things that _you_ want to write about. Or ask yourself what _you_ want to read, and write about that. By letting your interests direct your writing topic, you’ll be more passionate when writing about it.

Zinsser believes writers make the mistake of writing for their editor, publisher, or the people they think will read their piece. Don’t ask yourself what other people want to read—ask yourself what _you_ want to read or write. If you're not interested in a topic, your writing will sound bored, and your reader will pick up on it. But don’t worry about readers not being interested in what you’re passionate about—if you find it engaging, someone else will too.

Think about the last time you asked someone about a topic they’re passionate about. Did their eyes light up? Were they more engaged in the conversation? Was their passion infectious? The answers are probably yes. Writing works the same way—your passion will come through in your writing, and you’ll naturally sound more like yourself.

> **Counterpoint: Identify Your Ideal Reader**
> 
> In _On Writing_ , Stephen King offers a different perspective, suggesting that you keep one reader in mind as you write: your Ideal Reader. Your Ideal Reader is usually the one person whose opinion you trust above all. For King, it’s his wife Tabitha.
> 
> You come to know your Ideal Reader’s tastes so well you can predict how he or she will feel about any particular thing you’re writing. Will she laugh at this scene? Will she get bored here? The Ideal Reader helps give you an audience as you write rather than writing strictly for yourself, as Zinsser recommends.
> 
> The Ideal Reader should also be an honest reviewer—supportive but unrelenting. You might disagree with Ideal Reader’s feedback, but you know there’s truth to it.

#### Write in First Person

Once you find a topic you’re passionate about, write about it from your own perspective, or in first person. Zinsser explains that since we generally speak in first person, writing with “I” should feel natural. Avoid trying to tell a story through someone else’s eyes because it will place a barrier between _your_ thoughts and your natural writing voice.

But Zinsser acknowledges that not every piece of nonfiction writing can be in first person. For example, journalists traditionally avoid using “I” to maintain an objective perspective. In these instances, first write the article using “I” so you sound like yourself. Then go back and edit the article, converting it to third person. This process allows your writing to feel more personal, even when you can’t use first person.

> **Improve Reflection Through Wakewalking**
> 
> Since first person brings you closest to the story, your own reflection and insight will be more obviously represented in your writing when you use “I.” If you’re still struggling to connect to your writing or topic, try practicing your skills of observation and reflection.
> 
> One way to do this is through “wakewalking” (as opposed to sleepwalking), which is a kind of meditation for writers. To wakewalk, take a walk outside and name some of the things you see, such as a tree, rock, or stream. Then describe one of these things using all five of your senses. As you interact with the object, write down your internal feelings about it. It might stir up an old emotion or memory, or you might find a new way to describe it. By wakewalking, you can practice relating to the world and writing about the connections you make.

#### Write Like Yourself All the Time

Zinsser advises against changing your writing identity from piece to piece. He gives two reasons for this advice:

First, writing in your own voice will help you develop your identity since you’ll be consistently practicing writing in your unique voice. Eventually, your voice will come to you immediately and naturally when you write. For example, if you wanted to be a great Impressionist-style painter, you should paint consistently in the Impressionist style, not in a contemporary or cubist style.

Second, keeping your voice consistent makes your writing identity recognizable to readers. Zinsser believes your writing identity is your trademark as a writer, so don’t throw it away by switching up your voice.

(Shortform note: Many bloggers’ success stems from developing a signature writing voice that readers instantly recognize. For example, readers recognize Mark Manson for his unashamed use of curse words, his storytelling, and his way of writing to the reader like a friend. Manson’s blog quickly gained a large following, so when he published _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ , he already had a dedicated audience who was interested in his writing style and what he had to say.)

### What Is Good Taste?

As you write, you’ll face many creative decisions that will shape your writing identity. To make these decisions, you should develop good taste. Zinsser acknowledges that**the idea of taste is vague, but it can loosely be defined as understanding the creative decisions that do and don’t work for you.** Every word you choose, every sentence you construct, every mood you convey—these are all creative decisions.

(Shortform note: Experts agree with Zinsser’s definition of taste as the filter through which you evaluate your creative impulses. Taste is someone’s personal preferences of cultural, design, or aesthetic patterns. The writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe said, “There is nothing worse than imagination without taste.” He believed in using taste to decide which creative ideas to express in your art and which to ignore.)

### How to Develop Good Taste

To develop good taste, first identify your favorite writers—writers whose taste and creative decisions you admire. Once you’ve identified those writers, study their writing and emulate their style. Take the time to mirror their techniques and find what works for you. Don’t be afraid of copying them—Zinsser believes you’ll eventually graduate into your own unique voice and naturally develop your own sense of good taste.

However, don’t unfairly compare yourself to other writers—it’s not a competition. Zinsser recommends accepting where you are in your writing journey and focusing on your own progress.

> **Develop Good Taste by Emulating Great Writers**
> 
> In _Steal Like an Artist_ , Austin Kleon echoes Zinsser’s advice to take inspiration from great art and artists in any medium because doing so will help you create better art. Kleon compares the artistic process to genetics: Just like individuals are the products of the gene pools of each parent, art is the product of other art and ideas. While you can’t choose your DNA, you can carefully choose the art and artists you take inspiration from for your work.
> 
> Instead of thinking of other great artists as your competition or as an unattainable ideal, think of them as mentors. Kleon recommends studying one artist, her work, and what you like about her work. Kleon believes that by copying your mentor’s work and creative process, you’ll create something new. This is because you’ll inevitably fail to create a perfect copy of your mentor’s work, since it’s personal to her and her tastes, and the ways in which you’re different from your creative mentor will reveal your own unique strengths and develop your taste. For example, when she was a teenager, Joan Didion studied Ernest Hemingway’s writing, which influenced her own minimalist writing style. Despite their stylistic similarities, Joan Didion couldn’t write _The Old Man and the Sea_ , just like Ernest Hemingway couldn’t write _Slouching Towards Bethlehem_ —each story was personal to its writer.

When thinking about taste, keep these three key points in mind:

#### Don’t Be Breezy

When developing good taste, avoid being breezy. Zinsser explains breeziness as trying too hard to sound casual or friendly. Consider this breezy example: “Well guys, do I have a story for you! The other day, I took a jaunt over to the store, and I just couldn’t help myself—that bar of chocolate was calling my name.” As a result of breeziness, this writing sounds unnatural and unpleasant to read. If you wouldn’t talk like this, don’t write breezily either.

(Shortform note: E.B. White takes Zinsser’s idea one step further, stating breezy writing is the work of an egocentric person. He cautions that not _all_ of your thoughts are of interest to everyone. Find balance between being spontaneous and being thoughtful in your writing.)

#### Don't Be Condescending

When developing good taste, don’t make any creative decisions that make you sound condescending or like you’re talking down to your reader. Consider this example: “It’s actually really easy to avoid being condescending—obviously just don’t over-explain concepts. Most people already know this, but don’t make someone feel bad for not understanding something.”

To avoid being condescending, write like how you’d talk to a friend you respect. Be logical and thorough in your explanations, but trust readers to make obvious connections.

(Shortform note: To avoid sounding condescending, experts advise avoiding the words “actually” and “just.” These words give the impression that you’re talking down to your reader or oversimplifying a topic. Additionally, “simply,” “you should,” and “you know you can” are all condescending ways to start a sentence since they command a reader to do something or assume a reader’s level of knowledge.)

#### Don’t Use Clichés

When developing identity and good taste, your writing should sound unique, so avoid using clichés. Zinsser explains that clichés are phrases that are so overused that they lose all meaning and impact, and they ruin the chance to express something in a new and creative way.

Not only do clichés make you sound like an amateur writer, they don’t describe what you mean. For example, “She made it in the nick of time,” could be expressed in a better way. Maybe instead of using this cliché, you could describe how this person sped into the parking lot of her destination and rushed into the building. Think of different ways to show what you mean, instead of adding an overused cliché.

(Shortform note: Unlike Zinsser, some experts believe clichés are okay to use since they carry cultural context. Many clichés originated several decades ago—and sometimes hundreds of years ago—yet these clichés have stayed in use despite the changing nature of our language. Therefore, some experts believe clichés have survived for a reason—because they’re useful and speak to a shared culture. However, as with euphemisms (discussed earlier), readers won’t understand a cliché if they don’t have the cultural context for it. Therefore, you can make the creative decision on whether or not to use clichés.)

### Find Your Humanity

For unique and engaging writing, Zinsser believes that you must find _humanity_ , or the part of your writing that your reader will connect with. Humanity speaks to some shared experience or deeper truth about being human. For example, in _Educated_ , Tara Westover speaks to the experience of overcoming family limitations and the importance of education. These are deeper truths a reader can relate to, even if he didn’t grow up in a survivalist Mormon family.

Zinsser believes humanity is why people read stories about niche topics like fly-fishing or rock climbing. It’s not because everyone has a specific interest or knowledge of these things, but because we can relate to the people who do have a passion or interest in something. We resonate with someone’s resilience through hardship or search for meaning because most of us have had similar experiences. Consider what deeper truth your story speaks to.

> **How to Find the Humanity in Writing**
> 
> Writers are often told to “write what you know.” One expert believes this means that your writing should reveal an emotional truth you know rather than factual knowledge. She urges you to write from your values, experiences, and worldview because other people will relate to your perspective. Take the time to reflect on your views about the world, and see what inspiration you find.
> 
> If you’re still struggling to speak to some truth about humanity, consider referring to this list of common themes of humanity, such as the fear of failure, coming of age, corruption of power, or loss of innocence. You can probably think of personal experiences that relate to some of these themes—try writing about one of those experiences and discover what kind of insights naturally come through in your writing.
