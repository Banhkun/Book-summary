## Part 1.1: Simplicity

Zinsser believes anyone can learn to write well, and that while many writers think natural talent is the key to good writing, **writing is actually a _craft_.** As with any craft, you can hone your skills by practicing good fundamentals.

Even if you’re not a professional writer, you’ll find yourself in a position where you need to express an idea with words. Whether you’re crafting an email or a resume, you can apply Zinsser’s principles of writing.

Zinsser was a writer, journalist, and professor. He spent many years teaching writing courses at Yale and Columbia. This book is a distillation of his writing courses for nonfiction writers, but you can apply his ideas to other genres.

In Part 1 of this guide, we’ll talk about Zinsser’s three principles: simplicity, clarity, and identity. The first two principles discuss improving your writing on a technical and organizational level. The final principle involves developing your writing voice and being engaging. Then in Part 2, we’ll discuss specific advice Zinsser offers for constructing a piece of writing as well as common challenges of different nonfiction genres. Through commentary, we’ll add insights from other writers and ideas on how to apply Zinsser’s principles.

Zinsser’s first principle of good writing is simplicity. In this part, we’ll define simplicity and discuss how intentional word choices result in simplicity. We’ll also explain how eliminating types of clutter will simplify your writing.

### What Is Simplicity?

Simplicity means your writing is easy to understand. Simple writing uses common and precise words, constructs simple sentences, and omits clutter, thus making it less confusing for the reader.

(Shortform note: Zinsser’s belief in simple writing may have been influenced by Dr. Rudolf Flesch, who was a popular literacy expert throughout the mid-1900s. He advocated for short and straightforward writing, contending that it improved reading comprehension. His writings on the subject influenced the minimalist writing and editing style of the 20th century. Flesch even created literacy tests to assess the simplicity of a written passage.)

Zinsser advises that to write simply, you should follow these guidelines:

### Use Common Words

To avoid confusing your reader, write with smaller, more common words. Zinsser believes that a good rule of thumb is to write like you talk since we generally don’t use words with more than three or four syllables. If you wouldn’t say “pulchritudinous” in conversation with a friend, reconsider using it in your writing.

(Shortform note: Some writing experts offer another reason for using common words: People don’t appreciate feeling illiterate. They argue that writers who use complex words appear to be “showing off” and advise writers to get out of this habit. Researchers support this idea, citing overcomplicated writing and flowery language as a common reason manuscripts are rejected.)

Zinsser also advises against using large, complex words, such as jargon. Jargon is technical language used by a specific group of people, like doctors using medical terminology. Jargon overwhelms most readers because the general population doesn’t know the meaning of these specialized words.

(Shortform note: While Zinsser cautions against using jargon, other experts argue technical terms are sometimes warranted. Jargon serves a purpose: to describe specialized concepts. Sometimes it’s the most succinct term you can use to discuss an idea, in which case, using jargon aligns with Zinsser’s idea of simplicity. So if you’re specifically writing for an audience who will understand jargon, it’s okay to use it.)

### Use Precise Words

Simplifying your writing makes your meaning clearer with fewer words. To achieve simplicity, Zinsser advises choosing the best word to suit your meaning and tone. The best word is the one that accurately encapsulates the idea you want to convey. One precise word can do the job of three or four vague words.

For example, you could describe the color of an object as “a mix of blue and green,” or you could write “teal.” “Teal” is the better choice since it conveys in one word what “a mix of blue and green” says in six. By choosing one good word like “teal,” you convey meaning more efficiently.

Zinsser encourages writers to use a thesaurus and a dictionary when choosing words. Look up synonyms to words in your thesaurus, and use your dictionary to compare the nuances between their meanings. For example, you could describe the sun as “hot,” but also consider writing “boiling” or “scorching.” One word might offer more nuance or meaning than the others, thus making it a better choice.

> **Good Writing Doesn’t Require an Extensive Vocabulary**
> 
> While Zinsser encourages both simple and precise word choices, sometimes the most precise word isn’t the simplest or most natural. For example, “susurration” might be more precise, but “murmur” is the simpler choice. Stephen King echoes this idea, and he believes that while an advanced vocabulary can lead to good writing, it isn’t a requirement for it. Here are two examples:
> 
> 1) “The leathery, undeteriorative, and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing's form of organization, and pertained to some paleogean cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our powers of speculation.”—H. P. Lovecraft, _At the Mountains of Madness_
> 
> 2) “The foundations of the Mansion House hotel stuck up above the ground. The stone was chipped and split by the fire. It was all that was left of the town of Seney.”—Ernest Hemingway, _Big Two-Hearted River_
> 
> Both excerpts illustrate good writing while using different vocabulary levels. King encourages writers to use whatever vocabulary they have. Don’t mull over your vocabulary and conjure fancy words you wouldn’t ordinarily use. The first word that comes to mind is often the best one.

#### Choose Precise Verbs

Zinsser recommends being particularly precise when choosing verbs, or words that convey action, such as “hopped” or “leapt.” Verbs convey meaning and imagery—for example, when you picture someone “hopping,” you picture something different than someone “leaping.”

Since verbs convey multiple kinds of information, one precise verb will do the job of a vague verb and several adjectives. If a writer uses one specific verb like "leapt," it can condense a longer phrase, such as "pushed off her feet and into the air.” You’ll convey more information in fewer words, thus simplifying your sentence.

> **Counterpoint: Don’t Overdo Descriptive Verbs**
> 
> Unlike Zinsser, some experts caution against making your verbs too descriptive, saying that common words like “go” and “see” are common for a reason: They’re useful. These experts recommend using more expressive verbs only when you want to call attention to the manner of that action. For example:
> 
>   * “Martha walked down the aisle.”
> 
>   * “Martha ambled down the aisle.”
> 
> 

> 
> Decide what parts of the sentence are important and highlight them with your words. Is the particular way she walked important? Was Martha actually ambling, or was she truly just walking? Your verbs should tell the reader something important, not provide detail for the sake of detail.

### Construct Simple Sentences

Zinsser also recommends writing with straightforward sentence structures. A simple sentence structure clearly conveys the subject of the sentence and the action they are performing. These sentences are easier for readers to follow.

(Shortform note: There may be a scientific reason to use simpler sentence constructions. While researchers don’t know everything about how the human brain understands sentence meaning, some experts believe that we speed up the processing of simple sentences since our brains can more easily predict where the sentence is going.)

Writing in active voice is the easiest way to construct straightforward sentences. Active voice describes a subject performing an action: For example, “John will drive my car.” This differs from passive voice, which describes an event or action that happens to someone: For example, “My car will be driven by John.” Active voice is simpler, more direct, and less cluttered than passive voice, which is wordy and indirect.

> **When Should You Use Passive Voice?**
> 
> As Zinsser implies, voice refers to the relationship between a verb and the subject and object it’s associated with. Only use passive voice when the object—not the subject—of the sentence is the focus. Rather than highlighting the subject at the beginning of the sentence using active voice, passive voice flips the sentence around, focusing on the “what,” not the “who” that did the “what.”
> 
> For instance, lawyers defending someone who committed a crime might use passive voice to intentionally be less direct about the actions of their defendant. For example, instead of saying “Mr. Smith robbed the bank,” a lawyer might say, “The bank was robbed.” Passive voice obscures the focus of _who_ robbed the bank and reframes the sentence onto the object—the bank—of the robbing.

However, Zinsser notes that simple writing doesn’t equate to being boring or juvenile. Consider the difference between these two sentences:

  * “I heard a plane in the blue sky.”
  * “I heard the sonic rip of a military jet, like a giant trowel being dragged through wet concrete, but saw only blue above, a raw and saturated blue that seemed cut from an inner wedge of sky.” —Rachel Kushner, _The Flamethrowers_



Although the two sentences convey the same idea, the second sentence is more descriptive than the first sentence. However, the second sentence still follows Zinsser’s principle of simplicity, using small words and an easy-to-follow sentence structure.

> **Simplicity in Action: Hemingway vs. Faulkner**
> 
> Ernest Hemingway was famous for writing as Zinsser recommends, with simple words and sentences. But not every great writer completely subscribes to the idea of keeping things short and simple. William Faulkner—Hemingway’s stylistic opposite—used long sentences and complex words. He also explored stream of consciousness writing, which explores the numerous thoughts and feelings of a narrator and tends to be more complex.
> 
> However, Faulkner’s complexity didn’t violate all of Zinsser’s rules on simplicity. He took a disciplined approach to diction and the cadence of words. Consider this sentence from Faulkner’s “The Bear”:
> 
> “But this time it was no deer, no ringing chorus of dogs running strong on a free scent, but a moiling yapping an octave too high, with something more than indecision and even abjectness in it, not even moving very fast, taking a long time to pass completely out of hearing, leaving then somewhere in the air that echo, thin, slightly hysterical, abject, almost grieving, with no sense of a fleeing, unseen, smoke-colored, grass-eating shape ahead of it, and Sam, who had taught him first of all to cock the gun and take position where he could see everywhere and then never move again, had himself moved up beside him; he could hear Sam breathing at his shoulder, and he could see the arched curve of the old man’s inhaling nostrils.”
> 
> To counteract this sentence’s long and winding structure, Faulkner keeps the majority of words simple so the reader can easily follow along. Zinsser’s principle of simplicity is still reflected in this example, even if it looks different in Faulkner’s specific style.

### Eliminate Clutter

Zinsser asserts that simple writing can’t have clutter. Clutter is a word or phrase that doesn’t add meaning to your sentence, thus needlessly increasing the number of words in your sentence. Zinsser believes that it’s your job as a writer to carefully select the right words and delete clutter—this is part of what makes writing a craft.

Zinsser explains that by adding redundant words to your sentences, clutter forces the reader to do unnecessary work to understand your meaning. She might not have the patience to read a page of information that could be condensed to a paragraph. She’ll lose interest and stop reading.

If you think a word or phrase is clutter, Zinsser suggests bracketing it, rather than marking it out. Then you can analyze the sentence with and without the bracketed section. Decide if it adds anything to the sentence—if not, it’s clutter and should be deleted. Bracketing will train you to look for clutter and to make conscious decisions about what to include in your writing.

For example, imagine a memo that reads, “We’re in the process of renovating our offices.” This sentence could be revised to, “We’re renovating our offices.” Readers understand that renovations are a process, so “in the process of” is clutter and can be omitted without losing information.

> **Clutter and Cutting the Fat**
> 
> Another way to think of clutter is to consider your writing like a nutritious meal. Eliminating clutter is “cutting the fat” of writing—anything that’s unnecessary and doesn’t add value to the “meat” or substance of what you’re saying. Then add descriptions to your writing—this is like the fruits, vegetables, and sauces that add color and flavor to your meal. The key is to create a balanced meal by eliminating unhealthy fat.
> 
> If you’re struggling to cut the fat (and bracketing doesn’t work), try using an online editor like the Hemingway App. This tool highlights hard-to-read sentences, adverbs, passive voice, and other ways your writing may sound confusing. Like Zinsser’s bracketing technique, this lets you evaluate your writing and make thoughtful changes. But be careful not to rely exclusively on these kinds of tools—they shouldn’t be a crutch. Rather, they should help you develop a keener eye for words that aren’t doing necessary work.

Let’s look at a few common types of clutter. If you come across them in your writing, bracket them.

#### Wordy Phrases

Zinsser argues that wordy phrases can be a source of clutter if those phrases take the place of single words that have the same meaning. For example, “in the event that” or “for the purpose of” are both common phrases that create clutter. In this case, you can reduce these phrases to “if” and “for” since these words concisely convey the idea of the phrases.

To eliminate clutter, choose the word instead of the phrase. The word is usually better at conveying the meaning anyway—it has a purpose and a place in our language for a reason. For example, “During the course of the investigation, prosecutors found evidence.” “During” means “throughout the course or duration of.” To say “during the course of” is redundant, and could be simplified to, “During the investigation, prosecutors found evidence.”

> **Don’t Clear Your Throat on Paper**
> 
> Some experts refer to these wordy phrases as a form of “throat-clearing,” or a preamble to your writing. Throat-clearing prepares the reader for what they’re about to read rather than getting to the point of the sentence or story. This habit is the written equivalent of “like,” “um,” and “uh” for public speakers—it’s filler. It often has the effect of making a writer sound insecure or unsure of what she’s writing.
> 
> Experts note that these “throat-clearing” phrases can be omitted without losing any meaning:
> 
>   * It is important to note that…
> 
>   * I further point out that…
> 
>   * An important aspect, which must not be overlooked, is that…
> 
>   * It would appear to be the case that…
> 
>   * It should be emphasized that…
> 
> 

> 
> Use these phrases to pinpoint ideas in your writing that need to be emphasized or developed. Then expand on those ideas, and delete those phrases from your draft.

#### Euphemisms

To achieve simplicity, Zinsser also recommends avoiding euphemisms: words or phrases that indirectly talk about a taboo or embarrassing topic. Euphemisms complicate your writing because readers must interpret your true meaning. For example, “it left a lot to be desired” is an indirect and more complex way of saying, “it was bad.”

> **The Cultural Context of Euphemisms**
> 
> In addition to being a source of clutter, other experts believe that euphemisms are culturally dependent phrases and therefore may not be understood by people outside your culture. Misunderstandings can arise because euphemisms can be shaped by truths unique to particular nationalities, so the full connotation of a phrase may not be readily apparent.
> 
>   * For example, American euphemisms obscure words that aren’t offensive to begin with. For example, “in the family way” replaces “pregnant,” and “previously owned” replaces “used.” Some researchers believe this reflects the American pursuit of perfection.
> 
>   * In contrast, euphemisms in China reflect a value of respect and politeness. For example, rather than directly turn down an invitation, someone might say that something is “not convenient,” which people understand to mean “no.”
> 
> 

> 
> While euphemisms serve a purpose in verbal communication, not everyone will understand the cultural context behind these phrases. Therefore, reconsider using euphemisms in your writing.

#### Adverbs

Zinsser contends that adverbs are one of the most common sources of clutter for writers, and they signal areas where you can condense two or more words into one. Adverbs modify verbs, explaining _how_ someone does something. They often end in “-ly.” For example, “loudly,” “quietly,” and “slowly” are all adverbs that describe how someone might perform an action.

Adverbs are clutter because a verb already implies how someone is performing that action. For example, writing “ran quickly” is redundant since “run” already implies quickness. So including “quickly” doesn’t add anything to the reader’s understanding. If a verb doesn’t convey the meaning of the adverb, find a more specific verb.

Zinsser recommends that when you find yourself using many adverbs, go back and bracket them with the verb they modify. Decide if your verb already conveys the meaning of the adverb. If it does, delete the adverb. If it doesn’t, consult your dictionary or thesaurus to find one word that captures the meaning of the two words you bracketed.

For example, “while the dog slept peacefully in the corner, a mouse quickly ran away from the cat.” Bracket the adverbs with the verbs they modify: “While the dog [slept peacefully] in the corner, a mouse [quickly ran] away from the cat.” What word could replace “slept peacefully”? Consider slumbered, dozed, or napped. What word could replace “quickly ran”? Consider scurried, dashed, or darted.

> **How to Avoid Adverbs: Describe Context, Not Action**
> 
> Like Zinsser, Stephen King also advises against using adverbs, particularly in dialogue. Weak writers use adverbs in dialogue to break up the monotony, as in “‘Put down the gun,’ Sean pleaded tentatively.” King recommends deleting the adverb and defaulting to the simple “he said, she said” dialogue construction.
> 
> Then, instead of describing how he said something, describe the context of the situation. For example, you might explain that Sean felt his heart rate quicken or noticed his breath becoming shallow. If you describe a timid character in a frightening situation (such as having a gun pointed at him), the reader will make the connection that he was tentative or scared when he said, “Put down the gun.” Thus the context will provide more information than overexplaining how an action was performed.

#### Adjectives

Zinsser cautions against using many adjectives because they can be redundant, thus creating clutter. Adjectives describe nouns and provide detail. But some nouns already convey the idea of the adjective. For example, writing “the green grass” is redundant because grass is naturally green. But if the grass was “brown” or “dying,” including those adjectives adds detail your reader didn’t already know.

Zinsser believes you should use adjectives sparingly. Then when you do use an adjective, it’ll be more impactful because it’ll add detail that the reader couldn’t have inferred from the noun or verb.

> **Interpretive vs. Descriptive Adjectives**
> 
> Since Zinsser advises against using many adjectives, how do you provide detail in your writing? Other writers argue that the _type_ of adjective you use matters. They recommend that you avoid interpretive adjectives, or adjectives that are imprecise because they are up to the reader’s interpretation. For example, “the impressive building” doesn’t provide much detail. “Impressive” is up to the reader’s interpretation—what kind of building does she think is impressive? Two impressive buildings might not look anything alike.
> 
> Instead of interpretive adjectives, opt for descriptive adjectives. These are adjectives that are less likely to be misinterpreted because they reflect an objective truth or observation. For example, saying “the ornate Victorian manor” or “the contemporary white house” is more descriptive than “impressive building.”

#### Qualifiers

Another way to simplify your writing is to avoid qualifiers, or words that modify the meaning of other words (particularly nouns) rather than adding meaning of their own. For example, “really,” “probably,” “I think,” and “very” are all qualifiers.

To simplify your writing, Zinsser recommends finding one word that encapsulates the meaning behind your modifier and the word it’s modifying. For example, instead of writing “fairly cold,” consider “cool.” You’ll use fewer words while also providing a more accurate description, thus achieving simpler writing.

> **Identify Your Crutch Words**
> 
> For many writers, qualifiers fall under the category of “crutch words.” These are the words that each writer personally falls back on and uses too often. One expert recommends _always_ deleting “very,” “quite,” and “really” since they make your writing sound weaker.
> 
> She also suggests creating a list of your personal crutch words. To do this, read through your writing and find your most overused words and phrases. You can also use a text reading software to read your work to you. Often, hearing your work can highlight your crutch words.
> 
> Once you’ve identified your common crutch words, refer to this list when editing your drafts. If you’re using a computer, try using a Find or text search tool to search for each word or phrase. Then eliminate your crutch words or find synonyms to replace them with a more precise word.

### Embrace Rewriting

While you should strive to write with simplicity, don’t expect your first draft to be perfect—there will be clutter and imprecise words in your draft that you’ll need to edit. Zinsser recommends embracing rewriting, or the act of improving what you’ve already written. By rewriting, you’ll find better, simplified ways of expressing your ideas.

While many writers avoid rewriting, Zinsser believes all great writers revise their work—no one writes a masterpiece on the first try. Rewriting is part of the writing process, so don’t skip this crucial step.

(Shortform note: If you’re worried that needing to rewrite means you’re not a talented writer, don’t: Most great artists refine their work from the first draft to the final product as Zinsser recommends. Some _never_ stop fine-tuning their art: Leonardo Da Vinci worked on versions of the Mona Lisa for years up until his death.)

Zinsser explains that to rewrite, use your first draft as a guide, and restructure confusing sentences. Delete clutter, and rephrase words or sentences that could be more succinct.

Additionally, test the simplicity of your writing by reading your work out loud. Reading your writing out loud will indicate which sentences need reworking. If you trip over words or phrases, it’s a sign to rewrite it more simply.

> **Try Stephen King’s Rewriting Process**
> 
> If you’re having difficulty rewriting—and most writers do—don’t get discouraged. Finding your rewriting style takes time. Many famous writers have their own unique methods of revising. For example, Joan Didion marked edits at night after a day of writing and then made those edits the next morning to kickstart another day of writing.
> 
> In _On Writing_ , Stephen King outlines his revision process from beginning to end:
> 
> 1) After you finish your first draft, King suggests taking at least six weeks to work on other pieces before you start rewriting your draft. During this time, resist the temptation to read your draft. The point is to distance yourself from the draft, so you can be a more objective critic when you revise.
> 
> 2) After six weeks, read the draft in one sitting, if possible. Note fixes for specific issues, like deleting adverbs. Also ask yourself big-picture questions. What is the piece about? Is there a theme? Are there recurring elements? Is the story coherent?
> 
> 3) Go back through and revise for your second draft. Fix small issues and polish your big picture ideas.
> 
> 4) After you finish, give the second draft to a small group of readers you trust. Listen to their feedback. Incorporate the feedback as you like. The result can be your next draft, or even your final draft.
> 
> 5) Use however many revision cycles you’re comfortable with. King’s standard process takes two drafts and a final polish.
> 
> The next time you sit down to rewrite, consider using King’s process.
