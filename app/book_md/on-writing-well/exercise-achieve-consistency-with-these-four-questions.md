## Exercise: Achieve Consistency With These Four Questions

Zinsser says that to write consistently, you should answer four guiding questions about your main idea, point of view, tense, and tone.

* * *

Think of your current writing project. It could be an essay, travel guide, or letter—any kind of writing. What’s the main idea of this piece of writing? What’s the one thing you want your reader to take away from your writing?

How will you address the reader? What point of view is most appropriate for this piece of writing, and why?

What tense will you use? Why will this work best?

What tone will you use? What is your attitude—as the writer—to the piece? For example, if you’re writing an article about a political protest, your tone might be more serious than if you wrote a more conversational review of a new movie.
