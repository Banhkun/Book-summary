## Part 2.2: Creative Nonfiction

Now that you have the basics for writing well in any genre, let’s discuss Zinsser’s specific advice for _nonfiction_ writing. To write better nonfiction, first dispel the myth that nonfiction is boring. Some people have the misconception that nonfiction writing is uncreative, especially when compared to fiction. But Zinsser contends that this isn’t true. **Nonfiction writing allows us to creatively explore the truth of everyday life and the experience of being human.**

The benefit to writing nonfiction is that you have many people, places, and lives to draw inspiration from without the pressure of creating fictional characters, places, or events. Zinsser encourages writers to be interested in new ideas and experiences because these will give you more engaging topics to write about.

> **The Blurry Line Between Nonfiction and Fiction**
> 
> Experts expand on Zinsser’s idea that nonfiction can be as creative and engaging as fiction, contending that the line between fiction and nonfiction can be a blurry one. There are many fictional stories based heavily on real events, and there are many nonfiction stories that take liberties with the definition of “truth.”
> 
> For example,_The Things They Carried_ by Tim O’Brien discusses the narrator’s (whose name is also Tim O’Brien) experience in the Vietnam War—yet the book is classified as historical fiction. Conversely, in Annie Dillard’s nonfiction book _Pilgrim at Tinker Creek_ , the opening paragraph of her story describes an experience that didn’t actually happen to Dillard—she adapted the story from someone else’s experience. Thus one main difference between the genres is whether the writer categorizes the work as fiction or nonfiction, thus drawing their own line between fiction and nonfiction.

By writing simply, clearly, and in your own voice, you’ll have the skills to write in any genre. But writing engaging nonfiction also has its challenges. Zinsser discusses eight specific genres of nonfiction and common problems writers face when writing in these genres.

### Interviews

Zinsser encourages writers to include interviews incorporating direct quotes and information from another person into their pieces. By including someone else’s perspective in their own words—not yours—your writing will have more humanity and be more engaging.

(Shortform note: Other experts also encourage the use of interviews, noting that they can engage your reader through _pathos_ —an emotional appeal to your audience. By discussing a topic with someone who knows about or is directly affected by it, you’ll connect with your reader. For example, a news story about a flood will be more engaging if the journalist includes an interview with a family whose home was destroyed by the flood than if the journalist just gave the statistics about the flood damage.)

To conduct a good interview, Zinsser offers these steps:

1) Identify who you want to interview. Find someone who knows about the topic you’re covering or would be an interesting profile. Be sincere about your interest in this person and what they have to say. Don’t worry about inconveniencing them with an interview—most people jump at the chance to talk about themselves.

2) Start talking to them, and wait for them to get comfortable. This may mean talking to them multiple times as you gain their trust. You also shouldn’t start taking physical notes yet—that’s a quick way to ensure someone _doesn’t_ relax.

3) As you interview them, find what’s interesting. Don’t be afraid if you don’t know anything about that person’s field. If you don’t know anything about the topic, the average reader probably doesn’t either. Use your lack of knowledge to help guide the interviewee to tell you what you (and ultimately the reader) need to know, and don’t be afraid to ask dumb questions.

4) Be prepared to tell your interviewee to stop so you have time to write things down. Zinsser recommends physically writing things down rather than recording your interview because writing is the whole point. If you record the interview, you become an audio editor. You also risk technological malfunctions with your recorder. In some instances, a recorder can be helpful (such as for capturing diction), but in general, write physical notes.

5) Don’t be afraid to call your interviewee after your conversation if you need clarification on any quotes or ideas.

6) When incorporating the interview into your piece, be sure to uphold the integrity of your interviewee, but also don’t be afraid to rearrange and edit quotes if you can preserve the speaker’s meaning. Doing so is part of your role as a writer and interviewer: to make your interviewee sound good.

> **Tips for Interviewing**
> 
> As Zinsser notes, interviews can be intimidating for many writers. But don’t let this stop you from doing an interview. Your first few interviews may not go smoothly, but you’ll develop your skills the more you do them. Experts also offer tips for conducting a good interview:
> 
> Before the interview:
> 
> 1) **Choose the interview format**. Experts recommend phone calls, video calls, or in-person meetings, but avoid email because you’ll miss important things like tone and facial expressions. Decide which format is right for your story. For example, if you’re doing a profile of the person you’re interviewing, it’s better to meet in person or on a video call. This will give you more detail to work with—what were they wearing? How did they say that line? What kind of mannerisms did they have?
> 
> 2)**Come prepared**. While Zinsser advises against using recorders, some journalists use them. But always have a backup—either use two recorders or one recorder and handwritten notes. That way, if your recorder malfunctions, you won’t lose your interview.
> 
> 3) **If possible, don’t give the interviewee questions in advance**. If your interviewee over-prepares, you won’t get as many honest, casual answers during the interview. The spontaneity will force you to listen critically in the interview so you can ask a relevant follow-up question to their answers.
> 
> 4)**Introduce yourself**. Let your interviewee know who you are, what you’re writing, and what publication you’re writing for (if any). This lets them know upfront who you are and where they stand with you.
> 
> During the interview:
> 
> 1) **Be yourself**. An interview is just a conversation to learn more about a person or subject. So don’t turn into a stuffier or more robotic version of yourself, otherwise people won’t feel comfortable enough to talk to you.
> 
> 2) **Let your interviewee talk** —be an active listener and avoid interrupting him.
> 
> 3) **Give yourself enough time to talk to each other** —generally this means at least 30 minutes.
> 
> 4) **Stay focused**. If you and your interviewee explore a tangent, be sure to get back on track to your main point.
> 
> 5) **Be courteous and respectful to your interviewee**. This means letting them know you’re recording (if you are) and saying thank you afterward. If possible, send your interviewee the published article.

### Humor

Humor is a writing form that uses a lighthearted or funny approach to reveal absurd or harsh truths about humanity. Zinsser believes sometimes not being “serious” is the best and only way to talk about serious topics, like war, famine, violence, and so on.

For example, in “Thirty-Nine Rules for Making a Hawaiian Funeral into a Drinking Game,” Kristiana Kahakauwila reveals truths about family dynamics and cultural traditions through turning the emotional experience of a funeral into a humorous drinking game.

If you’re writing and find something humorous, include it. Zinsser advises against worrying about whether or not people will think it’s funny—if you genuinely think it’s funny, someone else will too. And you can always change your mind about it later.

Zinsser provides a few tips for writing humor:

  * Be comfortable writing well _without_ humor. You should be comfortable with the fundamentals of writing instead of relying on humor to cover up a lack of writing skill. 
  * Don’t be afraid to talk about everyday life, rather than seeking out quirky topics. Even something mundane can be turned into humor. 
  * Don’t force humor. Understand that humor is subjective and not everyone will find your humor funny. Let it come naturally, and people will either gravitate toward your humor or not.
  * Don’t use exclamation marks. Humor is best written subtly, and an exclamation point will ruin that. 
  * Avoid overstatements. Like exclamation marks, overstatements aren’t subtle. 



> **How to Write Humor**
> 
> If you’re struggling to write humor, first try identifying your own sense of humor. What do you find funny? One-liners? Wit? Sarcasm? Dark humor? Anecdotes? Self-deprecation? Read different types of humor to identify your style. Once you’ve identified your humor, try drawing from your personal experience for inspiration. What kind of funny anecdotes could you write about?
> 
> Once you’ve identified what type of humor you like, you can incorporate it into your writing. David Sedaris offers a few tips for writing humor:
> 
>   * Test out your humor in a casual situation. Tell your story to friends or family and include the humor—did they laugh? If not, consider workshopping the story or joke.
> 
>   * Be honest about your own flaws. The more honest you are about yourself, the more relatable you’ll be to your audience. And readers enjoy personal accounts that they can relate to.
> 
>   * Don’t be afraid of writing about a negative or sad personal experience. You can connect with your audience on a deeper level when you explore a wider range of emotions.
> 
>   * Unlike Zinsser, Sedaris encourages exaggerating parts of your story. Doing so will highlight the ridiculousness of a situation.
> 
> 

> 
> The next time you’re writing, try some of these tips to incorporate humor to connect with your reader through laughter.

### Travel

Travel writing describes a place, the people who live there, and what it’s like to be there. But these features should reveal a deeper truth about the city or its people. What’s special about this place and its people?

But travel writers fall into some common traps:

1) **Switching attitudes** : Writers often start by casually telling readers about their experiences in a new place before changing to a more detached travel guide style. Pick one tone, and keep it consistent throughout the piece.

(Shortform note: To avoid switching attitudes, experts recommend following one narrative thread throughout your travel writing. Doing so will link your piece from beginning to end, creating cohesion. With one main narrative thread, you’ll also be less likely to explore different facts about the place that will cause you to sound like a typical travel guide. For example, in “Heart of Dark Chocolate,” the author begins the piece by describing first tasting Bolivian chocolate and how that compelled him to travel to Bolivia to discover the source of the chocolate. Through this narrative thread, we learn about Bolivia, the rainforest, the cuisine, and the people there.)

2) **False** **novelty** : Keep in mind that you are not the first or only person to visit or live in this place. Many people have already visited Paris and described the city’s fashion and the Eiffel Tower—what makes your experience of this place different from everyone else’s?

> **Write Original Stories by Traveling Without Expectations**
> 
> To avoid false novelty, you should rethink how you _travel_ , not just how you _write_ _about_ traveling. In his essay “How To Write About Africa,” Kenyan author Binyavanga Wainaina exposes the hurtful and demeaning common attitudes of travelers who visit Africa. He implies that many travelers go to Africa with an idea of what Africa _should be_ and then write about experiences that confirm those biases, rather than experiencing anything meaningful about Africa. This kind of travel results in travel stories that discuss the same experiences, descriptions, and tourist destinations.
> 
> Experts agree with Wainaina’s idea—they find that by expecting certain experiences, travelers may actually be less likely to find authentic, original travel stories or even enjoy their trip for what it is. Instead, focus on learning about this place and its people, rather than supporting existing ideas or expectations about what that place already is or isn’t.

3) **Using** **clichés** : Writers often describe busy Middle Eastern “bazaars” and “exotic” safari trips. These are unoriginal, overused descriptions, and Zinsser advises against using them.

(Shortform note: As you write about your travels, consult this list of common travel clichés to eliminate from your piece, including “a breathtaking view,” “off the beaten path,” and “a blend of old and new.”)

4) **Stating** **the obvious** : When describing a new place, writers often state the obvious, such as discussing the desert heat. Heat is a standard characteristic of a desert, so telling the reader this detail is redundant.

(Shortform note: Zinsser doesn’t discuss it here, but stating the obvious is a form of clutter. It creates redundancy and uses more words than necessary. But adding _unexpected_ details does add value, like if there was a random thunderstorm in the desert.)

5) **Lacking** **humanity** : Travel writers often describe the things you can do in a city or the typical food there, resulting in a detached and impersonal tone. But these features don’t reveal any deeper truth about the city or its people. What’s special about this place and its people?

(Shortform note: When thinking about Zinsser’s idea of travel writing as understanding the humanity of a place and its people, consider Erich Fromm’s distinction between looking and seeing to improve your ability to find and write deeper truths about a place and its people. He relates _looking to an interest in lifeless, immobile artifacts_. But unlike simply _looking_ at something, _seeing_ implies a recognition of the life or humanity in something. Seeing requires embracing your own humanity, openness, and interest in the world. So rather than trying to use your writing as a form of looking, write with the intent to _see_ the life of a place and its people.)

### Sports

Sportswriting is a form of nonfiction that reports on topics involving sports, such as athletes, games, and competitions. Zinsser notes two problems sportswriters face: making the story about them and flaunting their knowledge.

First, while Zinsser recommends writing from your own perspective, don’t make a story all about you. He believes sportswriters often make themselves and their knowledge the focus rather than the athlete or the game. For example, you can report on a professional basketball game without describing your personal history of playing basketball in grade school.

Second, many sportswriters flaunt their knowledge by describing what it’s like to be an athlete or to suffer a particular injury. But sportswriters don’t have the expertise to comment on the mindset of a certain athlete or to explain what an injury felt like.

> **Types of Sports Stories**
> 
> Zinsser discusses common problems with sportswriting, but he doesn’t expand on the purpose or different types of sportswriting. To improve your sportswriting, first identify the key components of any sports story: the highlights of the game, the team names, the score, and when and where the game took place. Make these elements the most important part of the story—details and commentary should only support these main elements.
> 
> Then identify what kind of sports story you’re writing. There are five main types of sportswriting:
> 
> 1) **Straight-Lead Game Story** : This is the most common kind of sportswriting, and it provides a basic summary of the game. You should quickly present the final score, who won, and what the star player did during the game.
> 
> 2) **Feature Game Story** : These stories present a fresh look at a game and are more in-depth than a straight-lead game story. For example, you could discuss the coach’s background to give more context to the game. However, the game should be the focus, not your opinion.
> 
> 3) **Columns** : If you’re writing a column, your opinions _will_ be a focal point of the piece. You can share your thoughts or frustrations with a team, coach, player, or game.
> 
> 4) **Profiles** : Profiles discuss the story and experiences of an individual person, such as an athlete or coach.
> 
> 5) **Season Preview or Wrap-Up** : These stories provide a top-level, general look at a game season. Preview stories illustrate expectations of an upcoming game season, including predictions or attitudes about the teams. Wrap-up stories discuss the game season as a whole after it has ended.

### Criticisms

Zinsser explains that criticisms are another popular form of nonfiction, where an author reviews the artistic merit of a creative work. This work can be in any medium, such as visual art, literature, cinema, and so on. He believes that the writer should appreciate and be familiar with the medium as a whole since criticisms situate the work into the broader context of other similar works. For example, when writing a review of _Ferris Bueller’s Day Off_ , you could situate the reader into the genre of 1980’s teen movies, such as _The Breakfast Club_ and _Grease_.

(Shortform note: Zinsser focuses on using criticisms to situate readers into the broader context of a genre. But in _How to Read a Book_ , Mortimer J. Adler and Charles van Doren explain that criticizing a book means to comment, “I agree,” “I disagree,” or “I suspend judgment.” Their views can also be adapted for other media. When you’re criticizing an author, Adler and Van Doren caution against being overly contentious or combative. A discussion isn’t something to be won: It’s an opportunity to discover the truth. Remember that disagreement is an opportunity to learn something new.)

Zinsser provides advice for critics:

1)**Go into the criticism with an open mind.** If you anticipate hating the movie or book you’re critiquing, this will alter your perception—and your writing—of the work. Zinsser believes a critic who is negative about everything she reviews is being lazy.

(Shortform note: In _How to Read a Book_ , Mortimer J. Adler and Charles van Doren agree with Zinsser’s advice to have an open mind when criticizing. They encourage you to earnestly try to take the author’s point of view as you read. They also advise against playing devil’s advocate by default. Don’t resent the author for being right or teaching you something new.)

2)**Don’t be too technical**. Zinsser argues that writers use jargon to sound intelligent, like mentioning a specific camera technique in film. Because most readers lack this technical vocabulary, they won’t understand these references.

(Shortform note: While you should avoid using jargon, other experts believe it’s okay to comment on technical aspects, such as the camera angles in a movie. But pointing out these technical aspects should support a larger idea, like how the camera angle creates a certain mood, not just pointing out a technique for the sake of pointing it out. When pointed out to support your commentary, it can enhance your piece since it will provide more description for the reader.)

3)**Avoid spoilers**. Don’t explain the whole plot of the novel or movie. Instead, give the reader enough information to determine whether or not she wants to read or see the work.

(Shortform note: Many people claim to dislike spoilers since they only have one chance to experience a creative work for the first time—after that the ending is automatically spoiled. But a study found that spoiling a story may actually increase someone’s enjoyment of the work since they’ll be able to make connections about important elements and themes of the story. If you’re unsure about whether to include a spoiler, try including a disclaimer before the portion of the article that contains spoilers, allowing the reader to choose whether or not to spoil the creative work for themselves.)

4)**Show, don’t tell**. Use examples and descriptions of the artist’s work to illustrate the point you’re making. For example, rather than saying the costumes were drab or boring, write about how the muted brown dress hung loosely on the protagonist.

(Shortform note: Experts explain that _showing what you saw is the first step in critiquing a work_. You must first describe what you saw, so that you can then analyze, interpret, and evaluate the work—if you don’t provide any descriptions, your reader won’t have the necessary context to understand why you arrived at your conclusion of the piece.)

5)**Be confident about your perspective on the work**. Don’t backtrack on what you said with phrases like “but it’s too soon to tell.” This undermines your credibility as a critic.

(Shortform note: In _How to Read a Book_ , Mortimer J. Adler and Charles van Doren give another reason to confidently express your perspective. They believe that if you don’t acknowledge and express the feelings that come up as you experience the work, those feelings will fester and actually _prevent_ you from evaluating the piece with a clear head.)****

### Memoir

In a memoir, a writer describes a specific event or point in time that he experienced. Zinsser explains that unlike an autobiography—which discusses the writer’s life story—a memoir has a narrow focus. If you want to write a memoir, Zinsser recommends picking a specific idea, moment, or theme from your personal experience. Then write about that instance in depth, conveying the importance of that idea to you and your life. The more detailed you can be, the better. Details will paint a more complete picture of this idea or moment.

Zinsser notes that memoir writers are often timid about writing for or about themselves. He believes your story—whatever it is—is important and worth writing. Don’t doubt yourself or wonder if people will want to read it—they will.

> **The Exploitation of Trauma in Online Publishing**
> 
> Unlike Zinsser, other experts caution writers against narrowing your focus on certain kinds of personal stories since not everyone will be receptive to some kinds of experiences—particularly traumatic ones. When writing about your personal experiences, consider the ramifications of how your story may be received, affect your job opportunities, or alter your relationship with loved ones.
> 
> Many writers and editors have noticed a shift in what kinds of personal stories are in demand, stating that stories centered around intense trauma and hardship are published more than others. Experts admit that these intense stories often receive more attention, particularly online, than less extreme pieces. This publication environment places a premium on revealing trauma, thus creating an unhealthy relationship between increasing monetization or clicks and oversharing complex experiences. But many editors now worry about whether or not a writer can handle the stress of having these stories published and forever associated with their name on the internet.
> 
> While in some cases, these stories may be therapeutic to write, the authors of the pieces can face backlash and judgment from readers. Some writers who have published their stories note that it’s now _harder_ for them to write about their personal experiences after the scrutiny they faced in the past, stating that they would now reconsider publishing those stories.

### Science and Technology

Science and technology writing is a nonfiction genre that centers on technical subjects. Zinsser argues that science and technical writers often lack humanity in their pieces, resulting in an overly-logical and impersonal article. To avoid this, write like yourself, not a robot. Imagine how you’d explain this subject to a friend or family member in a casual conversation, then translate that onto paper.

Zinsser recommends focusing on humanity first and incorporating extra information later if it really adds anything to your story. People don’t want to read through lots of statistics, numbers, and studies even when reading about science and technology. That doesn’t mean you can’t include statistics or studies in your writing, but don’t overdo it—otherwise your article will quickly sound impersonal.

> **Incorporate Humanity Into Your Writing by Telling a Story About Real People**
> 
> To incorporate humanity into science and technology writing, tell a story about real people. Many science writers think that explaining the widespread effects of an issue will persuade their audience of an issue’s importance. But this approach relies on the abstract principles of the problem. Instead, be specific by discussing a real person or group and how this research affects them. Your reader can relate to this person and understand the effects through this lens.
> 
> For example, Michael Lewis uses this approach in many of his books—he blends technical information and narrative, thus making his research more digestible. In _Flash Boys_ , he discusses the complexities of the US stock market and high-frequency trading through the story of an individual trader who figured out the nuances of these unfair trading techniques. Through this trader’s narrative, the reader learns about the information on a more personal level.

### Business

In most companies, employees use some form of written communication, such as emails, memos, copywriting, newsletters, or social media captions. All of these different forms are types of business writing. Zinsser believes his principles of simplicity and clarity are important for business writing—employees and customers who read business writing should understand it. Remember that your whole purpose in writing is to convey an idea to someone. If no one understands your confusing email or memo, why write it?

Zinsser notes that it can be easy to stray from simplicity in business communication. Like scientific or technical writing, business writers often use jargon and confusing sentences to sound important or intelligent. But Zinsser explains that this kind of complex writing confuses a reader and makes her think a company is pretentious.

(Shortform note: The authors of _Rework_ echo Zinsser’s belief in the importance of business writing. They take the idea one step further, saying that companies should hire people who can write simply and clearly, even if it’s for a programming or engineering position. According to a 2013 study, 73.4% of employers now look for good writing skills for new hires. Like Zinsser, these experts believe clear writing is an indicator of clear thinking, which is a skill 93% of employers want. Thus having good writing skills may improve your hiring chances.)

Additionally, Zinsser recommends that you make your business writing sound personal. He believes a reader wants to know that she’s reading the words of a person, not a business. Organizations can’t write emails or memos—people do.

(Shortform note: Companies have embraced Zinsser’s version of personal business writing and are now creating consistent brand voices, or the unique personality of their communications with consumers. One key element of a brand voice is identifying what kind of person your business would be and using that idea to communicate with customers. For example, Nike’s brand voice persona is an athlete who uses strong, inspiring language to motivate consumers.)
