## Exercise: Create an Environment for Progress

Visionary companies have systems and methods to stimulate evolutionary progress. Find opportunities to foster experimentation and innovation within your company.

* * *

Visionary companies took incremental steps to pivot their business, sometimes starting with little experiments. Describe a project that your management seems to be wary of. (For example, the management of a chain of coffee stands might be hesitant to introduce snacks as part of their product line.)

What small experiments can you do to prove its feasibility? (For example, you can convince them to sell snacks at just one coffee stand for a month.)

What are two or three reasons that employees within your company might be hesitant to innovate or share new ideas?

What practices or policies can you put in place to encourage employees to experiment and explore new ideas?
