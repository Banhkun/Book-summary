## Exercise: Define Your BHAG

A BHAG inspires people, creates momentum, and stimulates progress. If you don’t have a BHAG, now is the time to set one.

* * *

Paint a clear picture of where you want to be 10 years from now. Think in terms of operations (number of stores, revenues, etc.), products or services, and even awards you want to win. List them below.

How can you condense these aspirations into a clear, concise goal? (For example, “Make a sale every two minutes.”)

What do you want this goal to motivate people to do? How do you think your goal statement is exciting enough to accomplish this?

How does your BHAG align with your core philosophy?
