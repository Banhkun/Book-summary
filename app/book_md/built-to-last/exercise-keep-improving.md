## Exercise: Keep Improving

Visionary companies recognize that success is never final and are thus driven to keep improving, even though theyâ€™re at the top of their game. Make sure you have mechanisms in place to prevent complacency.

* * *

What mechanisms of discomfort can you implement to keep people from becoming complacent? (For example, you can make it a regular exercise to view the company through the lens of a competitor.)

What actions have you taken recently that set you up for long-term success instead of short-term gains? (For example, you invested in the hire of a top-notch engineer rather than moving your company into a nicer office.)
