## Exercise: Create a Leadership Continuity Loop

One of the keys to building a visionary company is to have a leadership continuity loop. Make sure your company (or department) has capable people ready to take your place.

* * *

Imagine that you and your next-rank member of management suddenly left the company. Who would you trust to take your place? List two or three candidates and why you think theyâ€™d be a good choice.

Evaluate each candidate on your list. What kind of skills do they need to develop in order to be ready for the role?

What kind of training exercises can you set for your candidates to hone the skills necessary for the position?
