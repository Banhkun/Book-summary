## Exercise: Seek Alignment

Visionary companies don’t come up with random ways to preserve their core and stimulate progress. They make sure that every element they introduce is aligned.

* * *

Think about your organization’s incentive systems. Do they reward behaviors that reinforce the company’s core values? If not, what kind of incentive system _would_ reinforce the core values?

Review your company or team policies in a specific area (for example, mandatory training exercises). How do they encourage progress? How do they get in the way of progress?

What changes can you make to progress-blocking policies so that they better stimulate change and improvement?
