## Chapter 9: Givers, Break Free

People generally believe that gives are the least successful of all 3 types, but Adam Grant argues vehemently that that’s not true – recall the examples of VC David Hornik, Adam Rifkin, basketball scout Stu Inman, the optician salesperson, Abraham Lincoln.

Givers get to the top without cutting others down and pride their achievements by how much they help other people. The rise of collaborative knowledge work and the internet enables givers to develop stronger reputations than ever before.

At this point, you might be tempted to become a strategic matcher, finding people and appearing as a giver to achieve all the benefits described in this book. It’s unclear whether we should define reciprocity styles by the actions, the motives, or both. But Adam Grant believes that **strategic matchers will ultimately betray themselves through disingenuous efforts,** like Ken Lay. Eventually these people will be found out.

Thus, if you’re a matcher, try to start out by giving in ways they find enjoyable, to people they genuinely care about. Then, over time, you might fully adopt being a giver as part of your identity.
