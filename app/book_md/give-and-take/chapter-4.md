## Chapter 4: Givers Find the Diamond in the Rough

Assessing future potential is difficult. As discussed above, matchers and takers have a disadvantage in creating valuable networks – they seek out only people who can benefit them today. This ignores undervalued people who blossom into great success, whom givers help without expectation of return. We’ll discuss why givers tend to be better judges and developers of talent.

* * *

### The Pygmalion Effect – Self-fulfilling Prophecies of Potential

Confounding the potential problem is the **Pygmalion effect** – a self-fulfilling prophecy where having higher expectations about a person leads to performance increases in that person.

This effect has been experimented with in a wide range of professional and educational settings. Usually the experiment is conducted by having all students take a faux exam, then randomly assigning a percentage of students into a false “high potential group.” Instructors are then told which students were identified as high potential (again, in reality, since they were randomized, the high potential students are no different).

In a variety of environments, the falsely labeled “high potential” or “bloomers” achieve better gains.

  * In grade school students, bloomers gained ten IQ points more than their peers over 2 years. 
  * In the military, high potential trainees do better on expertise tests and weapons evaluations. 
  * In the workplace, new employees whose managers are told of their high promise receive higher performance ratings. 



The Pygmalion effect occurs because **the teacher reacts differently to a person based on her expectations**. To someone of high promise, a teacher sets higher expectations, communicates more warmly, calls to answer more often, gives more advice and feedback, and attributes failure to the task rather than the person. The student responds to positivity, setting into place a positive feedback loop that leads to a sustained self-fulfilling prophecy.

In contrast, to someone of low promise, a teacher does the inverse: **she attributes failure to the person’s low promise** , gives fewer chances to succeed, and gives less feedback (likely out of belief the advice will be wasted). Similarly, this leads to a vicious cycle where the student feels less motivated, and each progressive failure is more evidence of low promise.

### Takers, Givers, and the Pygmalion Effect

So it’s shown that trainees develop differently in response to the teachers’ beliefs. How do takers, matchers, and givers perform differently in this framework?

**Takers assume that most people are takers and thus place little trust in other people.** When they see someone with high performance, they see this person as a threat, which prevents them from whole-heartedly supporting the person. Furthermore, takers tend to dismiss low performers as not possibly being able to help the taker. This creates vicious cycles where takers fail to provide encouraging support.

Matchers value reciprocity, so when they see someone of high potential, they do provide support in hopes of returned favors later. But **matchers tend to wait to see evidence of performance before making the investment**. Thus, they lose opportunities to help people who don’t immediately show talent.

**Givers don’t wait for evidence. By default, givers tend to be optimistic and see everyone as bloomers.** All people are diamonds in the rough until proven otherwise. Furthermore, givers don’t see high potential people as threatening. Givers provide encouraging support broadly. Critically, they can recognize “undervalued” people who are ignored by takers and matchers but, with the right environment, can blossom.

### Talent Is Overrated – Grit is Important

One reason takers and matchers tend to undervalue potential is that they overemphasize **current** performance and talent. After all, they want to extract value now.

Instead, research has shown that orthogonal character traits like interest and grit make a big difference. Interest drives people to develop skill in the first place. And grit keeps them pushing through setbacks and difficulties.

Both character traits can be nurtured by early teachers who are caring and patient. Teachers who can spark the interest and provide positive experiences set the foundation for developing skill. Then teachers who set high expectations and push them past limits inculcate grit.

**Givers tend to be these supportive teachers.** Because givers signal that they care about the student’s growth, students respond better to teaching feedback and don’t question the teacher’s motives.

Furthermore, givers tend to be more gritty themselves, as they’re spurred on by the good of the group to put in more than they’d be willing to do for themselves.

### Avoiding Sunk Cost Fallacy

Givers invest a lot of time in developing people. But givers don’t have a magical Midas touch – not all trainees have the talent or the grit to reach their potential.

So with limited time, how can givers focus on people with true promise? And when someone doesn’t show promise, how do they avoid the **escalation of commitment** to investment in a person?

Escalation of commitment is a powerful force that pushes people to throw good money after bad. There are four factors here:

  * Ego threat – the biggest factor. “If I don’t keep investing, I’ll look and feel like a fool.”
  * Sunk cost fallacy – you weigh your past losses in your decisionmaking, rather than re-initiating a decision. For example, if you’ve bought 2 tickets for $200 but realize you don’t want to go to the show for 4 hours, the rational decision is to consider whether you want to waste 4 hours for $0. 
  * Anticipated regret – “will I be sorry that I didn’t give this another chance?”
  * Project completion – a desire to follow through and finish



In many cases, escalation of commitment to a bad decision is worse for the group, but better in the short-term for the individual (in terms of disguising mistakes and massaging ego).

**Takers are more vulnerable to ego threat than givers are.** They’re concerned about protecting their reputation, not about the health of the organization. Cutting off a bad investment makes them look foolish and can incur big personal costs like a loss of a promotion. Thus continuing the bad investment allows the taker to continue hiding the prospect of failure.

In contrast, givers are more concerned about achieving the goals of the group than about ego. Thus, **givers are more willing to admit personal mistakes and de-escalate commitment**. Studies show that people make more accurate decisions when they’re deciding on behalf of others rather than themselves. Givers do this naturally.

Furthermore, **takers tend to discount constructive feedback that harms their ego.** In an experiment, subjects were identified as givers or takers, then made decisions on how to solve problems. All participants received a random score indicating they were below or above average, then given a suggestion to delegate more. When takers believed they were above average, they delegated 30% more often; but when they believed they were below average, they delegated only 15% as often. In contrast, givers delegated 30% more often regardless of the feedback.

By avoiding constructive feedback, takers continuously entrench into their former decisions, as doing otherwise would deflate their ego in being correct. **Takers want to be the smartest people in the room.** In contrast, givers care about the performance of the group and focus more on the organizational consequences of their decisions. Thus, they take in as much data and disconfirming evidence as they can to make better decisions, even at the short term expense of their ego and reputation.

> **Example: Inman vs Jordan in Basketball Scouting**
> 
> Give and Take uses two well-known basketball figures to illustrate the talent-developing differences between givers and takers.
> 
> Stu Inman was a basketball scout for the Portland Trail Blazers and is seen as key to building the team that won the championship in 1977. Adam Grant cites Inman’s classic giver behaviors. As a college coach, he cared about talent development and made room for gritty players even if they lacked talent. As an NBA scout, he fought common wisdom and used psychological analyses to find gritty players, rather than focusing on upfront performance. This led to picks like Bill Walton and Clyde Drexler.
> 
> They had their share of mistaken picks. But **Inman was receptive to negative feedback and to admitting his mistakes**. After making bad picks, other NBA teams tended to play their picks more than they should have, in an effort to prove their ego correct and out of ego-protecting denial that they had made a mistake. In contrast, the Blazers played their bad picks less than average, thus de-escalating their commitment.
> 
> In contrast, Michael Jordan, despite being the best known basketball player of all time, was a classic taker on and off the court. While playing, he was known as being egotistical and selfish. He bristled under constructive feedback and was criticized at his Hall of Fame speech for thanking few people and excoriating his doubters.
> 
> As an executive for the Washington Wizards, Jordan made a bad first pick in Kwame Brown, who never lived up to potential. **Brown’s failure was mean a huge blow to Jordan’s ego.** Jordan un-retired to play on the Wizards alongside Brown, and he “ritually reduced Brown to tears.” Without success, Jordan was fired from the Wizards, but he didn’t let it go. **When Jordan owned the Charlotte Bobcats, he signed Brown again.** The Bobcats gave Brown more minutes than ever, but he struggled to thrive. Jordan kept throwing good money after bad, unable to admit his mistake and stinging under the increasing criticisms about his management.
