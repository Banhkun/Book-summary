## Shortform Actionables

As a summary, here are actionables arising directly from the book, or inspired by its concepts.

**Mindset**

  * Adopt a giving attitude. If this isn’t your natural orientation, start with small giving behaviors to people you care about.
  * To cross the perspective gap, understand the pain of others in their contributions, rather than centering around your own contributions. This applies to both subordinates, colleagues, and bosses. Avoid the Jonas Salk credit problem.



**Giving Behaviors**

  * Ask in every interaction, how can I help you?
  * Five minute favor: if you can help someone within 5 minutes, do so. Give honest feedback and make introductions.
  * Make your giving reputation known – this will increase reception by people approaching you, no matter which of 3 stances they belong to.
  * Don’t buy gifts off registry – you’re projecting your own preferences onto the recipient.
  * For your kids, find teachers who are caring and enthusiastic and make learning the subject fun. This will develop an interest and allow kids not to distrust teachers’ motives.
  * To avoid burnout from giving, make the impact of people’s work salient – create customer videos, publicize testimonials and results.
  * Practice powerless communication. Ask questions, seek advice, admit vulnerability. This should open people up.



**Techniques for Givers to Help Themselves**

  * When negotiating for your own self-interest, take the viewpoint of an advocate of people you care about. This will make you fight harder on their behalf.
  * Practice perspective taking rather than empathy. Adopt their perspective 
  * Find other givers by joining a giving community
  * Seek help more often. This can kick off a virtuous cycle of giving, where people tend to enjoy helping
  * In couples, advocate for your side to find the best joint outcome. Don’t let empathy bowl you over



**In Organizations**

  * In reviews, ask people first to itemize what they like about a company and what you or the company has done for them. This will minimize the responsibility bias of their own actions.
  * Promote a giving attitude in your org. Set the example for helping people willingly and for focusing on the goals of the group above your own gain. Publicly reward the behavior of people who demonstrate this. Try to develop psychological safety around ideas, so people don’t feel they have to claim credit for ideas. Run a reciprocity ring.
  * Try to hire givers. Takers will bring down a culture when people default to tit for tat. One bad actor can really spoil the whole batch.
  * to empathize with your subordinates in tough situations, induce the same pain in yourself. Make a list of situations similar to those they’re facing and reflect on these regularly. Eg list one time negative feedback really hurt; when positive feedback made you feel good; when you had a project taken away from you; when your boss or colleague took credit for your work; when you felt underpaid for your work; when you had a deep Mazlow’s hierarchy need that wasn’t fulfilled.
