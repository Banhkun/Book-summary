## Exercise: Prioritize Quality Time

Part of feeling centered is knowing that the time we spend with our loved ones is of high quality. Start by identifying the most important moments to share and then make sure you are present.

* * *

Think of one person who is very important to you. Who is it?

In the upcoming month, which moments does this person most want to share with you? (Feel free to ask.) Which moments do _you_ most want to share with _them?_

What can you _specifically_ add to your calendar in the next month to ensure that you are present with this loved one?
