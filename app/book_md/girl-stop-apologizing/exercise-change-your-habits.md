## Exercise: Change Your Habits

All habits consist of a cue, an action, and a reward. To change your habit, replace one action with another that provides the same reward.

* * *

Think of a bad habit that you would like to changeâ€”for instance, constantly checking your phone. What is the habit? What is your **cue** to do it? (In other words, what triggers the action?)

What is the **reward** you receive for performing the action? (Stress relief? Better sleep? Entertainment?)

Think of one **alternative action** you could take that would generate the same reward.

The next time you experience your **cue,** use your **alternative action** to achieve the reward.
