## Part 2: Behaviors to Adopt

So far, Hollis has explained how to recognize self-sabotaging excuses and how to eliminate them. Next, she discusses how to **take that new mindset of taking control of your life and apply it to behaviors that will help you succeed.**

She stresses that our behavior and habits are choices, whether or not we are conscious of them. Because of this, **we are capable of changing our behaviors so that they better serve us.**

In this section, we will examine each of the behaviors that Hollis identifies as being crucial to success and discuss strategies for implementing the behavior in your own life.

### Behavior 1: Start With a Solid Foundation

Before any other behaviors can be modified, Hollis strongly suggests **you start by laying a healthy foundation**. These are the habits and routines that will allow your new mindset and behaviors to flourish.

Hollis believes that **these foundational elements are the most important of all the behaviors** , and that **motivation and mindset won’t matter if your daily routine sabotages your efforts.**

She identified **three key areas** to focus on: **health, cleanliness, and community**.

Once you have established healthy routines in each of these areas, Hollis believes you will be ready to tackle your goals using your new mindset and behavior adaptations.

(Shortform note: What makes these three areas important? One theory is that all three contribute to your energy levels. Taking a look at _Lifehack_ ’s list of _74 Healthy Habits That Will Drastically Improve Every Area of Your Life, _you will notice that essentially every item listed (chew your food, walk at lunchtime, and so on.) could be classified into one of the three categories Hollis examines. The running theme in both _Lifehack_ ’s list and Hollis’s is that your overall energy and zest for life will increase if you incorporate the habits they discuss.)

##### But First, What Exactly _Is_ a Habit?

**Habits are patterned choices that we make** (often subconsciously) and Hollis explains that they’re **composed of three parts: a cue, an action, and a reward.**

  1. **The cue** is when something happens and you’re triggered to react. Oftentimes the cue is an emotion (feeling anxious, scared, or embarrassed, for example).
  2. **The action** is how you choose to react to your cue. Hollis gives an example of how she used to binge eat as her action when she experienced the cue of anxiety.
  3. **The reward** is how you feel immediately after the action. In the short term, this is a good feeling, which is why you keep repeating the action. However, you may feel differently after some time passes. In Hollis’s case, her reward after bingeing was a feeling of euphoric happiness. This high didn’t last, however, and after recognizing how bad this habit made her feel in the long term, she decided to change it.



As we go through the areas that Hollis believes should be your foundational daily habits for mental and physical health, remember that **habits have this predictable formula.** Take note of what your cues, actions, and rewards are and how you might adjust them to replace your bad habits with good ones.

> **What Is the Most Effective Way to Break a Bad Habit?**
> 
> Our habits are often subconscious, but they aren’t complicated. In his book, _Atomic Habits,_ James Clear breaks down how habits are originally formed in our brains. Similar to Hollis’s cue-action-reward theory, Clear contends habits consist of a cue, a craving, a response, and a reward.
> 
> **Why Willpower Doesn’t Work**
> 
> Resisting the habit alone won’t break it, because “not giving in” isn’t a reward in itself. As noted in _Atomic Habits,_ **in order to replace a bad habit with a good one, you must feel rewarded.**
> 
> Clear posits that the cue and craving make up the “problem” half of the habit. The response and reward are the “solution” half. To replace a bad habit with a healthy one, the way you get to the reward (the response) is the part that needs to change.
> 
> **Example:** A woman suffers from panic attacks and notices that they often follow conversations with her mother. After finishing a phone call with her mother, she often has a bottle of wine and it immediately eases her anxiety. The cue is talking with her mother, the craving is the bottle of wine, the response is drinking the wine, and the reward is the loss of anxiety.
> 
> The cue will stay the same (assuming she keeps the relationship with her mother) and she wants the same reward (a decrease in anxiety), so to break her wine habit, she’ll need to replace the response with something that gives her the same reward. After trying different things, she discovers that a hot bath with good music eases her anxiety as well. After she does that for a while instead of drinking, her craving will eventually switch from the desire to drink to the desire to relax in a bath.
> 
> Had she simply resisted the urge to drink, she wouldn’t have received the reward, and she would be unlikely to continue resisting.

#### Health: The Five Essentials

**The first of Hollis’s three key areas to develop positive habits is health.** As she explains, tackling goals is much more efficient when your body and mind are operating at peak performance. Within this umbrella category of health, Hollis has identified what she believes to be the **five most important daily habits** **for a healthy body and healthy mind.**

**1\. Wake up early:** Hollis recommends waking up an hour before everyone else in your house—the idea being that you have that hour to work on _your_ goals before you start living for everyone else. She clarifies that this might not be practical if you’re currently going through a major life change that is already disrupting your sleep (for example, if you have a newborn). Note: While Hollis believes it is powerful to _start_ your day on the right foot by spending it on yourself, she stresses that the important habit is to set aside an hour _somewhere_ in your day.

##### A Glimpse Into Rachel Hollis’s Morning Routine

Hollis has a structured morning routine that sets her day up for success. She wakes up at 5 a.m. to give herself almost two hours of alone time before her family wakes up. She starts her day with a glass of water before sitting down with coffee to work on her current project. After finishing her morning work, she meditates for 15 minutes. She then does some journaling, where she sets her intentions for that day and writes down a few lines of gratitude and a personal affirmation.

At this point, Hollis wakes up her children and spends the next hour in mom mode. Once her kids are at school, she gets herself ready for work while listening to loud, upbeat music. After she is ready, she makes herself a green smoothie for breakfast.

Her final act of the morning before heading to work is writing down her dreams and one goal (we’ll explain this in detail in Part 4).

> Hollis’s morning routine is a similar but abridged version of author Hal Elrod’s recommendations in _The Miracle Morning_. Elrod recommends you do the following each morning:
> 
>   * **Engage in silence:** Some might call this meditation. He says the important thing is to sit still, avoid sound, and live in the present moment.
> 
>   * **Speak affirmations:** Elrod believes in the power of saying your affirmations aloud and with emotion.
> 
>   * **Visualize your dream life:** Take a few moments to daydream in detail, focusing on your current goal.
> 
>   * **Exercise your body:** Get your blood flowing to jumpstart your energy for the day.
> 
>   * **Read a book:** Elrod says to read at least 10 pages each morning on a topic that interests you.
> 
>   * **Write:** Journaling, letter writing, words of gratitude are all suggestions.
> 
> 


**2\. Hydrate:** Hollis advises drinking half of your body weight in ounces of water each day. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, she believes you should drink 75 ounces of water daily. Hydration provides a multitude of health benefits, but the one she focuses on the most is the energy you will have if you drink up.

> **Counterargument: 8 Glasses of Water Each Day Is a Myth**
> 
> It is commonly believed that humans need to consume at least eight (8-ounce) glasses of water every day to be hydrated; and if you weigh more than 160 pounds, Hollis believes you should drink even more. However, this advice isn’t supported by science, as detailed in a heavily researched _New York Times_ article. Yes, hydration is crucial for health, but most of your hydration comes from the food you consume and even from beverages such as coffee and tea (which are mistakenly touted as being dehydrating beverages).
> 
> **Overhydration: How Much Is Too Much?**
> 
> Though rare, it is possible to drink _too much_ water. Symptoms of overhydration include confusion, drowsiness, and headaches. Ideally, your urine should be straw- or tea-colored. If your urine is perfectly clear, you may be drinking too much water.

**3\. Eat Healthy:** Putting good food into your body gives you more energy and a better attitude, but Hollis acknowledges that overhauling your diet overnight is an unrealistic expectation. Instead, she suggests choosing one unhealthy category of food that you regularly consume and eliminating it for 30 days. Why 30 days? Because this is about how long it takes for a behavior to become a habit. Hollis stresses that the exercise isn’t about the food you’re giving up—you can replace diet soda with an equally sugary drink, such as lemonade. **Rather, it’s about making a commitment to yourself and following through.**

> **After the 30 Days**
> 
> Hollis doesn’t explain what to do after these 30 days are up, or discuss how this month-long act would contribute to healthy eating habits in the long term. While 30 days is a great start, sticking with a commitment long term is more challenging.
> 
> As we discussed in a previous section, _Atomic Habits_ tells us that willpower isn’t a long-term solution when you’re trying to break a bad habit. To make permanent changes in your eating habits, incorporate psychological rewards.
> 
> Mireille Guiliano, author of _French Women Don’t Get Fat, _advocates eating for pleasure. She believes that if you eat quality foods you relish (think a perfectly cooked steak versus a fast food hamburger), you’ll consume less because the reward center of your brain is more quickly activated. She explains how to indulge in your favorite foods while maintaining a healthy lifestyle, which is more sustainable long term compared to elimination diets.
> 
> Some tips from _French Women Don’t Get Fat:_
> 
>   * Eat three times a day at regular intervals (avoid impulse or boredom snacking)
> 
>   * Choose quality ingredients and cook them yourself (the process of preparing a meal is satisfying in itself)
> 
>   * Present your food beautifully (use nice dishes, colorful foods, and plating techniques)
> 
>   * Eat indulgent foods in smaller portions (a small full-fat dessert is better than a large low-fat dessert)
> 
> 


**4\. Move Your Body:** Every day, Hollis recommends moving for at least 30 minutes. It does not need to be an intense workout—you can go for a walk or dance with your kids. The idea is simply to not be sedentary. As with hydration and eating healthy, Hollis stresses that keeping your body in motion will provide you with ample energy.

(Shortform note: The amount of time you spend exercising may not be as important as how often you move. One study concluded that moving for even three minutes every half hour counteracts the health detriments of all-day sitting—excellent news if you work a desk job.)

> **Do We Really Need 10,000 Steps a Day?**
> 
> If walking is your movement of choice, you might strive for 10,000 steps each day. This is common advice given in hundreds of articles. However, there’s no scientific basis for this number. Rather, the number came from the inventor of the pedometer back in 1965.
> 
> A study done in 2019 on women over 70 revealed that the health benefits of walking began at around 4,400 steps per day and plateaued at around 7,500 steps per day.

**5\. Practice Gratitude:** Of her five healthy living components, Hollis believes gratitude is the most important.**** She recommends writing down 10 things you’re grateful for each day, big or small. Make them specific (I am thankful my husband brought me coffee this morning vs. I am thankful for a good husband). She believes if you write your gratitudes down every single day, your mind will become conditioned to recognize blessings; as a result, you will attract even more opportunities.

> **Gratitude Connects Us to Others**
> 
> When we express gratitude, we acknowledge that our life has goodness in it, and that it comes from someone or something outside of ourselves. This acknowledgment allows us to connect: to other humans, to a higher power, or to the natural world.
> 
> Connection is the opposite of loneliness, and it leads to a happier and healthier life overall. One study conducted over 10 weeks found that those who reflected on what they were grateful for felt more positive overall, exercised more, and had fewer visits to the doctor compared to those who were asked to reflect daily on aggravations.

#### Cleanliness

**The second of Hollis’s three key areas to develop positive habits is cleanliness.** She states that**** your environment is often a reflection of your internal life, and she believes if you want to feel in control of your life, you should start with controlling your space.

Hollis believes that **your space should be clean and organized, as well as reflect your goals and vision.**

She notes that your space might be an entire house, or it could be as small as your desk at work. Whatever your situation, she instructs you to find the space that belongs entirely to you, and make it extraordinary.

> **Extreme Organization: A Double-Edged Sword?**
> 
> Studies have shown that **living and working in a disordered space is connected with higher levels of stress, anxiety, inability to focus, and depression**. Whether the space is disordered because the person is already suffering from those maladies or vice versa is up for debate and likely to be a self-feeding loop.
> 
> However, the **need for a clean and organized space** **to properly function** can also be a symptom of mental health dysfunction, such as obsessive compulsive disorder.

In addition to cleanliness, Hollis advises you to **visually display your dream somewhere in your space as a daily reminder of what you’re working to accomplish.** This could take the form of images, words, vision boards, and so on.

(Shortform note: Vision boards speak to the idea of the law of attraction (also known as manifestation). The theory is that thinking about something enough will eventually draw it to you. Perhaps the most well-known book on this subject is _The Secret_ by Rhonda Byrne.)

#### Community

**The third of Hollis’s three key areas in which to develop positive habits is community.**

There’s a popular adage (most often attributed to motivational speaker Jim Rohn) that claims **you’re the average of the five people you spend the most time with.** In other words, if your friends are all at the top of their game, you probably will be too. Conversely, if all of your friends are criminals, there’s a good chance you will commit crimes as well.

Hollis subscribes to this belief, detailing how your friendships can pull you up or drag you down. S**he encourages you to surround yourself with people who support and inspire your personal growth.**

Hollis’s advice? **Take inventory of your** **friendships**. Are your friends supportive of your personal growth? Do they have goals of their own? Are they open-minded and committed to lifelong learning? If not, they’ll drag you down, and Hollis believes you should limit or eliminate your time with them. She advises you to instead **seek out friends who will lift you up.**

> **Research Shows That You’re the Average of _More_ Than Five People**
> 
> Research supports Hollis’s belief that your community affects your growth and development—but that community extends well beyond the people closest to you.
> 
> Bestselling author and former business professor David Burkus has learned through his research on the science of social networks that we are the average of far more than the five people we spend the most time with. In fact, our likelihood of becoming smokers or overweight is linked not only to who we spend time with, but to the people _those people_ spend time with.
> 
> According to one study cited by Burkus, if the friend of a friend of a friend is a happy person, _you are 6% more likely to be happy with your life_. Compare this with only being 2% happier with your life if you get a $10,000 raise.
> 
> The message is that you should pay attention not only to your immediate friends, but to all of the social circles you participate in.
> 
> **Identifying Supportive Friends**
> 
> In _12 Rules for Life,_ Jordan B. Peterson teaches you how to identify unsupportive friendships. He advises you to keep your eyes open for the following red flags: The friend puts down your goals, is jealous when you succeed, downplays your achievements, or attempts to one-up you.
