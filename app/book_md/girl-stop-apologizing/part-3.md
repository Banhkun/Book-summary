## Part 3: Skills to Acquire

By this point in the book, Hollis has covered the excuses you need to overcome, as well as the behaviors and habits you must develop in order to achieve your dreams.

In Part 3 _,**she takes the preparation a step further and provides a list of universal skills that will take you from motivation to achievement.**_

Hollis defines skills unconventionally. In her view, **a skill is any ability that you can learn and develop over time through intentional practice.** The skills she lists are often viewed as character traits—confidence, for example. However, Hollis argues that if you can develop confidence and use it as a tool, then it is indeed a skill.

In this section, we will take a look at **five universal skills** Hollis believes will serve you best in the pursuit of your dream.

### Skill 1: Confidence

Hollis argues that confidence is a skill because it is fluid. **You aren’t born confident or insecure, but your confidence levels fluctuate over time and you can adjust them with effort.**

Hollis makes clear that confidence is important to success because if you already believe that you’re bad at something, you’re unlikely to even attempt it. In her experience, **there are three distinct areas where you can develop confidence: how you look, how you act, and who you hang out with.**

(Shortform note: Self-confidence is more valuable to success than most people realize. According to _Psychology Today_ , self-confidence decreases fear and anxiety, increases motivation, builds resilience, improves your relationships, and allows you to connect with your authentic self.)

##### How You Look

**The first area where Hollis believes you can develop confidence is in how you look.** Right off the bat, Hollis addresses the idea of vanity. She makes the distinction that **caring about what you look like does not make you vain; rather, caring what _other people think_ about your looks is vain.**

She emphasizes that confidence requires knowing who you are, and part of that is knowing what you like. She encourages you to **present yourself on the outside in a way that makes you feel the most _like yourself_ on the inside**.

For instance, Hollis explains that she feels most confident when she is dressed up. She enjoys makeup, eyelash extensions, highlighted hair, and hair extensions. She enjoys wearing high heels and having her nails done. She has two friends, however, who prefer a much more casual style and would feel uncomfortable if they were styled like Hollis.

> **How to Develop a Personal Style**
> 
> Hollis explains why having a personal style is important, and the juxtaposition she uses between her style and her friends’ makes a clear distinction between caring about how you look and caring about how others want you to look. However, she doesn’t explain _how_ she found her personal style.
> 
> If you don’t yet have a personal style, or you want to change your current look, there are lots of strategies to help you find what is right for you, for example:
> 
>   * **Assess your closet:** Pick out your favorite items of clothing—the ones that make you feel like a million bucks. You might have only two or three favorite items, and that’s okay. Lay them out side-by-side, and ask yourself what they have in common. Use your answer as a theme to buy more clothing. For example, if all of your favorite dresses have a high waist, look in that direction for future purchases.
> 
>   * **Experiment in the dressing room:** Try on clothes that are out of your comfort zone. Nobody has to see them but you. You may find that something you would ordinarily pass by is perfect for you.
> 
>   * **When in doubt, ask for help:** If you don’t know how to do makeup but want to try, reach out to a friend or acquaintance who is skilled in this area, and ask her to teach you. Not sure which clothes flatter you? Take a friend shopping with you and ask for honest feedback. If you do choose to have someone help you, be sure that you’re not blindly following their advice. They should serve as a resource, not a model to imitate.
>

##### How You Act

**The second area where Hollis believes you can develop confidence is in how you act.**

There’s a popular adage when it comes to impostor syndrome (the worry that you lack the skills or talent to do the job in front of you): “Fake it until you make it.” Hollis believes in this strategy, although she takes issue with the phrase “fake it” because “faking it” means you lack skills. Instead, she advocates **accepting opportunities for which you don’t feel entirely qualified and using the skills and experience you already have to learn the job along the way.**

Hollis believes **if you don’t take chances and push yourself out of your comfort zone, you won’t grow.**

For example, when Hollis was an event planner, she dreamed of hosting a big event at Sundance Film Festival. She was offered an opportunity to cater an event at the festival, which she saw as a foot in the door. The problem was, she had no catering experience. **She said yes anyway.** She believed that even though she had not catered before, **she had enough other skills and connections that she could figure it out** , and she did. The following year she was invited to host her own event at Sundance. If she hadn’t taken that chance and “faked it,” she wouldn’t have accomplished her dream.

> **Impostor Syndrome**
> 
> In Sheryl Sandberg’s _Lean In_ , she argues that women are more likely than men to experience impostor syndrome and are also in greater danger of limiting their success because of it.
> 
> Sandberg notes that women are hesitant to apply for positions if they don’t feel 100% qualified. In Hollis’s case, she was partially qualified for the Sundance catering job because she was an event planner, but not completely qualified because she had never catered an event. She pushed through impostor syndrome and figured it out on the job using the skills she had.
> 
> Impostor syndrome can take several forms. Consider these findings from _Lean In_ :
> 
>   * In reviews of their own performance, women tend to rate themselves lower than others would, while men tend to rate themselves higher than others would.
> 
>   * Women are more likely to attribute their success to hard work while men often attribute their success to innate qualities, such as being smart.
> 
>   * When men fail, they tend to blame outside factors or an action/inaction (such as not preparing enough). When women fail, they tend to blame personal qualities (“I’m not smart enough,” for example).
> 
> 

> 
> Remember, these are self-limiting beliefs and can be combated with truths.

##### Who You Hang Out With

**The third and final area where Hollis believes you can develop confidence is in who you hang out with.**

Building upon her foundational behavior of immersing yourself in a supportive community (see behavior 1), Hollis stresses that **who you hang out with can have a great effect on your confidence.** She believes that **if you hang out with insecure people, you will doubt yourself.** **If you spend your time with confident and successful people, that will rub off on you** as well.

(Shortform note: Surrounding yourself with positive and successful people will lift you up in several ways. These types of people are less likely to succumb to self-pity when they face challenges and instead model responsibility and perseverance. You will be presented with more opportunities for professional growth because you’re filling your network with people at the top of their game. Finally, spending time around success feeds into the Law of Attraction and will draw more of the same to you.)

### Skill 2: Persistence

Hollis states in her book (and in several interviews) that **nothing significant in her life came quickly**. She stresses the**importance of sticking to your plan and riding out challenges**. She contends that the skill of **persistence is vital to success**.

Hollis notes that several of her goals took her five or more years to accomplish, demonstrating how her skill of persistence paid off. For example, Hollis had a lifelong dream of being on _The New York Times_ bestseller list; her first five books didn’t land there, but her sixth book did. Had she given up, she wouldn’t have accomplished that dream.

To build persistence, Hollis says you need a total mindset shift. **For every goal you have, prepare for the long haul, expect rejection, and avoid the trap of comparison.**

(Shortform note: Angela Duckworth, author of _Grit_ , analyzes in depth the importance of perseverance (persistence) in the face of adversity. In her research, she found that grit was a greater indicator of future success than IQ. Duckworth defines grit as a combination of persistence and passion, so it stands to reason that having a strong “why,” or purpose you feel passionate about, and the willingness to fight for it is your best bet at achieving any dream.)

##### When You Lose Steam, Return to Your Why

In addition to facing outside challenges, sometimes we need persistence because we have lost motivation. Hollis contends that **it isn’t enough to know _what_ your dream is. You need to have a strong _why,_ or reason for pursuing it. **Return to this why when you find yourself lacking motivation.

According to Hollis, if you have started and stopped this dream several times before, it’s because your why wasn’t strong enough. For example, do you want to be rich so that you can buy a fancy car? Or is it because you want to quit a job that is negatively affecting your quality of life? **What is the real, true, deep reason for wanting what you want?**

(Shortform note: Could you be losing steam because your goals are _too_ attainable? Author Grant Cardone addresses this in _The 10X Rule_ , in which he theorizes that when our goals aren’t lofty enough, we lack the motivation to chase after them. For a goal to be inspiring, it must have a strong why and also be a challenge. If a goal is easy, you either would have done it already or you don’t have a strong inner reason to do it.)

### Skill 3: Effectiveness

Remember the excuse about not having time? In this chapter, Hollis explains how to develop the skill to defeat that excuse. Hollis advocates learning how to **manage your time efficiently to get the most out of it**. She recommends you take the following five actions:

**1\. List your desired outcomes rather than your to-dos.** To-do lists make us feel good because we get a sense of satisfaction with each item we cross off. However, Hollis points out that it isn’t a true indication of how much closer you are to your goal and it can be a time-waster. Instead, she recommends you write down the outcome you desire. For example, rather than writing “apply for five jobs,” try writing “secure a job interview.” Your brain will find the quickest way to make that outcome happen, and you will move closer to your goal.

(Shortform note: According to _Forbes_ , to-do lists and outcome lists are both valuable. Outcome lists ensure that the work you’re doing is productive and moves you closer to your goal. However, to-do lists can still be valuable, particularly when you need to list out specific steps to achieve an outcome. For example, if your outcome is “complete chapter three of my book,” you might have a to-do list that says “outline chapter,” “find two references,” and so on.)

**2\. Constantly evaluate your efficiency.** Hollis advises taking a look at your outcomes list and asking if there’s a better or quicker way to get the result you’re aiming for. This isn’t to say that success comes quickly or easily, but there are often items on our list that don’t need to take as much time as we believe…or that don’t need to be on the list at all. Evaluate whether all of the outcomes on your list are necessary or if there are any you can let go.

(Shortform note: An area of effectiveness that isn’t addressed here is quality of work. To be effective is to get a lot of bang for your buck. Said another way, you should be aiming to achieve the highest level of excellence with the least amount of effort. Every successful enterprise has a mix of quality and efficiency, and when put together, this is effectiveness. As you work, evaluate how your speed is affecting the quality of your output.)

**3\. Use whatever helps you focus.** Your working environment will often be out of your control, especially if you’re working on your dream in addition to other responsibilities and have to use whatever time and place are available. Hollis recommends finding something that you _can_ control that helps you work at your best, and using that consistently. For some people, this might be a cup of coffee, a certain type of music, comfortable clothing, or a scent. Whatever this is for you, she says to use it consistently when you work. When you put on that song, or take that sip of tea, your body and brain will recognize the cue and snap into work mode.

(Shortform note: Cal Newport offers several strategies for increasing your focus to be more effective in his book, _Deep Work._ One strategy that he recommends is training your “focus muscles'' by allowing yourself to be bored in situations where you would normally distract yourself. For example, if you’re waiting in line at the DMV, you might naturally reach for your phone. Instead, resist the urge and allow the boredom to happen. This is great focus training for your brain because you will develop increased control and discipline over your thoughts in the same way that an athlete controls their physical movements.)

**4\. Avoid the things that distract you.** This may seem obvious, yet people often expend mental energy trying to “power through” their biggest distractions. Hollis says that a more effective technique is to avoid the distraction altogether. Set yourself up for success. For example, if noise is a distraction for you, don’t try to work in a coffee shop.

(Shortform note: In _Deep Work,_ Newport points out that our tools of productivity often become distractions instead. For example, if part of your work includes promoting yourself on social media, you might find yourself scrolling through social media every time you log in to work. While it seems harmless, a minute here and there adds up over the course of a day. One solution is to set aside “active hours” and “non-active hours” for use on social media. For example, you might check in with Instagram twice a day at designated times.)

**5\. Be willing to adjust your course.** Hollis recommends checking in with yourself once a week. Ask yourself if you’re on track, and if you aren’t, then adjust your plans. Stay steadfast in your “why” but be flexible in your “how.”

(Shortform note: Flexibility is an important tool of efficiency because if you allow yourself to shift gears from time to time, you might discover quicker ways to get to your end goal. For example, let’s say your desired outcome is to get a new job and you schedule some job search activities throughout the week. On Monday, a friend calls and tells you about a job fair with some promising leads. If you allow yourself to adjust course and go to the job fair instead of your previously scheduled activity, you might arrive at your outcome sooner than intended.)

### Skill 4: Positivity

Hollis argues that by choosing positivity every day, **you will recognize the abundance of opportunities and blessings at your feet. As a result, you will have greater success in any goal you aspire to accomplish.** She believes that having a positive attitude is a choice that can be developed, and therefore it is a skill.

Hollis acknowledges that we can’t control the hardships that come our way. However, she notes that we can control how we respond to these obstacles, disappointments, and catastrophes.

One way that Hollis believes **you can practice positivity is to control your inner dialogue**. Your running mental dialogue is the soundtrack to your life. She believes **if you criticize or pity yourself** , even if it’s just in your thoughts,**these feelings manifest as a negative attitude.**

**When you feel the negative inner dialogue creeping in, Hollis advises you to redirect the conversation in the same way that you could shift a conversation happening out loud**.

For example, imagine you’re late for work again. You might chastise yourself internally with thoughts like, “You’re always late! Why can’t you be on time? What is wrong with you? You’re lazy and unreliable!” But would you ever say this out loud to somebody or allow someone else to talk to you like that? What if a colleague were speaking about another person in such a way and you were bearing witness? Could you step in and redirect the conversation? You certainly could and probably would. So when you find yourself thinking in such a way, imagine how you would respond in that situation and do the same thing inside your mind.

> **Toxic Positivity: When Is It Okay to Have Negative Vibes?**
> 
> While the benefits of positivity have been well-documented, it can be taken too far.
> 
> Since the time this book was published in 2019, the topic of toxic positivity has garnered attention. Toxic positivity is the belief that we should feel positive emotions all of the time, regardless of the circumstance. Rachel Hollis has faced criticism for encouraging positivity to a level that many people find unhealthy.
> 
> How do you know when positivity is healthy or toxic?
> 
> Numerous studies show that people who have a positive outlook enjoy longer lifespans, less illness, and healthier relationships. **As Mayo Clinic points out, however, there’s a difference between approaching situations with a solutions-mindset and ignoring life’s problems altogether. **This is when positivity is actually false and toxic.
> 
> The dangers of extreme optimism include:
> 
>   * Minimizing other people’s valid emotions when they’re going through a difficult time by encouraging them to “look on the bright side” or count their blessings
> 
>   * Suppressing your own negative emotions which can lead to unresolved trauma
> 
>   * Damage to healthy communication within your relationships for fear of judgment for being negative
> 
>   * Feelings of guilt or shame for feeling negative; you might feel as if you don’t appreciate what you do have.
> 
> 


### Skill 5: Leadership

The final skill that Hollis advocates developing is leadership. She notes that you don’t need to have subordinates or followers to be a leader. Rather, **leaders are examples to others of courage and integrity**. They’re true to themselves and encourage others to live their truth as well.

(Shortform note: Brené Brown, author of _Daring Greatly,_ says that a leader is anyone who sees potential in others and is willing to help them actualize that potential.)

Hollis points out that part of being an effective leader is being inclusive. She encourages you to keep this in mind as you go through life and make sure that your table is diverse. Hollis specifically mentions including diversity of race, ethnicity, religion, age, size, and physical capability. She encourages you to strive for diversity not just from a professional perspective, but in your social and personal life as well.

(Shortform note: One study shows that we are naturally attracted to friends who look like us, so it will likely take intentional effort to diversify the people in your life. Rather than “search” for people who don’t look like you (which has implications that are uncomfortable at best), you might try recognizing this homophily bias, and the next time you meet somebody who could be a friend or professional acquaintance, avoid dismissing them subconsciously. For example, if you want to go for after-work drinks, it might not be your first instinct to invite a colleague who is twice your age. Give it a shot.)
