## Part 1.2: Excuses 3 and 4

Besides self-limiting beliefs about capability, another excuse that Hollis says keeps women from pursuing their dreams is **the notion that if it’s been done already, there’s no point in doing it again.**

### Excuse 3: It’s Already Been Done

As Hollis points out, women tend to believe that in order for a dream to be worth pursuing, it must be revolutionary—something that has never been done and will change the world.

(Shortform note: If women place value on their dream’s capacity to better the world, perhaps this comes from the childhood conditioning that whatever they pursue, it must be in service to others.)

According to Hollis, there are three main reasons why women abandon their dream once they realize it isn’t unique:

  1. It is an easy way to get out of trying due to fear of failure.
  2. It keeps them from feeling arrogant (remember, they’ve been trained to be modest).
  3. It keeps them from feeling selfish and therefore not a “good woman.”



(Shortform note: It is worth considering that if a woman is going to face significant adversity and risk being ostracized for her goal, she probably wants a guarantee from the beginning that her dream is a) achievable and b) worth it. This line of thinking is dangerous in itself, as there are no guarantees in life, and it can keep her from even trying.)

#### The Truth: The World Still Needs You

**In response to the excuse that your dream isn’t unique, Hollis drops this truth bomb: Your dream _isn’t_ unique—but that’s okay. **

Hollis urges you to acknowledge these truths about your dream:

  * Yes, it has been done before. Probably many times.
  * Yes, it has been mastered by people who might always be better at it than you.
  * **Yes, it is still worth doing.**



If the first two points are true, then **why exactly is your dream still worth pursuing**? Hollis provides four reasons: It is enjoyable; the world needs more than one; being the best isn’t necessary for success; and you will regret it if you don’t do it.

**First, it is enjoyable.** Hollis maintains you must be true to yourself, and part of that is enjoying what you spend most of your time doing. In other words, don’t underestimate the importance of joy in life. Consider the following examples of things that have been done before: Eating is done by everybody, but do you still like eating? Sex isn’t new, but can you imagine life without it? Have you ever chosen to watch a remake of a movie?

> **Joy Versus Pleasure**
> 
> A dream should provide absolute joy to your life, but because of the sacrifices it takes to get there, it will be limited in pleasures.
> 
> At first glance, the words joy and pleasure appear to be synonyms. However, there’s a big difference between the two. Pleasure is a quick and cheap thrill; something that is easily attained, short-lived, and provided from an outside source. Pleasure is eating a piece of candy, soaking in a bathtub, or watching a great movie. Pleasure has its place, but it can be dangerous when overdone. For example, social media, drugs, and alcohol are all forms of pleasure that are highly addictive.
> 
> Joy, rather, comes from within. You can’t have it instantly just because you want it, and because of this, it lasts longer and is more fulfilling. Think of joy as connecting with your inner child. The joy you felt as a kid when you experienced something amazing for the first time and went home and dreamed about it is different from the pleasure you receive from a glass of wine.

**Second, the world needs more than one.** Hollis points out an obvious yet overlooked fact of life: The world couldn’t function with only one of everything. For example, imagine if the world had only _one_ teacher, or _one_ doctor. Or, imagine if nobody made music after The Beatles. Hollis tells us that “being first” shouldn’t factor into our dream’s value.

(Shortform note: Artists and scientists in particular build upon the work of their predecessors. For example, Copernicus and Galileo studied the stars over 600 years ago, and there have been countless astronomers since, each furthering the science of the one who came before him or her. Stephen Hawking wouldn’t be the Stephen Hawking we know without the work of predecessors to build on.)

**Third, being the best isn’t necessary for success.** Hollis acknowledges that we often fear that our dream is a “lesser” version of someone else’s, but she doesn’t want this to stop you. For example, some people might argue that Beyonce is the greatest living R&B singer. If we assume this to be true, does this keep Rihanna from being successful? Would you not want to be Rihanna?

(Shortform note: Mark Manson (author of _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck)_ contends that it’s a horrible goal to be mediocre, but that it is a perfectly fine result. He argues that to be exceptional you must take an area that you have natural talent in, and then work ridiculously hard to develop that skill to an extraordinary level. The likelihood that you have extreme natural talent and then also work hard enough to be the best at it is rare. So he recommends you shoot for the moon and land among the stars.)

**Fourth, and finally, you will regret not pursuing your dream.** Remember Hollis’s admonition about giving your soul what it’s asking for? Here it is. As Hollis points out, someone else accomplishing _your_ dream doesn’t scratch _your_ itch, does it? She wants you to accept that this dream has been nagging at you for a reason. It is your soul wanting to fly, and to deny it is to keep your soul in a cage.

(Shortform note: One study showed that the biggest regret experienced by people on their deathbed was not something that they did but something that they didn’t do _._ Inaction, or not trying, was most commonly cited.)

#### The Fix: Reframe Your Thinking

Hollis recommends you reframe your thinking: **Instead of seeing someone else’s success as a road _block_ , view it as a road _map_. **

She gives three reasons you should celebrate someone else accomplishing your dream. First, their success is proof that it is possible. Second, you can learn from their experiences. And third, you can use these people as teachers and allies on your journey.

(Shortform note: When somebody else has already accomplished your goal, this is an excellent opportunity to develop a mentor-mentee relationship. If you feel nervous or stuck on how to approach a possible mentor, this article in the _Harvard Business Review_ gives step-by-step instructions, including templates. One of their tips: Keep the first meeting casual instead of jumping straight into discussions about business.)

When you start doubting yourself, Hollis recommends you to go back to your “why.” Why do you need to do this? As she points out, your dream itself may not be unique, but your deeper reason for wanting it is. Referring to the earlier example, while Rihanna and Beyonce may have the same dream of musical superstardom, they each have their own reasons for wanting it.

(Shortform note: Is fear of success holding you back? While it may sound silly, anxiety around succeeding is fairly common and may lead to self-sabotage. You may have a fear of success if you find yourself imagining the downsides to achieving your dream. For example, if your dream is to be a successful actress, and you begin wondering how you will manage the hard work and pressure, you may be self-sabotaging. Rather than creating negative imagined scenarios, focus on your why.)

### Excuse 4: I Have No Free Time

Of all the excuses Hollis highlights, she says **the most common one she hears is, “I don’t have time.”** At this point, you have decided that you can be a good woman and still have a goal, that you’re capable of achieving said goal, and that your goal is worth pursuing even though it’s already been done. The excuse you might tell yourself now is: **I will start once I find the time.**

Hollis notes that in an ideal world, we would all have time for work, to socialize, to exercise, to have quality time with our families, engage in hobbies, practice self-care, and get a full night of sleep…

However, we don’t live in an ideal world and there’s a reason why “there aren’t enough hours in the day” is a common refrain. **Hollis points out that in _this_ world, where most people already feel like they can’t fulfill their obligations and still take care of themselves, the thought of adding _another_ task to our already full plates can seem overwhelming and downright impossible.**

> **Overwhelm Paralysis**
> 
> Have you ever had so much to do that you took a nap instead? Counterintuitive, yes, but common. According to Dr. Ellen Hendrickson, when we are faced with a large to-do list, particularly if the items on that list are complicated or difficult, our brains don’t see tasks, they see scarcity. Our brains see a lack of time, the possibility of failure, and the consequences of not completing the tasks at hand. These are all danger cues.
> 
> When faced with danger, wild animals fight, flee, or freeze (in hopes of not being seen). Humans still have this instinctive response, and in moments of overwhelm, we often innately choose to freeze. In other words, we do nothing.
> 
> Later in this guide, Hollis suggests using “outcome lists” rather than “to-do lists” (see Skill 3: Effectiveness). However, if you find yourself immobilized by overwhelm, it is helpful to break your list down into bite-sized pieces. For example, if your list says “clean the house,” and you feel paralyzed, it might be more helpful to create a longer list that includes items such as “wipe off the kitchen counter,” and “vacuum the bedroom.” Smaller steps that feel more concrete and manageable will help break the paralysis.

#### The Truth: You Will Never Find Time, But You Can Make It

Hollis acknowledges that everybody has the same 24 hours in each day. She maintains, however, that **how we choose to use those 24 hours is what separates those who accomplish their goals from those who don’t.** Put another way, high achievers have figured out how to best utilize their time.

Hollis puts forth a simple truth: **You won’t find more hours**. It is impossible to find more hours because all 24 hours of your day are already filled. There are no blank hours in your day. Something is always happening—whether it is working, sleeping, scrolling, or watching television.

Instead of trying to find hours, Hollis says you need to **make time** **by redesignating what fills your hours.** She stresses that you can replace any activity with a different activity; the choice is entirely yours.

For example, let’s say you normally cook dinner every night from 5 to 6 p.m. If you decide to cook a frozen meal from 5:45 to 6 p.m. twice a week, you’ll free up 1.5 hours for another activity.

> **Timeboxing: A Technique for Balancing Your Schedule**
> 
> Hollis recommends you redesignate your current hours, but she doesn’t provide a clear strategy for how to do it. Nir Eyal, author and investor, has a simple but effective strategy for managing the time you already have. Described in his book _Indistractible,_timeboxing is the technique of preemptively blocking out chunks of time on your calendar and designating them for certain activities.
> 
> **What this looks like:** On your calendar, schedule your entire day or week using different colors and categories. For example, you might spend from 5 to 7 p.m. each night cooking and eating dinner with your family. You might be tempted not to include items on your calendar that you routinely do every day (after all, you don’t _need_ the reminder), but you will want to put them on there anyway, as you will see next.
> 
> **Why it works:** There are two major benefits to timeboxing. First, it allows you to keep balance in your schedule. If you are worried about work-life balance, you can take a quick glance at your color-coded calendar to see where the bulk of your time is being spent. Second, this method keeps you on task. It is easy to get caught up in a project and find that suddenly your entire day is gone, and you haven’t even touched the rest of your responsibilities. Giving yourself an _end time_ will ensure that you don’t _waste time._

Hollis acknowledges that redesignating your hours can feel like a sacrifice. Sometimes, you’ll replace mindless television watching with a fulfilling activity, and that feels good. However, other times you might have to sacrifice something meaningful (like time with your family), and that can feel bad.

To ease the sting, she recommends that you be intentional about how you schedule your time and prioritize the parts of your life that are most important to you.

(Shortform note: It is also a good idea to have a conversation with yourself about which sacrifices are temporary and which are permanent. For example, you might be more likely to give up Taco Tuesdays with the girls if you know that it is only until after your marathon. Consider what you’re giving up, for how long, and your reason for doing it. If you keep these answers in mind, you’ll be less likely to give in.)

#### The Fix: Start With Five Hours Per Week

Hollis recommends you **start by “making” five hours available each week to work on your goal by reducing or eliminating other activities.** Here’s her step-by-step plan:

  * **Step 1:** Record everything you do for an entire week, down to the minute, then find five hours you can replace with time to work on your goal. The five hours can be divided into whatever increments work for you.
  * **Step 2:** Treat those five hours as sacred, and don’t forgo them for any reason. 
  * **Step 3:** Schedule those five hours for whenever you’re at your mental best. For example, if you’re a morning person, schedule your hours early in the day.
  * **Step 4:** Schedule your hours weekly. If you do it once a month, you’re not giving yourself enough flexibility, and if you decide day-to-day, you will end up flaking on yourself. 



> **How Many Hours Should You Dedicate To Your Goal?**
> 
> Hollis recommends starting with five hours per week, but is this enough time to effectively pursue your dream? Throughout her book, she discusses working tirelessly toward her dreams, often working late into the night and early in the morning. Grant Cardone, author of _The 10X Rule, _claims that working 95 hours per week is required to achieve success, and other self-made millionaires agree. One even stated that in the first year of starting a business, you should put in 18 hours of work a day, seven days a week.
> 
> It is important to keep in mind that the number of hours you put in depends on what your dream is and how many sacrifices you’re willing to make. This is a personal decision and there’s no right or wrong answer. Hollis likely recommends five hours because this is a manageable starting point.
