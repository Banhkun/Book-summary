## 1-Page Summary

_Girl, Stop Apologizing_ is a call to action—bestselling author and blogger Rachel Hollis wants you to stop apologizing for wanting more out of your life. Society expects women to take care of everyone else but looks down upon the woman who prioritizes herself. This book is Hollis’s guide to overcoming the guilt, shame, and fear of failure that women face whenever they dare to dream big. While Hollis addresses women, much of her advice on achieving your dreams could be useful to anyone.

Using her own life experiences, Hollis takes you one by one through all of the **excuses** that are holding you back. She lists the **behaviors** that you must be willing to change in order to succeed, and the **skills** that will help you along the way.

This book will help you:

  * Accept that you deserve to have a dream.
  * Stop pressuring yourself to be society’s version of a good woman.
  * Release the idea of “having it all.”
  * Build resilience in the face of adversity.
  * Go after what you want one step at a time.



### Excuses to Let Go Of

Before you can acquire the behaviors and skills to help you succeed, **you must first develop the right mindset.** To Hollis, this means letting go of excuses and embracing a mentality of positivity and perseverance.

**Excuses are a tool of self-sabotage.** Hollis explains that excuses are paralyzing beliefs that serve no valuable purpose and stop you from even trying.

In this section, Hollis goes through the most common excuses that she hears (and once believed herself) for why you can’t live your dream. She takes each excuse and strips it of its power, reveals the truth beneath, and provides you with strategies to conquer it.

(Shortform note: In _The Magic of Thinking Big,_ author and Ph.D. David Schwartz theorizes that people tend to make excuses in one of four areas: health, intelligence, age, and luck. Schwartz acknowledges that we are all born with advantages and disadvantages in life. For example, you can’t help it if you’re born with a disability. The disadvantage itself isn’t an excuse, but when we lean on our disadvantage as the reason we don’t succeed, then it becomes an excuse. He stresses that those with advantages and the wrong attitude are less likely to succeed than those with disadvantages but the right outlook.)

#### Excuse: Good Women Don’t Focus On Themselves

According to Hollis,**society expects women to care for everyone else,** and the phrase **“a good woman” is typically synonymous with “a good wife and mother.”** Hollis goes on to say that because society expects women to run the household, **they are often looked down upon for having career ambitions.**

Hollis argues that women must shed this excuse because**when you’re being true to yourself, you’re better able to care for those you love.** When you’re fulfilled, you’ll be better in all of your relationships. Hollis says that the only way to live a full and happy life is to be open and honest about your dreams, goals, and desires.

(Shortform note: The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted society’s lack of respect for women’s career paths. According to a survey conducted by Seramount (a consulting firm that studies workplace inclusion), about one-third of moms in the workplace had to quit or reduce their hours during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020 and 2021, with most citing a need to take care of their children during school closures. However, the government didn’t prioritize child care as a pandemic issue to address.)

#### Excuse: I’m Not Capable

Once you decide that you’re worthy of having your own dreams and goals, Hollis says the next excuse you’re likely to tell yourself is that **your dream is too lofty, and you’re not good enough at (fill in the blank) to accomplish it.**

Hollis says that believing you’re not capable is an excuse because the truth is, **everybody struggles at the start of something new and challenging.** She believes that **it’s not important to be naturally good** at whatever you’re doing. Rather, **you must have the willingness to be _bad_ at it for a long time**.

(Shortform note: When you embark on a new goal, it may be helpful to research what the typical learning curve is. For example, how long does it take most people to train for a marathon if their starting point is zero? How long does it take most people to complete prerequisites for medical school? This isn’t to say that you should compare yourself to others if your learning curve is steeper or slower; rather, having this information ahead of time likely will ease your worry if you’re worried about your starting point.)

#### Excuse: I Have No Free Time

Of all the excuses Hollis highlights, she says **the most common one she hears is “I don’t have time.”**

Hollis puts forth a simple truth: **You won’t find more time**. Instead, Hollis says you need to **make time** **by redesignating what fills your hours.** She stresses that you can replace any activity with a different activity; the choice is entirely yours.

Hollis recommends you **start by “making” five hours available each week to work on your goal by reducing or eliminating other activities.** Be intentional about how you schedule your time, and prioritize the parts of your life that are most important to you.

> **Timeboxing: A Technique for Balancing Your Schedule**
> 
> Hollis recommends you redesignate your current hours, but she doesn’t provide a clear strategy for how to do it. Nir Eyal, author and investor, has a simple but effective strategy for managing the time you already have. Described in his book _Indistractible,_timeboxing is the technique of preemptively blocking out chunks of time on your calendar and designating them for certain activities.
> 
> **What this looks like:** On your calendar, schedule your entire day or week using different colors and categories. For example, you might spend from 5 to 7 p.m. each night cooking and eating dinner with your family. You might be tempted not to include items on your calendar that you routinely do every day (after all, you don’t _need_ the reminder), but you will want to put them on there anyway, as you will see next.
> 
> **Why it works:** There are two major benefits to timeboxing. First, it allows you to keep balance in your schedule. If you are worried about work-life balance, you can take a quick glance at your color-coded calendar to see where the bulk of your time is being spent. Second, this method keeps you on task. It is easy to get caught up in a project and find that suddenly your entire day is gone, and you haven’t even touched the rest of your responsibilities. Giving yourself an _end time_ will ensure that you don’t _waste time._

#### Excuse: I Can’t Have It All

You have stopped caring what other people think of your dream, **but now you worry that the other areas of your life will suffer**. Hollis insists that**this fear that you can’t have it all is an excuse that will hold you back.**

Many people aim for balance in life but Hollis believes **you should instead strive to be “centered,” which means to feel content and at peace with all areas of your life.** Hollis believes that the easiest way to achieve contentment and relieve yourself of guilt is to **intentionally prioritize the important moments.** Rather than focusing on the number of hours you spend on family, friends, work, and so on, Hollis advises you to be intentional about _when_ you focus on each. **Go for quality over quantity.**

> **Are Being Centered and Being Grounded the Same Thing?**
> 
> Two phrases that are often thrown around in conjunction are “being centered” and “being grounded.” But are they interchangeable? According to _Psychology Today_ , while they’re similar, they’re not the same.
> 
> **To be grounded is to live in the present moment.** You aren’t dwelling on the past or worrying about the “what ifs” of the future. There’s a peacefulness that occurs when you live only in the present. How does this relate to goals? Well, let’s say your goal is to run a marathon. Instead of focusing on the past (_I’ve never been a runner_) or fixating on the future (_How will I find time in my schedule to train the longer runs?),_ focus on living in the moment: _I am running one mile right now._
> 
> **To be centered is to have a place to return to** —a value that is paramount over others and can be thought of as a destination. Using the previous example, if the most important thing in your life is your family, use that as your center and work your marathon training around your time with them.

### Behaviors to Adopt

So far, Hollis has explained how to recognize self-sabotaging excuses and how to eliminate them. Next, she discusses how to **take that new mindset of taking control of your life and apply it to behaviors that will help you succeed.**

She stresses that our behavior and habits are choices, whether or not we are conscious of them. Because of this, **we are capable of changing our behaviors so that they better serve us.** In this section, we will examine each of the behaviors that Hollis identifies as being crucial to success and discuss strategies for implementing the behavior in your own life.

#### Behavior: Start With a Solid Foundation

Before any other behaviors can be modified, Hollis strongly suggests **you start by laying a healthy foundation**. These are the habits and routines that will allow your new mindset and behaviors to flourish. She gives the following advice:

  * **Wake up early:** Spend at least an hour each morning focusing on _your_ goals before you start living for anyone else.
  * **Hydrate:** Drink half your body weight in ounces of water each day.
  * **Eat healthy:** Replace at least one unhealthy food in your diet (to start).
  * **Move your body:** Spend at least 30 minutes moving each day.
  * **Practice gratitude:** Designate time every day to reflect on what you are grateful for.



(Shortform note: What makes these areas important? All of them contribute to your energy levels. Taking a look at _Lifehack_ ’s list of _74 Healthy Habits That Will Drastically Improve Every Area of Your Life, _you will notice that essentially every item listed (chew your food, walk at lunchtime, and so on) could be classified into one of the categories Hollis examines. The running theme in both _Lifehack_ ’s list and Hollis’s is that your overall energy and zest for life will increase if you incorporate the habits they discuss.)

#### Behavior: Trust Yourself as the Voice of Authority

Hollis notes that throughout history, and across the globe, the vast majority of cultures have been patriarchal. This means that the voice of authority in nearly every government and community has been male since the beginning of time. On a smaller scale, in many (not all) families, the father is the decision maker. So for most of us, the voice of authority growing up was male, and this is now ingrained in our subconscious beliefs about leadership.

**If you’re a woman, Hollis says you must rewire this subconscious belief system in order to trust your own authority without the need for male validation. This takes conscious effort.**

> **The Relationship Between Approval-Seeking and Codependence**
> 
> Codependency is a psychological condition—often experienced by children of alcoholics and addicts—in which one person has an unhealthy need for another person’s approval.
> 
> Hollis is an admitted codependent. When she was growing up, every decision she made hinged on her father’s potential reaction. She sought his approval and feared his disappointment. After a decade of marriage, Hollis realized she had transferred the position of authority from her father to her husband, and she was now living for _his_ approval and seeking _his_ validation with every decision she made. When Hollis eventually began trusting her own decision-making skills, it was a major catalyst for her success.
> 
> _Codependent No More_ by Melody Beattie explains this pattern of behavior in depth. Her message (and Hollis’s) is that you can only break free of codependence by recognizing that other people’s thoughts and behavior aren’t your responsibility nor are they within your control.

#### Behavior: Advocate for Yourself

After building healthy habits and trusting your own authority, Hollis wants you to advocate for yourself. Speak up—unapologetically—because while your “village” wants to help, they can’t read your mind.

Hollis says the two best ways to advocate for yourself (and move more quickly toward your goal) is to **ask for help when you need it and say no to requests that will hinder your progress.**

##### Ask for Help

Hollis acknowledges that asking for help isn’t easy. **Women in particular tend to feel guilty for inconveniencing anybody else** , or they **feel weak if they cannot “do it all.”** This guilt and shame must be overcome.

Hollis reminds us that **we each have an entire village that we can turn to when we need help**. This help can come in different forms:

  * **Emotional support** from your loved ones when you feel like quitting
  * **Financial support** to help you get that college degree
  * **Child care, help around the house** , and so on



> **The Connection Between Help and Judgment**
> 
> Brené Brown (shame expert and author of _Daring Greatly_) discusses in a 2013 interview with Oprah the connection between help and self-judgment. According to Brown, if you judge yourself when you ask for help, then you’re also judging others when you offer help. This can cause a bit of cognitive dissonance, as you’re likely thinking: _I don’t judge others when they ask for help!_ However, consider this alternative viewpoint:
> 
> Try instead to view the need for help as a transaction. Acknowledge that you will help when somebody else needs it, and you will receive help when you need it. Taking this perspective will release any shame that you might otherwise feel when asking for help.

##### Say No

Beyond asking for help when you need it, Hollis’s second way of advocating for yourself is saying “no.'' As she explains, **declining requests without guilt allows you to reserve your energies for the areas of your life that are most important to you.**

Hollis recommends you **start by making a simple list of your priorities.** Then, **if the request isn’t going to serve your priorities** , Hollis says you should **politely decline**. When you’ve decided to say no, Hollis recommends you do it **as soon as possible, be polite but honest, and give a clear and firm “no”**(not a probably or maybe).

> **Reframing Your Thinking: A No Is a Yes**
> 
> In _Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less_ , Greg McKeown argues that for every “no” you deliver, you’re really saying “yes” to something else.
> 
> For example, if your friends invite you to dinner and it would mean missing family game night, instead of thinking, “I’m saying no to my friends,” reframe your thinking into, “I’m saying yes to my family.”
> 
> In this same chapter, he also offers some creative ways to decline an invitation for those who feel the word “no” is too harsh or daunting. For instance, **offer an alternative.** If you are uncomfortable completing the request, try offering what you _are_ willing to do. For example, if a friend asks to borrow your car to drive to the airport, try saying, “I can’t do that, but I will take you to the airport if you’d like.” It shows that you want to help, but you still keep your boundary.

### Skills to Acquire

In Part 3 _,_ Hollis provides a list of universal skills that will take you from motivation to achievement. She defines **a skill as any ability that you can learn and develop over time through intentional practice.** The skills she lists are often conventionally viewed as character traits—confidence, for example. However, Hollis argues that if you can develop confidence and use it as a tool, then it is indeed a skill.

In this section, we will take a look at **five universal skills** Hollis believes will serve you best in the pursuit of your dream.

#### Skill: Confidence

Hollis makes clear that confidence is important to success because if you already believe that you’re bad at something, you’re unlikely to even attempt it. In her experience, **there are three distinct areas where you can develop confidence: how you look, how you act, and who you hang out with.**

  * **How you look:** Develop a personal style that makes you feel incredible on the outside. The inside will follow.
  * **How you act:** Fake it until you make it. You have to push your own boundaries in order to grow.
  * **Who you hang out with:** If you surround yourself with confident people, it will rub off on you.



(Shortform note: Self-confidence is more valuable to success than most people realize. According to _Psychology Today_ , self-confidence decreases fear and anxiety, increases motivation, builds resilience, improves your relationships, and allows you to connect to your authentic self.)

#### Skill: Persistence

Hollis states that **nothing significant in her life came quickly**. She stresses the**importance of sticking to your plan and riding out challenges**. To build persistence, Hollis says you need a total mindset shift. **For every goal you have, prepare for the long haul, expect rejection, and avoid the trap of comparison.**

(Shortform note: Angela Duckworth, author of _Grit_ , analyzes in depth the importance of perseverance (persistence) in the face of adversity. In her research, she found that grit was a greater indicator of future success than IQ. Duckworth defines grit as a combination of persistence and passion, so it stands to reason that having a strong “why,” or purpose you feel passionate about, and the willingness to fight for it is your best bet at achieving any dream.)

#### Skill: Effectiveness

Hollis advocates learning how to **manage your time efficiently to get the most out of it**. She recommends you take the following five actions:

  * Replace your to-do list with an outcomes list (what are you trying to accomplish?)
  * Evaluate your efficiency (is there a quicker way to get things done?)
  * Use what helps you focus (music or a comfortable chair?)
  * Avoid your biggest distractions (eliminate them instead of trying to ignore them)
  * Be willing to adjust course (flexibility is key to recognizing opportunities)



(Shortform note: Cal Newport offers several strategies for increasing your focus to be more effective in his book, _Deep Work._ One strategy that he recommends is training your “focus muscles'' by allowing yourself to be bored in situations where you would normally distract yourself. For example, if you’re waiting in line at the DMV, you might naturally reach for your phone. Instead, resist the urge and allow the boredom to happen. This is great focus training for your brain because you will develop increased control and discipline over your thoughts in the same way that an athlete controls their physical movements.)

#### Skill: Positivity

Hollis argues that by choosing positivity every day, **you will recognize the abundance of opportunities and blessings at your feet. As a result, you will have greater success in any goal you aspire to accomplish.** She acknowledges that we can’t control the hardships that come our way. However, she notes that we can control how we respond to these obstacles, disappointments, and catastrophes.

One way that Hollis believes **you can practice positivity is to control your inner dialogue**. Your running mental dialogue is the soundtrack to your life. She believes if you criticize or pity yourself, even if it’s just in your thoughts, these feelings manifest as a negative attitude. When you feel the negative inner dialogue creeping in, Hollis advises you to redirect the conversation in the same way that you could shift a conversation happening out loud.

> **Toxic Positivity: When Is It Okay to Have Negative Vibes?**
> 
> While the benefits of positivity have been well-documented, it can be taken too far.
> 
> Since the time this book was published in 2019, the topic of toxic positivity has garnered attention. Toxic positivity is the belief that we should feel positive emotions all of the time, regardless of the circumstance. Rachel Hollis has faced criticism for encouraging positivity to a level that many people find unhealthy. At the time this guide is being written, Hollis has not yet addressed this criticism.
> 
> How do you know when positivity is healthy or toxic?
> 
> It has been proven through numerous studies that people who have a positive outlook enjoy longer lifespans, less illness, and healthier relationships. **As Mayo Clinic points out, however, there’s a difference between approaching situations with a solutions-mindset and ignoring life’s problems altogether. **The latter is when positivity is actually false and toxic.

### Executing Your Dream

Hollis has walked you through all of the excuses that will hold you back and revealed the truth beneath each one. She has given you behaviors to turn into habits, and she has suggested skills to develop. If you were a carpenter, you’d now have all of the tools necessary to get the job done. The final thing you need is the blueprint, and then you can get to work.

**Your blueprint is a universal step-by-step template that you can use as many times as you want on as many goals as you desire.** Here’s how you execute.

#### First, Choose One Goal Only

Hollis argues that having a long list of goals is wonderful, but that **working on more than one at one time is ineffective**. First, **you will spread yourself too thin** and not dedicate enough energy and time to any one thing to make it happen. Second, if you’re working on multiple goals at a time, **you might give yourself permission to quit when it gets tough** because you’ve got other things going on. But how to choose?

**First, visualize:** Ask yourself, “Who do I want to be in 10 years?” Write furiously for five minutes straight, describing in detail who you want to be and what that person is doing. **Next, strategize:** Take a look at what you wrote, and make a list of accomplishments that would make this dream life possible. Be specific and include only what is crucial. **Finally, prioritize:** Of all the accomplishments on your list, choose **one goal** you can work on **_right now_**.

(Shortform note: Gary Keller, author of _The One Thing_ , centers his book around the idea that choosing one impactful goal-oriented task at a time and performing them sequentially is far more effective than doing several tasks simultaneously. One strategy that he suggests is “going small,” which means to ignore the dozens of things you _could_ be working on, and instead focus on one small task at a time.)

#### Second, Break Down Your Goal Into Steps

**Hollis instructs you to thoroughly plan out your attack, working backward**. Chunk your goal into steps, beginning with **identifying your goal’s three most crucial targets to hit.** These are the three**** things that, if accomplished, will get you all the way to your goal. From there, make a list of how to get from target to target.

**What you’re left with is a step-by-step guide to go from your starting point all the way to your finished goal.**

(Shortform note: This is a great place to utilize the “outcomes list” that Hollis suggested earlier. For example, if your first target on the way to becoming a doctor is to get accepted into medical school, your outcomes list might include items such as: secure three letters of recommendation, complete all necessary prerequisites, and so on.)
