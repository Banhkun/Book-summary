## Part 1.3: Excuses 5 and 6

Because women are conditioned from childhood to care for others and not make waves, their**self-worth and other people’s opinions are often interwoven.** The next excuse that Hollis addresses is **the belief that what other people think of your dream matters.**

### Excuse 5: I’m Worried About What They’ll Think

Hollis explains that **this excuse keeps many women in the fantasy state and stops them from taking their first steps toward their goals.** So what might this excuse look like?

Example: A woman who dropped out of high school and has been raising children for the past 10 years decides she wants to become a doctor. Her first thought might be, _everyone is going to laugh at me for having such a huge ambition when I haven’t even finished high school._ This fear of other people’s opinions might stop her from even starting. But the truth is, her ability to become a doctor has nothing to do with her starting point.

(Shortform note: For some, the act of daydreaming or fantasizing is in itself a satisfying act. It’s the reason why planning a vacation is often more exciting than the vacation itself. Why would this be? In our fantasies, we get to enjoy the reward without all of the work and adversity that is required to achieve it in real life. Sometimes, a fantasy is enough. However, you will know something is a true dream when you return to the same fantasy over and over, and it’s not enough to satisfy you.)

#### The Truth: Other People’s Opinions Are None of Your Business

Despite our paralyzing preoccupation with what other people are thinking and saying about us, Hollis points out this truth: **Most people rarely think about you**. In reality, she says, most people are much more concerned with themselves and what others think of _them_.

(Shortform note: A famous quote by Eleanor Roosevelt sheds light on this topic: “You wouldn’t worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do.” Doubtful? Ask yourself how often you think about your neighbor down the street and compare it to how often you think about yourself.)

And as for those who _are_ thinking about you? Hollis points out that **they almost always view you through their own lens, not as you truly are.** Consider these two examples:

**Example 1:** A person who worries about her own abilities as a mother is likely hyperfocused on motherhood and will judge everyone’s actions through the lens of parenting.

**Example 2:** A person who is struggling to lose weight is likely to have an emotional reaction to any conversation regarding fitness or nutrition, which can manifest as judgmental body language, words, and tone of voice.

Hollis maintains that these people’s current situations and their own past experiences color their judgments and are completely separate from you.

(Shortform note: The ones who _do_ think about you are the ones who care about you the most (your mom, for example). Take comfort in knowing that those who care about you typically have your best interest at heart. They may still judge you through their lens, but their intentions are likely good. If you doubt their intentions, see Behavior 4: Stand Your Ground to help you decide whether they deserve to be in your life.)

#### The Fix: Discern Between Judgment That Matters and Opinions That Don’t

When somebody has a negative judgment of you, Hollis advises that you **first determine whether that judgment is real or if you’re assuming it.**

If the opinion is assumed, she says, don’t worry about it. It’s not real. It is in your head.

If the opinion truly exists (you heard it or read it yourself), then ask yourself: Did it come from somebody who matters? **Do you know this person and care about their opinion?** If you don’t know or care about this person, Hollis tells you to let it go.

If you know and respect this person, Hollis suggests asking yourself: **Did they offer their opinion with kindness and love?** If they didn’t, disregard it. This person may not have your best interest at heart. If they did offer the opinion with compassion, Hollis tells you to take their words under consideration but don’t accept them as gospel truth.

> **When in Doubt, Brainstorm With Someone Who Has Your Back**
> 
> If you begin doubting yourself based on a belief that somebody else has about you, try asking for honest feedback from someone who you know has your best interest at heart. If the person truly cares about you, they’ll point out realistic obstacles that you’re likely to face. **This does not mean that the obstacles are insurmountable**. Brainstorm with your loved one ways that you can overcome them.
> 
> Let’s take the case of the woman who wants to become a doctor. If she were to hear doubt or ridicule from a family member, she should turn to her best friend, partner, mother (whoever she feels closest to) and say, “I know this is going to be difficult, but it is my dream and I am up for the challenge. Can you help me think of all the obstacles I’m going to face and brainstorm solutions with me?”
> 
> Using this method, you will find that those closest to you will want you to succeed and are willing to help you.

### Excuse 6: I Can’t Have It All

By now you’ve decided that your goal is worth having—that _you_ are worth it. You’re capable of achieving it, you don’t care if it’s been done before, and you have made time to work toward it. Bonus: You have even stopped caring what other people think of your dream. **But now you worry that the other areas of your life will suffer**.

Hollis empathizes with your fears. That if you sacrifice time with your partner to work on your goal, your relationship will weaken. That if you choose to work instead of stay home, your children won’t feel as loved as they could. That you will lose friends if you scale back your social life. Hollis insists that**this fear that you can’t have it all is an excuse that will hold you back.**

(Shortform note: These fears don’t need to be ignored. In fact, fears are useful in that they define what we don’t want in our lives. You can use them as a tool to stay grounded in the pursuit of your dream. Write your fears down at the beginning of your journey and refer to them from time to time to make sure that you’re maintaining the relationships that are important to you.)

#### The Truth: Work-Life Balance Is a Myth

Many people aim for balance in life (most commonly, work-life balance), but Hollis believes **you should instead strive to be “centered,” which means to feel content and at peace with all areas of your life.**

She believes that **achieving balance in all areas of our lives is impossible.** Time can never be equally divided among all areas of your life, all of the time. And even if it could be, that still doesn’t mean that every important moment could be attended to. She stresses that **work and home will always compete, and sacrifices will always be needed**. In fact, she points out that we all struggle with balance in our lives even if we aren’t working on a goal, so we might as well be going after what we want.

So how do we achieve this centeredness? Hollis believes that **the easiest way to achieve contentment and relieve yourself of guilt is to intentionally prioritize the important moments.**

> **Are Being Centered and Being Grounded the Same Thing?**
> 
> Two phrases that are often thrown around in conjunction are “being centered” and “being grounded.” But are they interchangeable? According to _Psychology Today_ , while they’re similar, they’re not the same.
> 
> **To be grounded is to live in the present moment.** You aren’t dwelling on the past or worrying about the “what ifs” of the future. There’s a peacefulness that occurs when you live only in the present. How does this relate to goals? Well, let’s say your goal is to run a marathon. Instead of focusing on the past (_I’ve never been a runner_) or fixating on the future (_How will I find time in my schedule to train the longer runs?),_ focus on living in the moment: _I am running one mile right now._
> 
> **To be centered is to have a place to return to** —a value that is paramount to others and can be thought of as a destination. Using the previous example, if the most important thing in your life is your family, use that as your center and work your marathon training around your time with them.

#### The Fix: Focus On Quality Time

Rather than focusing on the number of hours you spend on family, friends, work, and so on, Hollis advises being intentional about _when_ you focus on each. **Go for quality over quantity, and the guilt will melt away.**

For example, your children won’t remember the number of hours you spent with them each day, but **they’ll remember if you had dinner with them every night, or if you showed up for their dance recital.** They’ll remember the family movie nights and one-on-one chats over breakfast.

As another example, your partner would rather have an hour or two of your undivided attention in the evening than an entire day together where you’re checking your emails and your mind is elsewhere.

(Shortform note: If you’re unsure whether you’re doing this right, check in with your most important relationships frequently to gauge whether your loved ones feel you’re there for them. For children, this might be a Sunday night conversation in which you ask, “What is happening this week that is important to you?” When you know what is important to others, it is easier to be there for the right moments.)

**So** **how can you make sure you’re giving enough quality time where it’s needed?** **When scheduling your week** (remember, Hollis said weekly is the key), **start by placing your _priorities_ on the calendar**—the moments that you will feel sad or guilty for missing. All of your other responsibilities can be worked into your calendar around these moments.

(Shortform note: This is an excellent opportunity to utilize _timeboxing_ , as discussed in Excuse 4: I Have No Free Time. Remember, timeboxing is the strategy of setting start and end times to all activities in your life to ensure that priorities are being met.)

**When possible, outsource the tasks that aren’t meaningful.** Hollis is a big believer in utilizing help (more on this in Behavior 3: Advocate For Yourself) and she gives many suggestions for how to winnow your list of responsibilities so that you can give more time to the important stuff.

For example, if your housework is taking time away from your priorities, and it is causing you to feel uncentered and guilty, outsource it. Hire a housekeeper (if you have the means), divide the housework among family members to share the load, or let some parts of your house be messier. Her point is, your time is valuable. Use it in areas that are important to you.

(Shortform note: One of the most effective ways to prioritize your time is to embrace the power of saying “no.” As discussed in Behavior 3: Advocate for Yourself, when you say no to requests that don’t serve you, you free up more time for your priorities. Hollis recommends you decline in a firm, polite, and immediate manner.)

**A final note: Some weeks will be heavier on work and others will be heavier in other areas, but if you prioritize with intention, you will feel centered overall.**
