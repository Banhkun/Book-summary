## Exercise: Craft a Mantra for Positive Self-Talk

Your greatest opportunity to practice positivity is within your inner dialogue.

* * *

Is there a negative thought that you often have about yourself? What is it? (For instance, do you believe that you are lazy or unintelligent?)

Imagine that your best friend overheard a stranger say this comment about you. How do you think your friend would respond? (For example, “She isn’t lazy! She is the hardest worker I know!”)

Take the answer above, condense it into one sentence, and replace the pronouns with “I.” (Example: “I am not lazy! I am the hardest worker I know!”)

Use this mantra whenever you feel the negative thought arise.
