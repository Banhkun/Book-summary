## Part 1.1: Introduction | Excuses 1 and 2

_Girl, Stop Apologizing_ is Rachel Hollis’s follow-up to her bestselling book, _Girl, Wash Your Face._ As Hollis describes it, her first book inspires you to take ownership of your life, and this one teaches you how to pursue your dreams. She asks her readers: “What if” you decided you were worth your dream?

Hollis is an author, blogger, motivational speaker, and former event planner to the stars. Drawing on her own rise from humble beginnings to massive success, Hollis uses the lessons she learned along the way to guide and inspire her readers.

_Girl, Stop Apologizing_ takes a hard look at the cultural brainwashing of women into believing that pursuing personal goals is selfish, unladylike, and unrealistic. Hollis empowers her readers to release these limiting beliefs and self-sabotaging behaviors by drawing attention to their origins, highlighting their ridiculousness, and providing strategies for achievement.

Before you can acquire the behaviors and skills to help you succeed, **first must develop the right mindset.** To Hollis, this means letting go of excuses and embracing a mentality of positivity and perseverance.

**Excuses are a tool of self-sabotage.** Hollis explains that excuses are paralyzing beliefs that serve no valuable purpose and stop you from even trying.

In this section, Hollis goes through the most common excuses that she hears (and once believed herself) for why you can’t live your dream. She takes each excuse and strips it of its power, reveals the truth beneath, and provides you with strategies to conquer it.

(Shortform note: In _The Magic of Thinking Big,_ author and Ph.D. David Schwartz theorizes that people tend to make excuses in one of four areas: health, intelligence, age, and luck. Schwartz acknowledges that we are all born with advantages and disadvantages in life. For example, you can’t help it if you’re born with a disability. The disadvantage itself isn’t an excuse, but when we lean on our disadvantage as the reason we don’t succeed, then it becomes an excuse. He stresses that those with advantages and the wrong attitude are less likely to succeed than those with disadvantages but the right outlook.)

### Excuse 1: Good Women Don’t Focus On Themselves

Foundational to Hollis’s premise in _Girl, Stop Apologizing_ is the notion that **society expects women to care for everyone else,** and a “good woman” will sacrificially cast aside her own desires.

According to Hollis, the phrase **“a good woman” is typically synonymous with “a good wife and mother.”** She points out that by societal standards, a woman is deemed to be a good wife if her husband is happy and satisfied. Similarly, women are praised for being**** good mothers if their children are happy and healthy.

(Shortform note: While Hollis’s assessment of what society deems a “good woman” has strong roots in history and most cultures, the definition of a “good woman” is progressing; especially in light of the Me Too movement. In _Essence_ magazine, Erica and Tina Atkins-Campbell (of the gospel duo Mary Mary) offer a modern definition of a good woman—without any mention of marriage or motherhood. Rather, they define a good woman as someone who knows who she is, is respectful and communicative, is resilient, and is kind and inspirational to others.)

Hollis goes on to say that because society expects women to run the household, **they are often looked down upon for having career ambitions.**

Hollis notes the double standard: **A woman’s ability to earn money for her family is rarely connected with being a “good woman,” whereas men are often praised for being “good men” if they have a respectable job and provide financial security for their families.**

For example, when Hollis started her own business, most people in her circle praised her. However, when she became pregnant, she says everyone she knew expected her to put the business aside and stay home with the children. **She received even more judgment when those around her learned that her husband made enough money for her to stay home**. Hollis realized that her decision to _choose_ to work when she didn’t have to broke one of society’s unwritten rules.

(Shortform note: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted society’s lack of respect for women’s career paths. According to a survey conducted by Seramount (a consulting firm that studies workplace inclusion), about one-third of moms in the workplace had to quit or reduce their hours during the COVID-19 Pandemic in 2020 and 2021, with most citing a need to take care of their children during school closures. However, the government didn’t prioritize child care as a pandemic issue to address.)

At what point do women take on the expectation to sacrifice themselves for others? Hollis says **praise for women meeting _other people’s expectations_ begins in childhood.**

According to Hollis, by conventional standards, a “good girl” is a child who doesn’t make waves. A good girl is happy, humble, and grateful. If she goes against the grain, she is labeled as difficult. Hollis contrasts this attitude with how young boys are seen when exhibiting the same behavior. She says that boys who rebel against the norm are instead viewed as leaders and visionaries.

> **Counterpoint: Expectations on Young Boys to Be Good Men**
> 
> While the societal definition of a “good man” typically does not involve his value as a husband or father, young boys are conditioned in the same way that young girls are. In picture books and television shows, men are modeled as funny, strong, independent, and adventurous. Boys rarely see depictions of men who lean on their wives financially or emotionally, or are clumsy and out of shape—the way many men are in real life. As a result, when boys grow into men that don’t meet the standard modeled for them, they often experience the same cycle of shame that women do.

**Hollis theorizes that this childhood conditioning makes women believe that if they focus on themselves and their own goals (instead of living entirely for other people), they aren’t good women.**

#### The Truth: To Be a Good Woman, Be True to Yourself

Hollis argues that this line of thinking**(** a good woman must always put herself last) is an excuse that women must shed because**when you’re being true to yourself, you’re better able to care for those you love.**

Hollis insists that keeping your dreams hidden away, even if you’re secretly working on them, is the same as hiding part of yourself—and this takes a toll on your well-being. She believes that **if you deny what your soul needs, it will manifest in illness, anxiety, and depression.**

In regard to the idea of selfishness, Hollis points out that a fulfilled woman will be better in all of her relationships. She’ll be a better partner, a better parent, a better friend, and so on.

> **Motherhood Martyrdom Burdens Your Children With Guilt**
> 
> As we’ve established, it is a cultural expectation that good mothers sacrifice for their children. What is less often considered is the guilt that this sacrifice produces, and who is bearing the weight of it.
> 
> Gemma Hartley, author of _Fed Up: Emotional Labor, Women, and the Way Forward_ , wrote in _The Washington Post_ about witnessing her mother’s college graduation. Her mother had quit college when Gemma was born, and she didn’t resume until she was well into her 50s. When Gemma watched her mother cross the stage and receive her diploma, she saw her mother as an individual for the first time—living only for herself, for one brief moment.
> 
> Gemma was plagued with guilt for being “the thing” that made her mom quit college so many years before. She reflected on herself as a mother, and how she had begun setting aside her dreams of being a writer in the name of motherhood martyrdom. She decided in that moment that she would begin living for herself and that her children would be better off because of it.

Hollis reminds you that **you have only one life, and you shouldn’t spend it feeling guilty, embarrassed, or shameful about having a dream.**

#### The Fix: Give Your Soul What It’s Asking For

So what is Hollis’s advice? She says that the only way to live a full and happy life is to be open and honest about your dreams, goals, and desires. Hollis insists that being true to yourself is the most important thing you can do in life. She explains that it doesn’t matter if your dreams are big or small in someone else’s eyes, they just have to be important to you. Some women may dream of being an astronaut, while others may dream of running their own Etsy shop. Hollis says both dreams are equally valid if they feed your soul.

(Shortform note: Even though much of this book focuses on career ambition, your passion doesn’t have to be work-related and doesn’t have to make money. Many people work day jobs and fulfill their dreams and passions as hobbies. For example, your dream might be to live in India for a year, or to see every baseball stadium in America. Hollis’s main point is, don’t hold yourself back with small dreams when your heart is asking for more.)

### Excuse 2: I’m Not Capable

So far, we have established that women learn from an early age that to be “good” is to meet others’ expectations, and that the primary expectation placed upon women is to take care of everyone around them.

Once you decide that you’re worthy of having your own dreams and goals, Hollis says the next excuse you’re likely to tell yourself is that **your dream is too lofty, and you’re not good enough at (fill in the blank) to accomplish it.**

For example, your dream might be to hike to the top of Mount Shasta, but you get winded climbing one flight of stairs. Your inner dialogue might go something like this: “I’m not even capable of walking up two flights of stairs. There’s _no_ way I could make it to the top of a mountain!” **You convince yourself that you’re destined to fail.**

Hollis tells us that everybody holds certain **self-limiting beliefs** —these are **insecurities specific to you that will hold you back**. She says it’s important to remember that these **insecurities are merely opinions you have about yourself** **that can be combated with positive truths.**

> **Self-Esteem Versus Self-Efficacy**
> 
> While they are different, self-esteem and self-efficacy both fuel self-limiting beliefs. If you are holding yourself back, start by identifying whether you’re doubting yourself as a person or if it’s your capability that you’re questioning.
> 
> **_Self-esteem_ is the opinion you have about yourself as a person**; about _who_ you are. If you have high self-esteem, you believe that you’re a good person.
> 
> **_Self-efficacy_ is the opinion you have about your abilities**; about what you’re _capable of doing._
> 
> It is common to have high self-esteem and low self-efficacy, or vice versa. The two aren’t tied together. For example, you may believe you’re a smart person but not capable of passing a certain test. In that case, you would have high self-esteem but low self-efficacy. Or, if you believe that you’re a bad person but know that you’re a great lawyer, that is low self-esteem and high self-efficacy.

#### The Truth: Everyone Sucks in the Beginning

Hollis says that believing you’re not capable is an excuse because the truth is, **everybody struggles at the start of something new and challenging.**

Hollis believes that to become successful in any new venture, **it’s not important to be naturally good** at whatever you’re doing. Rather, **you must have the willingness to be _bad_ at it for a long time**. She stresses that expecting instant or rapid improvement is a mistake and will sabotage genuine progress.

(Shortform note: Instant gratification and fulfillment rarely coexist. Fulfillment comes from achieving something that is deeply and truly important to you. Instant gratification satisfies the pleasure center in your brain, which isn’t your deeper level of desire. For example, you don’t deeply care about pizza, but when you eat it you receive instant gratification. The same can be said for goals. When you work slowly and steadily toward your dream, the importance becomes deeper to you and achieving it provides greater fulfillment.)

Hollis gives a couple of reasons why **not being capable “yet”** **doesn’t matter**. First, she points out that **this** **is true with every new skill you attempt**. For example, babies aren’t born knowing how to crawl, walk, or talk. Imagine if they quit before starting, or shortly after starting. It’s silly when you think of it that way, isn’t it?

Second, she says **not being capable “yet” has no bearing on what you can accomplish in the future**. Continuing with the first example, just because a baby isn’t crawling yet does not mean she will never walk.

(Shortform note: When you embark on a new goal, it may be helpful to research what the typical learning curve is. For example, how long does it take most people to train for a marathon if their starting point is zero? How long does it take most people to complete prerequisites for medical school? This isn’t to say that you should compare yourself to others if your learning curve is steeper or slower; rather, having this information ahead of time likely will ease your worry if you’re worried about your starting point.)

Hollis makes a clear distinction between making mistakes and failing. She stresses that you _will_ make mistakes. **Mistakes are inevitable and will help you develop best practices**. She contrasts this with the idea of **failure,** which**is avoidable**. Hollis defines **failure as letting mistakes scare you into not learning and continuing**.

(Shortform note: Mistakes can be a powerful tool for self-improvement—that is, if you treat them as such. Start by taking responsibility for the mistake. Then reflect on why you made the mistake (don’t dwell; this part should be quick), and make a plan for next time. It is also helpful to write a list of reasons why you don’t want to make the same mistake again.)

Hollis warns her readers to avoid the trap of unhealthy comparison. She says that **if you’re comparing yourself to others, it should be for the purpose of learning and not to gauge your capability for success.**

(Shortform note: Comparing your journey to others’ can easily turn into an unhealthy habit, particularly if you use social media posts to do it. For example, it is rare to find an Etsy crafter who posts pictures of her shoddy first creations. On the rare occasion that you do see this, it is usually only one photo; in reality, the first 20 or more that she made are probably not very good. Keep in mind that social media posts are curated and lead the viewer to believe what the poster wants them to believe.)

#### The Fix: Combat Your Self-Limiting Beliefs With Supportive Truths

Hollis asserts that **the best way to defeat self-limiting beliefs (_opinions_) is to remind yourself of factual evidence to the contrary**. Put another way, for every negative thought you have about your capabilities, refute it with indisputable facts.

For example, if you’re inclined to tell yourself that you’re not smart enough to get a college degree, remind yourself of a time when something was intellectually difficult but you made it through. Or, if you feel you’re not fit enough to climb that mountain, remind yourself of a time when your body accomplished something amazing.

> **Self-Limiting Belief: I Am Not Smart**
> 
> Hollis’s most challenging self-limiting belief was that she wasn’t “smart enough” to run a big business, mostly because she never went to college. It was such a strong belief that it almost kept her from growing her business past a small one-person blog into the large multimedia corporation it is now.
> 
> In his book _Limitless,_ author Jim Kwik says this self-limiting belief is common. He helps his readers combat the belief by teaching them how to recognize their type of intelligence and how they can use it to their advantage. For example, someone might believe that they aren’t intelligent because they did poorly in school, but in reality, they have what is called “practical intelligence,” also known as street smarts. This type of intelligence is no less valuable than the other types, and it can be powerful once embraced.
