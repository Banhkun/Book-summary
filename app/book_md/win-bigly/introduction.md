## Introduction

Most people think there is one objective reality, and we can understand that reality through facts and reason.

The problem is that we all think we’re the enlightened ones, and people who disagree with us just need better facts or better brains. If there is a single truth, isn’t it odd that everyone sees their personal beliefs as the truth, and that so many people disagree on what the truth is?

People actually make decisions more irrationally than they realize. We are subject to biases and pulled by our emotions. **We make decisions first, and rationalize them after the fact**. Analogously, asking someone what they want to do and why is also faulty. People don’t understand the reasons for their own behavior.

Consider humans as **moist robots, computers that respond predictably when given certain inputs**. Furthermore, moist robots can be reprogrammed if you know how to interface with them.

The view of reality that you have is a **“filter” that interprets the data you get and predicts an outcome**. The filter doesn’t have to be objectively correct - as long as it makes you happy and it predicts events accurately, it’s a good filter.

  * The moist robot filter lets you influence people and predict people’s irrationalities more than if you assumed everyone was fact-based and rational all the time.
  * You may think that you can will a successful future into being by envisioning it. Confirmation bias will highlight the times this worked and discard the failures. That’s fine - as long as it makes you happy and it works some of the time, it’s a decent filter for life.
  * Multiple filters or interpretations of reality may explain the existing data. You won’t know which one is true until you see how it predicts future results.



Evolutionarily, the reason we don’t need to see reality objectively is that objectivity isn’t always necessary for survival. Any illusion that keeps humans alive enough to procreate is good enough.
