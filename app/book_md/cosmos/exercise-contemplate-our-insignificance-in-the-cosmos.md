## Exercise: Contemplate Our Insignificance in the Cosmos

Sagan emphasizes how the vastness of the cosmos highlights our insignificance. Ponder your place in the universe.

* * *

Thinking about these questions can cause existential anxiety for some people. But it can also be liberating and empowering. How do you feel when you contemplate the vastness of the universe as compared to this “pale blue dot” you live on?

In what ways can you imagine your “insignificance” in the cosmos being liberating? What kinds of concerns in your life might be alleviated if you could embrace the idea that perhaps they don’t matter in the grand scheme of things?

How might this perspective change the way you go about your daily life?
