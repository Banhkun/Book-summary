## Category 4: How a Brain Thinks, Part 1

The previous category focused on how the brain integrates sensory information. This category focuses on a more conscious process: thinking. **Medina argues we can improve our learning and performance by understanding how the brain’s thought processes work.** This category discusses how the brain pays attention and how the brain creates and retrieves memories.

### Rule 6: Paying Attention Is a Multi-Step Process

Medina argues that **the better we’re able to focus on something, the better we’re able to learn it and remember it.** In this chapter, he explores how we pay attention, what piques our attention, and why multitasking doesn’t work.

#### How Attention Works

At any given time, there are millions of sensory neurons carrying messages to your brain, each competing for your attention. But only a few capture it. Stimuli direct our attention and help us to determine what is most important to focus on at any given moment. If our brains didn’t direct our attention to specific stimuli, so many things would be competing for our attention that it’d be difficult to focus on any one.

To pay attention, our brains go through a process controlled by three neural networks, which are activated consecutively.

  * The first is the **alerting network.** This kicks our focus into gear. For example, if you’re sitting at your desk and a co-worker starts a conversation, your alerting network will register their voice.
  * The second part is the **orienting network.** This processes information about the stimulus. In less than a second, you’d comprehend what your coworker said. 
  * The third part is the **executive network.** This dictates which action to take in response to the stimulus. You would then respond to their coworker.



> **Selective Attention**
> 
> The process of paying attention, controlled by the alerting, orienting, and executive networks, is activated through _selective attention._Selective attention allows us to narrow our attention to one thing at a time, even in an environment filled with stimuli. For example, if you’re in a coffee shop, your alerting network will kick into gear if you hear the barista call your name, but you won’t register the conversations of patrons around you.
> 
> Because of selective attention, we’re able to filter out unimportant information and focus on what’s relevant to us—if we didn’t have selective attention, our alerting network would ping back and forth between numerous sounds and images, without letting us focus on any one.

##### Emotion Grabs Our Attention

Emotionally charged stimuli capture our attention. Medina argues that this is a result of human evolution, because emotions like fear and sexual arousal are important for survival.

If you want to capture someone’s attention, Medina thus recommends using emotion as a “hook” to draw them in. For example, many advertisers and marketers use emotion to sell products and services. For example, advertisements often show happy people using their products. If you’re giving a presentation, play to your audience’s emotions to pull them in, instead of just relaying facts.

> **How Emotion Affects Our Attention**
> 
> A recent study shows how emotion in storytelling grabs our attention. Researchers showed participants an episode of a television show, while scanning their brains to measure their attention. They found that the participants’ brains all showed similarly high levels of attention during emotionally engaging moments (for example, when a character was solving a mystery). During less emotionally stimulating scenes, their attention fell.
> 
> This study shows how people’s attention naturally focuses and drifts off, and echoes Medina’s assertion that emotional stimuli consistently make people pay attention.

#### Why Multitasking Fails

Medina writes that multitasking is impossible when we do tasks that require our full focus. For example, you can’t read a book and watch a movie at the same time and keep full attention on both of them. On a higher-stakes level, it’s impossible to fully concentrate on driving if you’re also sending a text message.

Multitasking doesn’t work because it’s like subjecting yourself to a series of interruptions, and interruptions prevent you from sustaining focus on any one activity. Medina explains what interruptions do to our attention by outlining the steps that attention follows:

  1. Focus engaged: For example, when you bake a cake, you start by reading the first steps of the recipe.
  2. Focus sustained: You read that the first step is to crack three eggs, so you crack your first egg.
  3. Focus shifted: Suddenly, your cat walks into the room meowing loudly, and you break your focus from the cake. You realize that you haven’t fed the cat yet today. 
  4. Focus sustained on second stimulus: No longer focused on the cake, you feed the cat.
  5. Focus re-engaged: You then re-engage your focus on baking the cake.



By attempting to focus on two tasks at once, you lessen your ability to complete either. You can be more productive and focused, then, by completing one task at a time.

> **How to Stay Focused, Instead of Multitasking**
> 
> As Medina notes, when you multitask, you lose your focus, since your attention is redirected again and again. If you frequently multitask and struggle to pay attention to a single task, here are a few recommendations:
> 
>   * **Pick a few times of day to check email, messages, and/or social media.** These all pose frequent distractions, so it can be helpful to determine specific times to check these instead of refreshing them throughout the day.
> 
>   * **Remove distractions from your environment.** If you still find yourself checking your phone, your email, or social media frequently, try moving your phone to a different room and blocking distracting websites.
> 
>   * **If your environment is still distracting, leave it.** If your workspace has numerous distractions and you need to focus intently on a project, pick a different space with fewer distractions.
> 
>   * **Do the most difficult, or most important, task of your day first.** By doing this, you complete the most focus-intensive work of your day early, so there’s less pressure to finish it later.

### Rule 7: The Brain Needs to Form, Retrieve, and Forget Memories

The previous chapter discussed how we pay attention, and how our attention can be diverted. This chapter describes the results of paying attention: **forming memories. Medina writes that we can strengthen our memories through repetition, and therefore boost our learning.**

Medina primarily focuses on declarative memories, or memories that you have to actively think about to retrieve. Nondeclarative memories are the opposite. (For example, remembering the names of your kindergarten classmates would be declarative memories, while remembering your own first name would be a nondeclarative memory.)

Medina discusses why humans need memory, and how the brain creates, stores, and retrieves memories. He also describes several techniques for building strong memories through different types of repetition, and he suggests strategies for building strong memories in school and at work.

#### Why We Need Memories

Medina writes that memory is essential to human survival. Early humans lived among species that were physically stronger than us. Having strong memories gave us a mental advantage over any other species. As humans evolved, memory allowed us to remember important facts about our environments, like where to find food or where predators lived.

Medina argues that **memory is one of the key characteristics that makes us human, because it enables us to retain information and learn from experience.** For example, we need memory to use spoken and written language, a uniquely human ability.

> **The Evolution of Memory**
> 
> Many forms of memory evolved over time, leading to progressively more complex animal life. Researchers have determined seven types of memory that modern animals have, growing gradually more complex. The most complex, the social-subjective system, belongs only to humans.
> 
> The social-subjective system allows us to form societies, learn facts, and participate in organized social interactions with one another. This system allows us to have autobiographical memory, or memories about our individual lives and identities, and knowledge of the cultures we live in.

#### How Your Brain Encodes Memories

To form memories, and therefore learn from experience, the brain goes through a complex process. Medina writes that **the most important part of making a memory is encoding** , which is how our brain processes and stores sensory information. Encoding happens in the first few seconds of having an experience.

When we take in new information, each of our senses processes it at the same time. For example, imagine purchasing a danish from a new bakery in your neighborhood. You’d see the display case of baked goods, you’ll hear the sounds of the customers and employees, you’ll feel the pastry you’ve been handed, and you’ll smell and taste the danish you’ve purchased. Each of these senses is processed by different areas of the brain, so all of this information is converted into electrical signals by neurons in their respective areas.

After encoding, the brain then**** stores the different pieces of information in the areas that they’ve been processed in. Instead of the memory of the bakery entering one particular spot in your brain, then, the various sensory information you’ve processed in the bakery will be dispersed all over the brain.

> **What Happens When Encoding Is Disrupted?**
> 
> The importance of encoding can be seen when the process is disrupted—for example, when the hippocampus, the area of the brain that encodes short-term memories into long-term ones, is damaged. Hippocampus damage can occur through injury or conditions like Alzheimer’s disease.
> 
> When someone’s hippocampus doesn’t function properly, that person develops _anterograde amnesia_ , meaning they can remember very short-term memories but can’t form long-term memories. Thus, while a person with a properly functioning hippocampus would be able to remember their trip to a new bakery a week later, a person with a damaged hippocampus might only remember it for a few minutes.

##### Automatic Versus Effortful Processing

Not all encoding is the same. There are two major types of encoding, _automatic_ and _effortful_ processing, which determine how easy or difficult it will be to retrieve a memory.

**Automatic processing is encoding that requires very little conscious effort, usually involving visual stimulus.** For example, when you see a memorable movie, your brain will encode it automatically.

**Effortful processing, on the other hand, requires conscious attention to form a memory.** For example, when you study for a test, your brain uses effortful encoding. Effortful encoding can be challenging and requires numerous repetitions before you can easily remember what you learned.

> **“Chunking” Can Help Effortful Processing**
> 
> In _A Mind for Numbers_ , Barbara Oakley describes _chunking, a strategy for forming and retaining memories._ A “chunk” is a group of related ideas that you sort together in your mind to create meaning from your memories. Oakley notes that we can hold only a limited amount of working (or short-term) memories at a time—about four chunks of information. Automatic processing helps us chunk a lot of information without us noticing, but sometimes chunking requires effortful processing. Oakley suggests some strategies for chunking more efficiently to build stronger memories.
> 
> One chunking technique you can use is to simplify concepts you’re learning to the extent that you could easily explain them to someone that knows nothing about the topic. This helps you thoroughly understand the concept, helping to firmly commit the concepts to memory.
> 
> Another technique is to chunk from the “bottom-up”: Learn the information, then learn the concepts behind the information, then learn the context surrounding the information. These steps give you a full picture of the information you want to learn, helping to cement it in your memory.
> 
> By trying either of these strategies, you’ll improve your effortful processing and have an easier time committing difficult information to memory.

##### Short-Term Versus Long-Term Processing

Just as there are two primary types of encoding, there are two different types of memory: working memory (or short-term memory) and long-term memory. Short-term memories are usually accurate, but long-term memories can be filled with false information.

**Working memories are temporary memories that have been stored for immediate use.** Short-term memory retrieval is straightforward: When you search for a memory, you’re able to find it and review it accurately.

**Long-term memories are a small number of memories that are stored for an extended period of time.** Long-term memory retrieval is more complicated. We likely remember bits and pieces of the long-past event or information, and then fill in the gaps based on what they think makes sense. This can lead to a memory that’s filled with false information. Even if a memory is important to you, it can become difficult to remember accurately if you don’t think or talk about it often.

> **“Knowledge Collapse” Occurs Before Creating Long-Term Memories**
> 
> Medina describes the difficulties of retrieving long-term memories. Barbara Oakley expands on this in _A Mind for Numbers_ , where she discusses one particular pitfall of long-term memory. 
> 
> This pitfall is called _knowledge collapse_. As you learn more about a subject, your neurons will sometimes have to rearrange themselves in order to store the new information. This can temporarily wreak havoc on retrieving your long-term memories about the subject: As restructuring occurs, it becomes suddenly difficult to remember information you thought you solidly knew.
> 
> However, this is a temporary problem, as this restructuring ultimately helps you learn new and complex information. If you experience knowledge collapse, instead of stressing and giving up, keep up with your learning until your brain has integrated the new information.

#### Techniques for Creating Strong Memories

**To strengthen effortful processing and to create accurate long-term memories, we need to repeat the information, starting soon after the event occurs.** Effortful processing can be difficult and long-term memory can be unreliable. If you don’t use repetition to create strong, reliable memories, then you’ll have difficulty learning from your memories.

Medina describes several repetition strategies that can help us create strong memories. One strategy is to use a complex process to give meaning to your memories. When information has a lot of meaning, it becomes much easier to remember. For example, if you need to memorize a shopping list, it would help you to think about what you need each item for. You’ll have an easier time remembering the items than if you tried to memorize them without context.

(Shortform note: One way to give memory meaning, which Barbara Oakley suggests in _A Mind for Numbers_ , is to create a “memory palace.” To create a memory palace, imagine a place that you know well—for example, your childhood home. Then fill it with images representing the concept you want to remember. If you’re trying to remember your grocery list, for example, you could imagine a dozen eggs sitting on the shelf of the kitchen, bottles of hand soap on the bathroom counter, and detergent in the laundry room.)

Another strategy is to repeat information over an extended period of time. Spacing out repetition of information is more effective than trying to cram it all in at once. Rather than repeating information 15 times in a row, then, Medina would recommend repeating it once a day for 15 days.

(Shortform note: Research suggests that repeating information without breaks in between is hardly better than not repeating information at all. But if you don’t have time to repeat information periodically over the course of several hours or days, repeating with short breaks in between can be helpful. For example, if you have a test in an hour and want to remember a vocabulary word, you could repeat it frequently with 10-second breaks in between.)

Another strategy is to reflect and interpret a memory right after it’s formed. This is useful if you have an experience you immediately know you want to remember. Right after an event occurs or you learn new information, discuss the facts of it with someone else. Once you’ve talked about the facts, then discuss your personal interpretation of the event or information.

(Shortform note: If you’re an educator, one way you can use this memory-boosting technique is to quiz students often. This is because it makes students apply what they learned, and consider their interpretations of the information, right after they learn it.)

##### A Technique for Retrieving Memories

In addition to using strategies for forming memories, you can use strategies for retrieving long-term memories. One strategy is to put yourself in the same circumstances you first learned the information in. This is called context-dependent learning: People recall information better in the same situation in which they first encoded it. For example, if you learned a concept in your backyard, you could return to your backyard to reinforce it. Or if you were listening to a particular song, you could play that song again while you review.

> **State-Dependent Learning**
> 
> In the same way that you can better recall information in the same place you were when you learned it, you can also better recall information when you’re in the same mood or physical state. This is called _state-dependent learning_.
> 
> One study showed that people who learn information while drunk remember it better while drunk, while those who learn information sober remember it better sober. This shows how the physical state you’re in affects what you remember.
> 
> If you want to create strong memories, try recreating the state you’re in when you first learned them. For example, if you were in a good mood when you first learned a piece of information, try thinking of happy memories to recreate that same mood.

#### How to Create Strong Memories in School and at Work

How well we remember information affects our success in important areas of our lives, especially school and the workplace. Because of this, Medina suggests several techniques to strengthen memories in school and at work.

One strategy is for schools to repeat material several times over the course of a day, instead of having hour-long classes for each subject. According to Medina, frequent repetitions would encourage strong memory encoding. For example, a student might have 25 minutes of English, 25 minutes of math, and 25 minutes of history, which would be repeated three times.

(Shortform note: Repeating information in intervals helps to remember concepts, so it’s recommended that students repeat what they learned after class, in the evening, and before the next class. This suggests that Medina’s idea would be an effective model for learning: It provides class time to reinforce concepts, so students could retain information better and spend less time studying.)

Another strategy is for schools and businesses to repeat key information over the course of several years. Long-term repetitions can help to cement information in your long-term memory. In schools, Medina suggests reviewing course material periodically. For example, students would review basic algebra once a year from the seventh grade to the eleventh grade. In businesses, Medina suggests offering classes that provide reviews of important skills. For example, a marketing professional would be able to take classes to refresh their knowledge on social media, digital marketing, and writing skills.

(Shortform note: Research shows that learning information over a long period of time can help cement it. A study of foreign language students showed that they remembered words better when they learned and repeated them over the course of 56 days than when they learned them over 28 days. This suggests that Medina’s idea of repeating information over an extended period of time could help students retain information.)
