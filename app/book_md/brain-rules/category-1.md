## Category 1: How Nature Makes a Brain

The first category focuses on how natural processes have shaped the brain. Medina describes two rules that fall under this category:

  * Rule 1: Our brains evolved to adapt to new environments
  * Rule 5: Our brains are all wired uniquely based on our individual experiences.****



**These two rules affect how we approach the world and allow us to learn from changes and problems in our lives.**

### Rule 1: Our Brains Have Evolved for Survival

For the first rule, Medina starts at the beginning of the human race.

In this chapter, Medina discusses how the physical adaptations of the human body helped our brains to develop in the advanced way that led to our species’ unique intelligence. He says that this specialized evolutionary process led to the development of three uniquely human characteristics: the ability to imagine, the ability to embrace variety, and the ability to cooperate.

By understanding the evolution of the brain and how it led to these characteristics, we can learn how brain evolution has allowed us to thrive.

#### Physical Adaptations Allowed for Brain Development

According to Medina, one particular advance played a major role in our brain evolution: the ability to walk on two legs instead of four, which happened when we migrated from forests to grasslands and needed to travel long distances to get food and water.

Not only did walking on two legs allow us to cover more ground quickly, but it’s also a less energy-intensive method of moving around, and thus allowed our bodies to devote more resources to our brain development than our basic bodily functions.

> **Another Theory for Why Humans Walk on Two Legs**
> 
> Medina and many contemporary scientists believe that walking on two legs allowed for crucial brain development—and there’s research that backs it up, including that chimpanzees use much less energy when they walk on two legs than when they walk on four, suggesting that the brain could use that spared energy.
> 
> The same research suggests another plausible theory that Medina does not address, which is that we evolved to walk on two legs to make it easier to carry food. Researchers also found some support for this theory, because chimpanzees often walk on two legs when carrying important food.

#### Three Distinctly Human Characteristics

Medina argues that as we evolved, we developed the ability to think rationally, which allowed us to deal with difficult, changing, or complex circumstances. This led to the development of **three human capabilities that form the basis for society and culture: imagination, the ability to adapt to variation, and cooperation.**

##### We Can Use Our Imaginations

One key characteristic of humans that sets us apart from other species is our imaginative capability, which allows us to engage in **symbolic reasoning, or the ability to make meaning from things that aren’t inherently meaningful.** For example, when you look at a cloud and think it’s shaped like a turtle, you’re using symbolic reasoning.

Symbolic reasoning has allowed for the development of many central aspects of human existence, like written language, artistic expression, mathematics, and science. It’s also enabled us to develop societies and culture, which required the ability to imagine ways of life that didn’t already exist: for example, agriculture, towns & cities, and formal education.

> **Can Animals Use Symbolic Reasoning?**
> 
> While Medina argues that symbolic reasoning is a uniquely human ability, other researchers have found evidence that monkeys use it too. One study examined whether capuchin monkeys were able to engage with symbolic reasoning by testing their ability to understand the concept of exchanging currency for goods. When the researchers presented tokens representing food to the monkeys, the monkeys understood that taking a token would enable them to get food, suggesting that they’re able to use symbolic reasoning to some extent.
> 
> However, they had more trouble determining how valuable a token was—for example, the monkeys didn’t have a preference between a token representing one Cheerio and a token representing four pieces of Parmesan cheese, even though four pieces of cheese would be more valuable to them. The researchers concluded, then, that the monkeys’ ability to use symbolic reasoning was less developed than humans’ ability. So while symbolic reasoning itself may not be exclusively human, the advanced way that we use symbolic reasoning is unique.

##### We Embrace Variation

Our unique evolution also led to another specifically human characteristic: our acceptance of variation and change, which was necessary because early humans had to deal with great instability.

As humans evolved, the climate began to change rapidly. While early humans lived in hot, humid environments, later humans had to deal with a climate that constantly changed from hot to cold. We’ve mentioned that early humans migrated from forests to grasslands. They did this, in part, to find new sources of food in an ever-changing climate. Once there, they not only had to adjust to a new environment but also contended with the species already living there. Many of these species were stronger than humans.

In response to these massive changes in our environments, our brains developed the ability to quickly solve problems and to learn from past mistakes. We evolved the ability to retain memories and to make decisions based on those memories. As a result, we now have brains well-equipped to adapt to new environments and respond to new situations.

> **Theories About Climate Change and Brain Evolution**
> 
> Medina’s argument that climate change spurred human brain evolution is supported by research. However, the studies supporting this theory are recent, and scientists have differing views on how climate change affected brain development.
> 
> Researchers have found that the two most significant periods of early human evolution coincided with periods of climate change. While this shows that there’s a correlation between climate change and human evolution, scientists have different views on what that correlation might be. For example, some scientists believe that most brain development occurred during periods when the climate varied between wet and dry and between hot and cold (this matches Medina’s belief). Others believe that most brain development occurred during “wet” periods of climate change, when the climate was most conducive to thriving human life. They believe that the abundance of resources in these periods allowed humans to develop more complex cultures.
> 
> While scientists draw different conclusions on _how_ climate change impacted human brain development, they largely agree that it shaped our ability to respond to change in some way.

##### We Cooperate With Others

Another key human characteristic Medina outlines is the ability to cooperate with one another.

Since humans are not as strong as many other animals, we had to develop the ability to work with one another in order to survive. Humans developed an essential skill to make this possible: the ability to imagine what others may be thinking or feeling.

People ascribe motivations and feelings to one another, and even sometimes to animals and objects. Because we can “read” people’s emotions, we can communicate and solve complex problems with one another. Medina suggests that symbolic reasoning may have developed so we could imagine people’s thoughts and feelings.

> **Do Animals Cooperate and Read Emotions?**
> 
> While Medina writes that the ability to cooperate and read emotions are uniquely human features, other researchers have found these skills in animals. They hypothesize that other species evolved these abilities because cooperation can bolster the health of a species.
> 
> For example, researchers have found evidence that dogs and primates are able to detect emotions in others, both in their own species and in humans. This indicates that these species use this skill to strengthen social ties.
> 
> So while cooperation and the ability to read emotions are essential human characteristics, other animals possess them to some degree as well.

### Rule 5: Our Brains Are Each Uniquely Wired

**While our brains all fulfill the same basic functions, the structure of every brain is unique to every individual. This is why every person has an individual array of talents and skills.**

In this chapter, Medina explores how this came to be. He discusses how neurons shape the functions of our brain, and how each person ends up with a set of neurons that are unique to them. He then explores how we can use this information to structure our schools and businesses to function more efficiently.

#### Neurons Control Our Learning

Neurons are the cells that carry out the brain’s functions, including allowing the brain to absorb information. When our brains receive information, our neurons process it by sending messages to each other in the form of electrical signals or chemicals. This is how the brain has thoughts, creates memories, and learns new concepts.

(Shortform note: Neurons communicate with each other by sending electric signals to the brain, then converting them into chemicals to transmit the messages to one another.)

#### Everyone Has a Unique Set of Neural Pathways

The process of developing neural connections occurs differently in every person. As a result, everyone’s brain ends up with its own unique set of neural connections.

The average adult has 10,000 points of connection between neurons. Some of these connections are created through genetics and control things like our bodily functions and our ability to learn languages. But many of these connections are created through experiences, and then influence the way we understand the world.

When we’re exposed to new things, our brains adapt and incorporate the information into our neural networks. Because everyone’s individual experiences are unique, our brains develop unique ways of reacting to and understanding the world.

> **Experiences Shape Neural Growth Most in Childhood**
> 
> Researchers note that experiences early in life have more of an effect on neural growth than experiences later in life.
> 
> For example, experiences with language early in life influence a person’s language skills later in life. Studies show that, if someone is regularly exposed to multiple languages as an infant, they’re more likely to be bilingual later on. And children who learn two languages to fluency typically develop a larger left brain hemisphere.
> 
> Early experiences can also increase the likelihood of developing mental disorders. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one mental disorder that’s often shaped by early experience: Research shows that problems during pregnancy, birth complications, premature birth, and a dysfunctional home during childhood are all associated with the later development of ADHD.

To illustrate how everyone’s brains are unique, Medina discusses studies that show how people store information in different parts of their brains. For example, two people may store their language ability in different regions from one another. This uniqueness shows the flexibility of our brains and accounts for our ability to adapt to new circumstances and environments.

(Shortform note: This illustrates that, even if a cognitive function is usually processed by one part of the brain, individuals may store it differently. Most people store language on the left side of their brain. However, some people also store language on both sides of the brain, or only on the right side.)

#### We Can Redesign Schools and Workplaces to Accommodate Individuality

Medina argues that we can redesign institutions like schools and workplaces to suit everyone’s unique brain wiring. Since most schools and workplaces are standardized in structure, they don’t fit all individuals. For example, while most students are expected to read by the 1st grade, not all children have the ability to do so yet.

Medina recommends a couple of methods of individualized instruction to address this issue. To help suit school to individual students, Medina recommends smaller class sizes. This would help teachers learn students’ different learning styles. Another technique for individualized instruction is to use a “flipped classroom” where students review lectures at home before doing supervised homework at school.

> **Are Small Class Sizes and Flipped Classrooms Effective?**
> 
> Medina recommends small class sizes as a way to encourage individualized learning, but findings on their effectiveness are mixed. A set of studies showed that while small class sizes improved reading skills, they did not improve math skills. This mixed effectiveness might be because schools have to hire a large number of teachers in order to create small classes, which might lead them to lower their hiring standards so that some of those teachers may not be well-qualified. Studies show that while small class sizes can encourage individualized instruction, it’s _more_ important for students to have great teachers.
> 
> On the other hand, studies show that flipped classrooms can be very effective. Students in flipped classrooms often see improvements in their memory of important concepts, critical thinking, and engagement with course materials.

For workplaces, Medina believes that employees should advocate for changes that will help them individually, such as schedule flexibility. Medina also recommends that managers pay close attention to the strengths and weaknesses of their employees, and assign tasks and projects based on their abilities.

> **Individualized Workplaces**
> 
> Many professionals agree with Medina’s ideas for workplaces that accommodate workers’ individuality, as they can help both employees and managers.
> 
> Flexible work schedules are helpful for employees because they can adapt their schedules to their lifestyles, and they’re helpful for managers because their employees are happier and more productive.
> 
> Likewise, tasks assigned based on strengths are helpful for employees because they can do work they like, and they’re helpful for managers because their employees are more likely to do strong work.
