## Exercise: How Do You Use Your Memory?

Medina argues that we can strengthen our memories through repetition. A few of the techniques Medina suggests include repeating information over an extended period of time, giving meaning to information, reflecting on and discussing information soon after you learn it, and putting yourself in the same situation as when you first learned the information.

* * *

Think of a time when you used one of the strategies Medina recommends, such as playing scales every day when learning to play an instrument (repetition), or creating acronyms when studying for a test (making meaning). How effective was the strategy?

Why do you think this strategy was effective, or ineffective?

In what situations would you use that strategy in the future? If you wouldnâ€™t use this strategy again, pick another strategy Medina describes, and explain why you would use that strategy in the future.
