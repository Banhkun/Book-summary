## Exercise: How Do You Imagine and Cooperate?

Medina described symbolic reasoning and cooperation as two special features of human behavior. Everybody makes use of these skills in their daily lives, whether they think about it or not.

* * *

Think of a time when you were working with others, and you had to “read” someone else’s emotions or motivations to get effective work done. (For example, if you’re proposing ideas for a project with a coworker, you might have to read their emotions to assess whether they like your proposals.) What did you think that person was feeling or thinking?

Why did you think this is what the other person felt or thought?

How accurate were your assumptions about your collaborator’s thoughts or feelings?

Based on this experience, how will you approach “reading” someone else’s thoughts and feelings in the future?
