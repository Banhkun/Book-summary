## Introduction | Chapter 1: Choices in Strategy

A.G. Lafley and Roger Martin—who worked together at Procter & Gamble between 2000 and 2015 as the CEO and a consultant, respectively—open by saying that most people don’t understand why some business strategies succeed and others fail. Without this understanding, they have trouble choosing a good strategy themselves.

However, Lafley and Martin assert that developing a good business strategy is deceptively simple: **It’s the process of making tough choices that puts you ahead of the competition.** These choices can confine you—making one choice often means forgoing another one—but they’re necessary for success. The key to finding a good strategy is learning how to _win_ rather than just how to _play_.

The authors add that all employees, from the CEO to a retail salesperson, have to make strategic choices. Furthermore,**they have to make those choices not just with the intent to compete, but to win.** Winning will look different for different segments of the company: On the company level, it may include becoming the number one player in the market; on an individual level, it may mean having the best sales numbers in a region.

In _Playing to Win_ , Lafley and Martin explain their system for designing winning strategies, which they developed at P&G. The authors call their system the “ _strategic choice c_ ascade” to illustrate how each step flows into the next. For this guide, we’ll use the term _waterfall strategy_ instead, which is simpler and more intuitive.

In Chapter 1, Lafley and Martin give a high-level overview of their system, which is based on five questions. Chapters 2 through 6 each focus on one of those questions, explaining what the question means and why it’s important. Chapter 7 guides you in working through the waterfall process yourself. Finally, the conclusion provides guidelines for determining whether the strategy you’ve created is a good one.

(Shortform note: In _Good Strategy/Bad Strategy_ , Richard Rumelt offers a different definition of good strategy: using your strengths against weaknesses. This could mean using your strengths against _your competitors’_ weaknesses in order to get an advantage, or using your strengths against _your own_ weaknesses in order to fix them. To integrate that definition with Lafley and Martin’s, a good strategy means making tough choices about what your strengths are, and where to apply them.)

### The Waterfall Strategy

In _Playing to Win,_ Lafley and Martin outline their concept of a “good” strategy that involves making winning choices—**the waterfall strategy: an action plan for success in business.**

**The authors’ waterfall strategy entails answering five questions:**

  1. What is your business’s vision and purpose, or your “winning aspiration”?
  2. What are your target markets?
  3. How do you succeed in those markets? 
  4. What capabilities does your company need in order to “win,” or achieve its purpose?
  5. How should you manage your company in order to achieve its purpose?



Starting at the highest level, each question informs the next (hence the waterfall analogy) while also helping to refine the answers to the previous questions.**As you work through the waterfall and gain new insights, you’ll revisit and refine your answers to previous questions.**

> **Keep Your Answers Concise**
> 
> While these five questions form the foundation of Lafley and Martin’s waterfall strategy, it’s important not to get bogged down in pursuing too many different answers to them. Pursuing too many options, or options that work against each other, is a common reason many business strategies fail. Instead, **make only a few specific choices that, taken together,form a clear and cohesive strategy to reach your goal. **

The authors add that, **in large companies, many individual choices and broader strategies function at once and in conversation with one another.** For example, one employee’s strategy could play into a brand strategy, which in turn connects with a larger sector strategy, which forms part of the overarching company strategy. Each strategy flows together to form a cohesive strategy that determines the overall success of the company—**the authors call this a “nested cascade,” a waterfall made up of smaller waterfalls.**

This guide will detail how companies can win at each level along the waterfall. First, we’ll explore each step of the waterfall in detail. Then, we’ll look at how to develop a system of decision-making that increases your company’s chances of winning, or dominating its market.

(Shortform note: In his business guide _Good Strategy/Bad Strategy_ , Richard Rumelt asserts that simply having a strategy gives you an advantage over many other companies, who operate reactively or with only vague long-term goals. In other words, no matter what your _specific_ strategy is, having a clear set of goals and guidelines puts you in a stronger position by default than many of your competitors.)

#### Misconceptions About Strategy

Lafley and Martin believe that businesses often struggle with strategy because they misunderstand what it is. They describe several common misconceptions:

**1\. Strategy is just a vision.** Vision statements are good, but often there’s no action plan to back them up. There’s no point in having a vision if you don’t have a way to realize it.

(Shortform note: In _Good Strategy/Bad Strategy_ , Rumelt adds that companies sometimes think vision and motivation __ are all you need for a good strategy, as if you can realize your goals through sheer dedication and force of will. Like Lafley and Martin, he says this approach is incorrect: Dedication and determination are excellent values, but they’re not aspects of strategy.)

**2\. Strategy is just a plan.** A step-by-step plan is fine, but it’s not enough on its own to secure an advantage in the marketplace. A good strategy is goal-oriented and flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances.

(Shortform note: Rumelt says that, in creating a goal-oriented strategy, it’s important to choose appropriate goals (he uses the term “objectives”). Like Lafley and Martin, Rumelt warns against splitting your focus among too many different goals, and he adds that each of your goals should be a clear step from your current situation to your desired situation.)

**3\. A long-term strategy is a waste of time.** Many people think the world changes so quickly that long-term planning is impossible. This makes them _reactive_ rather than _proactive,_ which puts them at a disadvantage against more strategic competitors.

(Shortform note: In creating a long-term strategy for your company, there are certain challenges that you’re sure to face, such as competition, distribution, and advertising. Rumelt says that one common planning pitfall is failing to clearly and specifically identify inevitable challenges, which makes it impossible to overcome them.)

**4\. Strategy works within the status quo.** A lot of companies try to optimize their strategy for the current situation, or else rely on “best practices,” instead of innovating new approaches to anticipate and meet customer needs. Again, this makes them _reactive_ instead of _proactive._

(Shortform note: One reason this is such a common strategic pitfall is that people tend to resist change—we’re inclined to uphold the status quo even if we _know_ that better alternatives are possible. Therefore, companies are unlikely to pursue bold strategies that break with currently accepted theories and best practices.)
