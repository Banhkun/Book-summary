## Exercise: Evaluate Possible Responses to Climate Change

Koonin argues that rather than focusing on curbing carbon emissions, we should consider alternative responses to climate change, like geoengineering and adaptation. In this exercise, evaluate these different responses to climate change.

* * *

Do you agree with Koonin that curbing carbon emissions should be secondary to responses like adaptation and geoengineering? Why or why not?

Of the alternative responses Koonin considers (solar radiation management, carbon dioxide removal, adaptation), which do you find most promising? Why do you find this response most promising?

Which of Kooninâ€™s alternative responses do you find least promising? Why are you skeptical of this response?
