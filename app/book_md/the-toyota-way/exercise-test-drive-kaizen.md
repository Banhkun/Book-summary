## Exercise: Test Drive Kaizen

Liker calls one-time _kaizen_ (continuous improvement)__ bursts “spot _kaizen._ ” Try “spot _kaizen_ ” on a process in your life.

* * *

Write down a task that you do often that you’d like to make more efficient. (For example: making a coffee; taking a shower; writing an email; getting ready for work.)

Value map this process. How many stages are there? List (or use paper to draw boxes for) the key stages. Then draw arrows between the stages and indicate how you make the transitions between them. (For example, do you move things from one place to another? Do _you_ move from one place to another? Do you get out or put away particular tools?)

How might you reduce these wastes? Generate as many different ideas as you can.
