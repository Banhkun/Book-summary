## Part III: Sustaining Success | Chapter 9: Plan for Success

Even with the right knowledge and strategies in place, leadership comes with many challenges. In the next four chapters, we’ll explore the hurdles leaders need to navigate and the balance they must keep in order to use their tools and strategies effectively.

* * *

This chapter discusses the importance of planning. It may sound obvious, but a leader has to be able to develop a clear and well-thought-out plan; with a whole team of people following you, you can’t simply wing it. There are several steps to developing an effective plan.

#### The Mission

In order to craft a plan, the leader needs a clear understanding of what the overarching mission or goal is. **The mission must be simple, concise, and explicit, targeting a very specific goal that gets the team or company one step closer to the larger strategic vision.** A mission that is too broad or vague leads to a lack of focus and prevents a team from successfully achieving the goal.

Furthermore, the mission needs to incorporate the larger purpose and goal, so that everyone, from the leader down to the lowest level employees, understands the “why.”

#### The Course of Action

A leader should explore different possible ways to achieve the mission before determining the best course of action. Once decided, the leader needs to flesh out the details of the plan in a way that uses the resources available and takes advantage of various team members’ expertise.

Leaders should involve junior leaders and other employees to give input and help develop the plan. **An employee’s on-the-ground perspective will be different than the big-picture lens of a manager, and both are valuable to bring up different considerations and concerns.** Additionally, involving the whole team gives everyone a sense of ownership of the plan, which makes them more invested in the mission and helps them to better execute it.

During this process, the leader should be supervising the development of the plan and keeping a focus on the bigger picture and mission. Stepping back in this way allows her to see any weaknesses or issues and steer the team to correct them.

#### Minimize Risks

Not all risks can be avoided, and many aggressive and innovative plans will necessarily involve some inevitable risks; as the saying goes, _no risk, no reward_. But **an effective leader balances the necessary risks by planning for risks that she can control.** A well-developed plan should include contingency plans for risks that the team and leader can anticipate. Contingency plans help everyone involved to be prepared and know how to react if something goes wrong, so the plan can continue smoothly.

#### The Briefing

When the plan has been entirely fleshed out and checked over, the leader needs to explain the course of action to everyone involved. This explanation needs to be clear, concise, and simple to avoid any misinterpretations and ensure thorough understanding for everyone involved — down to the most junior team member. The brief doesn’t need to include every exhaustive detail of the plan, only pertinent information that helps the team members execute their roles in the plan.

While briefing the team on the plan, an effective leader encourages discussion and questions from everyone; as we discussed in Chapter 3, Extreme Ownership means a leader is responsible for equipping all members of her team with the information and resources they need to execute a plan. The leader can also use techniques to reinforce understanding, such as pausing at various points during the briefing and asking team members questions about what’s been explained so far.

#### The Debrief

After a team executes a plan, a successful leader makes time for the entire team to meet and debrief. This allows the team to review the whole process — from planning to execution — and discuss what worked well, what didn’t work, and how they can be more effective next time. This **constant self-assessment helps a successful team continue to grow and constantly improve.**

* * *

Standardizing the planning process (including the format and terminology used) across a business creates even more success. A standardized process allows every department as well as supporting assets (e.g. contractors and subsidiary companies) to speak the same language with their plans and save time, since they don’t have to reinvent the wheel for every plan or project. Everyone in the company should be briefed on the standardized planning process, and it needs to be designed to be repeatable and include some sort of guide or checklist to help employees implement it.

### Battle Story: Hope for the Best, Plan for the Worst

Babin is leading a team of SEALs on a mission to rescue the teenage nephew of an Iraqi police colonel, who is being held hostage by a terrorist group connected to al Qaeda. Intelligence reports say that the hostage is in a house in an extremely dangerous, enemy held neighborhood, where the roads are littered with explosives. Babin has to develop a plan that carefully mitigates as much risk as possible while giving his team the greatest chance of success.

Babin plans to lead SEALs, a bomb technician, and Iraqi soldiers into the house to clear it for safety, while Willink will command the assault force, armored vehicles, and aircraft that will provide support for the mission. Babin discusses the plan with Willink as well as a U.S. Army officer who is very familiar with the neighborhood where the hostage is being held. The officer is able to offer some advice to fine-tune the plan.

Babin quickly and thoroughly briefs everyone involved in the operation. **It’s a lot of information in a short amount of time, so he closes the brief with the three most important takeaways** : implement the element of surprise when entering the house, focus on getting in and out as quickly as possible, and be careful not to hurt the hostage or mistake him for a captor.

After the brief, as the team is preparing to start the mission, Babin and Willink get a new intelligence report that there are explosives buried in the front yard of the house and machine guns inside. Despite the new information and the increased risk, Babin and his troops are confident in their plan and know they have mitigated every risk they could anticipate. **The new intelligence doesn’t force Babin to change his plan because his planning is so thorough that he has already prepared for that possibility** ; every operation carries the risk that the enemy could be armed and have explosives ready.

Babin and his team successfully carry out the mission, and ultimately they find no explosives in the yard or machine guns in the house. They credit their success to detailed and thorough planning, with helpful input from the Army officer, and an effective briefing that helped every man fully understand his role and responsibility in the operation.

### Business Application: A Good Plan Empowers Employees

The vice president of emerging markets for a retail business credits much of the company’s success to having experienced, successful employees lead expansion in new areas. Planning is crucial in the company’s expansion, but as the business continues to grow and enter new markets, he recognizes the need to develop a standardized planning process.

**Some members of the VP’s team feel that documenting their planning process and teaching it to other leaders is tedious and unnecessary** ; the company is doing well, so why fix what’s not broken? But the vice president knows the value of taking the time to do this.

To explain the importance of standardized planning Babin shares a story from his time in SEAL officer in training.

* * *

Babin’s training program included a 96-hour planning practice, which gave the SEALs-to-be four days to plan for a combat mission, and the officers in training would create a PowerPoint presentation of more than 70 slides to brief their teams on the operation. Instructors and officers always sat in on the presentations, and would inevitably tear apart virtually every detail of the plan. They seemed to want more PowerPoint slides, more charts — essentially, more production. But it seemed to Babin like too much time and effort was going to creating the slides and taking away from actual planning.

During the final stage of his training, Babin and his platoon had to develop another mission and brief, and it wasn’t going well; the plan was complex and unclear, but it did have lots of PowerPoint slides. With time running out, Willink (Babin’s boss) advised Babin and his team to forget about the PowerPoint and forget about impressing the officers. Instead, he said to focus on making sure the troops understood the mission and their individual tasks.

Willink explained that **briefs need to communicate at the lowest common denominator, to make the plan clear to the most junior people involved.** In theory, everyone should understand the plan well enough that they can execute it without any guidance (though things often come up or circumstances change, which is why the leader must be there to help everyone adapt).

Babin simplified the plan — and the presentation — to focus on the aspects that the troops would need to know to successfully execute it. Babin asked the troops to stand around the map during the brief, to clearly point out where the operation was happening. **Babin stopped periodically to ask questions and make sure everyone was following him, and asked team members to repeat back pieces of the plan to ensure they understood it thoroughly.** At the end of the brief, the officers complimented Babin and his team for having the most clear and understandable brief of any team.

Babin carried this experience into his deployment in Iraq, remembering to keep each plan and brief clear and simple. Additionally, he developed the habit of holding a debrief with his platoon after every operation so the whole team had a chance to analyze how they could be more efficient and effective in future missions. Babin credits this routine for his platoon’s success and constant improvement in one of the most hostile and dangerous areas of U.S. military occupation at the time.

* * *

Hearing that story, the emerging markets VP wants to emulate the SEALs’ example by developing a planning SOP that is replicable across the company. Babin shares a workbook with the VP and his team that outlines military mission planning and to adapt it to the corporate world. The VP uses the workbook to develop a standardized planning process and presents it to his key leaders.

The leaders perform a planning exercise, developing and revising plans using the SOP. The company actually executes one of these plans, and discovers that the contingencies that were built in — per the planning procedure — end up saving the company business and revenue. **As a result of having the planning SOP and ensuring the team thoroughly understands the company’s larger vision, the VP discovers that his employees are able to act and make decisions in the field without wasting time running every question by senior leaders.**

### Checklist: How To Make A Plan

A successful initiative starts with a well-thought-out plan. Follow these steps to develop an effective plan for your team or business.

  * Start with the mission. What is the overarching vision, and the specific goal you’re trying to reach with this plan? Make your mission specific and clear. 
  * Consider the manpower, assets, time, and resources at your disposal. How can you most effectively use the tools at hand? 
  * Get everyone involved in the planning process. Ask key leaders to come up with and assess possible courses of action. 
  * Decide on the best course of action; often, the simplest plan is the best one. Commit to the decision and put your full focus on developing that plan. 
  * Lean on the key leaders on your team to flesh out the plan with specific actions. Task key junior leaders with developing specific aspects of the plan. This leaves you the time and energy to maintain the big-picture view and identify weaknesses or holes in the plan.
  * Think through possible risks and develop contingency plans for each possibility. Manage any risks you can control. 
  * Consider new information and changes in circumstances, constantly reassessing the plan to make sure it’s still the best course of action. 
  * Brief your team on the plan in a clear, simple, and concise way. Be sure to explain how the plan fits into the larger vision so everyone understands the “why.” Create an open floor so everyone involved can discus the plan and ask questions.
  * After the plans’ completion, debrief with your team to take stock of what you can improve in the future.
