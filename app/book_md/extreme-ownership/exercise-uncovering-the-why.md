## Exercise: Uncovering the Why

Sometimes upper management issues a directive that seems to have no logic. This exercise can help you make sense of it (of course, if possible, the fool-proof way to understand it is simply to ask).

* * *

Describe an order or plan your boss recently handed down that you disagreed with or didn’t understand. What part of the plan didn’t make sense to you?

What are the company’s main overarching goals (or what were they at the time)?

Now look at it from your boss’s perspective. How could this strategy possibly have tied into the company’s larger goal(s)?

How would this perspective have impacted how you carried out the plan?
