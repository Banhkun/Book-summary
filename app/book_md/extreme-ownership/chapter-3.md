## Chapter 3: Leaders Must Believe In the “Why”

As a leader, you have to believe in a plan and its goal before you can inspire your team to work toward it. **How can you effectively explain a strategy to your team, let alone expect them to carry it out, unless you understand and believe in the purpose** , or the “why”?

Doubts — or anything less than full confidence and conviction — will be apparent to your team members or employees, and that will undermine their confidence in the plan. Why would they execute something that their leader clearly doesn’t believe in? Additionally, if you don’t believe in the plan or the goal, you won’t do the hard work and take the necessary risks to achieve it. That means **neither you nor your team is on the path to achieving anything unless you first believe in it.**

**If you don’t believe in the plan, adapt it**(if you have the authority to do so) to something you can stand by. If that’s not an option, talk to your boss and reach an understanding about the purpose of the mission and how it fits into the entire organization’s larger goal. It takes Extreme Ownership to ask your boss for clarification on a plan or its why; it shows that you have the humility to admit that you don’t understand, and that you own your responsibility to lead your team in fully and correctly executing the directive.

As you gain a better understanding and carry out the plan, you may find that it benefits your team in ways you didn’t expect. Furthermore, your boss will appreciate that you’re doing all you can to execute her plan, and she may be more inclined to give you and your team additional support.

With a thorough understanding of the goal, **it’s especially important that a leader adequately explain each mission and its “why” to her junior leaders, so that they can do the same with their teams.** Junior leaders need to ask questions when in doubt and raise concerns so that higher-ups understand potential hurdles in the execution. The junior leaders and their teams may have insights that the bosses have overlooked. This ties in with the Decentralized Command, the fourth Law of Combat, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 8.

### Battle Story: Finding the “Why”

Willink gets an order from the higher-ups that his task force unit must train and fight alongside Iraqi Army soldiers, but he feels this directive will put his SEALs at a disadvantage and could put them in danger on the battlefield. The order doesn’t make sense to him, and he doesn’t see how it could be effective.

The SEALs are exceptionally well trained and operate under universal rules and conventions, so they work together smoothly and efficiently. On the other hand, the Iraqi soldiers are poorly trained, ill-equipped and unmotivated; few job prospects mean many join the Iraqi Army as a way to earn money, and are not necessarily driven by a strong belief in the mission.

Knowing that, as a leader, his attitude and conviction in the purpose of each mission sets the tone for his team, Willink conceals his skepticism from his troops. **Willink tries to step back and think about the strategy from his bosses’ perspective: What would cause them to come up with this plan?** He breaks the question down into smaller pieces.

  * What is the generals’ ultimate goal? For the U.S. forces to win. 
  * What does winning mean? They can’t expect surrender or a peace treaty in this situation so success, in this case, means helping Iraq get to a place of relative safety and stability.
  * How can the U.S. troops prepare the Iraqi forces to take care of their country without help from other nations? The Iraqi soldiers need to learn how to maintain relative peace and order in their country. With no time for proper training, they need to learn on the battlefield — because if they never gain the skills to protect their country, the U.S. military will never be able to pull out.



The U.S. troops need to not only help prepare the Iraqi Army to eventually defend themselves as the only force on the ground, but also defeat the insurgency enough to lower its strength and give the Iraqi Army and police a better chance at maintaining power and stability.

Now understanding the “why” of the order, Willink can effectively carry it out and explain it to his troops so that they understand and believe in its purpose. Although his troops are frustrated and wish there was an alternative option, after Willink explains the reasoning they understand the importance. And, ultimately, the Iraqi troops become assets in unexpected ways: Their knowledge of the area and the culture help the troops work more efficiently and better identify enemies.

Once convinced of the importance of including the Iraqi soldiers in their operations, Willink doubles down on the order, insisting that every mission includes the Iraqis. As a result, every operation plan his team submits to the higher-ups for approval gets the green light, and Willink’s task force unit is able to take more action and make a bigger impact in Ramadi. **Because Willink came to understand and strongly believe in the importance of his bosses’ directive, he implemented it so thoroughly and effectively that his team benefitted from the support they got from the higher-ups.**

The SEALs’ and Iraqi forces’ missions increasingly establish some safety and stability in Ramadi as they beat back the insurgents’ power. Seeing these effects, local residents stop passively supporting the insurgents and instead show support of the U.S. and Iraqi troops.

### Business Application: Asking The Boss For An Explanation

The senior leaders in a corporate company recently rolled out a new pay structure for the company’s sales team. The plan cuts pay significantly, especially for low performers.

The mid-level managers are confused and frustrated, saying that the new structure will make it hard to keep salespeople from leaving and working for competing companies. They don’t believe in the plan, and can’t defend it to their salespeople. The middle managers recognize that the company’s senior leadership is experienced and motivated to make strategic decisions that will ultimately bring the company success — they just don’t understand how this plan fits in. And they don’t want to ask for an explanation, for fear of looking stupid in front of their boss.

Meanwhile, the CEO feels that she has a good relationship with all her managers, and that they would undoubtedly bring up any issues with her. Although she is open to questions and concerns, she underestimates the weight of her position in the minds of the managers and employees under her. In other words, the CEO thinks she is approachable and laid-back, but her employees still see her as the big boss, and that carries some intimidation.

The CEO finally learns that her managers don’t understand the plan, and she understands that **if the managers don’t understand or believe in the plan, then the salespeople won’t either, and the CEO’s plan — while very strategic in its logic — is more likely to fail.** The CEO approaches the managers and asks them to share their concerns about the plan. This gives the CEO the opportunity to explain the “why,” that this plan will lower overhead and product prices, weed out low-performing salespeople, and allow successful salespeople to flourish.

The managers finally understand the plan in a way that they can explain to their sales teams. **The managers ultimately acknowledge that, under the guidelines of Extreme Ownership, they were at fault for not asking the CEO to explain the plan sooner**. The CEO had no idea the managers were feeling that way, and could only rectify the situation once it was brought to her attention.
