## Exercise: Working With Another Team

When another department is creating a hurdle for your own team’s success, sometimes the best course of action is to figure out how to help them get their work done so they can do what you need from them.

* * *

Describe a current or recent situation in which another team, department, or division impeded your team’s work.

How could you approach that team’s leader to better understand their workflow and identify ways your team might be able to help them?

How can you give the other team a better sense of your team’s workflow and challenges, so that they might gain a better understanding of how they can help you achieve your goals?

What could you and your team do to help them accomplish their work more efficiently? This could be something that helps them achieve the task you need them to do, or it could help them perform another task that frees them up to do what you need.
