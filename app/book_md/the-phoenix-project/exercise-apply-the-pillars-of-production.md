## Exercise: Apply the Pillars of Production

Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford use a fictional scenario to illustrate three foundational ways of improving the speed and quality of production in the context of IT services. Theoretically, these same production philosophies could apply to any organization, whether itâ€™s producing software, information, physical products, or a customer service experience. Think about your own workplace and how the three Pillars of Production (fast workflow, quick feedback, constant improvement) might apply.

* * *

How does your workplace monitor the flow of projects and the status of tasks, and how might you make it more transparent?

Is there a bottleneck that slows down the flow of work, and if so, how would you suggest it be improved?

How long does it take to receive productive feedback on the quality of your work? How often do you provide feedback to others? How would you improve the cycle of feedback so that problems are identified before they become emergencies?

How does your workplace react when mistakes or systematic errors are discovered? Do your teammates come together to correct them, or do people focus on shifting blame elsewhere? How much does the way mistakes are handled encourage or discourage experimenting with new ideas or procedures?
