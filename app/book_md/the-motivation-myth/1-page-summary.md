## 1-Page Summary

Do you have goals and ambitions that you can never seem to get off the ground? Are you waiting for a spark of motivation to finally get yourself moving? If so, then you’re going about it all wrong. According to Jeff Haden, **motivation comes _after_ achievement, not before.** It’s only once you’ve started down the road to your dreams that you can create the motivation to keep yourself going.

In _The Motivation Myth_ , published in 2018, Haden explains how to build up motivation as a product of success and use it to push you toward even greater achievements. He argues that your lofty goals should only provide a direction for the path you want to take in life and that true motivation comes from learning to take pride in every inch of incremental progress you make. Instead of waiting to bask in the glow of achieving your ambitions in the distant future, you can create the motivation you need for success by celebrating every step along the way.

Haden began his career in the manufacturing industry before becoming a regular columnist for _Inc. Magazine_ , a LinkedIn influencer, and the ghostwriter of numerous best-selling books. He is known for his public speaking on entrepreneurship and personal growth, as well as for being a physical fitness enthusiast, from which he draws on personal experience for his knowledge of how to motivate yourself.

In this guide, we’ll lay out Haden’s recommendations for how to kickstart your path to success. We’ll show how to break down your goals into achievable steps and create a positive, reinforcing cycle that creates motivation as you go along. We’ll discuss how to develop resilience to keep you focused on your goals through times of struggle and how to define success so you’ll know when you’ve achieved it.

We’ll also compare Haden’s suggestions with those of productivity experts and motivational leaders. We’ll expand on some of Haden’s writing with practical tips on time management, avoiding distraction, and maintaining mental focus. We’ll also explore what psychologists and wellness experts have to say about chasing ambitions versus finding contentment in your everyday life.

### Preparation

The first step toward reaching your goals isn’t finding motivation. To begin, you must first **design a program that will help you build the momentum** you’ll need to accomplish your objectives. In this section, we’ll cover Haden’s advice about finding a professional example on which to model your program for success and creating a routine that will kickstart you into action.

The hardest part of following a course of action is starting in the first place. Haden says that once you get over that initial hump, it’s much easier to keep moving toward your goal. What’s holding you back isn’t a lack of motivation, but rather a lack of _preparation_. Preparation gives you enough confidence to help you cross your first hurdles, after which, _incremental success_ will slowly grow your motivation to keep going.

(Shortform note: In _Switch_ , Chip and Dan Heath suggest that the difficulty you feel when starting toward a goal is caused by the friction between your rational and your emotional mind. Your emotional self responds most strongly to instant gratification, and the seemingly endless wait for the rewards of long-term goals can feel daunting to the point of distraction. The Heath brothers suggest designing your process to provide your emotional side with some form of gratification as quickly as possible, which is also what Haden goes on to recommend.)

When starting out, **don’t focus on the end goal,** whether that’s earning a college degree, winning a swimming competition, or writing a best-selling novel. Instead, try to imagine how good it will feel once you’ve got the ball rolling. Keep your mind on the next step toward your goal and the feeling of accomplishment your next small win will bring.

(Shortform note: When following Haden’s advice, don’t be discouraged by how small the individual steps might be. One striking example is the stroke recovery process Jill Bolte Taylor describes in _My Stroke of Insight_. After having a stroke and losing many of her cognitive functions, even a goal such as getting out of bed was a mighty achievement to be broken down in steps. Taylor writes that celebrating every microscopic victory was crucial to regaining her autonomy, just as Haden suggests when tackling what you perceive as larger goals.)

You should be careful, though, not to celebrate too soon. Haden writes that this usually happens when you let others know what you hope to achieve. With the intention of being supportive, they’ll often congratulate you in advance, which will simulate the feeling that you’ve already reached your goal. But the feeling that you’ve won the race before it’s started is nothing but an illusion, and people who experience it are less likely to follow through on the work needed to achieve real success. **Instead of telling your friends what you wish to accomplish, talk about the steps you’ll take to get there.** To do that, you’ll need to know what those steps are.

(Shortform note: Haden’s claim that talking about your goals is counterproductive comes from a psychological study published in 2009. However, more recent research shows that sharing your goals with others _can_ create motivation through accountability, so long as the person you share with is someone you perceive to be more successful than you are. For example, talking about your ambitions to a supervisor, professor, or mentor creates what psychologists call “evaluation apprehension,” the feeling that you’re going to be judged on your progress if you don’t live up to your stated goals.)

#### Find a Teacher

To design your path to success, Haden suggests finding a high-achieving professional to emulate. Study how they achieved what you’re after, and determine the steps they took along the way. Haden stresses the difference between a professional and a coach, gives clues as to how to emulate their path to accomplishment, and suggests ways to place yourself in the right surroundings to gain access to a variety of professionals to learn from.

Haden recommends using a professional, not a coach, as a model because, unlike a coach, a professional won’t cheer you on or cut you any slack. **A professional who isn’t a mentor by trade will simply explain what it takes to succeed and expect you to do it.** The trick is to channel their experience and techniques. Once you’ve identified a person to emulate, you don’t even have to meet them in real life—just pick someone whose path you want to mirror, and do what they did without taking shortcuts. It’s not actually the person themself that you need but the program for success that they used.

(Shortform note: Though Haden debates the relative merits of coaches versus professionals as role models, there are other types of relationships you can use to advance you toward your goals—namely, mentors and sponsors. A **mentor** is distinct from a coach in that your relationship with them isn’t transactional. It’s a coach’s _job_ to help you develop skills and motivation, whereas a mentor helps guide you as a way to “pay it forward” and invest in the future of their field or community. A **sponsor** , on the other hand, is someone who helps you advance toward your goal not by developing your skills but by boosting your visibility and reputation, which can be essential in fields where networking is of paramount importance.)

Haden says to start by picking one thing your professional exemplar does that would point you toward your goal, then do it even if it seems to go against your normal behavior. If they’re a novelist, perhaps they wake up hours before you do to write while everyone else is asleep. If they’re a top-ranked public speaker, maybe they do vocal warmups every morning as part of their exercise routine. Whatever activity you select will stretch you in ways you aren’t accustomed to and will grow your skills in ways you might not have expected.

(Shortform note: If you follow Haden’s advice and seek out a career mentor, it may be wise to look beyond their success to other facets of their lives. Psychologists suggest that it’s important for your role models to reflect your values in addition to the achievements you’d like to emulate. That way, their example can guide you through the emotional ups and downs of your journey and not just the path to success. Beyond demonstrating how to achieve your goals, a good role model can show how to do so with integrity and professionalism.)

##### Meet Your Teacher in Person

It may be that you find it difficult to emulate an example from a distance. On the other hand, it wouldn’t be productive to stalk the person you want to emulate and badger them for suggestions. Instead, Haden suggests joining a group such as a club of experienced hobbyists or a professional organization. Being in such an atmosphere will put you in touch with many people whose personal experiences you can draw from. When joining a group, though, it’s important not to make a nuisance of yourself and drive away the people you’d like to learn from. Instead, you must diligently take steps to transition from an outsider to an insider. You can do this by:

  1. Showing up
  2. Being humble
  3. Volunteering for tasks
  4. Helping other newcomers fit in



> **Be a Conscientious Joiner**
> 
> Before following Haden’s advice and joining a club or organization, you should evaluate whether the group is a good fit for you. You can do this by talking to some of its members to gain a feel for the organization’s culture. If possible, go to some meetings before joining fully as a member. You should also weigh the cost of group membership, not just in terms of money but also in time and energy commitment, and whether your personal return on investment will match how much you put in.
> 
> Ideally, whatever organization you join will have an onboarding process for new members that will make it easier for you to take the steps Haden suggests. This might include having an orientation period to encourage attendance and help you find a place, letting you judge how your skills and values fit in with the rest of the group, providing training on how you can be of service, and charting a path to form relationships between you, older members, and fellow newcomers.

Once you’ve made yourself part of a community full of people working toward the same goal as yours, you’ll not only have access to professionals to learn from, but you’ll also have found an invaluable network of support who can also help motivate you along your way.

(Shortform note: To maximize the benefits that Haden says you’ll receive from being part of a like-minded community, it’s as important to give as much value as you gain. In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield lists several steps to productively add value to your growing personal network, such as sharing your work and skills with others and demonstrating your reliability to the group. Just as individual practice creates a personal feedback cycle, active membership in an organization creates a mutually beneficial cycle that helps everyone in it achieve their personal goals.)

#### Build Your Program

Haden says the true purpose of designing a program is so that you can stop worrying about your goals at all. Instead, a good program will let you laser-focus on your next step and nothing else. Here, we’ll discuss how to choose a program to follow and how establishing a routine eliminates the need for willpower. We’ll also cover tips for how to maintain your focus.

Thankfully, when plotting your course, you don’t have to reinvent the wheel or rediscover fire. Chances are that whatever you aspire to, whether it’s to paint professional-level murals or to kayak down Class V rapids, someone else has already achieved it and mapped out a program to get there. You merely have to do your research and choose from the many different programs available. Haden suggests that you shouldn’t waste time fretting over which program is the most ideal for you because you have no way of knowing until you’ve started. **The advantage of any good program toward success is that it lays out every step you need to take,** saving you the time and effort of figuring it out for yourself.

(Shortform note: This may be the easiest step in Haden’s program by far. Over the last few decades, an entire industry has sprung up around providing step-by-step instructions to people with minimal knowledge of any subject. The popular _For Dummies_ and _Idiot’s Guides_ series began in the early 1990s and now boast editions on thousands of subjects. Free online courses can be found on a variety of topics, including business, technology, and language learning. Further learning resources can be found through continuing education courses at colleges and universities, as well as by visiting your local public library.)

The next vital component is to turn your program into a routine. By making your efforts toward your goal automatic, _a routine negates the need for motivation_. Without a routine, every day and moment means you must consciously choose whether to follow your program or do something else, such as binge-watch TV or play games on your phone. Having to make that choice depletes your will and makes it more likely that you won’t follow through. However, if you establish a routine that keeps you on your program, you’ll no longer have to decide what to do. **Followed long enough, a routine makes the steps toward your goal a part of your identity** —it’s not just what you do, it’s who you are.

(Shortform note: Haden’s words on the power of routine echo those of Greg McKeown, author of _Essentialism_. However, McKeown warns that a poorly designed routine can lead to boredom and stifle the creative energy you’re trying to free up. Setting up a beneficial routine involves changing your daily habits so that the cues that trigger unproductive behavior—such as snacking or surfing the internet—instead become associated with productive activities, such as brainstorming ideas for the next step to your goal.)

Establishing a routine is easier said than done. Haden offers several tips to make it less of an uphill battle:

  * Redesign your workspace to eliminate distractions (such as putting away your phone and closing your door so you won’t be interrupted).
  * Place reminders of your overall goal, such as sticky notes and photos, in places where they’ll interrupt temptations (such as on your refrigerator or in front of your TV).
  * Keep healthy snacks easily available (such as fruits, vegetables, or nuts) to keep your energy levels from flagging.
  * At the end of each day, plan out the next one, so you won’t have to spend that energy in the morning. Use that start-of-day energy instead to tackle your hardest task first.



> **Different Approaches**
> 
> As with any list of productivity tips and suggestions, the literature is full of elaborations and counter-examples. For instance, in _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cardone says that instead of leaving yourself reminders of your goals, you should write them down at least twice a day as part of your routine. In _Make Time_ , Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky argue that to avoid distractions, it isn’t enough just to put away your phone—you should delete all social media apps, games, and even your email from it. Knapp and Zeratsky also give more detail on how to strategically use food to fuel your program, pointing out that unprocessed snacks give a longer energy boost than treats full of sugar and caffeine.
> 
> Whereas Haden emphasizes starting each day with the hardest task before you, many other productivity experts make the distinction that you should start with the most _important_ task. In _First Things First_ , Stephen R. Covey presents a method to evaluate your to-do list based on whether tasks are urgent or important, stressing that you should begin with action items that are both while completely ignoring any tasks that are neither. In _Eat That Frog!_ , Brian Tracy prioritizes tasks based on the rule that 20% of your actions produce 80% of your results, and he states that focusing on small, easy action items to “get them out of the way” is a never-ending battle and a waste of your time.

### Repetition

Since motivation isn’t what starts you down the road to success, what role does it actually play? According to Haden, **motivation is momentum** that keeps your program of improvement moving forward through a repeating, self-energizing cycle. In this section, we’ll talk about how that cycle works, how repetition reduces luck as a factor in your success, and how it provides you with steady, regular feedback that you can use to adjust your program going forward.

The path to achievement is a slow and steady process that requires putting your nose to the grindstone and doing the work, day after day. That’s disheartening if you’re focused on your goal, such as getting a million YouTube subscribers or growing the prettiest garden on your street, because especially in the early days, your goal will seem a million miles away. Instead, you should focus on individual steps, celebrating each bit of incremental progress. Haden writes that **every small victory triggers a response in your brain’s reward center that sets up a positive feedback loop** , which will push you to take the next step, and the next. There’s the motivation you’ve been lacking—not at the start of the process, but in the middle.

(Shortform note: Haden’s advice works because your brain’s reward system is triggered by positive progress, but what if your goal requires _not_ taking an action, such as avoiding snacks to lose weight? In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear addresses this problem by stating that if your goals require a program of _avoidance_ , you have to create an associated reward for when you successfully fight the urge to crack open a bag of potato chips, for example. Clear writes that whatever reward you give yourself must be associated with the goal you’re trying to reach. In the snacking example, your reward might be a healthy, five-minute walk around the block.)

And now a word of caution: Hard work and repetition don’t guarantee success, but they do improve your probability of success. More than that, Haden explains that if you stick with your program long enough, you’ll be able to calculate the odds of your efforts paying off in a way that will tell you how much work you have left to do. For example, if you’ve been job-hunting for some time, you may find that one in every ten applications results in a call-back from a potential employer. Therefore, if you’d like a call-back every day, that tells you how many jobs to apply for. Random chance is still a factor, but **if you act as if your success is completely under your control, you can minimize your reliance on luck** just through simple mathematics.

(Shortform note: One way to put yourself in the mindset Haden advises is to model your thoughts and behavior as if you’ve already achieved your goal. In _The Success Principles_ , Jack Canfield suggests you imagine how your life will be different once you achieve your ambitions. Perhaps you’d be more self-confident and comfortable with taking risks. Canfield argues that envisioning or even role-playing your future success can influence your behavior in ways that can bring your goals to fruition. Though this goes against Haden’s cautionary advice not to celebrate your end goal too soon, Canfield presents anecdotal evidence of people who shaped their future success by acting as if they’d achieved it in the present.)

#### The Feedback Cycle

Repetition is also important for providing you with quick and accurate feedback. For one thing, you’ll certainly make mistakes, each of which is a learning experience. The more you repeatedly push toward your goal, the more mistakes you’ll make and the more you’ll improve. Of course, this requires keeping the proper attitude—**view mistakes as training, not a sign of failure.** They’ll also teach you how to adjust your efforts. Perhaps you set your daily goals too high or too low and your program needs refinement. Just make sure to evaluate your progress and setbacks in relation to your daily objectives and not your end goal, which may still be months or years away.

(Shortform note: If anything, Haden understates the value of making mistakes on the way to your goal. In _Limitless Mind_ , educator Jo Boaler explains that making and correcting errors is a vital part of the process of cognitive growth. Neurological research has shown that students who struggle to master a skill engage and build more neural connections than students for whom the skill comes naturally. As a result, people who make mistakes and struggle through the learning process create stronger and longer-lasting neural pathways in their brains than those who don’t, and they end up outperforming the “quick learners” in the long run.)

You should also be mindful that whatever program you devise won’t be perfect, and the feedback you get from your mistakes will tell you how. For example, you might try to work out every morning before discovering that certain muscle groups need more recovery time between sessions. Nevertheless, Haden advises not to make changes to your program too soon. Instead, wait until the program you’ve devised has the chance to provide you with actual feedback as to whether your efforts are producing results. If not, then feel free to try a new approach. There are always different paths to achieving your target.

(Shortform note: In _Ultralearning_ , Scott Young gives more information than Haden about how to differentiate good feedback from bad. Some forms of feedback are like grades on a report card—they tell you how well or poorly you performed without providing guidance on how to improve. Corrective feedback—such as a colleague’s review of your grant proposal—includes both information on where you stand as well as directions for growth. Young lists pitfalls to avoid, such as overreacting to feedback, not applying it properly, or giving too much weight to feedback that pumps up your ego.)

Over time, as you move toward your goal, you’ll inevitably reach a point where it feels as if your progress is slowing, and it may seem like you’ve hit your limit. However, Haden insists that this feeling of diminishing returns is an illusion created by comparing yourself to your past self. This may seem counterintuitive, but it’s just math—if your goal is to do five more pushups every time you work out, then the _percentage increase_ in your number of pushups will steadily diminish even if your actual rate of progress never slows.

This is another reason why having a professional example to strive toward comes in handy: If you compare yourself to your professional exemplar, you’ll see what is actually possible to achieve and not merely the distance you’ve covered to date. Such comparisons can be useful to recalibrate your inner limitations.

> **The Downside of Comparison**
> 
> Not everyone agrees with Haden’s advice about comparison. In _The Gap and the Gain_ , Benjamin Hardy and Dan Sullivan define “gap-thinking” as self-comparison against your ideal, whereas “gain-thinking” is when you compare your progress against your previous self. Unlike Haden, Harden and Sullivan argue that forward-looking gap comparisons are unhealthy because the ideal you compare yourself to will always leave you wanting just a little bit more. Backward-looking gain comparisons, however, are based on concrete measurements and thus provide an objective assessment unclouded by emotional thinking.
> 
> Many wellness experts, however, argue that you should eschew comparison altogether. In _The Paradox of Choice_ , Barry Schwartz says that comparing your experiences and choices to those of others can lead to poor decision-making and overall unhappiness. Likewise, in _The Gifts of Imperfection_ , Brené Brown says that comparing yourself to others is emotionally damaging and prevents you from being your full, authentic self.

### Resilience

Even with the motivation cycle that comes from repetition and incremental improvement, that by itself may not be enough to keep you going. Therefore, it’s important to develop resilience, which Haden defines as **the ability to persevere through difficulties and disappointments**. Such resilience doesn’t come from being stronger, smarter, or more energetic but from learning to make the most effective use of the abilities you already have. Haden gives two specific suggestions for efficiently using your time and energy, which we’ll cover in a moment:

  1. Conserve your resources by saying no to things that distract from your goal.
  2. Dedicate an entire day to focusing your efforts on one specific task.



In general, though, resilience (like motivation) is a mental construct that arises from making a deliberate choice to ignore distractions and focus on your goal.

(Shortform note: In addition to helping you overcome hard times and disappointments, resilience is also necessary to overcome a third productivity killer—boredom. In _Atomic Habits_ , James Clear warns that boredom is a natural side effect of skill-building repetition, a cycle in which the activities that once excited and challenged you eventually become routine. Once this happens, boredom can test your resilience just as much as fatigue, so you should keep ramping up the difficulty level of your program so that whatever skill you’re practicing remains slightly beyond your current abilities. For instance, if you’re working out with weights, gradually increase your number of reps or the amount of weight that you’re lifting so it can remain a challenge.)

#### The Power of No

Saying no to yourself is hard, and saying no to other people and external commitments can sometimes be even harder. To stay resiliently focused on the tasks and goals that matter most, evaluate anything that diverts your time and energy by whether it serves your primary goal. This includes your habitual distractions, work obligations, and even opportunities that may look appealing but are wasteful in the long run.

One tool that Haden provides to strengthen your resilience against losing focus is to **reframe “I can’t” statements as “I don’t.”** For example, if you’re spending an afternoon making calls to build your client base (toward your goal of being a freelance public speaker) and you’re frequently tempted to quit this task early, don’t tell yourself “I can’t stop until I’ve made my daily quota.” Say instead, “I don’t stop until I’ve made my daily quota.” The word “can’t” opens the door to resentment—as if the stated task was imposed from outside—while leaving room to negotiate with yourself. Rephrasing as “I don’t” makes completing the task _a part of who you are_ and has been shown to bolster resilience and motivation.

(Shortform note: Tapping into your sense of identity is a powerful way to enact change, but it can be more complex than simply changing “I can’t” to “I don’t.” In _Switch_ , Chip and Dan Heath point out that identity can serve as a barrier to change if you have a “fixed mindset”—the belief that your identity is hard-wired in your brain and therefore immutable. To leverage your identity as a tool for change, you’ll have to adopt a “growth mindset”—the belief that change is possible through consistent effort. Thankfully, you can develop a growth mindset by pushing through challenges and setbacks while accepting them as part of the process toward your goal.)

Setting up boundaries at work is also vital. Odds are that you spend a great deal of time not focusing on the tasks that you’re best at or pushing yourself forward to your goal. If you’re already a high achiever, this is likely because you’ve said “yes” too often and have taught your colleagues that you’re always available. Haden suggests dialing back on this habit so that the people you work with won’t use you as a crutch. **Don’t be afraid to deflect and delegate jobs that don’t support your main goals.** Setting boundaries isn’t dismissive—to the contrary, it can foster productive relationships and help your colleagues to be more self-reliant.

(Shortform note: It can be hard to set boundaries as Haden suggests because telling someone no feels like a flat-out rejection that might be reciprocated in kind. However, it needn’t be that way. In _Never Split the Difference_ , Chris Voss and Tahl Raz argue that “no” is merely the first step in a process of negotiation resulting in more personal autonomy. The word “no” can change a conversation from “please interrupt your work and do something for me” to a solution-based discussion to determine what best supports the goals of both parties.)

This also involves saying no to things that may seem like opportunities at first glance, such as a request to mentor someone, plan a party, or accept additional work responsibilities. Haden argues that you should look at each offer and ask if it will help you on your way to your goal and if it will do so better than the plan you’re following now. If the answer is no, then as much as it pains you in the short term, turning down an opportunity can be a choice that saves energy and time.

(Shortform note: In _Essentialism_ , Greg McKeown goes into more detail than Haden about setting criteria for when to say no. For unexpected opportunities that arise, McKeown suggests a way to give them serious thought: List three minimum criteria the opportunity would have to meet to serve your goal. If it doesn’t meet all three of those criteria, reject it. If it passes, think of _three more critical criteria_ it would have to fulfill for you to take it on. McKeown suggests that to be worth your time, an unexpected opportunity would have to meet two out of your three additional criteria. Otherwise, it’s not your best use of time and energy.)

#### Productivity Marathon

Another way to make the most of your resilience is to **occasionally concentrate your efforts in a day-long session** to complete a major task toward your goal. A work marathon (or, in Haden’s words, an “extreme productivity day”) can knock a major step off your to-do list, motivating you to keep moving toward your goal while reducing the need for resilience by completely shutting out distractions. Haden lists steps for setting up a marathon session, how to stay energized and focused, and how to apply similar principles to an entire week or more.

(Shortform note: Though Haden discusses productivity marathons as solitary ventures, they don’t have to be. In _Sprint_ , Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, and Braden Kowitz explain how to implement a productivity marathon for an entire team. The steps involved in setting up a group productivity sprint are very similar to those described by Haden below, although they need to be formalized and documented when applied in a business setting.)

First, it’s vital to let people know you’re going to be unavailable. **Schedule your concentration time as you would a vacation and dedicate yourself to working those hours.** Also, make sure to book a _long_ stretch of time. Haden says that spending long hours on a task is paradoxically easier since it frees you from having to monitor your schedule. He also suggests not beginning your marathon at the same time you’d normally start work. This session is meant to be a break from your habits, and one way to make sure that happens is to break from your routine. Also, by accomplishing more in a day than you normally would over several, a marathon recalibrates your expectations of how hard or how much you can accomplish at once.

(Shortform note: The sort of concentration Haden describes is what Cal Newport discusses in his book _Deep Work_. Newport defines deep work as focused, uninterrupted, undistracted work on a task that pushes your cognitive abilities to their limit. While deep work is hard to carry out, it’s also much more fulfilling than the shallow tasks that normally fill your day. Whereas Haden focuses on secluding yourself as the best way to carry out deep work, Newport offers several alternatives, such as making it a regular part of your schedule or squeezing it in whenever the opportunity presents itself.)

While embarking on your productivity marathon, you balance taking care of your mental and physical energy needs with not letting yourself drift too far off task. Haden suggests eating snacks before you're hungry and getting up to stretch your muscles before you start to feel tired. By the time your body sends you those signals, its reserves are already flagging.

(Shortform note: To maintain productivity, momentum, and motivation, self-care must be more than just an afterthought. In _Make Time_ , Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky describe it as one of the essential pillars of time management, especially in a modern, sedentary workplace for which the human body isn’t designed. In addition to Haden’s suggestions to eat right and periodically stretch, Knapp and Zeratsky recommend methods to use caffeine strategically as well as ways to rest that maximize your energy.)

However, Haden also says to delay taking breaks (to reward your progress) longer than you normally would and to stop work in the middle of a task so that you know exactly where to pick up when you start going again.

(Shortform note: Haden’s advice to take your breaks in the middle of a task is a recommendation often given to writers—that you should stop in the middle of a chapter, or even a sentence—to make it easier to get back into the flow. The idea may have originated with Ernest Hemingway, who always quit work at a point when he knew what had to happen next in his stories. The idea has gained wider popularity as a tool to help reduce procrastination.)

##### Long-Term Productivity

Once you’ve felt the success of blocking off a day to accomplish one major step toward your goal, you can make use of similar tactics to optimize your motivation and resilience throughout the week. Begin by mapping out your weekly schedule, setting aside times for each task while being realistic about how long they’ll take. Don’t try to multitask, but make room to focus on one individual step at a time. Blocking out a whole week as you did for one day can help you identify where your slack times are and help you find more productive ways to use them.

(Shortform note: Haden skips a step in blocking out time, which is to build in protective buffers to keep tasks from conflicting. In _Essentialism_ , McKeown describes buffers as a way to protect your mental space. A time buffer keeps travel delays from throwing you off schedule. Building time for questions into a presentation prevents you from speeding through important points you’d like to make. “Planning buffers” such as packing lists for trips reduce the risk you’ll forget something important, wasting precious mental and emotional energy as well as the extra time you’d need to readjust your plans.)

Nevertheless, you can’t stay busy 24/7. When mapping out a productive week, be sure to schedule time to turn your productivity off. Spend time with your family, go hiking in the woods, or have fun at the movies. Haden affirms that you should **respect your leisure and family time** so that it doesn’t get eaten away in your quest to pursue your overarching goal. It’s great to excel, but you must also live your life.

(Shortform note: In _168 Hours_ , Laura Vanderkam goes into more detail about how to block out and balance a productive week that maximizes time for your work and private life. To do so, she suggests recording your typical week in detail to better understand how you’re spending time already. Once you’ve done that, you can plan your time at work to focus on tasks that play to your strengths. At home, she recommends scheduling more time to spend with your loved ones and delegating time-consuming housework and chores if it’s cost-effective to do so.)

### Success

Suppose you’ve done everything that Haden's recommended. You’ve created a program for success and followed it, celebrated every improvement you’ve made, and learned to endure all the bumps and roadblocks. How do you know when you’ve finally “made it,” and what do you do next if you find the success you’ve been after?

Defining what success means for you is crucial to living a balanced, healthy life. Haden offers guidelines on how to realistically measure success, why you should aim for it in multiple parts of your life, and why personal goals should be just as important, if not more important, than professional ones.

He begins by pointing out that **any goal you pursue comes with a cost**. Chasing professional goals will often mean neglecting the rest of your life while devoting yourself to personal goals will usually mean not making the most of your career. Therefore, Haden says it’s unrealistic to believe that you can maximize both. Instead, you need to be honest with yourself about how you define “good enough.” If you wish to be among the top 1% in any field, whether that’s sales, photography, or weightlifting, it will take a lifetime of single-minded dedication. However, being counted in the top 10% is eminently rewarding and much more achievable.

> **What Does “Success” Really Mean?**
> 
> Despite all the literature on how to achieve success in life, a true definition of personal success is elusive. In general, authors agree with Haden that individual definitions of success will vary, and instead, they focus on the characteristics of success. In _The Success Principles_ , Canfield links personal success to identifying and following your purpose in life. In _The 10X Rule_ , Grant Cardone explains that success isn’t something with a limited supply, but instead, it’s something you can work for and achieve again and again.
> 
> Philosophers and wellness experts take a different view. In _Happy_ , Derren Brown argues that chasing after achievements will keep you trapped on a neverending treadmill of desire, brief rewards, and disappointment. In _The Happiness Advantage_ , Shawn Achor also denies that success leads to happiness but says that instead, the reverse is true—finding happiness is what leads you to success. In _The Book of Joy_ , the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Desmond Tutu discount any connection between striving for accomplishments and finding joy in life, instead arguing that looking for external sources of fulfillment is inherently detrimental.
> 
> On the spectrum between these differing opinions as to what degree success leads to personal fulfillment, Haden’s approach to qualifying success may be seen as more measured than the extremes on either end.

With that in mind, Haden lays out the following rules:

**1\. Before setting out on an ambitious project, make sure that you’re mentally, physically, and financially sound.** If you can’t meet your basic human needs of food, shelter, community, and relationships, then that’s what you have to take care of first.

**2\. When you set a long-term goal, choose one that fulfills you in more than one aspect of your life.** It’s easy to give up on goals that only serve one facet of yourself, such as your job or your health. A goal that brings together more than one ambition—such as becoming a freelance writer to further your career and your creative drive—will be more closely tied to your identity and less likely to get dropped by the wayside.

**3\. Define your goal in a way that’s quantifiable.** Your ambition can start as a nebulous dream, but as you set your course it should grow more concrete. Quantifiable goals let you know if you’ve achieved them—you’ll know for certain when you’ve finished hiking the Appalachian Trail, just as you’ll know you’ve scored an acting role in the latest television sitcom. Solid goals are based on more than just a feeling.

> **Goals to a Balanced Life**
> 
> The path to fulfillment that Haden describes is a relatively recent human invention. In _The One Thing_ , Gary Keller recounts that for most of human history, your work was your life, and all your daily activities were governed by the struggle to meet your basic needs. Once technology started freeing people from the endless daily drudgery of living, people started to seek the perfect balance between work, family, leisure, and achievement. In _Lean In_ , Sheryl Sandberg argues that some degree of balance is possible, but realistically it’ll never be perfect and will require making compromises in various aspects of your life.
> 
> In _Designing Your Life_ , Bill Burnett and Dave Evans offer a practical approach to getting your life in order before moving on to greater ambitions. The first step is a self-assessment to determine where you stand in terms of physical and mental health, your career, and overall happiness. Once you’ve done that, you can identify what areas need improvement and set goals to bring your life into alignment.
> 
> Finally, in _First Things First_ , Stephen R. Covey makes the point that achieving a goal you’ve worked long and hard for can actually be painful—if it was the wrong goal all along. According to Covey, it’s not enough that long-term goals be measurable and touch on various aspects of your life, as Haden suggests. They should also tap into the deeply human traits of creativity, willpower, and morality, as well as the self-awareness to change your ambitions if life and circumstances demand it.

#### Your Goal Isn’t the End

Haden makes clear that any goal you set for yourself isn’t going to consume the rest of your life. Because of that, **you should expect to have multiple goals—just not all at once.** Instead, once you’ve achieved success as you define it in relation to one specific objective, you should set your sights on the next one, and the next. Think about musicians who branch into acting, actors who become directors, and directors who write books. Consider athletes who open up restaurant chains, or restaurateurs who become travel writers. These are only the most well-known examples, but if you truly wish to have a well-rounded life, you should be open to following your dreams in however many directions they take you.

(Shortform note: Haden is basically arguing in favor of becoming a _polymath—someone who’s well-versed in many skills and fields of knowledge_. The most famous example of a polymath was Leonardo da Vinci, who was skilled as a scientist, an engineer, and an artist. As opposed to specialists with narrow expertise, people with skills in a variety of areas can combine them in innovative ways peculiar to their own unique sets of knowledge. Adaptability, flexibility, and having a wide range of interests are going to become more and more valuable, both for the workforce and for mental health, as people live longer lives in the future.)

Most of all, when you begin a cycle of improvement, repetition, and self-motivation, you need to be sure that the goal you’ve picked is something you’ll enjoy. Also, your goals don’t have to be aspirations that send your life in a whole new direction—they might simply be new skills to add to what you already do. Haden suggests that **the most fulfilling goals are things you’ll regret if you don’t ever try.** More likely than not, those goals won’t have anything to do with your profession, but they’ll be no less rewarding for having been followed.

However, nothing’s ever as rewarding as a dream. So define what you want, build a program to achieve it, create a positive cycle of reinforcement, persevere through the hard times, and enjoy every win along the way.

(Shortform note: By arguing that you should pursue success in multiple fields that you’re passionate about, Haden implies that happiness and fulfillment should be your objectives, and not just success for its own sake. But is happiness something you can achieve by design? In _The Happiness Project_ , Gretchen Rubin says it is. She set herself the year-long goal of improving her life in several key areas, including work, relationships, parenting, and play. At the end of her experiment, she concluded that happiness is a goal you can work for, agreeing with Haden that it’s the work that counts and that you don’t need to wait around for motivation.)
