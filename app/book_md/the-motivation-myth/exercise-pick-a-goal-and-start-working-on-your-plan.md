## Exercise: Pick a Goal and Start Working On Your Plan

Haden’s central argument is that instead of waiting for a “spark of motivation” to get you started on the road to your ambitions, you _generate_ motivation by creating a plan, breaking it down into achievable steps, celebrating every win, and persevering through disappointments. Consider how you might put this into practice.

* * *

What’s something you’ve dreamed of doing but have never done? Write down the general steps you can think of to get you started down the path. If you’re not sure, where could you turn to for more information on the subject?

Now forget about the overarching goal and focus on the individual steps themselves. How would you measure incremental progress? How would you reward yourself for every small gain toward your goal?

What difficulties do you expect you might encounter? Are any of them truly insurmountable, or could you push through them with hard work and effort? What’s keeping you from starting right now?
