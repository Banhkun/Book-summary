## Exercise: Get Involved

Gates explains that the best way for individuals to help curb carbon emissions is to get involved politically. While voting during national elections is critical, Gates also encourages readers to be active in local politics. This involvement can start with identifying a climate-related issue that resonates with you.

* * *

Which climate-related issue discussed by Gates resonates most with you? (For example, the environmental impact of an animal product-intensive diet, carbon emissions from passenger vehicles, sea level rise, the increasing frequency of droughts, and so on.) How does this issue impact your life/your community?

What can you do to address this issue in your own life? (For example, participating in Meatless Monday, or considering an electric vehicle purchase or public transportation.)

If applicable, what can you do to address this issue in your community? (For example, by purchasing CSA shares from a local farm or joining a local climate-oriented group).

According to Gates, getting involved in local politics is one of the most effective ways to fight climate change because you have more opportunities to make a difference. Would you consider getting involved in politics in your community? Why or why not?
