## Exercise: Give Awesome Feedback

Revisit a recent time you gave feedback to someone, and improve your approach.

* * *

Think about a recent time you gave feedback that didn’t get the results you wanted. What was it about? How did you present it? How did the other person respond?

Try to start your approach by pointing out the problem in a new way. (Remember: start with praise; point out problems indirectly; point out your own mistakes; preserve the person’s pride.) What would you say?

Now that the problem is understood, present the solution in a new way. (Remember: ask questions instead of giving orders; create a reputation to live up to; make the improvement seem easy; appeal to the person’s interests.) What would you say?

People thrive on positive feedback and praise for improvements. How could you give praise to someone for their improvements right now?
