## Shortform Introduction

For each chapter, we’ll follow a standard format:

  * Principles: The main ideas
  * Tactics: How to implement the principles
  * Examples: Concrete examples to show the principles and tactics in action



If you’re reading this book, you probably want to change your behavior. But changing your behavior is hard. Despite reading these principles, when you’re in the thick of an argument, it’s easy to totally forget that you’re supposed to see the other person’s viewpoint.

Here’s advice from the author Dale Carnegie on how to get the most out of the ideas in this book, and really change your behavior permanently:

  * The principles are best applied with **sincerity**. Be _genuinely interested_ in other people and believe they have something to teach you. Be _genuinely interested_ in helping others achieve their interests. Without this sincerity, you will feel disingenuous to others.
  * Keep remembering how important these principles are to you. “My success depends on how I interact with people.”
  * Changing your behavior is hard. You have to review your notes and keep practicing these principles over and over until it becomes second nature.
  * Like a swear jar, have other people monitor you and require you to pay up whenever you violate a principle.
  * Reflect on your worst personal interactions and think about what you could have done better.
