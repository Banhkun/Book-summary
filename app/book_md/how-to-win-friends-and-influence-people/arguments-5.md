## Arguments 5: Let the Other Person Talk

### Principles

  * **Someone who disagrees with you will not pay attention to you while they are crying for their own expression.** So encourage them to express their ideas fully.
    * (Shortform note: If you’ve had an argument where each person seemed to be repeating the same points over and over, it might be because she didn’t feel acknowledged.)
  * **Resist the temptation to interrupt the person.** This is costly every time you do it. The more you let the other person talk, the more receptive they’ll be to what you have to say.
  * For many, conversation is a way of organizing their thoughts. While a person may disagree with you at first, when reasoning through it herself, she may arrive at your conclusion independently.
    * People don’t want to be told what to believe. But if they work through their own logic to arrive at the same conclusion, they may ultimately agree with you.
  * This is especially important for people to whom you feel tempted to lecture unilaterally: your subordinates at work, your children, your students, even your parents.



### Tactics

  * Ask someone to tell their story, completely.
  * Make the other person feel like the expert. “You know your life/car/child far more than I do. You are the world’s expert on this. So I want to hear you out.”
  * Volunteer your solution’s weaknesses, then ask how the other person feels about it. They will usually react in the other direction, downplaying the weaknesses.
    * (Shortform examples - when recruiting an employee:
      * Approach 1: “You’re required to move across the country. Everyone does it, and it turns out not to be a big deal.” “But my kids go to a great school, they have friends there. It IS a big deal.”
      * Approach 2: “It sounds like moving across the country is going to be a big bother for you. What do you think?” “My kids have a lot of friends locally, but they’ve moved before, they adjust pretty quickly.”
    * When discussing a project you don’t approve of.
      * Approach 1: “I don’t see a way this project is going to work. It’s going to be a waste of time and money.” “You’re missing the potential for a big success.”
      * Approach 2: “The downside of shutting this down right now is we’ll lose a chance at a big success. What do you think?” “I agree, but the chances of that success are pretty low, so we’ll try to reduce the risk.”)



### Examples

  * A salesperson was scheduled to pitch to his customer, but he lost his voice. He wrote it down on a piece of paper. The president of the customer's company volunteered to talk for the salesperson, praising their work and taking on the salesperson’s position.
  * A mother had a child who repeatedly disobeyed her instructions on chores and when she could see friends. The mother typically only lectured, and the child would leave in a huff. One time, the mother asked why the child behaved that way and listened. The child confided her troubles, and the mother became more of a confidante than a lecturer.
