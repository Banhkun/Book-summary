## Arguments 10: Appeal to the Best Self

### Principles

  * All people think of themselves as fine and unselfish. They think of themselves as saviors, martyrs, missionaries. They are generally honest and want to honor their obligations. If they are not, they generally have a good reason for it.
  * A person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good, and a real one. (quote from JP Morgan)
    * You do not need to articulate the real one. You don’t need to back someone into a corner and make them admit they are doing things for selfish reasons.
    * **Instead, emphasize the nobler motives.** Let the person save face by acting for the better motive.
  * Take the high road. Rise above the squabble and appeal to the grander mission. If the other person returns to the squabble, she’ll look small.



### Tactics

  * Appeal to their highest moral principles. 
    * To an angry customer: “I’m impressed by your fairness and your patience, given the horrid treatment you suffered through. And now I ask for your fairness as we consider our next action.”
  * When someone is breaking a prior agreement, say that you see them as a person of high integrity, and that you’re confident they’ll live up to their word.
  * Talk about situations most people can relate to. Humanize yourself and have them relate to your situation (as a parent, as someone with too much on their plate, as someone who’s afraid of growing old, etc.)
  * **If you can’t pay someone enough, offer to contribute pay to their favorite charity.** Thus, their total payment (the emotional reward) is far beyond the cash amount.



### Examples

  * A tenant wanted to break a lease early. Instead of reminding him of the legal consequences, the landlord gave the person a fine reputation to live up to. 
    * “I’ve been a landlord for years, and I’ve come to know people. When I first met you, I saw you as a person of your word. I’m so confident of this that I’m willing to take a risk. Think it over. If you still want to break your lease, I’ll accept it as final and learn that I was wrong in my judgment. But I still believe you’re a man of your word and will do the honorable thing.”
  * A customer was upset about a bill and refused to pay. The collector explained that the company had failed to service the customer, and the collector was there only to listen and not offer an opinion. After the customer finished his story, the collector said, “We clearly mishandled this situation. That shouldn’t have happened. You were very fair and patient. So now I’ll ask you to do something special that no one else can do. I will ask you to adjust your bill, as though you were president of the company. We are going to accept your judgment no matter what you do.” The customer paid the full bill.
  * When a celebrity wanted a picture to stop from being published, he didn’t say, “Don’t print this. I don’t like this picture.” He said, “My mother doesn’t like it.” All people have a mother they want to keep happy, and they understood.
  * Rockefeller wanted to stop photographers from taking photos of their kids. “You know how it is. You’ve got children yourselves. You know it’s not good for youngsters to get too much publicity.”
  * (Shortform example: When the iPhone 4 had issues with call reception when part of the antenna was covered, people wanted Apple to kowtow. Instead, Steve Jobs said, “We’re not perfect. **Phones aren’t perfect. We want to make all our users happy.** Let’s start with the data about what problems there are and what we’re going to do about it.” “It’s been 22 days since we launched. We’ve been working our butts off to figure out what the problem was.” He then showed how other phones would also show similar antenna problems when gripped at specific places.)
