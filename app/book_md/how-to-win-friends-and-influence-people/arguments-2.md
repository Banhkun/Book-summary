## Arguments 2: Have a Friendly Approach

### Principles

  * **Don’t go in guns blazing. A hostile attitude just invites reciprocal hostility.** People don’t want to change their minds. They can’t be forced to agree with you. But they may be led to.
  * Acknowledge the merits of the other side, and the humility of your approach.
    * “Let’s sit down and take counsel together, understanding why it is that we differ, and what the points at issue are.”
    * Convince the person that you are her sincere friend.
  * Think about how to make an animal come to you. Do you chase after it, snarling? Or do you offer food?
  * “A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.”



### Tactics

  * When you feel you have the superiority to command someone, instead approach as though the person were _permitting_ you to give feedback. 
  * When asking for something, don’t complain about how unreasonable the situation is. Talk about what you appreciate so much and how the current situation will prevent you from enjoying the appreciation further.
  * When complaining to a company, start by offering that you really enjoyed the service. Then that you’re explaining a problem to make the manager aware of a situation that might tarnish their reputation.
  * When hearing a complaint, say that you are not there to change their mind. The company makes mistakes. You are there only to learn about their situation.



### Examples

  * Rockefeller had to deal with strikers who hated him. He started by spending weeks with the strikers and their families. Then he gave a speech that glowed with friendliness: 
    * “**This is a red-letter day in my life.** It is the first time I have ever had the good fortune to meet the representatives of the employees of this great company...**I am proud to be here** , and I shall remember this gathering as long as I live. Had this meeting been held two weeks ago, I should have stood here a stranger to most of you, recognizing a few faces. Having had the opportunity last week of visiting all the camps in the southern coalfield and of talking individually with practically all of the representatives; **having visited in your homes** , met many of your wives and children, **we meet here not as strangers, but as friends** , and it is in that spirit of mutual friendship that I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss with you our common interests...**It is only by your courtesy that I am here**.”
  * The president of a motor company was friendly to strikers - publishing an ad complimenting the strikers on their peacefulness. He bought them baseball bats and gloves and invited them to play on lots. This begot friendliness - the strikers in turn cleaned up the factory of their own will.
  * Someone had a tough landlord who increased his rent. Instead of complaining about how this was unfair, he talked about how much he appreciated the house and the way the landlord ran the building, and how he would like to stay another year but couldn’t afford it.
