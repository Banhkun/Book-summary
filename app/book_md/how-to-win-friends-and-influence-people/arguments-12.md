## Arguments 12: Issue a Challenge

### Principles

  * **When motivation doesn’t work, organize a competition.** This gets people going because they don’t want to be second to anyone else (lest they lose self-importance). This is what makes pie-eating contests and sports enjoyable.
  * Furthermore, the desire for mastery and to excel is a fundamental driver of behavior. People love the game, the chance for self-expression, the chance to prove their worth.
  * “All men have fears, but the brave put down their fears and go forward, sometimes to death, but always to victory.” - King’s Guard in ancient Greece.



### Tactics

  * If a person is unsure, subtly question their strength or resolve. “I don’t blame you for being scared. It’s a tough spot. It’ll take a big person to take the job.”
  * Show a public scoreboard around the metrics you care about.
  * (Shortform note: a suggestion for managers is to imagine a hypothetical big scary competitor that is about to destroy your company. How would they attack you? What makes their product ingenious? This gives ideas on what to do yourselves)



### Examples

  * Charles Schwab was having trouble with an underperforming mill that didn’t respond to the manager’s motivation. He asked for a piece of chalk, turned to a worker, and asked how many heats the shift finished. He wrote a big 6 on the floor. The night shift came by and asked what the 6 was about. By morning, the 6 had been rubbed out and replaced with a 7.
  * Carnegie himself uses this in the book to convince the reader to accept his advice. “If you’re completely satisfied with your current position, why change? If you’re not satisfied, why not try what I’m saying?”
