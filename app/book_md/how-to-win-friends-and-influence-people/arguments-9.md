## Arguments 9: Let Them Own Your Idea

### Principles

  * **People like their own ideas better than other people’s.** Coming up with their own ideas makes them feel smart and important. Executing their own ideas, instead of someone else’s, gives them agency.
    * Isn’t it a bad idea, then, to ram your ideas down someone else’s throat? **Isn’t it better to let people think through to your conclusion?**
  * Let people take credit for your ideas. If you truly care about the **outcomes** , and not credit, then you will be fine with other people executing your ideas.
  * Chinese philosopher Lao Tze: “Rivers receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams by staying below them. Thus they are able to reign over all mountain streams. So a wise man who wants to be above men would put himself below them. Thus, even though he is above men, they don’t feel his weight.”



### Tactics

  * Give people a framework for making a decision, then let them do the work to come to their own conclusion.
    * Example: When selling products, give a worksheet for customers to compare features and pricing. As they fill it out, they may naturally conclude that your product is better.
    * Give them previous customers to call about their experiences.
  * If pitching your ideas/projects doesn’t work, ask the customer what they would like to see. Say you know the product is not perfect and can benefit from their advice.
  * Ask your employees for ideas on how to solve a hairy problem.
  * Ask your employees: “What are the qualities you expect from me? Now, what are the qualities that I have a right to expect from you?”
  * Ask about the pros and cons of what you are trying to sell. A person volunteering why they like a product may end up liking it much more.
  * Plant an idea in the person’s mind without a strong suggestion for action. It may work its way independently.
  * Give references to your target customer to talk to. Through their conversations, she will come to her own conclusions.



### Examples

  * A designer sent hundreds of sketches for textiles to a manufacturer, having all of them rejected over years. He changed his approach - he sent unfinished sketches to the buyer, asking for a favor to propose changes that would turn into usable designs. The manufacturer obliged, and ultimately accepted the designer’s new designs.
  * A medical equipment manufacturer wanted to sell a hospital its equipment. Instead of sending sales reps, they sent a sample unit to the doctor in charge, with a letter requesting the doctor contribute his expertise to improve the imperfect design. This made the doctor feel important. He studied the machine, discovering that he liked a lot about it, and. He had come to his own conclusion, instead of having it pressed on him by a salesperson.
