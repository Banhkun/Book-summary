## Arguments 1: Avoid a Heated Argument

### Principles

  * What use is telling someone she’s wrong if she didn’t invite your opinion? Is that going to make her like you? Why not let her save face?
  * **Telling someone that she’s wrong will make her feel inferior and hurt her pride.** She will resent your triumph, no matter how factually correct you are.
  * Poetic ways to put it:
    * “Here lies the body of William Jay, who died maintaining his right of way - He was right, dead right, as he sped along. But he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.”
    * Ben Franklin’s friend: “You are impossible...your friends find they enjoy themselves better when you are not around. You know so much that no man can tell you anything...for the effort would lead only to discomfort and hard work. So you are not likely ever to know any more than you do now, which is very little.”



### Tactics

  * Distrust your first instinctive impression. Be calm and watch out for your angry first reaction. **Control your temper.** You can measure the size of a person by what makes her angry.
  * If someone keeps going on about something you believe is wrong but you want to move on, simply agree and they will run out of steam.
  * Thank your opponents sincerely for their interest. Anyone who takes time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are. Think of them as people who really want to help you.
  * Welcome the disagreement. Be thankful for a point that is brought to your attention, as it’s an opportunity to preempt a mistake.
    * “When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.”
  * Promise to think over your opponents’ ideas and study them carefully.
  * Postpone action to give both sides time to think through the problem.



### Examples

  * A tax consultant was audited and felt the tax inspector had made a mistake. They were at a stalemate until the consultant admitted, “I’ve just had my training in theory and books. You have real experience in taxes. If I had your job, I would learn a lot.” The inspector then talked for a long time about his work, and eventually cleared the consultant’s case.
