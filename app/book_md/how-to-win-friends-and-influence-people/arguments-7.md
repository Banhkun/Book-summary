## Arguments 7: Sympathize with the Other Person

### Principles

  * **Any upset person feels completely justified in their anger, no matter what _you_ believe. **Few people are in the state of mind to think, “I know I’m being irrational, and my anger doesn’t make sense, but I’m going to be angry anyway.” 
    * Instead, they have built it up in their mind beyond what you have assumed: “this company is a soulsucking leach and I’ve been taken advantage of. We’ve all been taken advantage of.”
  * **The majority of people are hungering for sympathy.** Being pitied makes someone feel important, since other people are paying attention to them. Give it to them, and they will love you.
  * Begin with:**“I don’t blame you at all for feeling what you’ve felt. If I were in your shoes, I’d definitely feel the same way.”**



### Tactics

  * Find the reason that they are upset, and articulate it. Hearing their discontent verbalized by you makes them feel heard. In the best case, they can even start imagining the reasons they should feel differently.
    * “Let me make sure I understand what you’re saying. What I’m hearing is ___.”
  * Even as they apologize for losing their temper, don’t lose the perspective. Keep insisting that you are the one to apologize for the original error.
  * Resist one-upping anyone else’s tails of misfortune with your own. It makes them feel completely unimportant and their troubles are trivialized.



### Examples

  * A hotel elevator broke down, and the repairman cited 8 hours shutdown. The hotel refused, saying they didn’t want more than 2 hours of shutdown. The repairman could say:
    * Bad Approach: “I’m not sure what to tell you. There’s no possible way that I can fix this in 2 hours. Let me go through the repairs I need to explain why it’ll take so long.”
    * Good Approach: “I know you have your reputation to uphold, and an elevator being down for 8 hours is definitely going to look bad to your guests. But imagine that we don’t shut down for 8 hours to put in this fix. The problem will continue getting worse. The cable will continue fraying, and when it fails, it’ll require a fix that will take 3 days to finish. Even worse, an accident might happen and injure your guests. I know this would be even worse for your reputation.”
  * An artist manager had to deal with temperamental divas. One needed sympathy to get him on stage and frequently pretended to feel sick. 
    * Response: “What a pity! Of course you can’t sing. I’ll cancel this engagement at once. It’ll cost you thousands of dollars and your reputation with your fans, but it’s no comparison to preserving your vocal cords.”
