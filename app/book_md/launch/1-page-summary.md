## 1-Page Summary

In _Launch_ , entrepreneur and digital marketing expert Jeff Walker says that **you should prioritize giving value and building customer engagement rather than focusing on sales to launch a product online quickly and successfully.** By following Walker’s product launch strategy, you’ll be able to market and sell a product with little to no start-up costs and build a business that grants you flexibility, autonomy, and immediate profits. Walker’s process hinges on creating a powerful tool: the email list.

Jeff Walker is a leading digital marketing specialist and entrepreneur. Since he first developed his Product Launch Formula in 1996, Walker has been teaching and refining it through the experiences of both his personal and client launches.

In this guide, we’ll explore what sets Walker’s product launch method apart, examine each stage of his formula, and learn how you can apply his strategy to grow your own business.

First, we’ll discuss what a product launch is, how the Internet has changed the marketing game, and how we can adapt to the new landscape for impressive financial results. Next, we’ll dive into the five stages of a product launch, discussing the tools you’ll need and why they work. Lastly, we’ll explore two alternative ways you can launch a product. Along the way, we’ll provide insights into the psychology and logic behind Walker’s strategy, as well as compare his approach with that of other experts.

### The Product Launch in the Online Business World

When starting a business, people often invest great effort into creating a product, put it on the market, and simply _hope_ that others will buy it.**** Walker’s strategy, however, takes a reverse approach. He insists that cultivating interested buyers _before_ releasing the product is the key to a successful launch.

**At its simplest, a product launch is the process of introducing and selling a new product to potential customers.** This product might be something physical, like handcrafted pottery, or something informational, like online baking courses.

**According to Walker, the Internet has both advantages and challenges when it comes to launching a product**. On one hand, it allows you to reach people across the world within minutes and at little to no cost, creating a low barrier to starting your business and more opportunities to take advantage of. On the other hand, these attractive qualities lead to greater competition, which can make it harder to stand out. Additionally, online review platforms and customer ratings provide more transparency, dissipating the “smoke and mirrors” of clever sales talk. Because of these unique advantages and challenges, Walker insists that, to achieve success through Internet marketing, you must depart from traditional marketing approaches and embrace a launch strategy focused on customer engagement.

(Shortform note: In _All Marketers Are Liars_ , Seth Godin echoes Walker’s approach of focusing on your customer first before thinking of how to sell your product. He explains that older tactics focused on lowering production costs to increase profits. However, in the Internet marketplace, hoping your product sells just because it meets your market’s needs no longer works because there are so many competitive options available. To appeal to potential customers, Godin suggests you market your product by telling a powerful story. You can do this by appealing to their values and emotions.)

### Three Keys to a Successful Launch

To stand out in this digital marketing arena, Walker suggests you **take advantage of mental triggers—brain shortcuts that influence people to do certain things—in your product launch.** These triggers support three key factors of a successful launch: value, relationships, and desire. By integrating all three, you can ensure that your launch will gain traction and responsiveness.

> **Heuristics: Mental Shortcuts Can Help Market Your Product**
> 
> What Walker refers to as “mental triggers,” psychologists call heuristics. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that help us navigate the world and make decisions quickly and efficiently. While consumer demands and marketing techniques are constantly changing, these mental habits remain effective because they are grounded in human psychology. Here are some to keep in mind when following Walker’s launch approach:
> 
> **Availability** —We tend to make decisions based on the first information or visuals that come to mind when we think of something. By planting a good image of your product in your customer’s minds, you’re increasing the “value” factor of your product launch. For example, if you’re teaching gardening classes, you want your customer to picture their backyard transformed into a beautiful garden whenever they come across your marketing.
> 
> **Representativeness** —This heuristic explains our tendency to judge things based on a mental stereotype we already have. For example, when you imagine a gardener, you might picture an older woman living an unhurried life, despite this representing only one of many types of people who enjoy gardening. When trying to build value and desire during your launch process (we’ll discuss this process shortly), try thinking of what other images or values you want your product to be associated with, and how you’ll subvert your prospective customers’ stereotype.
> 
> **Loss Aversion** —This heuristic explains that people are motivated more by the fear of losing things than the hope of gaining things. Once someone owns something, they naturally value it more simply because it’s theirs. How could this apply to your product launch? When you give out free samples, customers will appreciate you and your product more because they own it. And once they own it, they likely won’t want to lose it, meaning you’ve potentially earned a lifelong customer.

#### Build Value

**When you give value _before_ mentioning sales, people will be more eager to purchase your product down the line. **Many entrepreneurs fixate on the selling aspect when starting up a new product or business. Walker argues that this approach makes it hard to stand out in digital marketing, with thousands of voices hawking products online. Instead, he writes that **when you focus on value first, the sales will come naturally.**

How does this work? When you provide value free of charge, you’re establishing trust and authoritativeness. Even just by giving quality information—a tip or trick—you’re giving people a taste of what your product or service will be, as well as your expertise. When you’re generous with free content, people will appreciate you and feel more inclined to reciprocate by buying your product.

(Shortform note: Walker says you should provide value to your prospects, but what makes something valuable? Experts have created a four-tiered pyramid illustrating how customers value products and services. From bottom to top, people value things that fulfill practical, emotional, transformational, and philanthropic needs. Experts argue that your product can’t satisfy the higher tiers (like personal transformation or making a social impact) without meeting some basic needs (like reducing effort or saving time). When following Walker’s launch strategy, consider what kinds of needs you want to address to ensure you’re offering something that your customers value.)

#### Build Relationships

Walker writes that**to launch a product successfully, you must forge strong relationships with your buyers and potential customers**.**** When you do this, you’ll be more _memorable_ than just _loud_ and stand out from your competitors. One way to build these relationships is to**** pace your launch over the course of several days or even weeks. Instead of a single impression, you can have more sustained and regular interactions.

Additionally, a spaced-out launch creates room for conversations to flow and communities to form. When you build a community around your product, you form not only robust relationships with your customers, but also connections between your buyers themselves, which generates more momentum in your launch. Walker says this works because of social proof—when people base their actions off of other people’s opinions or experiences, such as deciding on a restaurant because of good reviews. When people hear others expressing their eagerness to buy your product, they tend to be more willing to do so themselves.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree with Walker’s emphasis on building customer relationships, adding that developing a sense of community helps retain customers more than loyalty programs do. When you create a community for customers to interact with like-minded people, you’re creating positive experiences. This is crucial as, according to research, you need 40 positive customer experiences to make up for a single negative review. Therefore, by following Walker’s recommendations to market your product by building relationships, you can foster loyalty for long-term business growth.)

#### Build Desire

To get people to purchase your product, you need to convince them that they _want_ it. To accomplish this, **Walker suggests you** **treat your product launch like a major event to stir up anticipation and build desire.** Just like an advent calendar to Christmas, turn your product launch into a countdown that generates excitement that will unleash on your launch day. Walker reasons that **this approach activates people’s natural desire to be a part of something bigger.**

(Shortform note: Walker’s strategy of turning a product launch into an event is grounded in psychology. Experts explain that our instinct to anticipate events developed for evolutionary reasons and continues to serve our mental health and well-being. When we look forward to an event, our anticipation serves as a form of emotion regulation and releases dopamine, a neurotransmitter that increases positive feelings and decreases negative ones. When customers feel good while waiting for your product to release, they’re more likely to want to purchase your product because their brains associate it with positive feelings.)

**Just like an event, however, your launch must have an endpoint.** By having a definite window, you create an urgency to buy your product. When things are limited, people feel more hastened to make a decision.

(Shortform note: When you set an end date for your launch, you’re taking advantage of FOMO, or the fear of missing out on something good. Psychologically, this fear comes from our basic need to belong, and experts say that 60% of people make purchases due to FOMO. You can take Walker’s scarcity tactic a step further by adding a countdown timer to your launch. By including a countdown clock in their email, one company's Black Friday campaign achieved a 400% increase in conversions.)

**To make your launch an event, approach your product launch in five stages:** 1) Create an email list, 2) gauge the interest of prospective customers, 3) build anticipation, 4) open for sales, and 5) follow up with buyers and non-buyers.

### Stage 1: Create an Email List

**Whether you’re starting with a vague business idea or a fully-developed product, Walker says that creating and growing an email list is the first step to a successful launch.** The Internet enables you to access a wider pool of potential customers, and encouraging people to subscribe to your content helps you stay connected and form lasting business relations.

(Shortform note: Research corroborates Walker’s recommendation to use email as a primary way to contact your customers. According to a 2023 study, email remains the main form of business communication, reporting that over 333 billion emails are sent every day. While newer online platforms, such as Tiktok or Discord are attracting the attention of marketers, experts predict that email usage will continue to grow in the coming years.)

#### Start Your List

Before you even mention your product, attract followers who are interested in receiving regular emails from you. To start building an email list, Walker suggests you:

1) **Develop your promise.** In other words, figure out the core reason people should subscribe to your list. To do this, consider something free and valuable that you can offer through email. For example, if your (current or future) business promise is to improve mental health and wellness, you might deliver on this promise through weekly newsletters with self-care tips and positive quotes.

(Shortform note: When developing your promise, Al Ries and Jack Trout in _Positioning_ recommend you over-simplify your message. They explain that people’s brains can only retain a few ideas at a time, so having a clear and straightforward message helps you catch people’s attention.)

2) **Identify your target market.** Walker suggests looking for a specific group of people whose needs or wants could be met by your product. Examine the demographics to get a better sense of how to market to them. For instance, think about what particular age range you want to appeal to the most.

(Shortform note: In _The 4 Hour Work Week_ , Tim Ferriss says you shouldn’t limit your search to people who currently fit in your market. Also consider people who want to fit into your product demographic. For example, if you’re producing pet-related content, don’t restrict yourself to pet owners—consider people who might be interested in getting a pet.)

3) **Create a “squeeze page”—a landing page on your website that gives visitors the choice to either subscribe to the email list or leave.** Walker states that, even if a majority of people leave without signing up, having a small group of responsive followers you can keep in contact with is better than having many contacts who rarely open your emails.

(Shortform note: To create an effective squeeze page, experts recommend you develop a digital resource—such as a behind-the-scenes video, a discount code, or a newsletter—and showcase it visually with a photo or a video. Keep it concise and relevant, and consider adding testimonials that enhance your authority.)

4) **Encourage people to subscribe with an enticing offer.** Give people an immediate incentive to sign up. This should be something free and specific, such as an exclusive worksheet on anxiety.

(Shortform note: Offering an incentive to subscribe encourages people because of instant gratification—we tend to want positive rewards now rather than to wait for satisfaction. For example, you might have gorged on the free bread offered at restaurants, only to find yourself too full to eat your meal. Similarly, your small, free incentive is like a restaurant’s free bread. While you’re eager to bring your product to the table, an immediate incentive will attract a lot more engagement early on.)

#### Grow Your List

Now that we understand how to acquire a list, how can we grow it? In other words, how do we get more people to see our squeeze page? Walker suggests three methods of promoting traffic to your page: organic traffic, social media, and paid advertising.

**1) Organic Traffic** —Drive traffic to your page by getting your website to appear higher up in the search engine’s results. This increases the likelihood that people will come across your page.

(Shortform note: But how do you get to the top of Google’s search results? The process is called search engine optimization (SEO), which involves improving your site’s ranking through various techniques such as putting keywords in your title tag or improving the speed at which your site loads. Learning to apply good SEO practices is important to getting natural traffic, since only 0.63% of Google users click on a result beyond the first page.)

**2) Social Media** —Use social media as a tool to draw attention and direct people to your email list. By social media, Walker’s referring to platforms that allow people to connect, follow, and share content like Facebook. He explains that there are advantages and disadvantages to using social media for your product launch:

**Advantages** : Social media platforms make it easy for people with similar interests and desires to gather together. This, in turn, makes it easier for you to discover and interact with these communities.

**Disadvantages** : Unlike email, Walker argues that social media platforms lack stability and risk falling into disuse. He adds that since you don’t own the platform, your accounts can get shut down for arbitrary reasons. Ultimately, Walker suggests using social media to channel people to your email list and to spread awareness of your product but cautions against relying on it solely to market your product.

(Shortform note: Research supports Walker’s caution against only using social media to market your product, finding that social channels result in significantly lower conversion rates than email. However, you can use social media to _aid_ your launch. Experts recommend you use hashtags to make it easy for people to get involved and suggest you decide on a single one that is unique, memorable, and clear.)

**3) Paid Advertising** —Use paid advertising to drive more people to your landing page and email list. In digital marketing, this involves spending money to display your promotions on relevant platforms so that more people can discover your brand, such as Google Ads. Walker says you should approach paid advertising differently depending on who you’re targeting: those already familiar with you (warm traffic) versus those unfamiliar with you (cold traffic).

For cold traffic, use paid ads to convert them into warm traffic by guiding them to your opt-in page. For warm traffic, focus your paid advertising later on in your launch process to encourage your prospects to purchase your product.

> **Ad Blockers and Banner Blindness**
> 
> Walker suggests using paid ads to promote your launch, but how can you be sure that your ads are effective? According to a 2022 study, 42.7% of people worldwide use ad blockers. These tools remove ad content from web browsers, which can pose a problem when you’re trying to get paid traffic for your launch. Many people state, however, that they are fine with ads as long as they aren’t annoying or disruptive.
> 
> Yet, another problem remains—when people aren’t blocking ads, they’re ignoring them. With advertisements populating practically every corner of the Internet, many users experience “banner blindness,” which means that people subconsciously ignore parts of a page that seem like they could be ads based on factors such as location and appearance. To avoid this, experts suggest creating visually-unique designs, having a clear and attractive message, or adding interactive features.

### Stage 2: Gauge Interest

Once you’ve accumulated an email list, start bringing your product to the attention of your email subscribers. **In this step, gauge whether you’ve got a successful product worth launching by soliciting engagement from your followers.** For instance, if you’re planning to sell a 30-day yoga challenge, it’s time to start alerting your list about it.

**Send a simple email to your followers telling them about the product you’re planning to launch.** Walker suggests directly asking for feedback and questions through a survey with questions like: “What is the biggest thing you want to get out of a yoga challenge?” Take note of their receptivity to your offer, as well as any objections. By asking your prospective customers what they’re looking for, you can modify your product to meet their needs and increase their interest in buying. You’re re-engaging your loyal followers and kindling relationships with new ones.

(Shortform note: In addition to surveying your prospective customers online, Rob Fitzpatrick in _The Mom Test_ advises you to seek out informal conversations with potential customers at locations they might frequent to gauge their receptivity to your product. For example, visit a park if your product’s related to health and wellness. Then, decide on three things you want to learn from your customers so you can ask direct and specific questions.)

Just like a sneak peek of a movie “coming to theaters,” announcing a product that’s not yet available sets off that first spark of anticipation. However, Walker advises you not to mention anything about sales at this stage. You might think of it like fishing—you wouldn’t want to start reeling in the line before the fish has approached the bait.

Afterwards, write another email thanking people for their input and providing a progress update. Maintaining steady communication with your list ensures you’re more frequently at the front of their minds.

(Shortform note: Walker suggests having frequent communication with your subscribers, but how much is too much? In a 2015 study about how marketers could improve their email approach, 43.9% of respondents wished businesses emailed less frequently. To avoid this, provide high-value content as Walker advocates and personalize your emails to make them more appealing to your subscribers.)

### Stage 3: Build Anticipation

After you’ve introduced your followers to your offer, **send three pieces of marketing content to your email list to build anticipation for your product and convince them to buy.**

Walker explains that this approach is more effective than emailing a traditional sales letter to your list (which is usually a single piece of persuasive content) because **people are drawn to sequences and stories.** By releasing a series of content, you’re communicating with your target audience _more_ than with a single letter, generating excitement and a narrative that keeps your audience engaged.

Walker suggests you space these marketing pieces over the course of five to twelve days. The content format doesn’t matter—it could be an email, podcast, video, or even livestream broadcasts—so long as it’s high-quality.

(Shortform note: There’s ample psychological reasoning behind Walker’s claim that a series of messages work better than a single one. According to experts, sequences help us determine what to pay attention to. People are flooded with so much information daily that it’s hard to figure out what we should pay attention to and what we should ignore. The more people see something, the more they pay attention to it. When you divide your marketing content into three sequential pieces as Walker advises, you’re increasing the chances that people notice your product.)

#### Offer Value With Three Content Pieces

In your three marketing pieces, Walker recommends you **give your target market the answers to three questions:_Why_ they should buy your product, _what_ your product is, and _how_ it will benefit them.**

**Piece #1: The Reason** —“Why”

In your first piece, capture your follower’s attention and give them a reason to care about your product.

The first “Why” question you need to answer is **“Why __ should I care?” **Walker suggests promoting your product as an opportunity for change or betterment. For example, if your product is a series of virtual tutorials on how to longboard dance, focus on how your tips and tricks will _transform_ people into stylish skaters within a short period of time.

(Shortform note: In _The Personal MBA_ , Josh Kaufman agrees with Walker’s claim that people are interested in products that provide change or growth. However, he adds that there are four additional needs people try to meet when making purchases: to feel safe, minimize effort, connect with others, and feel good about themselves. To show why customers should care about your product, consider being more specific by highlighting these other needs. For example, your longboard lessons could satisfy someone’s need for social belonging and improve self-esteem.)

The second “Why” question is**“Why should I listen to you?”** As Walker points out, people tend to listen to those with authority—people are more likely to sign up for a workshop run by an experienced professional rather than a beginner. With the longboarding example, you’d want to share how you’d been skating for over 15 years and how you’d won several longboard dancing competitions.

(Shortform note: When showcasing your authority to potential customers, be careful not to distance yourself from them too much in status, so that they find it hard to relate to you. To increase relatability, experts suggest you lean into emotion and tell a narrative—share your flaws and the challenges you've overcome, especially those that your audience may be facing. When your prospects feel like you share their experiences, they’re more likely to listen to you and think that your product is relevant to them.)

Walker recommends you not only reveal your new product, but also share part of the content for free. To continue the example, you could provide a free tutorial on how to do one longboard dance trick, giving something of value upfront. Finally, hint at what’s coming up (the next content piece) and encourage engagement by asking for feedback and comments.

(Shortform note: When you ask for feedback and comments at the end of your message, you’re making a call to action. In other words, you’re specifying an action you want your audience to take. According to Donald Miller in _Building a StoryBrand_ , having a call to action like Walker suggests is crucial because people don’t usually act without being prompted to. By asking for feedback, you’re encouraging readers to do more than passively glance at your message, but to get actively involved in your product launch process.)

**Piece #2: The Product** —“What”

For your second content piece, Walker says you should **focus on giving your prospects an idea of _what_ they will learn or achieve if they purchase your product.** To do this, summarize what you’re offering, address any concerns, and finally, offer another piece of your product for free (such as a more in-depth tutorial of another longboard trick). Lastly, end by hinting at the third piece and ask for more feedback.

(Shortform note: Research supports Walker’s tactic of offering a free sample, finding that 65% of customers who try free samples purchase the product. By providing something free and of value, you lower the risk that a customer faces when purchasing a new product. This reassurance can convert hesitant prospects into buyers.)

**Piece #3: The Benefit** —“How”

In this final piece, Walker advises you to showcase**_how_ people can experience the benefits for themselves and visualize their own transformation**. Try to draw a link between your prospect’s goals and your offer. He suggests offering a case study to convince people that the product will work for _them_. For example, you could spotlight before-and-after videos of a beginner longboarder you’d taught before. Then, answer any major questions you’ve received from your feedback requests.

After that, transition into discussing your offer and the logistics of how your followers can finally attain your product (and its benefits) for themselves.

(Shortform note: Experts agree with Walker’s approach of helping people feel like your product will work for them personally. They encourage you to cultivate psychological ownership, which allows customers to feel like the product is an extension of their identity. They offer three suggestions on how you can do this: increase customer control by involving them in the process, make your product customizable, and make your product feel exclusive.)

### Stage 4: Open to Sales

In this third stage of the launch process, you can open your product to the market. By this point, Walker notes that most of the work is already done. All that’s left to do before you start taking orders is to**create a sales page on your website with a video or letter summarizing your offer, while emphasizing how buyers will benefit from it.**

Then, send a short email with a link to your sales page announcing that your product is available for purchase. For better results, communicate regularly with your followers. Send an email each day of your launch giving updates, expressing gratitude, and answering questions.

Again, Walker stresses that **you should have a definitive end to your launch to capitalize on people’s sense of scarcity.** Consider having the price increase, a special bonus go away, or the offer end completely. Near the end, Walker advises you to send out emails reminding people of your cart’s closing time as many people are natural procrastinators.

(Shortform note: What happens if people add your product to their cart, but don’t make the purchase? Experts offer tips on how to remind your customers to purchase a product they had previously added to a cart by crafting a cart recovery email. In your email, display your customer’s cart and give a link returning them to their cart so that they don’t have to re-enter their information. Also, include a call to action, such as a “Return to Cart'' button.)

### Stage 5: Follow Up

After your launch,**continue nurturing your relationship with buyers (and non-buyers) to grow your business long-term.** Walker notes that people often feel underwhelmed after purchasing a product. To address this, continue to communicate and deliver more than what they had expected. Strengthen connections by writing an email expressing your thanks, summarizing your launch results, and asking for feedback.

(Shortform note: Other experts agree with Walker’s emphasis on maintaining quality relationships after the launch, adding that when customers are disappointed in a product, they’re experiencing post-purchase dissonance. There are several different causes: a lack of product information, a low product quality, or an impulsive purchase. To avoid customer dissatisfaction in your product launch, give detailed product information and consider offering a return policy.)

Walker suggests you **follow up with and send bonus content to both people who had purchased your product and those who hadn’t**. For the buyers, giving a bonus gift conveys your gratitude for their support, and asking for feedback fortifies your connection. For the non-buyers, giving them more content and asking for feedback offers you insights as to how to win them over for future launches.

(Shortform note: Consider applying Walker’s suggestion of generous gifting long after your launch is over. For example, Chewy, an e-commerce pet supply company, regularly nurtures customer relationships by sending handwritten notes and painted pet portraits as surprise gifts, which make customers feel appreciated. The company’s value-driven approach resulted in its great success and eventual acquisition by a leading pet supply company, showing that small tokens of appreciation to your customers go a long way in building a lasting business.)

### Variations of the Product Launch

Now that you’ve learned the basic framework of Walker’s launch strategy, we can explore two variations you can consider: launching without a product and launching with a partner company.

#### Launching Without a Product

What if you don’t have a product to launch? Walker says you can create a business from scratch with his product launch strategy.**With nothing more than an idea, you can gauge interest, build anticipation, and make sales by asking for continual feedback at every step.** With this approach, you develop your product as you’re delivering it—it works especially well when you’re offering information or training to others.

For example, if you want to start teaching people how to train their cat to do tricks, you can follow the basic formula for a product launch:

Gather a list of prospects. Walker reassures that small lists work fine—in fact, they’re often more responsive. In your three content pieces, present your offer as though you had the full product developed, emphasizing the benefits your buyers will gain. Once you’ve opened your initial product to the market and made some sales, you can send surveys asking what your buyers are looking for. For instance, ask about which tricks they are most interested in teaching their cats. Equipped with their input, you can then create the next iteration of your product (in this example, your upcoming course). Then, you repeat the process, asking for feedback before developing the next.

> **Customer Feedback Loop: How to Implement Feedback**
> 
> Walker’s approach of asking for customer feedback and using it to develop the next stage of your product is similar to a customer feedback loop, a customer experience strategy used to improve your product through continuous communication. Experts explain that feedback is vital to satisfaction and loyalty. Instead of _improving_ a product, you can apply the four stages of this loop to get useful feedback to _develop_ a product:
> 
>   * **Collect** —While Walker suggests sending a survey to your buyers through email, you can gather customer feedback in a variety of other ways, such as text message, which can be especially useful for direct questions. When launching without a product, consider interviewing some of your buyers.
> 
>   * **Analyze** —To analyze feedback, experts suggest you separate your feedback (which may vary from comments and suggestions to concerns and questions) into categories based on the type of customer (such as those more familiar with you and your product versus those less familiar). This approach allows you to notice patterns and get a better sense of what’s important to your buyers, which will help you develop your product.
> 
>   * **Implement** —After analyzing feedback, apply it to your product to make sure your customers feel heard and that you’re providing the value that they’re expecting.
> 
>   * **Follow-up** —Like launching without a product, the customer feedback loop is cyclical and continuous. Following up after receiving and implementing feedback keeps your customers involved in the process.
> 
> 


#### Launching With Partners

**Take your launch to the next level by doing a partner launch**. In this approach, Walker suggests teaming up with one or multiple companies to promote your product to _their_ subscribers. By having access to other email lists, you can quickly grow your own.

In the stage leading up to your launch, have your partners send emails telling their followers about your offer and directing them to your squeeze page. That way, new people join your list at the same time you’re delivering your three pieces promoting your product. In exchange for the increased exposure, your partner receives a portion of your sales.

(Shortform note: While Chris Guillebeau, author of _The $100 Startup_ , agrees with Walker that working with affiliate companies is a powerful tool for growing your business, he cautions you to make sure you offer a decent commission to your partner companies. If you provide only a small rate, your partners may not put much effort into promoting your product.)

Walker offers these steps for finding a partner for your launch:

**Step #1:** Search online for keywords of what your target market might be looking for, for example, “learn cybersecurity.” The search results will show some companies offering that service.

**Step #2:** Browse the results for relevant companies in your field that serve your market’s goal and join their email lists—Walker recommends subscribing to around 50.

**Step #3:** Read their emails as they come in and see if they promote other businesses. Then, narrow down to three to five best options. To start reaching out to potential partners, Walker says you’ll need to create value to stand out. You can do this by: advertising one of their products, offering positive feedback for one of their products, or engaging with them on social media.

Walker says that **you should focus on building a lasting relationship with your partners.** When your partners promote your offer, they’re taking a risk. Before you involve them in your product launch, Walker suggests you run one with your own list first to make sure your product is successful. When you get good launch results, your partners will be more inclined to continue working with you.

> **Product Launching With Influencers**
> 
> Walker writes that working with other companies is an effective way to gain exposure and grow your list of followers. In a similar vein, Ryan Holiday in _Perennial Seller_ suggests you partner with influencers on social media to gain new customers for your launch. An influencer is someone in your niche with persuasive power and a large following of people in your target audience. This could be anyone from academics to artists to CEOs. In many ways, Holiday’s tactics to attract influencers to your launch are similar to Walker’s:
> 
>   * **Research** —Like Walker, Holiday recommends you find people who have promoted products in the past that are similar to yours. He suggests you reach out through the lens that you’re going to improve their lives. Try to avoid those who might already be overwhelmed with requests.
> 
>   * **Give Value** —As Walker recommends doing with partner companies, Holiday suggests offering influencers something of value. He notes that, since influencers care about how their followers perceive them, you should also consider what _their_ audience finds valuable. You could try: giving free content, creating custom products for the influencer, or making them an unofficial brand ambassador.
> 
>   * **Build a Relationship** —Influencers are often busy and swamped with requests to promote products. To stand out, Holiday’s advice echoes Walker’s: Focus on relationships before transactions. Treat influencers as people and focus on how you can offer value to _them_.
