## Exercise: Document Your Processes

Your business has a few key processes that keep it functioning. Identifying, documenting, and ensuring that everyone follows your key processes consistently makes your business more efficient and scalable.

* * *

Think of a process in your company or department that different people handle differently. What problems have resulted from the inconsistency?

What is a key business process that youâ€™re involved with? Document it by listing the most important steps. Next, list the procedures for each step as bullet points.

Streamline the process by removing any redundant or unnecessary steps. What steps could you take to share and ensure others follow the process?
