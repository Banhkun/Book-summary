## Exercise: What Are Your Key Numbers?

Reviewing a handful of key numbers or vital signs weekly can tell you how your business is doing—for instance, revenue, sales activity, customer complaints, or production output. They give you a chance to avert problems and help you stay on track to meet your goals.

* * *

What numbers do you review regularly to see how your business is performing? How often do you receive and review these numbers?

Who in your organization is accountable for each number? What is each person’s goal?

How can you use the numbers to avert problems or make course corrections?

What is an important goal that isn't represented by the key numbers? What numbers can you monitor to track progress?
