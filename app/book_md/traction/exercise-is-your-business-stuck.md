## Exercise: Is Your Business Stuck?

Many businesses become stuck or fail because their owners can’t let go of control, build a trusted leadership team, delegate, and systematize their business.

* * *

In your business, do you have a leadership team that you trust? What kinds of things do you delegate? How often do you check up on people?

Do you spend more time working _on_ your business (thinking and planning strategically) or working _in_ your business? Why?

Think of a recurring issue in your company. How do you and your people handle it—is there one way or does everyone do things their own way? How could you handle it more systematically?
